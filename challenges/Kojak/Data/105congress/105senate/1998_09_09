Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 45 minutes of debate on the motion to proceed to S. 1873, \nthe American Missile Protection Act of 1998.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the issue we are debating this morning is \nnot new to the Senate. In May of this year, the Senate voted on a \nmotion to invoke cloture so that we could proceed to consider the \nAmerican Missile Protection Act. That motion was not successful. The \nvote was 59 in favor and 41 against. Therefore, we fell one vote short \nof invoking cloture so the Senate could proceed to debate the American \nMissile Protection Act.\n  We have another chance today, Mr. President, to go on record in favor \nof considering this bill. So it should be put in context what we are \nvoting for and what we are not voting for. We are not voting to pass \nthe bill without any debate. That is not the issue. We are voting to \nproceed to consider the bill. Now let us put in context what the facts \nare today as compared with last May when we fell just one vote short of \nvoting to consider this bill.\n  At the time we voted in May, India had just tested--that very day--\nfor the second time, a nuclear weapons device. We were not aware that \nIndia was going to conduct that test. Our intelligence community was \nsurprised. All the world was surprised.\n  We used that example to urge the Senate to change our current policy \non national missile defense, because the current policy is that we will \nmake a decision to deploy a national missile defense system if we learn \nthat some nation has developed the capacity to put us at risk, to \nthreaten the security of American citizens with a ballistic missile \nsystem.\n  So the assumption is that our intelligence community and our \nresources for learning things like this are so sophisticated and so \nreliable that we will be able to detect this, that we will have an \nearly warning, that we will be able to know well in advance of any \nnation having the capability of inflicting damage or destruction on \nAmerica's soil, through a ballistic missile system, in enough time that \nwe could deploy a national missile defense system.\n  Another consideration is that we have not yet developed a national \nmissile defense system. We have various\n\n[[Page S10046]]\n\nprograms that are being tested in various stages of development--\ntheater ballistic missile defense systems--that can defend us against \nregional attacks, shorter-range attacks. But this bill is talking about \na national ballistic missile defense system and whether or not our \npolicy should be to wait and see if other countries develop the \ncapability to put us at risk and then decide--then decide--whether we \nshould work to deploy a system to protect against that kind of threat.\n  What has changed since the vote in May is that not only did Pakistan \nproceed to test a nuclear device--we were not sure they were going to \ndo that--they also had just recently tested a missile system that we \ndid not know they had. We had been told a few months earlier that they \nhad a missile system that was in the 180 mile range. They tested one \nthat had a range of about 900 miles without our knowing they had the \ncapability to do that, without our knowing that they had that missile. \nBut they had acquired either the missile, the component parts, or the \ndesign from other countries or another country--according to press \nreports, North Korea was involved in that--and they were able to \nactually launch that across that distance, and it was a surprise to our \nintelligence community, to our country and to the world.\n  Those events occurred about the time we voted in May. Since then, \nlook what has happened. Iran has tested a longer-range missile than we \nexpected them to have. North Korea has tested and has fired a multiple-\nstage ballistic missile. We had discussed the fact that that was \npossibly under development, the Taepo Dong missile. We are calling it \nthe Taepo Dong I because we are told that there is a Taepo Dong II \nunder development. That has been publicly reported in the press.\n\n  The missile that was tested the other day by North Korea, the \nmultiple-stage missile, was fired over Japan. There was evidence that \nthe missile actually crossed the territory of Japan. Do you realize, \nMr. President--I know Members of the Senate are aware--that we have \nsome 37,000 Americans deployed in South Korea as a part of a defense \nstability effort in that region, and we have more than that in Japan, \nin the Okinawa area?\n  The whole point is that if you consider all of that, we have 80,000 \nAmericans who are at risk now because of the proven capability of North \nKorea and its new advanced missile capability. We have gone to great \nlengths in the last few years to dissuade North Korea from proceeding \nto develop nuclear weapons. We were very concerned that they were \nproceeding to do just that. Some think that they have made substantial \nprogress in doing just that.\n  Incidentally, the Taepo Dong II that I just mentioned has the \ncapacity of striking the territory of the United States. Many troops \nand military assets and resources are located in Alaska. According to \npress reports, the Taepo Dong II would have the capacity to destroy \nthat area, as well as striking Hawaii.\n  Now, the issue is, do we proceed with the wait-and-see policy of this \nadministration, or do we today vote to proceed to consider legislation \nthat will change that policy, that will say as soon as technology \npermits, the United States will deploy a national missile defense \nsystem that will protect it against ballistic missile attack, whether \nunauthorized or accidental or intentional. We have all worried about \naccidental and unauthorized launches from China and Russia. We know \nthose countries have the capability of striking us. But think about \nthis other fact: What else has changed recently?\n  The United States has observed the Russian Government slowly \ndeteriorate to the point that the command and control structure of the \nmilitary is seriously in question. Who really controls the armed forces \nof Russia to the point that you can rely upon the good intentions of \nthe Yeltsin government not to target U.S. sites with their missile \nsystems, their intercontinental ballistic missiles, the most lethal and \naccurate of any other country in the world, with multitudes of \nwarheads, nuclear-tipped warheads? We are sitting here hoping and \nassuming that we can continue to work with Russia and whatever \ngovernment does come out of the struggle for power there to continue to \ndestroy nuclear weapons under Russian control rather than to build them \nup and make them more accurate and lethal.\n  By the way, it is not like they have dismantled the nuclear weapon \nsystems in Russia. They exist. They are lethal. They are capable of \nstriking anywhere in the United States they might decide to strike, and \nwe are glad that they don't have any intention of doing that. But they \nhave the capability of doing that and there could be an unauthorized or \naccidental launch and we have absolutely no defense against that kind \nof attack. We have been operating under the assumption that we can \nassure them we will retaliate--we have the capacity to--and we will \ndestroy any country who attempts to strike us in that way. That has \nbeen the system for defense that we have had.\n  We have had no defense. The defense is that we will destroy you if \nyou attack us in that way. That doesn't work with North Korea or Iran \nor some other rogue states, leaders, and terrorists who have announced \nthat it is their stated goal to kill Americans and to destroy America \nand to build missile systems to do that or to sell missile systems to \nthose who want to do that. North Korea said just that. An official \nstated publicly that they are in the business of selling missile \nsystems. They need the money. That was the explanation. We know that is \ntrue. They have sold missile systems; they have sold component parts. \nRussia has people who are cooperating in Iran right now, and have in \nthe past, to develop systems that could inflict great damage not only \nin that region but beyond.\n  Now, some are saying that we already have authorization and funds in \nthe pipeline to develop these missile systems to protect us--\ninterceptor missiles--and we read about the testing that is going on of \ntheater systems. But we have no program that has as its goal the \ndevelopment and deployment of a missile defense that will protect the \nUnited States against unauthorized, accidental, or intentional \nballistic missile attack.\n  That is what this legislation addresses. It has two parts. The first \nis recitation of all of the facts that we have been able to gather \nthrough hearings over the last 2 years in our Subcommittee on \nInternational Security, Proliferation, and Federal Services. We have \nhad hearings. We have published a report called Proliferation Primer. \nIt has been widely distributed. It documents the fact that throughout \nthe world there is a growing capability for the use of ballistic \nmissiles.\n  We talk about how it is happening and what people are saying who are \nin charge of those countries who are involved in this. It clearly, in \nour view, justified our asking this Congress to legislate a change in \nour policy to carry out now the express recommendations of the Rumsfeld \nCommission, which has, since our vote in May, given its report on the \nstate of affairs regarding the ballistic missile threat to the United \nStates. It was concluded in that report that our intelligence community \ndoes not have the capacity for making the early warning assessment that \nis contemplated under current administration policy.\n  The Director of Central Intelligence has admitted in previous \nstatements to the Senate that there are gaps and uncertainties in the \ninformation that his agency can obtain in making decisions about \nwhether or not countries are developing or have the capacity to deploy \nballistic missile systems that put our Nation at risk. Now that \nassessment and that description of the situation has been borne out by \nthose recent developments.\n  Admiral Jeremiah made a recent study of our intelligence agencies in \nthe wake of some of these events, and he reported a similar problem.\n  Given those facts, Mr. President, it seems clear to me, the \ncosponsors of this legislation, and 59 Senators, that the time has come \nto change the policy from wait and see to proceed as soon as \ntechnologically possible to deploy a national missile defense system to \nprotect the security interests of the United States and its citizens. \nThere is no higher responsibility that this Government has--no higher \nresponsibility, no priority any greater--than the security of U.S. \ncitizens. We are putting that security at risk, Mr. President, under \nthe current policy. It is as clear as anything can be.\n\n[[Page S10047]]\n\n  The time has come today--this morning at 9:45 a.m.--to vote to \nproceed to consider this proposal, which simply calls for the \ndeployment, as soon as technology permits, of a national missile \ndefense system.\n  Mr. President, I urge Senators to vote in support of the motion to \ninvoke cloture.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several articles pertaining to this \nsubject be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 16, 1998]\n\n        Panel Says U.S. Faces Risk of a Surprise Missile Attack\n\n                           (By Eric Schmitt)\n\n       Washington--Rogue nations or terrorists could develop and \n     deploy ballistic missiles for an attack against the United \n     States with ``little or no warning,'' an independent \n     commission announced Wednesday.\n       But senior American intelligence officials disputed the \n     finding, which challenges a longstanding intelligence \n     estimate that no country except Russia and China, which \n     already possess ballistic missiles, could hit American \n     targets, and that North Korea could perhaps field long-range \n     missiles before 2010.\n       The unanimous conclusions of the bipartisan commission, \n     headed by former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, provide \n     fresh ammunition for supporters of a national missile \n     defense, and sharpen an election-year issue that Republicans \n     want to wield against the administration and Democrats in \n     Congress.\n       ``It's a very sobering conclusion,'' said Speaker Newt \n     Gingrich, a strong supporter of national missile defenses, \n     who called on the administration to work with Congress in the \n     next several months to address the heightened threat as \n     described in the report.\n       The United States has spent more than $40 billion since the \n     Reagan administration to build a space- or land-based defense \n     against ballistic missile strikes, but has yet to construct a \n     workable network.\n       Indeed, a report Wednesday by the General Accounting \n     Office, the auditing arm of Congress, concluded that it is \n     unlikely that a program to develop a national missile defense \n     will meet an important deadline in 2000.\n       The commission did not address the merit of any particular \n     defensive system, focusing instead on the ballistic missile \n     threat to the United States.\n       ``The major implication of our conclusions is that warning \n     time is reduced,'' said Rumsfeld, who was defense secretary \n     under President Gerald Ford. ``We see an environment of \n     little or no warning of ballistic missile threats to the U.S. \n     from several emerging powers.''\n       The commission singled out North Korea, Iran and Iraq for \n     scrutiny. For example, the panel's report said, ``We judge \n     that Iran now has the technical capability and resources \n     to demonstrate an ICBM-range ballistic missile'' similar \n     to a North Korean model.\n       But in a letter sent to Congress on Wednesday, George \n     Tenet, the director of Central Intelligence, said the \n     government stood by a threat assessment first made in 1995 \n     and reaffirmed most recently in March.\n       The government assessments, Tenet said in his letter, \n     ``were supported by the available evidence and were well \n     tested'' in an internal review.\n       But the commission, in its 300-page classified report \n     delivered to the House and Senate on Wednesday, as well as in \n     an unclassified 27-page version, said the American \n     intelligence community was wrong in relying on the much-\n     longer warning times.\n       Rumsfeld said rogue nations, such as Iran and Iraq, had \n     obtained sensitive missile technology, in part because of \n     loosened export controls among industrialized nations. \n     ``Foreign assistance is not a wildcard,'' Rumsfeld said. ``It \n     is a fact of our relaxed post-Cold-War world.''\n       Rumsfeld also said that these suspect countries had become \n     more adept at concealing their missile programs, making it \n     more difficult for Western intelligence analysts to gauge a \n     country's progress and intentions.\n       In a hastily called briefing for reporters, senior \n     intelligence officials said Wednesday that the commission had \n     examined the same information available to government \n     analysts, but had come to different conclusions.\n       These intelligence officials said that they tended to focus \n     on specific evidence to reach their conclusions, assigning \n     various degrees of certainty to each assessment.\n       The intelligence officials said the panel, officially \n     titled the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat \n     to the United States, took the same information and, in \n     essence, assumed the worst about what was known for a \n     particular country's missile program, and drew its \n     conclusions.\n       Rumsfeld concurred: ``We came at this subject as senior \n     decision-makers would, who have to make difficult judgments \n     based on limited information.''\n       For that reason, the report, even though it was praised in \n     particular by Republicans, is likely to stoke the debate over \n     ballistic missile threats rather than be viewed as the \n     definitive conclusion.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, July 23, 1998]\n\n                    Iran Tests Medium-Range Missile\n\n                            (By Bill Gertz)\n\n       Iran conducted its first test flight of a new medium-range \n     missile Tuesday night, giving the Islamic republic the \n     capability of hitting Israel and all U.S. forces in the \n     region with chemical or biological warheads, The Washington \n     Times has learned.\n       ``It is a significant development because it puts all U.S. \n     forces in the region at risk,'' said one official familiar \n     with the test.\n       U.S. intelligence agencies detected and monitored the \n     launch, which took place at a missile range over land in \n     northern Iran late Tuesday night, said officials familiar \n     with intelligence reports.\n       The missile was identified as Iran's new Shahab-3 missile, \n     which is expected to have a range of 800 to 930 miles, far \n     longer than any of Iran's current arsenal of short-range \n     Scud-design and Chinese missiles.\n       Data on the test are still being analyzed, but the missile \n     appeared to be a modified North Korean Nodong missile, which \n     Iran is using as the basis for its Shahab-3 design.\n       The launch has raised new fears that Iran has acquired more \n     Nodongs, which have a range of about 620 miles, from North \n     Korea.\n       Intelligence officials said the Shahab-3 is a liquid-fueled \n     system carried on a road-mobile launcher. Mobile launchers \n     are extremely difficult to detect and track.\n       The Shahab is believed by U.S. intelligence agencies to be \n     inaccurate and thus is expected to be armed with chemical or \n     biological warheads. Iran is developing nuclear warheads but \n     is believed to be years away from having them.\n       Officials said the test's success is significant because \n     U.S. military planners must regard the weapon as capable of \n     being used even though it was only fired once.\n       North Korea's Nodong also was flight-tested only once and \n     recently was declared ``operational'' by the Pentagon, which \n     puts it in a position to threaten U.S. troops throughout that \n     region.\n       In April, Pakistan for the first time also tested a Nodong-\n     design missile called the Ghauri.\n       A congressional report released last week by a commission \n     set up to assess the missile threat said, ``Iran is making \n     very rapid progress in developing the Shahab-3 medium-range \n     ballistic missiles.\n       ``This missile may be flight tested at any time and \n     deployed soon thereafter,'' said the report by the \n     commission, headed by former Defense Secretary Donald \n     Rumsfeld.\n       Iran also is building a longer-range Shahab-4, which is \n     expected to have a range of up to 1,240 miles--long enough to \n     hit Central Europe.\n       The Shahab--which means ``meteor'' in Farsi--was first \n     disclosed by The Times last year.\n       ``The development of long-range ballistic missiles is part \n     of Iran's effort to become a major regional military power,'' \n     a Pentagon official said recently.\n       A second U.S. official said data on the missile test are \n     being evaluated by U.S. spy agencies to determine in more \n     detail its estimated range, payload capacity and other \n     characteristics.\n       ``This is something that was anticipated by the \n     intelligence community,'' this official said.\n       The Shahab missile program has benefited greatly from \n     Russian technology and materials, as well as Chinese and \n     North Korean assistance, according to a CIA report on \n     proliferation released Tuesday.\n       The report said companies and agencies in Russia, China and \n     North Korea ``continued to supply missile-related goods and \n     technology to Iran'' throughout last year.\n       ``Iran is using these goods and technologies to achieve its \n     goal of becoming self-sufficient in the production of medium-\n     range ballistic missiles,'' the report said. A medium-range \n     missile is one with a range between 600 and 1,800 miles.\n       Russian assistance to Iran's missile program has meant \n     Tehran could deploy a medium-range missile ``much sooner than \n     otherwise expected,'' the CIA said.\n       A U.S. intelligence official said recently that Shahab-3 \n     deployment was about one year away and that before Russian \n     help it had been estimated to be up to three years from being \n     fielded.\n       The Iranian Shahab program has been a target of intense \n     diplomatic efforts by the Clinton administration, which has \n     been seeking to curtail Russian technology and material \n     assistance.\n       Asked to comment on the test, Rep. Curt Weldon, \n     Pennsylvania Republican, said it was ``devastating news.'' He \n     said the test confirms the findings of a bipartisan \n     congressional panel that emerging missile threats are hard to \n     predict.\n       ``We now have evidence that Iran has already tested a \n     missile system that the intelligence community said would not \n     be tested for 12 to 18 months,'' he said. ``That means the \n     threat to Israel, to our Arab friends in the region and to \n     our 25,000 troops in the region is imminent, and we have no \n     deployed system in place to counter that threat.''\n       Mr. Weldon, a member of the House National Security \n     Committee and an advocate of missile defenses, said Iran \n     would most likely deploy chemical or biological weapons on \n     the Shahab-3, depending on what types of advanced guidance \n     systems it may have obtained from Russia.\n       ``There is evidence Iran is aggressively pursuing nuclear \n     weapons and within a short period of time--months not years--\n     will have a nuclear warhead,'' Mr. Weldon said.\n\n[[Page S10048]]\n\n       Henry Sokolski, director of the Nonproliferation Policy \n     Education Center, said the test firing shows that long-range \n     missiles are likely to be the threat of the future.\n       ``This stuff is moving a lot faster than we thought five \n     years ago in the Bush administration,'' said Mr. Sokolski, a \n     former defense official.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             Early Warning\n\n       When the history books on the 21st century are written, the \n     Shehab-3 may show up on a list of early warning signs that \n     schoolchildren memorize about great catastrophes. The medium-\n     range ballistic missile that Iran tested last week is just \n     that--a warning that the missile threat is here and now, not \n     years away. The coming catastrophe is a ballistic missile \n     attack on an undefended U.S. or U.S. ally by a rogue nation.\n       You can't say we haven't been warned. The week before the \n     launch of the Shehab-3, made from a North Korean design, a \n     bipartisan panel headed by former Defense Secretary Donald \n     Rumsfeld issued a report to Congress on the ballistic missile \n     threat. The unanimous finding? Ballistic missiles from rogue \n     nations could strike American cities with ``little or no \n     warning.''\n       The security and defense experts on the Rumsfeld Commission \n     noted that North Korea is developing missiles with a 6,200-\n     mile range, capable of reaching as far as Arizona or even \n     Wisconsin, and that Iran is seeking missile components that \n     could result in weapons with similar range, able to hit \n     Pennsylvania or Minnesota. That information is from the \n     unclassified version of the report. The general public \n     doesn't get to hear about the really scary stuff. The \n     bipartisan Rumsfeld Commission report, or course, received \n     little play in the general media, which seems to have \n     concluded somehow that this issue is no big deal.\n       Earlier this year, Senator Thad Cochran's Subcommittee on \n     International Security reached many of the same conclusions. \n     Using open-source materials, the committee published ``The \n     Proliferation Primer,'' which lists in detail the progress \n     being made by a host of countries toward the development and \n     deployment of weapons of mass destruction. ``The \n     Proliferation Primer'' didn't make it into the headlines \n     either.\n       As the Shehab-3 drama was being staged in Iran, Vice \n     President Gore found himself in Russia, playing another scene \n     in the absurd theater of arms control. This is a form of \n     diplomatic drama that employs repetitious and meaningless \n     dialogue and plots that lack logical or realistic \n     development. Over the past 30 years, every act in this \n     ongoing show has been structured around the same ludicrous \n     theme: arms control works.\n       And so it goes in Moscow, where Mr. Gore, reading from the \n     usual script, expressed U.S. concern last week about the \n     transfer of Russian missile technology to Iran and other \n     rogue states, and signed two agreements on the peaceful uses \n     of nuclear technology. President Clinton voiced similar \n     concerns in Beijing last month.\n       Meanwhile, two-dozen countries are hard at work on \n     improvements to their ballistic-missile capabilities and \n     North Korea is exporting do-it-yourself Nodong missile kits \n     like the one that Iran used to build Shehab-3. In addition to \n     all this there is the so-called loose-nukes problem, by which \n     it is feared that a Russian missile might find its way into \n     the hands of a terrorist group.\n       No arms-control agreement can provide the necessary \n     protection against such threats. Not so long ago the threat \n     was a massive Soviet missile attack, but today it is more \n     likely to be one or two ballistic missiles in the hands of a \n     calculating national leader or government determined to \n     operate outside civilized norms. What do hoary notions of \n     ``arms control'' have to do with these realities? Is anyone \n     seriously going to propose that the way to keep more Iranian \n     Shehab-3s from being produced is to invite the ayatollahs for \n     a stay at Geneva's finest hotels and a long meeting of the \n     minds across a green baize table?\n       What prospect is there at all that Iran will ``agree,'' \n     much less comply with any commitment to give up what it now \n     has? What it has is a medium-range missile that can reach \n     U.S. allies Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia and Egypt. And if \n     similar minds somewhere in the world get hold of a missile \n     capable of reaching San Francisco or Honolulu or New York, \n     what ``agreement'' could induce them to give that up?\n       The fact that the U.S. has absolutely no defenses against \n     ballistic-missile-attack is an unacceptably large negative \n     incentive to this country's enemies. The way to deter them is \n     not by signing more archaic arms-control agreements but by \n     researching and deploying a national missile-defense system \n     as quickly as possible after the next President takes office.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Sept. 1, 1998]\n\n                   N. Korea Fires Missile Over Japan\n\n                 [By Rowan Scarborough and Bill Gertz]\n\n       North Korea yesterday conducted the first test launch of an \n     extended-range ballistic missile in a provocative flight that \n     crossed Japan and signaled the hard-line regime is now able \n     to threaten more neighboring countries.\n       The Taepo Dong-1 and its dummy warhead traveled about 1,000 \n     miles, surpassing by 380 miles the reach of North Korea's \n     operational medium-range missile, the No Dong.\n       Taepo Dong's debut was predicted by Washington. The flight \n     was tracked by U.S. Navy ships and by surveillance aircraft \n     as the missile left northern North Korea, dropped its first \n     stage in the Sea of Japan and then crossed Japan's Honshu \n     island before falling in the Pacific Ocean.\n       The test of the medium-range missile immediately raised \n     security fears not only in Asia, but in the Middle East and \n     the United States as well.\n       Republicans in Congress renewed demands for President \n     Clinton to accelerate development of a national missile \n     defense that could intercept incoming ballistic missiles. Mr. \n     Clinton has put off a decision until 2000 despite a blue-\n     ribbon commission's finding that a rogue nation, such as \n     North Korea, could launch a ballistic missile onto U.S. soil \n     within the next five years without warning.\n       ``The test of the Taepo Dong indicates that a North Korean \n     threat to the continental United States is just around the \n     corner,'' said Richard Fisher, an Asia expert at the Heritage \n     Foundation. ``It is now long past overdue for the \n     administration to finally wake up, smell the coffee and get \n     serious about missile defense.''\n       By flying the missile directly over Japan, Mr. Fisher said, \n     North Korea is showing it has the ability to hit U.S. \n     military facilities there and can eventually field a missile \n     capable of hitting bases farther south in Okinawa. ``Okinawa \n     is the military reserve area for the United States in any \n     potential Korean peninsula conflict,'' he said.\n       David Wright, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of \n     Technology in Cambridge and researcher at the Union of \n     Concerned Scientists, said of utmost concern is ``that this \n     is a two-state missile.''\n       Creating a multiple-stage missile is ``one of the more \n     complicated hurdles . . . in developing a longer range,'' he \n     said. ``But in and of itself it doesn't give much new \n     capability to North Korea.\n       ``The accuracy of these missiles is very low,'' he told \n     Agence France-Presse, adding that they would most likely be \n     used to carry biological or chemical weapons.\n       Japan reacted to the test by abruptly withdrawing plans to \n     extend $1 billion in aid to build two civilian nuclear \n     reactors. North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear-weapons \n     program in exchange for the two plants and U.S. deliveries of \n     fuel oil.\n       Japanese analysts saw the missile launch as a ploy in \n     winning concessions from the West during ongoing nuclear-\n     disarmament talks in New York.\n       Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, visiting \n     Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, said, ``This is something that \n     we will be raising with North Koreans in the talks that are \n     currently going on,'' the Associated Press reported.\n       A South Korean Cabinet meeting of 15 ministers said North \n     Korea's ``reckless'' test-firing of a missile over Japanese \n     territory poses a direct threat to the region.\n       North Korea is the world's largest exporter of ballistic \n     missiles. It has been helping Iran develop a missile arsenal \n     that can reach deployed American forces, moderate Arab states \n     and Israel. A North Korean envoy told congressional aides \n     last week the motive for exporting missile technology is \n     simple: badly needed hard currency for the famine-ridden \n     country.\n       Intelligence officials said Iranian technicians observed \n     yesterday's test, underscoring the close ties between \n     Pyongyang and Tehran, which tested its own medium-range \n     missile, the Shahab-3, with a range of about 800 miles, last \n     month.\n       North Korea, which boasts a 5-million-man army and stocks \n     of chemical and biological weapons, is also developing the \n     intermediate range Taepo Dong-2. Scheduled for operation in \n     2002, the weapon is designed to travel up to 3,700 miles, \n     putting it within range of Alaska. Eventually, Pyongyang \n     wants to deploy an intercontinental ballistic missile capable \n     of reaching the continental United States.\n       The U.S. has 37,000 troops stationed in South Korea, where \n     they are already vulnerable to North Korea's arsenal of \n     short-range missiles and thousands of artillery pieces. The \n     forces enjoy limited protection through Patriot interceptors \n     used in the 1991 Persian Gulf war to knock down Iraqi Scud \n     missiles.\n       Maj. Bryan Salas, a Pentagon spokesman, said, ``We were not \n     surprised by the launching. We're still evaluating all the \n     specifics in the matter and we consider it a serious \n     development.''\n       The missile test comes as Mr. Clinton and Republicans are \n     at odds on national missile defense.\n       The GOP got a boost this summer when a congressionally \n     appointed panel of experts, led by former Defense Secretary \n     Donald Rumsfeld, stated the United States could be blindsided \n     by a missile attack within the next five years from North \n     Korea or another rogue nation.\n       But the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in a letter disclosed last \n     week by The Washington Times, rejected the finding and \n     continued to support a 2003 deployment date at the earliest \n     for a national system.\n       ``The administration needs to wake up,'' said Rep. Curt \n     Weldon, Pennsylvania Republican and a leading missile defense \n     advocate. ``From what we know about this missile, it can even \n     reach U.S. soil with a range that can strike U.S. citizens in \n     Guam.''\n       Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, Texas Republican, added: ``The \n     administration's decision to block development and deployment \n     of missile defenses means we are unable to protect either our \n     important allies . . . or the\n\n[[Page S10049]]\n\n     thousands of American troops stationed there.''\n       North Korea has the expertise to mount chemical and \n     biological warheads on its ballistic missiles. It also has \n     been attempting to develop nuclear weapons, but promised to \n     end the program in return for economic aid.\n       ``When you begin to feed the wolf, the wolf just gets \n     hungrier and hungrier,'' Mr. Fisher said. ``The aid to North \n     Korea since 1995 can be said to have indirectly assisted the \n     North Korean missile program because it allowed them to spend \n     less money on feeding their people and sustain their missile \n     develop budgets.''\n       The Rumsfeld panel dismissed a CIA conclusion the United \n     States faces no ballistic missile threat from a rogue nation \n     for 15 years. The panel was particularly leery of North Korea \n     and its ally, Iran.\n       Its report said: ``The extraordinary level of resources \n     North Korea and Iran are now devoting to developing their own \n     ballistic missile capabilities poses a substantial and \n     immediate danger to the U.S., its vital interest and its \n     allies. . . . In light of the considerable difficulties the \n     intelligence community encountered in assessing the pace and \n     scope of the No Dong missile program, the U.S. may have very \n     little warning prior to the deployment of the Taepo Dong-2.''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this bill will not contribute to our national \nsecurity. As a matter of fact, it will weaken and jeopardize our \nnational security.\n  That is not just me saying it and those of us who oppose this bill. \nThe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has written us a very, very \nstrong letter supporting the current national missile defense policy, \nwhich is to develop defenses against these long-range missiles but not \nto commit to deploy such defenses, since such a commitment will violate \nan agreement that we have with Russia which has made it possible for us \nto reduce the number of nuclear weapons in this world.\n  Committing to break out of a treaty which has allowed us to reduce \nthe number of nuclear weapons will result in Russia--they have told us \nthis--not ratifying START II, and then, indeed, deciding to reverse the \nSTART I reductions. START I reductions, START II reductions, and \nhopefully START III reductions are based on an agreement that we have \nwith Russia that neither party will deploy defenses against long-range \nmissiles.\n  If we violate that agreement--this bill commits us to a position \nwhich would violate that agreement--if we violate that agreement, we \nare going to see Russia reverse the direction in which it is going--\nreduction of nuclear weapons. Indeed, there will be a much greater \nthreat of the proliferation of nuclear weapons, because thousands of \nadditional weapons will then be on Russian soil.\n  This bill is a pro-proliferation of a nuclear weapons bill. That is \nnot the intent, obviously. But that is the effect of this bill, because \ninstead of Russia just having a few thousand nuclear weapons on its \nsoil--which are then subject to being stolen, or pilfered, or sold--it \nwill have many more thousands of nuclear weapons.\n  It is not in the security interests of this Nation to trash the START \nII agreement by threatening another treaty called the Antiballistic \nMissile Treaty upon which START II is based, upon which START I is \nbased, and upon hopefully START III will be based.\n  Can we negotiate a modification in that ABM Treaty? I hope so. Might \nit be desirable for both sides to move to defenses against long-range \nmissiles? I think so. Should we develop defenses against long-range \nmissiles but not commit to violate the ABM Treaty by committing to \ndeploy those missiles? Yes. We should develop those defenses. And we \nare at a breakneck speed--by the way, a very high-risk speed.\n  This bill, which would change our policy, will not speed up the \ndevelopment of national missile defenses by 1 day. We are already \ndeveloping those defenses as fast as we possibly can.\n  Mr. President, I want to just read briefly--if my 4 minutes are up, I \nask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nwrote Senator Inhofe a letter on August 24, which I ask unanimous \nconsent to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Chairman of the\n\n\n                                        Joint Chiefs of Staff,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 24, 1998.\n     Hon. James M. Inhofe,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Inhofe: Thank you for the opportunity to \n     provide my views, together with those of the Joint Chiefs, on \n     the Rumsfeld Commission Report and its relation to national \n     missile defense. We welcome the contributions of this \n     distinguished panel to our understanding of ballistic missile \n     threat assessments. While we have had the opportunity to \n     review only the Commission's pre-publication report, we can \n     provide answers to your questions subject to review of the \n     final report.\n       While the Chiefs and I, along with the Intelligence \n     Community, agree with many of the Commission's findings, we \n     have some different perspectives on likely developmental \n     timelines and associated warning times. After carefully \n     considering the portions of the report available to us, we \n     remain confident that the Intelligence Community can provide \n     the necessary warning of the indigenous development and \n     deployment by a rogue state of an ICBM threat to the United \n     States. For example, we believe that North Korea continues \n     moving closer to the initiation of a Taepo Dong I Medium \n     Range Ballistic Missile (MRBM) testing program. That program \n     has been predicted and considered in the current examination. \n     The Commission points out that through unconventional, high-\n     risk development programs and foreign assistance, rogue \n     nations could acquire an ICBM capability in a short time, and \n     that the Intelligence Community may not detect it. We view \n     this as an unlikely development. I would also point out that \n     these rogue nations currently pose a threat to the United \n     States, including a threat by weapons of mass destruction, \n     through unconventional, terrorist-style delivery means. The \n     Chiefs and I believe all these threats must be addressed \n     consistent with a balanced judgment of risks and resources.\n       Based on these considerations, we reaffirm our support for \n     the current NMD policy and deployment readiness program. Our \n     program represents an unprecedented level of effort to \n     address the likely emergence of a rogue ICBM threat. It \n     compresses what is normally a 6-12 year development program \n     into 3 years with some additional development concurrent with \n     a 3-year deployment. This emphasis is indicative of our \n     commitment to this vital national security objective. The \n     tremendous effort devoted to this program is a prudent \n     commitment to provide absolutely the best technology when a \n     threat warrants deployment.\n       Given the present threat projections and the potential \n     requirement to deploy an effective limited defense, we \n     continue to support the ``three-plus-three'' program. It is \n     our view that the development program should proceed through \n     the integrated system testing scheduled to begin in late \n     1999, before the subsequent deployment decision consideration \n     in the year 2000. While previous plus-ups have reduced the \n     technical risk associated with this program, the risk remains \n     high. Additional funding would not buy back any time in our \n     already fast-paced schedule.\n       As to the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, the Chiefs \n     and I believe that under current conditions continued \n     adherence is still consistent with our national security \n     interests. The Treaty contributes to our strategic stability \n     with Russia and, for the immediate future, does not hinder \n     our development program. Consistent with US policy that NMD \n     development be consistent with the ABM Treaty, the Department \n     has an ongoing process to review NMD tests for compliance. \n     The integrated testing will precede a deployment decision has \n     not yet gone through compliance review. Although a final \n     determination has not been made, we currently intend and \n     project integrated system testing that will be both fully \n     effective and treaty compliant. A deployment decision may \n     well require treaty modification which would involve a \n     variety of factors including the emerging ballistic missile \n     threat to the United States (both capability and intent), and \n     the technology to support an effective national missile \n     defense.\n       Again, the Chiefs and I appreciate the opportunity to offer \n     our views on the assessment of emerging ballistic missile \n     threats and their relation to national missile defense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Henry H. Shelton.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, part of the Joint Chiefs' letter is the \nfollowing:\n\n       * * * we reaffirm our support for the current [National \n     Missile Defense] policy and deployment readiness program.\n\n  Those are the key words.\n\n       Based on these considerations, we reaffirm our support for \n     the current [National Missile Defense] policy and deployment \n     readiness program.\n\n  Then General Shelton wrote the following:\n\n       Our program represents an unprecedented level of effort to \n     address the likely emergence of a rogue ICBM threat. It \n     compresses what is normally a 6-12 year development program \n     into 3 years with some additional development concurrent with \n     a 3-year deployment. This emphasis is indicative of our\n\n[[Page S10050]]\n\n     commitment to this vital national security objective. The \n     tremendous effort devoted to this program is a prudent \n     commitment to provide absolutely the best technology when a \n     threat warrants deployment.\n       Given the present threat projections and the potential \n     requirement to deploy an effective limited defense, we \n     continue to support the ``three-plus-three'' program. It is \n     our view that the development program should proceed through \n     the integrated system testing scheduled to begin in late \n     1999, before the subsequent deployment decision consideration \n     in the year 2000.\n\n  Then he points out that:\n\n       Additional funding would not buy back any time in our \n     already fast-paced schedule.\n\n  Finally, General Shelton said the following:\n\n       The [ABM] Treaty contributes to our strategic stability \n     with Russia and, for the immediate future, does not hinder \n     our development program.\n\n  Mr. President, our program now calls for the development of defenses \nagainst long-range missiles. Let no one misunderstand that, or misstate \nthat. That is our current program.\n  We are moving as quickly as possible. Indeed, it is a high-risk move \nthat we are making because we have collapsed this development schedule \nso much. We are not going to speed up this schedule 1 day by \nthreatening to destroy the ABM Treaty. All we will do, if this bill \npasses, is to contribute to the threat of the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons on the soil of Russia. That is not in our security interest. I \nhope we do not proceed to the consideration of this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am a cosponsor of this amendment. I \nbelieve that it is a very important amendment. Other countries are \ngoing forward and developing missile systems. Can we afford not to do \nit? For the sake of our people and the sake of this Nation, we should \nseize this opportunity to go forward on this matter promptly. It is in \nthe interest of our Nation and the people of this country that we take \nthat step.\n  I thank the Senator, very much, for yielding to me.\n  Mr. COCHRAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I regret that we are on such a tight constraint, because I think this \nis the most significant issue this Senate will be addressing certainly \nthis year. We are talking about the lives of American citizens.\n  As one who is from Oklahoma and can see what type of terrorist \ndevastation can take place, and realizing that the devastation in \nOklahoma was one-thousandth of the power of the smallest nuclear \nwarhead known, it is a very scary thing.\n  I believe right now--I don't think there is a Senator here who \ndoesn't believe this--that there could very well be a missile headed \nour direction as we speak. It is not a matter of a rogue nation \nlearning how to make missiles to deliver the weapons of mass \ndestruction that we know they have. It is a matter of just getting that \ntechnology and those systems from a country that already does. China is \nsuch a country.\n  China fully has missiles that can reach Washington, DC, from any \nplace in the world. We have no way in the world of knocking them down. \nWe know that China is trading technology systems with countries like \nIran--countries that would not hesitate to use missiles against us.\n  I wish I were speaking last, because there are going to be some \nthings said about the exorbitant costs of such a system. We can \ncomplete a system to protect us against a limited missile attack for \nabout $4 billion. In the case of our AEGIS ship system, we have 22 \nAEGIS ships that have the capability of knocking down a missile, but \nnot an ICBM. We have a $50 billion investment in that system, and for \nonly $4 billion more we could have that system to protect Americans.\n  I hope that people will give consideration to this resolution. I \nthink it is the most significant resolution we will be considering this \nyear.\n  I ask unanimous consent that three items pertaining to this matter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [April 15, 1998]\n\n           Pakistan's First Test of Its New Ballistic Missile\n\n          (By Rahul Bedi, New Delhi and Duncan Lennox, London)\n\n       The first test of Pakistan's new ballistic missile, the \n     Hatf 5 or `Ghauri', took place on 6 April. Statements from \n     the Pakistani government said that the missile has a maximum \n     range of 1,500km, a payload of 700kg and a launch weight of \n     16,000kg.\n       Some earlier statements had implied that the `Ghauri' might \n     also be used as the basis for a satellite launch vehicle.\n       Currently described by government officials as ``a research \n     effort for the time being'', its indigenous development and \n     research status means that ``no international sanctions or \n     regimes apply to its development or production''.\n       Claims that the missile was tested over land are confusing \n     as the length of Pakistan's territory does not allow for the \n     range attributed to `Ghauri'. Other reports have indicated \n     that the missile was test launched from a location near \n     Jhelum in northeast Pakistan to the area southwest of Quetta, \n     a range of about 800km to 1,000km, which would agree with the \n     reported flight time of around eight minutes.\n       An earlier secret test of the `Ghauri' missile in January \n     was reported by the Islamabad News, which said that further \n     tests would be made before a public demonstration of the \n     missile on 23 March. The ``secret'' test probably refers to a \n     static motor firing and systems check-out, and is unlikely to \n     have been a flight test.\n       The `Ghauri' missile was not displayed during Pakistan's \n     National Day parade on 23 March. A missile similar to the \n     Hatf 1 short-range missile was the only ballistic missile \n     displayed.\n       Pakistani official statements are limited to the maximum \n     range, payload and launch weight. From the pictures released, \n     the missile is similar in shape to the earlier Hatf 1 design, \n     which is also similar to the Chinese M-9 (CSS-6/DF-15). The \n     launch weight of 16,000kg makes `Ghauri' much heavier than \n     the M-9, which has a launch weight of 6,000kg. This would \n     appear to support the payload weight quoted for `Ghauri' of \n     700kg over the maximum range of 1,500km.\n       It appears to be a scaled-up Hatf 1 single or two-stage \n     solid-propellant missile that may use some Chinese \n     technologies. The missile shown does not bear any resemblance \n     to the Chinese CSS-2 (DF-3), which uses liquid propellants \n     and has a launch weight of 64,000kg.\n       An alternative option might be that `Ghauri' is based on \n     the Chinese CSS-5 (DF-21) and CSS-N-3 (JL-1) ballistic \n     missile design, which has a launch weight of 15,000kg, a \n     payload of 600 kg and a maximum range of between 1,700km and \n     1,800km. The CSS-N-3 SLBM version entered service in 1983 and \n     the CSS-5 in 1987.\n       The Iranian `Shahab 3' ballistic missile project has a \n     similar range and payload to `Ghauri', and, although the \n     Iranians have never quoted a launch weight for `Shahab 3', it \n     might be in the 16,000kg bracket.\n       `Shahab 3' is believed to be an Iranian-developed single-\n     stage liquid-propellant ballistic missile, based on North \n     Korea's `Nodong 1' design, and a series of motor tests were \n     reported last year.\n       It is not clear whether Pakistan and Iran have shared \n     missile technologies, but their development approaches appear \n     to have followed relatively similar lines and in similar \n     timescales.\n       Unconfirmed reports have suggested that Pakistan and Iran \n     may have received either missiles or technologies associated \n     with the Chinese solid-propellant M-11 (CSS-7/DF-11) and M-9 \n     programmes, and it is to be expected that there might have \n     been some assistance given both ways.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Daily Oklahoman, Sept. 8, 1998]\n\n                         Vulnerable and at Risk\n\n       Recently, U.S. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Tulsa, asked Gen. Henry \n     H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to comment \n     on a new report questioning U.S. readiness to deal with a \n     long-range missile attack. The general's response was \n     illuminating, particularly so in light of North Korea's \n     subsequent test of a missile capable of carrying nuclear \n     warheads.\n       Inhofe raised the issue after release of the Rumsfeld \n     Commission Report, warning a missile threat may come sooner \n     than many in the U.S. government think. The panel said it's \n     possible an enemy could develop a ballistic missile program \n     in a way that would give the United States little or no \n     warning before an attack.\n       In fairness, Shelton and the joint chiefs answer to Bill \n     Clinton, so it's not surprising they echo his \n     administration's soft-line on missile defense.\n       Shelton reiterated to Inhofe that the chiefs don't think a \n     real threat is near. They believe the United States should \n     continue to\n\n[[Page S10051]]\n\n     comply with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and they \n     support Clinton's ``3-plus-3'' plan for a national missile \n     defense. The policy calls for three years of development with \n     another three years for deployment--if a missile threat is \n     identified. ``We remain confident that the Intelligence \n     Community can provide necessary warning of . . . an ICBM \n     threat,'' Shelton wrote.\n       Inhofe points out that U.S. intelligence was surprised by \n     India's nuclear testing this summer and considered attacks on \n     embassies in Africa unlikely. As for the ABM treaty, Inhofe \n     says it ``reinforces the discredited policy of mutual-assured \n     destruction at a time when the U.S. is being targeted by \n     numerous potentially undeterrable rogue states and \n     terrorists.''\n       Inhofe's ally on missile defense, U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence, \n     R-S.C., cut to the dangers of the Clinton administration's \n     ostrich-like approach to missile defense in an interview with \n     Frank Gaffney, director of the Center for Security Policy.\n       ``The first warning of a heart attack is a heart attack,'' \n     Spence said. ``The Clinton administration's response to all \n     this is that we are working on a system and we are going to \n     experiment for about three years. And if the threat arises, \n     we will decide at that time whether or not to deploy. My God, \n     the threat is right now here, this minute, this moment, not \n     some time in the future.''\n       The Oklahoman urges Inhofe, Spence and other patriots in \n     Congress to hold hearings highlighting America's \n     vulnerability to missile attack.\n       Bold action is needed to counter Clinton's idle approach to \n     defending the U.S. against a grave and growing threat.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 8, 1998]\n\n                             Shooting Stars\n\n       ``Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at \n     without success,'' Winston Churchill once famously said. \n     Perhaps. But the Japanese might have a different take, having \n     now had North Korea fire a missile over their heads. In a \n     world where Pathan tribesmen with rifles have been replaced \n     by rogue states with ballistic missiles, Churchill would have \n     been the first to argue that the leader of the free world \n     needs more going for him then the other guy's bad aim. To \n     wit, a missile defense.\n       If the events of the past few weeks have taught us \n     anything, it is that the bad guys out there--Saddam Hussein, \n     Kim Jong II, Osama bin Laden and the like--are not kidding \n     when they threaten to blow up Americans. What we don't yet \n     know is just how many of them have the capability to follow \n     through on their threats, though recent tests by both North \n     Korea and Iran confirm that some are not that far away. We \n     shouldn't have to wait until a missile lands in Times Square \n     to find out.\n       Unfortunately that is precisely what Democratic Senators \n     have been doing. Back in March, GOP Senator Thad Cochran \n     introduced a bill calling for the U.S. ``to deploy as soon as \n     is technologically possible an effective National Missile \n     Defense System capable of defending the territory of the \n     United States against limited ballistic missile attack.'' \n     When the motion to move it to the floor for debate and \n     amendments came up, it fell just one vote shy of the 60 \n     needed. All 41 opposed were Democrats. While bin Laden bombs, \n     the Democrats filibuster.\n       They have a chance to redeem themselves when the \n     reintroduced petition comes up for a vote tomorrow. Events \n     since the March 13 filibuster have tragically underscored \n     just how irresponsible a move it was: India and Pakistan have \n     exploded nuclear bombs; Iran and North Korea have tested \n     ballistic missiles; Saddam Hussein has forced U.N. inspectors \n     to a standstill; and bin Laden blew up two American embassies \n     in Africa.\n       Indeed, it has lent a prophetic tone to the findings of the \n     Rumsfeld Commission, a team of defense experts which in July \n     warned that America's enemies could deliver a ballistic \n     missile threat to the U.S. within five years of any decision \n     to acquire such a capability. More ominously, the Rumsfeld \n     report warns that ``during several of those years, the U.S. \n     might not be aware that such a decision has been made.''\n       In face of these tangible threats, the continued Democratic \n     preference for arms control agreements in the bush over real \n     defense capabilities in the hand is baffling. And our guess \n     is that an American public that has now watched North Korea \n     and seen for itself some of bin Laden's handiwork also would \n     be a hard sell. We wouldn't be surprised, then, if these \n     developments, coupled with a President suffering from a \n     severe loss of moral authority, might lead some of these \n     Democrats to consider whether they want to continue to block \n     debate about ways to protect Americans--especially the 13 \n     Democratic Senators up for re-election which follow:\n\n\n                           Up for Re-election\n\n       Democratic senators who voted against closure on the \n     American Missile Protection Act of 1998.\n       Barbara Boxer, California.\n       John Breaux, Louisiana.\n       Thomas A.

It is \n     worth asking whether Mr. Clinton could even have taken the \n     limited action he did against sites in Afghanistan and the \n     Sudan had bin Laden somehow managed to buy a missile of his \n     own--or pay the North Koreans or Iranians to shoot one off \n     for him.\n       Likewise, could George Bush have prosecuted the Gulf War if \n     Saddam Hussein had had a missile capability? As Mr. Clinton \n     has had impressed on him, just four or five warheads in hands \n     like Kim Jong II's pose a far more immediate and practical \n     threat to American lives and interests than the 2,000 or so \n     in the Russian arsenal. Especially given North Korea's \n     willingness to sell its missiles to anyone with cash.\n       Providing an American President with the wherewithal to \n     shoot down a ballistic missile on its way to an American city \n     shouldn't be a partisan issue. But if the Democrats decide \n     again to make it one in the coming vote, that would be a \n     persuasive Republican argument for a filibuster-proof \n     Republican Senate. If we ever get a missile defense system \n     this country needs, we may owe more to Monica Lewinsky and \n     Osama bin Laden than we do to our Democratic Senators.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield Senator Conrad 4 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise as a strong supporter of national \nmissile defense. But I also rise as a strong opponent of the Cochran \nbill that is before us. I believe so strongly in national missile \ndefense that I have introduced legislation promoting national missile \ndefense that has passed the U.S. Senate.\n  I support national missile defense because we have an unpredictable \nand rapidly emerging ICBM threat to this country from the so-called \nrogue states. The Rumsfeld Commission recently alerted us to the \ngrowing need for national missile defense. As I have said many times on \nthe Senate floor, we must be prepared before we are surprised.\n  But the bill before us is fatally flawed because it does not include \nthe correct criteria for a decision to deploy. It says that we should \ndeploy ``as soon as technologically possible.'' Mr. President, that \nisn't the right test. Let's make sure that we deploy the best initial \nsystem, not simply the first one off the shelf. The first one off the \nshelf may be significantly inferior to one that follows soon thereafter \nthat would be a far more effective system of national missile defense.\n  Further, the Cochran bill is also seriously flawed because it has \nonly one criterion--``as soon as technologically possible.'' It \ncompletely disregards three other vital criteria for national missile \ndevelopment:\n  No. 1, treaty compliance. As the Joint Chiefs have said in several \nletters, the ABM Treaty and START accords must not be endangered. Mr. \nPresident, I direct my colleagues' attention to a statement by General \nHenry Shelton, the current Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He said that \nthe effect that ``NMD deployment would have on arms control agreements \nand nuclear arms reductions should be included in any bill on national \nmissile defense.''\n  Are we going to listen to the top military leadership of our country \non this question? I hope so. I hope we are going to listen to the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  The second key criterion is cost. A system we can't afford, such as \none with space-based weapons, is a fantasy in the short run and \nprotects no one. We need to have a system that we can afford.\n  The third criterion is use of proven technology to ensure performance \nand contain costs. We ought to use technology we know will work. Again, \nrushing to failure will not protect one single American family.\n  Mr. President, we are in a development stage on national missile \ndefense, and that is where our efforts must be. I applaud our \ncolleagues on the Appropriations Committee and Armed Services Committee \nfor fully funding aggressive development of national missile defense. \nHowever, the Cochran bill, at this point, is counterproductive because \nit applies the wrong criteria to the decision to deploy. The Senate \nshould again vote no on cloture.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and give back the remainder of \nmy time.\n\n[[Page S10052]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 4 minutes to Senator Dorgan.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this debate and this vote are not about \nwhether we support research on a missile defense system. I am on the \nAppropriations Committee. I am on the Defense Appropriations \nSubcommittee. The Defense appropriations bill has over $3 billion for \nresearch and development of theater and national missile defense \nprograms. I expect all Members of the Senate support that. I do.\n  But this bill presents us with a different question. This bill would \nput the Senate on record saying there must be a deployment of a \nnational missile defense system--there must be a deployment as soon as \n``technologically feasible.'' And we must then deploy.\n  Well, 25 years ago, we had an antiballistic missile system in North \nDakota. I guess that particular system was technologically feasible \nthen. Of course, that system would have used nuclear bombs to intercept \nand destroy incoming missiles. But it was built, at the cost of over \n$20 billion in today's terms. Thirty days after it was declared \noperational, it was mothballed. That system was too expensive and too \ncontroversial.\n  Let's keep that cautionary tale in mind as we consider this bill.\n  If this bill were to pass, the question is, What is technologically \nfeasible? What kind of technology? At what cost? Does cost have any \nrelevance at all? How will the bill affect arms control? Will this bill \ncrowd out spending on other ways of dealing with terrorism? What other \ndefense programs that respond to terrorist threats or rogue nations \nwill then lack funding because we forced deployment of a system when \nsomeone said we now have the technology, and we forced deployment \nnotwithstanding costs?\n  Frankly, a rogue nation or a terrorist state is much more likely to \npose a threat to us with a suitcase nuclear bomb planted in the trunk \nof a rusty Yugo car at a dock in New York City. The threat is much more \nlikely to be a nuclear weapon put on top of a cruise missile--not an \nICBM, but a cruise missile. There is far greater proliferation of \ncruise missiles and greater access to them. Will this defend against \ncruise missiles? No. Will it do anything about the suitcase bomb? No. \nWhat about a fertilizer bomb in a truck parked in front of a building? \nNo. What about a vial of the most deadly biological agents? Again, no.\n  There are a lot of terrorist and rogue nation threats that we ought \nto be concerned about, and we ought to worry about developing missile \ndefense--and we are. But rushing to say we must deploy now, as soon as \nit is technologically feasible, notwithstanding any other \nconsideration, makes no sense.\n  The Senator from Michigan was asking what this bill would do to arms \ncontrol. I want to hold up a chart of unclassified pictures to try and \nshow what arms control means. This is a photo from March 26, 1997. It \nshows the launching of an SSN-20 missile from a Russian submarine in \nthe Barents Sea. The submarine launched a missile, and within minutes \nthe missile was destroyed. And the last picture here shows the \nmissile's pieces falling into the sea.\n  Why was that missile destroyed? Because of arms control agreements \nthat we have reached with Russia. There was a whole series of these \n``launch-to-destruction'' launches, because they were an inexpensive \nway for Russia to destroy its submarine-launched missiles and for us to \nverify their destruction. That is the way to deal with these threats--a \nreduction of nuclear weapons, reduction of delivery vehicles. This is \nthe kind of thing, with Nunn-Lugar and other efforts, especially arms \ncontrol agreements, that results in a real reduction of threat.\n  The question is, What will the vote today do to arms control? Will it \nmean more delivery systems, more nuclear weapons? A greater arms race? \nI don't think anybody in this Chamber has that answer. My colleague, \nSenator Conrad, put it well. To those who support--and I think almost \nall of us do--theater missile defenses and the research on national \nmissile defense, it doesn't make any sense to say that notwithstanding \nany other consideration we must deploy as soon as technologically \nfeasible. That is not, in my judgment, the right thing or the \nthoughtful thing to do in order to defend this country.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield Senator Bingaman 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nyielding me time. I want to join my colleagues in resisting S. 1873, \nthis proposal. In my view, what this proposal would do is to put our \nDefense Department in an untenable position. It essentially says that, \nin this case, in the case of national missile defense, as distinguished \nfrom all other cases, they should ignore the criteria that they use for \ndeciding which programs to go ahead and deploy. Those criteria are that \nthey maintain a sensible balance among cost, schedule, and performance \nconsiderations, given affordability constraints.\n  Now, that is the criteria the Department of Defense has set up. This \nproposal by my colleague from Mississippi would have them ignore those \nprovisions and rush ahead to develop this as soon as it is \ntechnologically feasible. We have some experience with efforts by \nCongress to turn up the political pressure on the Department of Defense \nand to urge them to rush ahead with development of programs before they \ncan be safely deployed. The most recent example is one that many of us \nare familiar with; it is the THAAD Program, Theater High Altitude Area \nDefense Program. In that case, again, we were anxious to get this \nprogram fielded. The Congress put increased pressure on the Department \nof Defense to move ahead. Accordingly, we have had disaster. In that \ncase, the program is 4 years behind schedule. There have been five \nconsecutive flight test failures of the THAAD interceptor. The cost of \nthe program has risen from $10 billion to $14 billion today.\n  General Larry Welch, who reviewed this missile defense program and \nother programs indicated that one reason is that there was a very high \nlevel of risk, that we were, in fact, engaged in what he called a \n``rush to failure'' in the THAAD Program. We do not need a rush to \nfailure in the national missile defense program to follow onto the rush \nto failure in the THAAD Program. We need a program that the Department \nof Defense can develop on an urgent basis, but on a reasonable basis. I \nbelieve they are on that course. I believe when General Shelton asks us \nto refrain from this kind of a legislative proposal, I think we should \ntake his advice. I hope we will defeat the proposal by the Senator from \nMississippi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 3 minutes to Senator Biden.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, whatever our views on a nationwide \nballistic missile defense, it seems to me that we should reject S. \n1873.\n  Were that bill to pass, deploying a national missile defense system \ncould, in my view, break the back of the economy at a moment when we \nfinally have gotten a handle on things.\n  A week ago, General Lyles warned that our current programs are over \nbudget and ``may not be all affordable.''\n  We spent years getting some budget discipline. We have finally \nachieved that. We must not throw that all away.\n  This bill would require deployment even without a threat of new \nstrategic missiles; and it would throw taxpayers' money at the first \navailable technology, rather than the best technology.\n  As Dr. Richard L. Garwin warns, the first technology will be \nvulnerable to missiles with penetration aids, which Russia surely has \nand others can easily develop. Missile defense is expensive; \npenetration aids are cheap.\n  This bill will also guarantee what General Welch calls a ``rush to \nfailure.'' Five test failures with the THAAD theater defense system are \na reminder of how difficult it is to develop any missile defense. A \npolicy of deploying the first ``technologically possible'' system is \nalmost bound to fail.\n  Finally, this bill does not even permit consideration of the negative \nconsequences of deployment. S. 1873 would destroy the Anti-Ballistic \nMissile Treaty, and thus end any hope of implementing START Two or of \nachieving START Three.\n\n[[Page S10053]]\n\n  ``Star Wars'' may seem easier than the hard, patient work of reducing \ngreat power armaments and stabilizing our forces. But the ``easier'' \npath can also be the dangerous path.\n  Last week, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin agreed to share real-time \ndata on third-country missile launches, to reduce the risk of \naccidental nuclear war. That is a good, sensible initiative.\n  But what happens if we say we will deploy a national missile defense? \nWe may call it just a defense, but others will see it as a second-\nstrike defense that enables us to mount first-strike nuclear attacks. \nRussia and China will adopt a hair-trigger, ``launch on warning'' \nposture to overwhelm that defense, and the risk of nuclear war will \nrise.\n  Now, some day we may need a nation-wide ballistic missile defense. \nThat is why the Defense Department has the ``3+3'' policy of developing \ntechnology that would permit deployment within three years of finding \nan actual threat on the horizon.\n  Some of my colleagues believe we cannot wait for that. But Iran's \nmissiles will hit the Middle East and parts of Europe. North Korea's \nmissiles will hit Japan and Okinawa. Despite recent missile tests, \nthese countries are several years away from threatening even the far \nwestern portions of Alaska and Hawaii, as General Shelton made clear in \nhis letter of August 24.\n  And should a real threat materialize, there are far cheaper \nalternatives to fielding a national missile defense. So, while sensible \npolicy on ballistic missile defense is perfectly feasible, S. 1873 is \nnot such a sensible policy.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has real work to do. Americans deserve a \nPatient's Bill of Rights; we can enact campaign finance reform that \neven the House of Representatives had enough sense to pass; and we must \nstop the slaughter of our teenagers by Big Tobacco.\n  Let us get back to legislation that meets real, current needs and \nthat will not destroy the balanced budget. Let us reject cloture on the \nmotion to debate S. 1873, and get this Senate back to work.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as a cosponsor of the legislation before \nthe Senate, I rise in strong support of the objectives set forth in \nthis bill. As we all know, this legislation would establish a policy \nfor the U.S. to develop and deploy a national missile defense as soon \nas technologically possible. This system will defend all 50 states \nagainst any limited ballistic missile threats.\n  Mr. President, allow me to offer a couple of observations about the \nchanged international and national security environment which directly \nimpact U.S. defense needs. The original impetus for a national missile \ndefense system was the perceived threat from the Soviet Union during \nthe cold war.\n  Although some assume that the collapse of the Soviet Union and the \ncontinued thaw in previously frosty relations with Russia have rendered \nsuch defensive capabilities unnecessary, this view is naive. I believe \nthat in many respects the threat has actually increased.\n  The increased threat results from several interrelated factors. The \ncollapse of the bipolar geopolitical order defined by U.S.-Soviet \nconfrontation has ushered in multipolar instability. The threats we \nconfront today as a nation are diffuse. Moreover, our potential enemies \nare abundant in a world where interstate relations are no longer \ndelineated according to membership in one of two ideological camps.\n  I would like to emphasize a further change brought about by changes \nin the international environment. An additional aspect of the post-\ncold-war world is the rapid and, in some cases, uncontrollable \ndiffusion of advanced technologies. While earlier non-proliferation \nefforts relied heavily on stringent export control regimes, heavy \nreliance on multilateral controls is insufficient to protect U.S. \ninterests.\n  The U.S. continues to maintain a complex and multi-layered system of \nexport controls as a deterrent to would-be proliferators or rogue \nnations. However, an export control regime is only as strong as its \nweakest link. Furthermore, rogue nations--such as North Korea--who \nalready possess threatening capabilities, are more than willing to sell \ntheir know-how to others.\n  I am aware of others' predictions that ballistic missile capability \nwill not present a threat for more than another decade. I believe, \nhowever, that these predictions rely too heavily on the assumption that \nexport controls will keep rogue nations at bay. Without the technology, \nour potential enemies are presumably impotent. I think this is an \noverly optimistic view.\n  More than 15 nations already possess short-range ballistic missiles. \nMany of these same nations are pursuing weapons of mass destruction to \naccompany these missile capabilities. Several of these same countries \nare hostile to U.S. interests.\n  Any country with the know-how to launch low-orbit satellites is also \ncapable of achieving long-range delivery of a nuclear or other type of \nwarhead. In contrast to the CIA's earlier prediction, the recently \nreleased Rumsfeld Report stated that the threat is only five years \naway. Moreover, the Rumsfeld Commission determined that the U.S. may \nnot be able to identify the source of a threat, thus having little or \nno warning.\n  Let me simply offer one concrete example why the Administration's \ncurrent policy is dangerous. The Administration assumes it will have \nthree years warning of a ballistic missile threat to the U.S. Although \nU.S. intelligence previously believed that Iran could not field a \nmedium-range missile until 2003, this system was flight-tested in July.\n  According to intelligence sources, the light-weight alloys as well as \nequipment for testing these Iranian missiles came from Russia.\n  If we assume the predictions about othe5r countries; lack of \ntechnological capacities are accurate and postpone implementation of \nour own defensive capabilities based on these assumptions, the U.S. \nwill be rendered vulnerable while we test the accuracy of these \npredictions. If these assumptions are proven false, the results would \nbe devastating.\n  This is a risk to U.S. security and a risk to U.S. civilians that I \npersonally am not willing to take.\n  It has been an enduring objective of U.S. defense policy to achieve \nthe capability to defend our country from ballistic missiles, whether \nthe threat be from deliberate, accidental or unauthorized launch.\n  A further reality we confront under changed circumstances is the \nsteady deterioration of Russia's system of command and control over its \nnuclear warheads.\n  Although the Russian situation presents a potential threat now and \ndeployment is not slated for another several years, no one can assume \nthat the command-and-control elements in any state possessing weapons \nof mass destruction and long-range delivery capability will remain \nimpenetrable and secure. This is one more reason that devising and \ndeploying missile defense makes sense.\n  There has been sufficient debate as to whether this bill is necessary \nin addition to the Defense Department's three-plus-three program. I \nbelieve it is for the following reasons:\n  First, although the three-plus-three program provides for development \nof national missile defense (NMD) technology, it does not commit to \ndeployment.\n  Under the Administration's program, the U.S. would achieve the means \nto deploy an NMD system, but would await an imminent threat to do so. \nCapability that is not deployed opens a window of vulnerability. \nCertainly the plans of an attack on the U.S. by a hostile nation are \nnot going to include a great deal of advanced warning. By not providing \na commitment to deployment, as is the objective of this legislation, we \nare deliberately creating an indefinite phase of vulnerability.\n  Second, opponents to this legislation firmly believe that by \ncommitting to deployment we may end up with an inadequate or faulty \nsystem. This bill neither prematurely locks the U.S. into specific \ntechnological solutions nor does it freeze our missile defense options.\n  We already are deploying systems, even though the technologies \ninvolved continue to evolve. The specific technologies utilized and the \ndefense capabilities achieved are in no way determined by this \nlegislation. Further development and improvements to the system are \nanticipated, and this legislation allows for that.\n\n[[Page S10054]]\n\n  An additional strategic consideration is that the lack of a U.S. NMD \nsystem may actually provide an additional incentive to would-be rogues. \nIf the U.S. implements an NMD system early enough, this may serve as a \ndeterrent to these states.\n  As mentioned, I believe that predictions regarding the technical \nmediocrity of hostile nations are excessively optimistic. However, I \nalso firmly believe that a national missile defense system undoubtedly \nraises the bar on the technological capability necessary to inflict \ndamage.\n  Any nation hostile to the U.S. would not only have to achieve long-\nrange capability, but they would also have to be sophisticated enough \nin their delivery system to defeat a defensive shield. The financial \nand technical means necessary to accomplish this goal does, indeed, \ncomprise a substantial deterrent.\n  More importantly, a missile defense system places strategic stability \non a more reliable and less adversarial foundation. The cold war \ndeterrence relied on vulnerability and threats of retaliation. Missile \ndefenses create a shield of protection, while the maintenance of a \nreliable stockpile underpins our credibility in threats of retaliation \nif attacked.\n  Arms reductions can only achieve objectives of stable U.S.-Russian \nrelations if these reductions are accompanied by national missile \ndefense deployment. With such a system in place, possible non-\ncompliance and third party threats are not as pertinent. This would \nprovide the confidence necessary to achieve even greater reductions.\n  Mr. President, based on these concerns about U.S. national security \nin conjunction with my commitment to disarmament objectives I \ncosponsored and fully support the legislation before us today.\n  National missile defense will provide the necessary additional \nsecurity requisite in an unstable and transitional global environment \nwhere hostile nations are rapidly amassing threatening and \nsophisticated weapons capability. The objectives set forth in this \nlegislation achieve that goal.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1873, the \nAmerican Missile Protection Act. This bill is simple, but extremely \nimportant. It makes it clear that it is the policy of the United States \nto deploy, as soon as technologically possible, a national missile \ndefense system which is capable of defending the entire territory of \nthe United States against limited ballistic missile attack.\n  We voted on cloture earlier this year--the motion fell one vote shy. \nWell, as is common in this business, we are dealing with changed \ncircumstances. North Korea continues to defy rational behavior. As we \nall know, it recently fired a multi-stage missile over Japan! \nStarvation in North Korea is rampant, and many North Korea watchers \nhave long predicted that government's imminent collapse. Well, Mr. \nPresident, the North Korean Government continues to defy the odds--but, \nwhat concerns me is the old adage that ``desperate times often call for \ndesperate measures.'' If North Korea is truly desperate, to what extent \nwill it go to try to hold on to its grasp of power?\n  We have almost 80,000 American troops in the Asia/Pacific Theater. \nMost of these troops are already in the range of current North Korean \nmissile technology. As their missile development program advances, we \ncan expect more American lives and territory to be at risk. We cannot \nstand idly by and wait! We need to be prepared so that we can protect \nour citizens and our territory from such a reckless or accidental \nstrike by North Korea or some other nation.\n  Alaskans have been justifiably concerned with this issue for some \ntime. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this \ntime a resolution passed by the Alaska State Legislature which calls on \nthe Administration to include Alaska and Hawaii in all future \nassessments of the threat of a ballistic missile attack on the United \nStates. More than 20 percent of our domestic oil comes from Alaska, all \nof it through the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. Alaskans are concerned, as \nshould the rest of the country be concerned, that a strike at the \npipeline could have dire consequences to our domestic energy \nproduction.\n  There being no objection, the resolution was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:'\n\n              State of Alaska--Legislative Resolve No. 36\n\n       Whereas Alaska is the 49th State to enter the federal union \n     of the United States of America and is entitled to all of the \n     rights, privileges, and obligations that the union affords \n     and requires; and\n       Whereas Alaska possesses natural resources, including \n     energy, mineral, and human resources, vital to the prosperity \n     and national security of the United States; and\n       Whereas the people of Alaska are conscious of the State's \n     remote northern location and proximity to Northeast Asia and \n     the Eurasian land mass, and of how that unique location \n     places the state in a more vulnerable position than other \n     states with regard to missiles that could be launched in Asia \n     and Europe; and\n       Whereas the people of Alaska recognize the changing nature \n     of the international political structure and the evolution \n     and proliferation of missile delivery systems and weapons of \n     mass destruction as foreign states seek the military means to \n     deter the power of the United States in international \n     affairs; and\n       Whereas there is a growing threat to Alaska by potential \n     aggressors in these nations and in rogue nations that are \n     seeking nuclear weapons capability and that have sponsored \n     international terrorism; and\n       Whereas a National Intelligence Estimate to assess missile \n     threats to the United States left Alaska and Hawaii out of \n     the assessment and estimate; and\n       Whereas one of the primary reasons for joining the Union of \n     the United States of America was to gain security for the \n     people of Alaska and for the common regulation of foreign \n     affairs on the basis of an equitable membership in the United \n     States federation; and\n       Whereas the United States plans to field a national missile \n     defense, perhaps as early as 2003; this national missile \n     defense plan will provide only a fragile defense for Alaska, \n     the state most likely to be threatened by new missile powers \n     that are emerging in Northeast Asia;\n       Be it resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests the President of the United States to \n     take all actions necessary, within the considerable limits of \n     the resources of the United States, to protect on an equal \n     basis all peoples and resources of this great Union from \n     threat of missile attack regardless of the physical location \n     of the member state; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests that Alaska be included in every \n     National Intelligence Estimate conducted by the United States \n     joint intelligence agencies; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests the President of the United States to \n     include Alaska and Hawaii, not just the contiguous 48 states, \n     in every National Intelligence Estimate of missile threat to \n     the United States; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature urges \n     the United States government to take necessary measures to \n     ensure that Alaska is protected against foreseeable threats, \n     nuclear and otherwise, posed by foreign aggressors, including \n     deployment of a ballistic missile defense system to protect \n     Alaska; and be it\n       Further resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature conveys \n     to the President of the United States expectations that \n     Alaska's safety and security take priority over any \n     international treaty or obligation and that the President \n     take whatever action is necessary to ensure that Alaska can \n     be defended against limited missile attacks with the same \n     degree of assurance as that provided to all other states; and \n     be it\n       Further resolved, That the Alaska State Legislature \n     respectfully requests that the appropriate Congressional \n     committees hold hearings in Alaska that include defense \n     experts and administration officials to help Alaskans \n     understand their risks, their level of security, and Alaska's \n     vulnerability.\n       Copies of this resolution shall be sent to the Honorable \n     Bill Clinton, President of the United States; the Honorable \n     Al Gore, Jr., Vice-President of the United States and \n     President of the U.S. Senate; the Honorable Newt Gingrich, \n     Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives; the Honorable \n     Ted Stevens, Chair of the U.S. Senate Committee on \n     Appropriations; the Honorable Bob Livingston, Chair of the \n     U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations; \n     the Honorable Strom Thurmond, Chair of the U.S. Senate \n     Committee on Armed Services; the Honorable Floyd Spence, \n     Chair of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on \n     National Security; and to the Honorable Frank Murkowski, U.S. \n     Senator, and the Honorable Don Young, U.S. Representative, \n     members of the Alaska delegation in Congress.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Last year North Korean defectors indicated that the \nNorth Korean missile development program already poses a verifiable \nthreat to American forces in Okinawa and seems on track to threaten \nparts of Alaska by the turn of the Century. The Taepodong missile, \nwhich is under development, would have a range of about 3,100 miles. \nFrom certain parts of North Korea, this weapon could easily target many \nof the Aleutian islands in\n\n[[Page S10055]]\n\nwestern Alaska, including the former Adak Naval Air Base.\n  The Washington Times reported earlier this year that the Chinese have \n13 of 18 long-range strategic missiles armed with nuclear warheads \naimed at American cities. This is incredible, Mr. President. Opponents \nto the motion to invoke cloture somehow fail to understand that this \nthreat is real and that we have a responsibility to protect the United \nStates from attack, be it deliberate or accidental. Without question, \nthe threat of an attack on the United States is increasingly real, and \nwe must act now to make certain that it is the policy of the United \nStates to construct a national missile defense system with the \ncapability of intercepting and deterring an aggressive strike against \nAmerican soil from all parts of the United States--as soon as possible.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would mention for a moment that S. 1873 is \nnot, and I repeat not, in any way a strike at Russia. The ABM treaty \nwas crafted and agreed to when the United States and the Soviet Union \nwere the only nuclear powers. The mutually assured destruction system \nwas agreed to under the understanding that we were dealing with the \nSoviet Union, and not third parties. Times have changed; there are \ncountless more players that have complicated the issues. We have a \nresponsibility to protect ourselves, and we must act now to do so.\n  Mr. President, I support the motion to proceed to the bill and hope \nthat my colleagues will vote overwhelmingly in favor of this \nlegislation this morning and pass it in the near future.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of S.1873, \nthe American Missile Protection Act of 1998 drafted by Senators Cochran \nand Inouye. While I have been an ardent supporter of a vigorous missile \ndefense program with a specific architecture and under a specific \ndeployment schedule, a sufficient minority of members has been able to \nderail this effort over the last few years. Therefore, the modest \nproposal under consideration today, is an attempt to compromise by \naffirmatively establishing as U.S. policy the deployment of an \neffective National Missile Defense (NMD) system as soon as \ntechnologically possible.\n  I have long argued that such a system is both necessary and prudent \nbecause the threat of an attack or an inadvertent launch did not end \nwith the termination of the cold war, but is real and continues to \ngrow. In fact, the threat is greater today than any time in United \nStates history. The technology revolution aids equally those who want \nto bring good into the world, as well as those who would do harm.\n  Recent activities in Africa, namely the bombing of our embassies in \nKenya and Tanzania, and the launch of ballistic missiles (or a \nsatellite) by North Korea, as well as the shoot-down of two unarmed \nAmerican aircraft in the Florida straits two years ago, reminds us of \nthe threat the United States and our allies face from rogue and \nterrorist states, and non-state actors.\n  Beyond these, the future of Russia and China remains unclear. While \nwe wait to see if the forces of freedom and democracy prevail in the \ninternal struggles happening in these countries, we must remember that \nthey maintain the capability to launch weapons of mass destruction. \nOther states continue efforts to develop destructive capabilities. \nRecently, Iran has made dramatic progress in its missile development. \nWe know that China's proliferation has aided the development of \nPakistan's nuclear program, adding to the instability of South Asia.\n  My primary concern with the Administration's ``plan'' on deploying an \nanti-ballistic missile defense system is that it is premised on \ndeploying a system within three years of clearly identifying an \nemerging threat. I believe the Administration greatly overestimates its \nintelligence gathering capability.\n  In early 1997, a CIA official testified that Iran was not expected to \nhave the capability to field a medium range ballistic missile until \n2007. Less than a year later, that nine year time frame was \nsignificantly reduced by the CIA, and another Administration official \npredicted Iran could have the capability in as early as one-and-a-half \nyears. Similarly, in 1997 the Department of Defense only credited \nPakistan with a 300 km capability. However, less than six months later \nPakistan launched a missile capable of traveling 1,500 km.\n  Based on past performance, I am very hesitant to base the fielding of \na missile defense system on the Administration's determination of the \nexistence of an emerging threat. I believe such a plan is grossly \ninadequate and could have catastrophic consequences for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, last May, in the wake of India's nuclear \nweapons tests, the Senate rejected by one vote a motion to allow us to \nconsider the need for a national missile defense. At that time I came \nto the floor and urged my colleagues to support defending our nation \nagainst missile attack. I recalled how the President, in his State of \nthe Union address, underscored the importance of foresight and the need \nto prepare ``for a far off storm.'' The President wasn't talking about \nweapons proliferation and national missile defense, but I suggested he \nshould have been--and that the thunder clouds of proliferation were \ngathering.\n  Since that vote in May, the storm has picked up force and is not so \n``far off.'' That weapons proliferation is a serious threat to our \nnation is more obvious today that even a few month ago.\n  Allow me to remind my colleagues of a few developments since the \nSenate last considered missile defense:\n  Following India's nuclear tests, Pakistan conducted six of its own \ntests. The South Asian subcontinent--rife with smoldering disputes--is \nnow perched on the edge of a nuclear arms race.\n  The following month, in June, North Korea blatantly announced that it \nwas selling, and would continue to sell, ballistic missiles to any and \nall comers. The only requirement is cash on the barrel-head.\n  In July, the Congress received stark warning of our under-\npreparedness from the Rumsfeld Commission. This distinguished, bi-\npartisan, group of experts concluded that our assessment of the missile \nthreat to America was inadequate, and that hostile countries were \ncloser to developing and deploying ballistic missiles than we thought. \nAs if to prove the Rumsfeld Commission right, Iran test-launched its \nShahab-3 missile that same month. This weapon was based on a North \nKorean design and updated with Russian and Chinese assistance. It is \ncapable of striking U.S. allies and troops in the Middle East. Iran \nalso continues its work on the Shahab-4, which will be able to reach \ncentral Europe.\n  Then, just a few weeks ago, North Korea test-launched its Taepo-Dong \n1 missile--and they shot it right over our key ally, Japan. The Taepo-\nDong 1 is a huge breakthrough for North Korea. It is a multi-stage \nrocket that puts North Korea over a critical technology threshold. \nTheir next missile, already under development, is the Taepo-Dong 2 \nwhich will be capable of striking American shores.\n  When I spoke on this subject in May, I cautioned that developments \nsuch as these were on the horizon. Indeed, I noted a few of them \nspecifically. But I truly did not expect to stand here this soon and \nrecount that so many dangerous developments actually occurred. My \nfriends, the past few months demonstrate that the threats from weapons \nof mass destruction and missiles with increasingly greater range are an \nimminent threat. We have consistently underestimated that threat and \nmust proceed with development and deployment of a national missile \ndefense as soon as possible.\n  I do not know if there will be another proliferation development to \nreport this month. Given the recent track record, it's very likely \nthere will be. It's certain that missile development in hostile \ncountries will continue apace. Moreover, world events are becoming more \nand more chaotic each day. The instability in Russia and Asia and the \ncontinuing proliferation activities of countries like China and North \nKorea only heightens the prospect that dangerous weapons technology \nwill be sold to rogue actors.\n  President Clinton was recently quoted in the press that requiring \ncertification regarding other countries' actions only creates the need \nfor the Administration to ``fudge'' its reporting. More recently, it \nappears the Administration took an active role to limit weapons \ninspections in Iraq, despite all its rhetoric to the contrary. Mr. \nPresident, events like these are\n\n[[Page S10056]]\n\nhighly worrisome because they suggest the President is less than \nforthcoming to the American people, to our allies and to our foes on \nissues of national defense and foreign policy. Perhaps even more \nworrisome, however, is the possibility that Administration policy \nmakers may be fooling themselves. In the case of missile defense, this \nappears to be so. Their defense policy is based on hollow rhetoric and \ndelusion. It is based on the hope of a three-year advanced warning. My \nfriends, we're receiving our warnings now--over and over again. It's \ntime to act.\n  It's time to wake up and it's time to act. The technology to develop \nnuclear and other weapons of mass destruction is widely available. If \nwe do not prepare today, when the day arrives that America is paralyzed \nby our vulnerability to ballistic missile attack, or when an attack \nactually occurs, we will be reduced to telling the American people--and \nhistory--that we had hoped this would not happen. We will have to say \nwe had ample evidence of a growing threat, but did not act for whatever \nreason.\n  Mr. President, if we're going to err on this issue, we should err on \nthe side of caution. If our choices are to deploy a missile defense \neither too early or too late, let's make it early. The first step in \nraising our guard is to pass S. 1873, the American Missile Protection \nAct, and commit the United States to a policy of deploying national \nmissile defenses.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as I listen to the debate on S. 1873, two \nobservations come to my mind. First, it appears that a rigid adherence \nto ideology seems to be trumping the judgment of this nation's most \nsenior military leaders. Second, advocates of S. 1873 apparently lack \nconfidence in their own publicly stated position. They are insisting \nthat the critical and costly decision about whether we deploy a \nnational missile defense should be based on a single criterion--\ntechnological feasibility--a simplistic test that the bill's supporters \nare unwilling to use for any other federal program.\n  The Senate should act as it did in May. We should oppose cloture and \nmove on to the Patients' Bill of Rights, campaign finance reform, \neducation, agricultural relief, and the environment--all issues of \ngreater urgency for working families in this country.\n  The proponents of this latest attempt to deploy ballistic missile \ndefenses at all costs have entitled this bill the American Missile \nProtection Act. But let's be clear, enactment of this bill will provide \nprecious little if any additional protection. If the Senate were to \nimmediately adopt this bill, we would not be a single day closer to \nactually having a national missile defense. In fact, as stated by the \nSecretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in \nrecent letters to Congress, deployment of national missile defenses at \nthis time is unnecessary, premature, and could effectively increase the \nnuclear threats this country faces.\n  Quoting from S. 1873, ``the United States should deploy as soon as is \ntechnologically possible an effective national missile defense \nsystem.'' In the eyes of the sponsors of this bill, the only standard \nthat must be met in deciding whether to deploy defenses is that they be \ntechnologically possible.\n  Mr. President, I cannot find a clear definition of effective defenses \nin S. 1873. That troubles me greatly, though it apparently doesn't \ntrouble the bill's supporters. They are strangely silent when it comes \nto establishing even the most minimal performance requirements for \nmissile defenses. Many of these bill supporters are the same people who \nreject important domestic programs such as health care and school \nconstruction because they fail to meet their stringent--sometimes \nlogically impossible--set of conditions.\n  This irony is not lost on me, nor should it be lost on the rest of \nthe Senate. As I noted in May when we last debated this bill, the \nattitude displayed by the proponents of S. 1873 is cavalier even by \nmilitary spending standards. Some research by the Department of Defense \nshows that S. 1873 would make history. For the first time ever, we \nwould be committing to deploy a weapons system before it had been \ndeveloped, let alone thoroughly tested.\n  An additional irony is that most experts believe that a rush to \njudgment on ballistic missile defenses will not necessarily lead to the \ndeployment of the most effective system. According to General John \nShalikashvili, the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ``if \nthe decision is made to deploy a national missile defense system in the \nnear term, then the system fielded would provide a very limited \ncapability. If deploying a system in the near term can be avoided, the \nDefense Department can continue to enhance the technology base and the \ncommensurate capability of the missile defense system that could be \nfielded on a later deployment schedule.''\n  In addition to its silence on the effectiveness issue, there is not a \nword in S. 1873 about the costs of this system. The Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that the deployment of even a very limited \nsystem could cost tens of billions of dollars. And given that so much \nof the necessary technology remains unproven, history tells us the real \ncost could be much, much more. Despite the hefty price tag and the \nquestionable technology, proponents of this bill essentially say, ``the \ncosts be damned, full speed ahead.'' Yet when it comes to proven \nproposals to improve our nation's schools, increase the quality of \nhealth care, or enhance the environment, the first question out of the \nmouths of the proponents of S. 1873 is, ``how much does it cost?''\n  Mr. President, S. 1873 also says absolutely nothing about how a U.S. \ndeclaration that it plans to unilaterally deploy national missile \ndefenses will affect existing and future arms control treaties. It \nshould be clear to every one in this chamber that if the United States \nunilaterally abrogates the ABM Treaty, which is what S. 1873 states we \nwill do, the Russians will effectively end a decades-long effort to \nreduce strategic nuclear weapons. They will back out of START I. They \nwill not ratify START II. And they will not negotiate START III. In \nother words, a unilateral U.S. deployment of national missile defenses \ncould end the prospect for reducing Russia's strategic nuclear arsenal \nfrom its current level of 9,000 weapons down to as few as 2,000.\n  I find it hard to believe that many of my colleagues are willing to \nforego the opportunity to eliminate thousands of Russian nuclear \nweapons today in exchange for the possibility that we might some day be \nable to deploy a system that can intercept a few missiles. This is much \ntoo steep a price to pay for a course of action that at present is \nunproven, unaffordable, and unnecessary.\n  Supporters of S. 1873 have argued that the Senate should reconsider \nits position on this issue as a result of three major developments \nsince May--the nuclear weapons tests in India and Pakistan, the \nRumsfeld Commission report on the threat posed by ballistic missiles, \nand North Korea's test of a medium-range ballistic missile. In reality, \nnone of these events suggests we should go forward with premature \ndeployment of national missile defenses. The tests of nuclear weapons \nby India and Pakistan as well as the larger issue of proliferation of \nnuclear weapons can best and most directly be addressed by swift \nconsideration and ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. \nAdoption of S. 1873 does not directly address this situation and will, \nin fact, lead to more, not less, nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, the \nmajority side of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has not seen \nfit to conduct a single hearing on this issue, let alone report out \nthis treaty for consideration by the full Senate.\n  As for the remaining two events, I commend to all members of the \nSenate an excellent letter from General Shelton, this nation's most \nsenior military leader. General Shelton and the rest of the service \nchiefs take issue with the Rumsfeld Commission's findings and reaffirm \ntheir support for the Clinton Administration's current missile defense \npolicy and deployment readiness program. As for the recent Korea \nmissile test, although the letter was written prior to the test, the \nChairman's conclusions were explicitly based on the assumption that \nNorth Korea would continue the development and testing of their missile \nprogram. Quoting General Shelton, the North Korean missile program, \n``has been predicted and considered in the current examination.''\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to reflect on the advice of the \nSecretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff and vote against \ncloture on S. 1873.\n\n[[Page S10057]]\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise as a cosponsor and strong supporter \nof S. 1873, the American Missile Protection Act, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this much needed legislation.\n  Let me begin by being blunt--the United States cannot defend its \nborders against a single ballistic missile attack. This leaves all \nfifty states, especially Alaska and Hawaii, defenseless against any \ncountry that wants to threaten the U.S. with ballistic missiles.\n  We will hear that there is no need for a national missile defense \nbecause the Soviet Union is gone. This is true, but the USSR's demise \nhas given rise to many nations ready to take their place. Russia has \n25,000 nuclear warheads and recent reports show that their technology \nand warheads are readily available. Just as problematic is that 25 \nnations have or are developing nuclear, biological and chemical \nweapons. Over 30 nations have ballistic missiles, with many more \nattempting to strengthen their weapon of mass destruction capability.\n  Until just recently, China, with its over 400 warheads, had strategic \nnuclear missiles targeted at the United States. However, these missiles \ncould be red-targeted within minutes if so desired. Just last week, \nNorth Korea placed all of South Asia on high alert due to their missile \ntest. They now have demonstrated the capability to build two-stage \nmissiles, which is significant because adding stages increases missile \nrange. While the Administration plays down the threat, I cannot. This \nleaves the region and our over 80,000 troops in the area vulnerable to \nattack. Also, according to ``Jane's Strategic Weapons Systems,'' North \nKorea is developing long-range missile capability that could threaten \nsouthern Alaska and with additional assistance from Russia could later \ndevelop missiles with ranges which could threaten the west coast of the \nU.S.\n  Opponents will also argue that a missile defense system cannot defend \nthe United States against suitcase nukes or terrorist attacks on our \nown soil. They are right, and we need to do more to detect this form of \nterrorism, but it should not be done at the risk of a ballistic missile \nattack. To quote William Safire, ``. . . nations like China, Iran, \nIraq, North Korea, India, and Pakistan have not been investing heavily \nin suitcases.'' These countries are spending money on long range \nmissiles. While many of these countries may never threaten the United \nStates, we should not base all of our future threats on the present.\n  Opponents also point out that non-proliferation agreements will end \nthe need for a missile defense. The problem is that not all countries \nabide by these agreements, or even sign at all. Presently, China, North \nKorea, and Russia are all engaged in the transfer of missile components \nand technologies. Despite past denials, North Korea now admits to \ntesting and selling missiles in an effort to help build the arsenals of \nIran, Iraq, and Syria. Again, despite the threats and pleadings of the \nAdministration, North Korea has refused to stop developing, testing, \nand deploying missiles.\n  Lastly, opponents of a missile defense system point to the \nAdministration's 1995 National Intelligence Estimate which stated that \nthe United States would not face a threat of a missile attack for at \nleast 15 years. However, to come to this conclusion, they had to \nexclude any threat to Alaska and Hawaii. This intentional omission is \ndeceptive at best. We must not sacrifice the protection of U.S. \ncitizens living in Alaska and Hawaii just to score political points. By \nleaving one state vulnerable, we leave the country vulnerable. This is \nunacceptable.\n  While I am a strong supporter of the capability of our intelligence \ncommunity, they are not perfect. In May, the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity was caught by surprise when India conducted a series of \nnuclear tests on the 11th and 13th of that month. In another surprise, \ndespite intelligence estimates that Iran could not field its medium \nrange ballistic missile until 2003, Iran flight-tested this system on \nJuly 22nd of this year. Also, it has been reported that Iran is \ndeveloping a longer-range version capable of reaching Central Europe.\n  Again, the Administration believes that we will have at least 3 years \nwarning before any missile attack would be feasible. However, on July \n15th, the Congressionally mandated bipartisan Rumsfeld Commission \nconcluded that the United States could get little to no warning of \nballistic missile deployments from several emerging powers. The \nCommission stated that ``The threat to the U.S. posed by these emerging \ncapabilities is broader, more mature and evolving more rapidly than has \nbeen reported in estimates and reports by the intelligence community.'' \nIt also warns that, ``The warning times the U.S. can expect of new, \nthreatening ballistic missile deployments are being reduced. . . . the \nU.S. might well have little or no warning before operational \ndeployment.''\n  While it may be difficult, we must admit that we live in an era of \nunstable international politics. The U.S. should never initiate a \nballistic missile attack, but we cannot be sure that other nations are \nlike-minded. The United States must be able to defend itself. I believe \nthe world would be a better place without these weapons. In the \nmeantime though, we must live with the reality that they do exist and \nin the wrong hands will be used.\n  The bottom line is that if the United States is on the receiving end \nof a missile attack, we are defenseless. I believe it is wrong to \nunderstate the danger still lurking in the world. We must do all that \nis possible to protect all Americans. We must develop a true national \nmissile defense as soon as technologically possible. To do anything \nless would be to shirk our duties to provide for the common defense of \nthe United States and all its citizens.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, how we vote is not always clear to \nAmericans. For the average citizen it is not easy to keep straight \nwhether a ``yea'' is for or against something--whether it is a vote to \npass a bill or table it. It also can be difficult to sort out where \ntheir senators stand when a particular vote covers many provisions in \none ``package.'' Which provision was the ``yea'' vote for or the ``no'' \nvote against?\n  But, Mr. President, the vote on cloture of the American Missile \nProtection Act (S. 1873) this morning is not at all one of those \n``confusing'' votes. I can think of no vote where it can be seen more \nclearly exactly where each senator stands. This morning's vote was \nblack and white. This morning's vote shows who takes the most important \nfunction of the Federal Government--national security--seriously. The \nSenate failed for a second time this year to invoke cloture on the \nbill. Forty-one Senators, all Democrats, voted against protecting \nAmerican families from the greatest threat to our homeland.\n  Nothing can be more frightening than the thought of an attack on our \nhomes by another nation using nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons. \nNot thinking about it or pretending that it won't happen are absolutely \nnot grownup ways to deal with this reality.\n  Opponents of the American Missile Protection Act claim concern with \nthe fact that the bill mandates deployment of a National Missile \nDefense system. They claim that this bill ties our hands because when \nwe finally do develop the capability to deploy a system, there might \nnot be a need for it.\n  Might not be a need?? Let me be completely up-front. It's a myth that \nwe have plenty of time to build a missile defense capability and hold \noff deployment until some potential future threat develops. The \nAmerican people need to get that scenario out of their minds. The \nsystem is needed today, right now, and it is time for this \nAdministration to get off its slow-track development program.\n  Just two months ago, the Rumsfeld Commission to Assess the Ballistic \nMissile Threat to the United States concluded that ``ballistic missiles \narmed with WMD payloads pose a strategic threat to the United States.'' \nThe commission did not say there might be a future threat, it said \nthere is a present threat. Further, India and Pakistan have conducted \nnuclear tests, North Korea just launched a two-stage missile over \nJapan, and we don't know Iraq's chemical weapons capability because the \ninspectors have not been allowed to look. If these events do not \nconvince my colleagues on the other side of the aisle of our need for a \nNational Missile Defense system, what will it take to convince them? Do \nthey actually have to see a missile strike?\n\n[[Page S10058]]\n\n  So, Mr. President, I do not take seriously this criticism that S. \n1873 is flawed because it mandates deployment of a missile defense \nsystem that may not be needed. This sounds more like a smoke screen. I \nbelieve that the Democrat's real hope is to try and resuscitate the \nAnti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which was voided by the breakup of the \nSoviet Union. Getting back the ABM Treaty seems to be all consuming for \nsome senators, and a U.S. National Missile Defense system gets in the \nway of their goal.\n  Mr. President, after today's vote it is very clear to American \nfamilies that their senators either support real national security \naction or are trying to convince the citizens that a paper treaty will \nbe sufficient to protect them--there is no middle ground.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 15 seconds remaining; the \nmajority a minute and a half.\n  Mr. GLENN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. GLENN. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose cloture on the \nCochran bill.\n  I will agree at the outset that the many cosponsors of this bill, \nthough haling overwhelmingly from a single party, probably believe they \nhave the best interests of the nation in mind by giving their support \nto this bill. So I am not here today to challenge their motives or to \nimpugn their character. I am here instead to state as concisely and \nsincerely as I can how and why I believe they are simply wrong.\n  This bill is fatally flawed because it bases a profound national \nsecurity decision--that is, the decision to deploy a missile defense \nsystem spanning the entire territory of the United States--upon one \nsingle consideration . . . its technological possibility.\n  Voters across the land sent us here to Washington because here is \nwhere the tough decisions are made that face all Americans. They are \ntough decisions precisely because they rarely if ever involve only one \nconsideration. They are tough because they often entail tough trade-\noffs in the pursuit of goals that our country simply cannot achieve all \nat once. As members of Congress, we have to consider politics, \neconomics, short-term and long-term effects, impacts on other policies, \nlegal issues, and other factors. We have to weigh all these \nconsiderations and reach a judgment on what will serve the interests of \nthe nation.\n  Yet here we are today, deliberating a decision that could well lead \nto the expenditure of tens or potentially hundreds of billions of \ndollars solely on the basis of a wish on a star. And that star is Star \nWars.\n  This is my main objection to the bill--I just do not think it is wise \nto base fundamental national security decisions on simply one \ncriterion, especially one so notoriously ill-defined as the notion of a \n``technological possibility.''\n  But I have other concerns as well. These relate to the potential cost \nof the policy enshrined in this bill. And they focus on the dubious \ntechnological objective that lies at the heart of what is known as \n``National Missile Defense.'' I think it is certainly appropriate to \nask some tough questions--as the Rumsfeld Commission did--about the \nforeign missile threat to determine if this threat is so grave or so \nimminent that it requires throwing twin babies out with the bath water: \nfirst, by abandoning standard US government procurement laws and \nprocedures when it comes to acquiring major technological systems, and \nsecond by setting America on a course that is contary to our nation's \narms control treaty obligations. And with respect to the consideration \nof what is actually possible, I also want to call my colleagues' \nattention to an article in the New York Times dated July 28 by Richard \nGarwin, a member of the Rumsfeld Commission. The article makes a \npersuasive point: that we cannot--must not--depend on a system for our \ndefense which, even under the best circumstances, cannot accomplish its \nmission. In fact, it is not at all clear that any system we design \ncould ever deal with all of the varied threats from different quarters.\n  Mr. President, the American people are not dummies. I am convinced \nthat when they listen carefully to both sides on this issue, they will \nrecognize that nobody has yet come up with an improvement on existing \nUS policy for missile defense. They will come to this conclusion \nprecisely because our current policy is premised upon all of the many \nconsiderations I have just summarized . . . not just one.\n  Americans understand that it makes sense not to force the government \nto buy costly, high-risk technologies that simply have the possibility \nof being effective.\n  They understand that America's national security decisions must not \nbe made without considering the impacts of these decisions on the \ndefense choices that will be left open to other countries.\n  They understand that in an age of balanced budgets, large new public \nsector commitments will jeopardize funding prospects for a multitude of \nother precious national goals.\n  They will know how to assess the incorrect claim so frequently made \nby missile defense advocates that America is allegedly ``defenseless'' \nagainst the foreign missile threat. The closer they look at the $270-\nplus billion that we are spending each year on the nation's defense \n(not to mention the additional billions that we are investing in our \ndiplomatic and intelligence capabilities), the sooner they will see the \nfallacy in the idea of a defensless America.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I yield the time remaining on our side to \nthe distinguished Senator from Texas, Senator Hutchison, for closing \nour debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMississippi for his leadership.\n  Which of these actions would be the act of a strong and powerful \nnation led by men and women of vision and foresight: a nation that \nconstantly reassesses its security threats and tailors its defense to \nmeet those threats, or a nation that sits back and says let's see what \nthe threat is, then we will assess it and then we will address it?\n  Mr. President, it was the latter thinking that caused us to go to a \nhollow military after World War II, and we paid the price with \nthousands of lives in the Korean war--lives of our men and women, \nbecause we hadn't planned for the future.\n  Mr. President, we have gotten the wake-up call. It is the Rumsfeld \nreport that Congress commissioned, which said that we have failed to \nestimate how long it would take rogue nations to develop ballistic \nmissiles. That is the wake-up call. Are we going to meet the security \nthreats of this country? The greatest security threat we have is \nincoming ballistic missiles. If we put our mind to the technology, we \ncan prioritize our defense spending to say to the American people that \nwe will protect you from incoming ballistic missiles to our shores, or \nto any theater where our Armed Forces are present. We can do no less if \nwe are men and women of vision and foresight for the greatest Nation on \nEarth.\n  I urge your support for the Cochran visionary amendment that would \nprotect our country at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nCoats be added as a cosponsor of S. 1873.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to S.1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act, \nwhich will be voted on later today. This legislation is urgently needed \nto address abuses of our bankruptcy laws and help make sure bankruptcy \nis reserved for those who truly need it.\n  We have had Federal bankruptcy laws for 100 years, and no one \ndisputes that some people must file for bankruptcy. Some people fall on \nhard times and have financial problems that dwarf their financial \nmeans. They need to have the debts that they cannot pay forgiven under \nchapter 7.\n  However, other people who file for bankruptcy have assets or have the \nability to repay their debts over time. These people should reorganize \ntheir debts under chapter 13. Bankruptcy should not be an avenue for \nsomeone to avoid paying their debts when they have the ability to do \nso. People should pay what they can.\n  Unfortunately, too many people today who file for bankruptcy choose \nto discharge their debts rather than reorganize them and pay what they \ncan. The reason may be because filing for bankruptcy does not have the \nmoral stigma it once had. It may be because the person needs to be \neducated on how to better manage their money. Maybe attorneys do not \nencourage enough people to reorganize their debts. Whatever the reason, \nit is a big problem today.\n  The problem is becoming more serious because more and more people are \nfiling for bankruptcy every year. In fact, more Americans filed for \nbankruptcy last year than ever before, about 1.35 million people.\n  S.1301 addresses the issue by making it easier for judges to transfer \ncases from chapter 7 discharge to chapter 13 reorganization, based on \nthe income of the debtor and other factors. The bill permits creditors \nto be involved if they believe the debtor has the ability to repay. \nHowever, if a creditor abuses that power and brings such motions \nwithout substantial justification, the creditor is penalized. Also, the \nlegislation places more responsibility on attorneys to steer \nindividuals toward paying what they can.\n  The bill makes reforms without jeopardizing the truly needy. For \nexample, the bill has special provisions to protect mothers who depend \non child support by making these payments the top priority for payment \nin bankruptcy.\n  Mr. President, it is too easy to file for bankruptcy. It is too easy \nto get the slate wiped clean. We recognize that some people need a \nfresh start. But a fresh start should not mean a free ride. We must \nstop this type of abuse.\n  It is important to note that we are only attempting to proceed to the \nbill. It is only appropriate that we consider this legislation on the \nmerits this year.\n  Under the outstanding leadership of Senator Grassley, we held \nnumerous hearings during this Congress in the Judiciary Committee on \nbankruptcy and on this bill in particular. We have considered and \ndebated this legislation at the subcommittee and full committee, where \nit was reported out on a bipartisan vote of 16 to 2. Much work has been \ninvested in this complex issue, and it would be a mistake not to act on \nthis important reform proposal this year. It deserves our consideration \nand our support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the \nworld record breaking achievements of the National Aeronautics and \nSpace Administration's (NASA) Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) program \nconducted at the Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF) on Kauai. This \nexemplary program is part of NASA's Environmental Research Aircraft and \nSensor Technology (ERAST) program, which first gained national \nrecognition for record breaking Pathfinder flights last year.\n  Mr. President, on December 10, 1997, I was proud to participate in a \nceremony dedicating the previous record breaking flight that reached an \naltitude of 71,500 feet in memory of Hawaii's beloved hero, Colonel \nEllison Onizuka. This was a most fitting tribute to honor Colonel \nOnizuka and inspire our youth to excellence.\n  Since that time, the Pathfinder solar electric powered remotely \npiloted aircraft has undergone design upgrades which have allowed the \nERAST Team to once again set a new world altitude record for unmanned \nsolar-powered aircraft. This landmark was accomplished when the \nsolarplane climbed to 80,200 feet above PMRF on August 6, 1998. I am \nparticularly proud of the students and faculty of Kauai Community \nCollege and the talented personnel at PMRF who assisted NASA's ERAST \nTeam in attaining this monumental achievement.\n  The success of Pathfinder and Pathfinder Plus has opened new doors to \npossible educational, scientific, and technological applications that \nwere not imaginable a few years ago. There are countless implications \nfor advances in the fields of aviation, satellite deployment, solar \nenergy technology, oceanic and atmospheric research and monitoring, and \nenvironmental protection.\n  Mr. President, I commend NASA's ERAST Team, the students and faculty \nof Kauai Community College and the personnel at PMRF for demonstrating \nthat through our imagination, we can reach unimagined realms in space \nand near space.\n\n\n                         PRIVILEGE OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

However, we are available \nto deal with amendments that can be worked out and agreed to which we \nwill send up and deal with if there are any short spaces of time in \nwhich Members are not available to discuss the McCain-Feingold bill. \nMembers who have interests in the Interior appropriations bill who have \namendments that they think will be accepted or can be worked out should \nbe in contact with me or with staff of the Appropriations Committee, \nand we will attempt to work them in whenever it is convenient to do so.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first I mention a scheduling item. I am \nconfident that the agreement we reached yesterday was that there would \nbe a vote either late tomorrow afternoon or early evening. Now I am \ntold that there may be some Members on the other side who want to have \nan earlier vote. Mr. President, I will not agree to such a thing. I \nbelieve that we need more than 2 days' debate on this issue even though \nwe have been over this issue many times before. I just want to tell my \ncolleagues on both sides, but particularly on the other side of the \naisle, I understand there are personal commitments and we will try to \naccommodate those, but to have a vote earlier than very late tomorrow \nafternoon or tomorrow evening I think would not be in keeping with the \nagreement that we reached yesterday.\n  This is not a happy time for America. It is not a happy time for the \ninstitutions of government, especially the Presidency, but also the \nCongress. We are going through a very wrenching and difficult episode \nwhich already, I think most of us would agree, ranks in the first order \nof crises that affect this country. And it affects us. As I have said \non numerous occasions, all of us are tarred by a brush when the \ninstitutions of government are diminished and affected by scandal. But \nit also points out the criticality of us addressing this issue of \ncampaign finance reform now rather than later. In today's newspaper, \n``Reno Sets 90-day Clinton Probe'':\n\n       Attorney General Janet Reno yesterday opened a preliminary \n     investigation of President Clinton that could lead to an \n     independent counsel probe of allegations that he orchestrated \n     a plan to violate spending limits for his 1996 reelection \n     campaign. . . .The new Clinton inquiry was triggered by a \n     preliminary report last month from the Federal Election \n     Commission auditors. The auditors concluded that the DNC ads \n     about issues such as Medicare and the budget amounted to \n     ``electioneering'' on the President's behalf, and the \n     Clinton-Gore campaign should be required to reimburse the \n     government for the entire $13.4 million it received in \n     Federal matching funds.\n\n  This morning, in most of the major newspapers in America, there is a \npoll that is conducted by the Terrence Group and Lake, Snell, Perry and \nAssociates--one Democrat and one Republican polling group: ``What do \nyou think is the number one problem today? Moral-religious issues, 14 \npercent; crime and drugs, 14 percent; economy and jobs, 13 percent.''\n  Mr. President, perhaps moral and religious issues have been a No. 1 \npriority in America before, but I don't think there is any doubt that \nthat is the case today. ``Which of the following issues do you want \nCongress to focus on? Restoring moral values, 22 percent; improving \neducation, 19 percent; reducing taxes and Federal spending, 13 \npercent.''\n  Mr. President, when 22 percent of the American people say they \nbelieve that restoring values is the No. 1 issue they want Congress to \nfocus on, I don't believe they are just referring to the problems \nconcerning the Presidency and that crisis. I think they are talking \nabout the fact that they don't believe that they, as individual \ncitizens, are represented here in the Congress in the legislative \nprocess. I think they believe that special interests rule. I believe \nthey are concerned that no longer are their concerns paramount, but \nonly those of major contributors.\n  The effect of this was manifested just yesterday in my home State of \nArizona in the primary that was held, as has been true throughout the \ncountry. It was the lowest voter turnout, as a percentage, of any time \nin the history of my State. I don't think that voters didn't turn out \nto vote in the primary in Arizona yesterday because of their anger--\nwhich may be justified--at the President of the United States; I think \nthey didn't turn out because they believe that the present system of \nfinancing campaigns results in an exclusion of them in the legislative \nprocess; their homes and their dreams and aspirations for themselves \nand their families are no longer reflected here in the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, the amendment at the desk, which is commonly known as \nthe McCain-Feingold campaign finance legislation, is amended by \nSenators Snowe and Jeffords. This amendment would begin to reform a \nseverely broken campaign finance system. Early last month, the Members \nof the other body did what the Senate has failed to do, and that is to \npass genuine campaign finance reform. By so doing, they have given \nMembers of this body who support reform encouragement that Congress, at \nlong last, may accede to the wishes of the majority in both Houses of \nCongress and to the wishes of the vast majority of the people we \nrepresent by repairing a campaign finance system that has become a \nnational embarrassment and assails the integrity of the office that we \nare privileged to hold.\n  I want to commend and thank Representatives Shays and Meehan, and \nmany other Members of the other body, whose courage and determination \nhave given us a chance to reclaim the respect of the American people. I \nappeal to all Members of the Senate to listen to the majority of our \ncolleagues in the other body, and to the majority of Senators, and \nseize this historic opportunity to give the Nation a campaign finance \nsystem that is worthy of the world's greatest democracy.\n  Mr. President, no Washington pundit thought that the House would \nactually\n\n[[Page S10061]]\n\npass campaign finance reform, but it did. It was not an easy fight. But \nthose in favor of reform prevailed. I hope the majority in the Senate \nthat favors reform will be able to prevail here. A majority in the \nHouse passed reform because the American people demand it. Members of \nthe House recognized that the current system is awash in money, \nexploited loopholes, and publicly perceived corruption. It is a system \nthat no Member of Congress should take pride in defending.\n  Before I discuss the matter more fully, I want to remind my \ncolleagues of three points. One, for reform to become law, it must be \nbipartisan. This is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill that affects both \nparties in a fair and equal manner.\n  Two, reform must seek to reduce the role of money in politics. \nSpending on campaigns in current inflation-adjusted dollars continues \nto rise. In constant dollars, the amount spent on House and Senate \nraces in 1976 was $318 million. By 1986 that total had risen to $645 \nmillion, and in 1996 it was $765 million. Including the Presidential \nraces, over a billion dollars was spent in the last campaign. As the \nneed for money escalates, the influence of those who have it \nrises exponentially.\n\n  Three, reform must seek a level playing field between challengers and \nincumbents. Our bill achieves this by recognizing the fact that \nincumbents must always raise more money than challengers. As a general \nrule, the candidate with the most money wins the race. If money is \nforced to play a lesser role, then challengers will have a better \nchance.\n  The amendment before the Senate achieves these three points. Is the \nmeasure perfect? No. Is it a legitimate start for discussion? Yes. For \nthat reason, I hope my colleagues will support cloture and allow the \nSenate to work its will, to improve the measure where necessary, and \nbegin a real dialog with the House on what can and should be sent to \nthe President for his signature.\n  I want to repeat that this is the Senate's opportunity to not only do \nwhat is right but what is necessary. Washington has lately become \nsynonymous with scandal, but for all the recent scintillating \nrevelations, the real scandal--a scandal that will not go away--is the \nmoney that is and has been corrupting our elections. Unless this Senate \nfinds the courage to act, that scandal will not subside.\n  Some will come to the floor and state that we do not need to reform \nhow campaigns are run. They will state instead that we should simply \nenforce the laws that already exist. Mr. President, with all due \nrespect, this argument is specious. Republicans demanded that the \nwelfare system be reformed not only because it was the right thing to \ndo but because the system was riddled with loopholes and was being \nabused and exploited. We didn't sit back and simply challenge the \nexecutive branch to enforce the laws. We acted, we changed the law, and \nwe changed it in our society for the better. Let's do the same now.\n  I know that many colleagues think this refrain has become all too \nfamiliar, and they are correct. This is not the first time our campaign \nfinance system has been in need of reform, and it will undoubtedly not \nbe the last, because as time passes, the flaws and loopholes in the law \nbecome more evidence. It is at that time that the Congress has \nhistorically done what is needed; it has passed campaign finance \nreform.\n\n       The underlying purpose of this movement for the publication \n     of contributions made for campaign purposes is to limit \n     expenditures in political contests to legitimate purposes and \n     to lessen the use of money in political elections.\n\n  So said Senator Culberson in 1908.\n  Senator Culberson inserted into the Record many letters, many of \nwhich could have been written today:\n\n       For some years there has been earnest agitation of the \n     question of enforcing campaign contributions relating to \n     national elections. A strong public sentiment has been \n     created in favor of this important regulation. In obedience \n     to this sentiment, a bill is now pending in Congress \n     providing for the desired publicity. The question is whether \n     the bill will be passed, defeated, or smothered.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       No party should be afraid to go before the country with a \n     record of its campaign financiering.\n       No candidate for office should hesitate to have the people \n     know the sources of campaign money. In other words, such \n     contributions should come only from legitimate sources, and \n     only money from such sources would be accepted, if the facts \n     had to be made public: Hence, the great importance of \n     publicity. The people do not want successful candidates to \n     owe their elections to special interests affected by the \n     subsequent administrations of such candidates. Such favors \n     and obligations they involve are absolutely against the \n     principles of honest government, whether that government be \n     national, State, or municipal.\n\n  In the House that same year 1908, Congressman Sulzer stated:\n\n       In my opinion, this publicity campaign contribution bill is \n     one of the most important measures before this House. It is a \n     bill for more honest elections, to more effectively safeguard \n     the elected franchise, and it affects the entire people of \n     this country. It concerns the honor of the country. The \n     honest people of the land want it passed. All parties should \n     favor it. Recent investigations conclusively demonstrate how \n     important to all the people of the country is the speedy \n     enactment of this bill.\n\n  Remember, this statement was made in 1908.\n\n       In every national contest of recent years the campaign has \n     been a disgraceful scramble to see which party could raise \n     the most money, not for legitimate expenses but to carry a \n     system of political iniquity that will not and cannot bear \n     the light of publicity. Political corruption dreads the sun \n     of publicity and works in the secret of darkness . . . \n     Napoleon said victory was on the side of the heaviest guns. \n     There are many thoughtful people in this country who have \n     been saying since 1896 that the political victory in our \n     Presidential contest is on the side of the campaign committee \n     which can raise the largest boodle fund.\n       This important bill for publicity of campaign contributions \n     is a nonpartisan measure. There should be no politics in it. \n     We should all advocate from patriotic motives; but some of \n     the gentlemen on the other side are injecting party politics \n     into it, and are doing everything in their power to prevent \n     the Members of this House who sincerely favor the bill from \n     having the opportunity to vote for it. . . It is a shame the \n     way this bill is being strangled to death.\n\n  In 1908, Congress went on to do the people's bidding. It passed the \ncampaign finance reform legislation.\n  In 1947, Senator Ellender stood on this floor, and stated:\n\n       It came to my attention as chairman of that committee--and \n     this feeling is shared by committee members joining me in \n     sponsoring this bill--that the present statutes dealing with \n     elections, campaign expenditures, and contributions, and \n     limitations thereon, are utterly inadequate and unrealistic \n     and as now in force and do not begin to accomplish the \n     purposes for which they were enacted. . .\n       I may state, Mr. President, that our committee last year \n     found that many corporations and some labor organizations had \n     spent thousands of dollars in Federal elections, but we could \n     not force them to report for the reason that the money \n     expended was not considered as contributions. So this bill \n     requires any money spent to be reported by whoever makes the \n     expenditure.\n       Experience has shown that some corporations and labor \n     unions have spent money directly on behalf of a party or \n     candidate and thus I invaded the application of the \n     prohibition upon contributions.\n\n  In 1947 the Congress, again, responded to the public's disdain for \nthe way our campaigns are financed and passed campaign finance reform \nlegislation.\n  In 1974, in the aftermath of the Watergate scandal, the Congress \nagain passed campaign finance reform legislation.\n  Mr. President, after what we know about the last election, it is time \nagain to pass campaign finance reform legislation.\n  Mr. President, recently there was given to me a memo that is public \nknowledge: The Democratic National Committee, Democratic National \nCommittee Managing Trustee Events and Membership Requirements Events; \ntwo annual Managing Trustee Events where the President in Washington, \nDC, attended; two annual meetings, trustee event for the Vice \nPresident, et cetera. It is kind of a standard thing that you see on \nthese kind of things. But the thing that is interesting about this is \nthe fifth one down, ``Annual Economic Trade Missions.'' ``Managing \ntrustees are invited to participate in foreign trade missions, which \naffords opportunities to join Party leaders in meeting with business \nleaders abroad.''\n  Another memorandum that was given to me of May 5, 1994, to Anne \nCahill from Martha Phipps:\n\n       White House Activities: In order to reach our very \n     aggressive goal of $40 million this year, it would be very \n     helpful if we could coordinate the following activities \n     between the White House and Democratic National Committee: 1. \n     Two reserved seats on Air Force\n\n[[Page S10062]]\n\n     One; and, 2. Six seats at all White House private dinners.\n\n  No. 4: ``Invitations to participate in official delegation trips \nabroad. Contact: Alexis Herman.''\n  Mr. President, that is wrong. We know that is wrong. And the people \nwho did it knew that it was wrong at the time. That is not an \nappropriate use of official trade missions.\n  This gives rise to all the speculation and allegations concerning the \ntransfer of technology to China. It makes it much more logical or \nbelievable when you read about these kinds of things.\n  Mr. President, I know this legislation is not perfect. I know that if \ngiven the opportunity to offer amendments, many Members would do \nexactly that, and the measure could be improved.\n  For example, I think there would be a majority vote in this body that \nwould raise the individual spending limits to the level of $1,000, \nwhich it was in 1974, that some here may not agree with. But I believe \nthe majority would.\n  I believe that the Snowe-Jeffords amendment went a long way towards \nleveling the playing field as far as unions, businesses, and \ncorporations are concerned. I know that there are other ways we could \nimprove this legislation. I know that we can do that if my colleagues \nwould vote for cloture.\n  I appeal to my colleagues to muster the courage that led to reform in \n1908, 1947, and 1974.\n  Mr. President, I ran for public office first in 1982. It was not the \nkind of money in that campaign that I see today. When I meet a young \nman or woman who is interested in public office nowadays--I used to ask \nthem, ``How do you feel about smaller government, taxes, less \nregulation?'' We would have discussions of the issues. Now there is \nonly one question you ask a young man or woman who is interested in \nseeking public office. And I might add it seems to be fewer and fewer. \nThe only question is, ``Where is the money? Where is the money?'' \nBecause, if they don't have the money, obviously no matter how they \nstand on the issues, no matter how principled they are, and how \nimpressive their resume might be, their chances of achieving public \noffice are dramatically diminished.\n  I know that many on this side of the aisle don't agree with all of \nthe provisions of the amendment. I know they recognize that there is a \nproblem--a problem that we have to address.\n  This is our opportunity, and if we opt to gridlock over results, we \nwill only fuel the cynicism of the American electorate.\n  I want to point out again, every political expert is predicting that \nwe will have the lowest voter turnout in this upcoming election than at \nany time in history. I think that is a sad commentary.\n  I hope we will do what is right to take such steps as necessary to \npass meaningful campaign finance reform. Should we fail, we will have \nonly ourselves to blame for the low esteem in which we are held by the \nAmerican people. We will have done our part to degrade the high office \nto which we have been elected. We will by our inaction contribute to \nthe alienation of the American people from the people who have sworn an \noath to defend their interests.\n  As I mentioned, Mr. President, yesterday was primary day in Arizona. \nTurn out was an all-time low, indicating another record-setting low \nturnout election day. I have no doubt whatsoever that the way in which \nwe finance our campaigns has in no small measure contributed to the \nabysmal commentary of the health of our democracy. The people's \ncontempt--there is no more charitable way to describe it--for us and \nfor the way in which we attain our privileged place in government \ncannot be sustained perpetually. We will someday pay a high price for \nour inattention to this problem. We will forfeit our ability to lead \nthe country as we meet the complicated challenges confronting us at the \nend of this century because we have so badly squandered the public \nrespect necessary to persuade the Nation to take the often difficult \nactions that are required to defend the Nation's interests.\n  Our ability to lead depends solely on the public's trust in us. Mr. \nPresident, people do not trust us today. And that breach, that \ncalamity, is what the supporters of campaign finance reform intend to \nrepair. I beg all of my colleagues to join in this effort and give our \nconstituents a reason to again trust us, and to take pride in the \ninstitution we are so proud to serve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, some in the press have suggested there \nis a sense of momentum for this issue because it passed the House of \nRepresentatives. I would remind my colleagues that a measure similar to \nthis passed the House in the 101st Congress, the 102d Congress, and the \n103d Congress. So it is not unusual, I would say, for the House of \nRepresentatives to pass this kind of legislation. It has happened \nbefore, and I would say it does not reveal any sense of momentum behind \na plan that is constitutionally flawed. Speaking of the Constitution, \nwe were on this same issue last fall and then we were on it again in \nFebruary. The outcome was the same during those debates, and in a sense \nwhat we are doing is having the same debate once again.\n  There have been suggestions, particularly on the other side, that the \ncourts might be open to changing the Buckley case or revisiting it in \nsome way. So I think it is always appropriate, when we have these \nperiodic campaign finance debates, to bring my colleagues up to date on \nwhat has been happening in the courts. As we all know, the so-called \nreformers have been out around the country seeking to get new laws on \nthe books at various States and localities, some by referendum, some by \nState statute. All of those, of course, are subsequently found in the \ncourts, in litigation. So what I would like to do here at the outset is \ngive my colleagues an update on what is happening in the courts; all of \nthese court cases, by the way, reaffirming Buckley in one way or \nanother.\n  I would remind everyone--I think everyone in this Chamber surely \nknows the Buckley case, Buckley v. Valeo, the landmark case in the area \nof campaign finance reform which has not been changed by any of the \ncourts over the last almost 25 years. In fact, court decisions have \ndeepened and broadened areas of permissible political speech over the \nquarter of a century since this landmark case, widely thought to have \nbeen written by Justice Brennan. So let me just run down a few cases \nthat have been decided just since April of this year, since there is a \ngood deal of litigation emanating from these State efforts to restrict \nthe rights of people to be involved in political activity.\n  On April 17, in Americans for Medical Rights v. Heller, the United \nStates District Court for the District of Nevada held that the Nevada \nState Constitution could not be enforced so as to prevent issue \nadvocacy groups from contributing more than $5,000 to a ballot \ninitiative. This was a court response to an effort to try to shut up \ngroups in criticizing politicians--very similar to the measure \ncurrently before us which seeks to make it essentially impossible for a \ngroup to criticize a politician in proximity to an election.\n  On April 27, in Kruse v. Cincinnati, the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Sixth Circuit held that a Cincinnati ordinance placing \nspending caps on campaigns for city council violated the first \namendment. This case is noteworthy. Here was a conscious effort on the \npart of the city council in Cincinnati to get a court, some court, to \nrevisit the question of whether spending limits were permissible. This \nis something the Buckley case struck down forthwith, and forthrightly. \nThat effort to get the court to reverse its decision was unsuccessful.\n  On April 29, in North Carolina Right to Life v. Bartlett, the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina held a State \nstatute that attempted to regulate issue advocacy groups as \nunconstitutional. That is the same issue we have before us in the \nMcCain-Feingold amendment, the effort by the Government to try to \nregulate constitutionally protected issue advocacy.\n  On June 1, in FEC v. Akins, the Supreme Court held that voters have \nstanding to challenge the FEC's dismissal of an administrative \ncomplaint. Although the Court remanded the case for further \nproceedings, the Court strongly suggested that a membership \norganization's communications with\n\n[[Page S10063]]\n\nits own members would not meet the definition of ``expenditures'' \nsubject to regulation by Congress.\n  In another case, on June 1, in Right to Life of Dutchess County v. \nFEC, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York \njoined a chorus of many other Federal groups in striking down--striking \ndown--an FEC regulation that prohibited corporate speech, even though \nthat speech stopped short of the ``express advocacy'' standard adopted \nin the Buckley case.\n  Then on June 4, in Russell v. Burris, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Eighth Circuit held that contribution limits of $300 to certain \nState candidates violated the first amendment and that special \nprivileges to so-called ``small donor'' PACs violated the equal \nprotection clause.\n  On June 11, in State of Washington v. 119 Vote No!, the Supreme Court \nof Washington held that a State statute which prohibits a person from \nsponsoring, with actual malice, a political advertisement containing a \nfalse statement of material fact to be facially unconstitutional.\n  On July 21, in Virginia Society for Human Life v. Caldwell, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit held that a Virginia campaign \nfinance statute could not reach the conduct of groups that engaged in \nissue advocacy.\n  On July 23, in Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Adams, the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that a first amendment \nchallenge of a State statute limiting campaign contributions was so \nlikely to succeed that a preliminary injunction should issue preventing \nMissouri from enforcing the statute.\n  On July 23, in Suster v. Marshall, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSixth Circuit enjoined the enforcement of a provision of the Ohio Code \nof Judicial Conduct which capped spending in a judicial election for \nthe Ohio Common Pleas Court at $75,000--again, a court decision \nstriking down spending limits.\n  On August 10, in Alaska Civil Liberties Union v. the State of Alaska, \nthe Superior Court for the State of Alaska granted summary judgment, \nruling Alaska's campaign finance reform legislation unconstitutional \nand, therefore, null and void.\n  Finally, on August 11, in Vannatta v. Keisling, the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit held that an Oregon ballot measure passed \ninto law which prohibited State candidates from using or directing any \ncontributions from out-of-district residents and penalizing candidates \nwhen more than 10 percent of their total funding comes from such \nindividuals does not survive scrutiny under the first amendment.\n  My reason for the recitation of these cases is these are cases just \nsince April, and every single one of them, at least three of which are \nright on the point of issue advocacy, which is what we have before us \ntoday, have ruled these government restrictions unconstitutional.\n  So there is virtually no chance--no chance--that the restrictions on \ncitizens' ability to engage in issue advocacy contained in McCain-\nFeingold will be upheld as constitutional. There is certainly no \nevidence that the courts are moving in the direction of allowing \ngovernments at any level to restrain the voices of citizens at any time \nin proximity to an election or any other time.\n  Mr. President, issue advocacy is, of course, as I said, \nconstitutionally protected speech. The New York Times, the Washington \nPost, and USA Today are some of the most aggressive users of issue \nadvocacy. These multimillion-dollar corporations express themselves \nwithout limitation at any point, both in the news sections and on the \neditorial pages. They are the practitioners of the first amendment.\n  The problem with the New York Times, the Washington Post, and USA \nToday is that they think the first amendment only applies to them. It \nis amusing to look at the amount of space dedicated over the last 2 \nyears by these three newspapers to their efforts to aid and abet those \nwho would shut up citizens and make it difficult for them to exercise \ntheir constitutional rights.\n  Just looking at the New York Times, they have editorialized on the \nsubject of campaign finance reform between July 1, 1997, and September \n9, 1998, 82 times. The average number of days between campaign finance \neditorials in the New York Times is 8. On the average, every 8 days, \nthe New York Times is lobbying for campaign finance reform, which they \nhave a constitutional right to do. What is particularly amusing is the \nway in which they do it, which is remarkably similar to issue advocacy \nthat groups engage in frequently on television.\n\n  The typical issue ad says at the end of the ad, ``Call Congressman'' \nso-and-so ``and tell him to either keep on doing what he is doing'' or \n``stop doing what he is doing.'' I thought it was particularly amusing \nthat the April 21, 1998, editorial in the New York Times was just like \nissue advocacy. The same opportunity they would deny to anyone else, \nthey engaged in themselves.\n  They opined here about the importance of passing their version of \ncampaign finance reform and then listed Members of the House and their \nphone numbers--exactly the kind of thing they don't want anybody else \nto do. Exactly the kind of thing they would prohibit every other \nAmerican citizen from doing in proximity to an election, they are doing \nright here on the editorial page.\n  Of course, the newspapers are exempt from the Federal Election \nCampaign Act. I think they should be exempt, but I find it disingenuous \nin the extreme for them to engage in the very same practice. This is a \nhuge, multi-, probably billion-dollar, American corporation, a \ncorporation engaging in issue advocacy, putting the heat on elected \nofficials, putting their phone numbers in there, saying call them--call \nthem up and tell them to do this or not to do that. That is what they \ndon't want anybody else in America to be able to do.\n  Mr. President, part of what is at the root of this debate is: Who is \ngoing to have the opportunity to express themselves, who is going to be \nable to engage in political discourse, in this country? Just newspapers \nand nobody else? Boy, that would be a good deal for them. That is \nexactly what they have in mind, because they practice issue advocacy \nevery day, and sometimes it is remarkably similar to the issue ads you \nsee on television run by organized labor, or plaintiffs' lawyers, or \nyou name it. ``Call Congressman'' so-and-so, ``and tell him to do'' \nthis or do that, it said in the New York Times of April 21.\n  The Washington Post has been not far behind, another megacorporation \nwhich exists for the purpose of influencing political discourse in this \ncountry. This big corporation, of course, like the other big \ncorporation I just mentioned, the New York Times, is exempt from the \nFederal Election Campaign Act, and this big corporation, too, would \nlike to restrict the speech of other American citizens in order to \nenhance its own views.\n  On the subject of campaign finance reform, going back to January 1, \n1997, the Washington Post has written 53 editorials. The average number \nof days between editorials on campaign finance reform in the Washington \nPost is 12. So, Mr. President, every 12 days, this great, huge American \ncorporation is lobbying the Congress to take a particular position on \ncampaign finance reform.\n  I defend their right to do it, but I find it amusing--if not really \ntroubling more than amusing--that this kind of corporation should have \nthis kind of influence and everybody else in society in proximity to an \nelection would be essentially muffled from being able to mention a \ncandidate's name in proximity to an election.\n  So some big corporations would have an advantage; others a \ndisadvantage. That is what the Washington Post would like--more power \nand more advantage. USA Today, another huge American corporation--\nbetween January 1, 1997, and today, USA Today has run 25 editorials on \nthe subject of campaign finance reform. That is an average of one every \n25 days--another major American corporation seeking to influence the \ncourse of this legislation, which also supports McCain-Feingold, which \nwould make it impossible for anybody else to do the same thing in \nproximity to an election.\n  The USA Today editorial just yesterday was remarkably akin to an \nissue ad, Mr. President, remarkably akin to an issue ad, just like the \nNew York Times editorial back in April I mentioned awhile ago. They \nstate their case on the editorial page, and then they list all the \nRepublican Senators, and particularly they highlight those\n\n[[Page S10064]]\n\nwho are up for reelection this year. And they put their phone numbers \nby their names. Issue advocacy, Mr. President; within 60 days of an \nelection.\n  Under the bill they support, over at USA Today, nobody else in \nAmerica could do this, could mention a candidate's name within 60 days \nof an election. So this big corporation would have its power further \nenhanced by the quieting of the voices of everybody else in America who \nsought to express themselves within 60 days of an election by maybe \nsaying something unkind about some Member of Congress.\n  So, Mr. President, there isn't any question; there is an enormous \ntransfer of influence and power to the part of corporate America that \nowns and operates newspapers. Of course they are enthusiastic about \nthis kind of legislation. This industry, the newspaper industry, which \nalready has an enormous amount of power, would be dramatically more \npowerful if the kind of legislation we have before us were passed.\n  Some would argue there is a media loophole in the Federal Election \nCampaign Act because they are exempt from all of these restrictions \nthat currently apply to everybody else, and certainly would be exempt \nof the greater restrictions that this legislation seeks to place on \nAmericans of all kinds.\n  Mr. President, there are some Americans who believe that newspapers \nare a bigger problem, a bigger problem than campaign contributors. \nThere was an interesting article back on October 21, 1997--excuse me, \nMr. President, it is a Rasmussen poll, an interesting finding.\n\n       More than 80% of Americans would like to place restrictions \n     on the way that newspapers cover political campaigns. In \n     fact, restricting newspaper coverage is far more popular than \n     public funding of campaigns.\n\n  Restrictions on newspaper coverage is far more popular than public \nfunding of campaigns. This is the American people in a poll in late \n1997 discussing the influence of newspapers on the political process.\n  Further, in the description of the poll finding, it says:\n\n       One reason for the public desire to restrict newspapers is \n     that Americans think reporters and editorial writers have a \n     bigger impact on elections than campaign contributions.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Not at the moment.\n\n       The Rasmussen Research survey found that 68% of Americans \n     believe newspaper editorials are more important than a $1,000 \n     contribution. Only 17% think such contributions have a bigger \n     impact.\n       Americans may also support restrictions on reporters \n     because more than seven-out-of-ten believe personal \n     preferences of reporters influence their coverage of \n     politics. In fact, Americans overwhelmingly believe (by a 61% \n     to 19% margin) that a candidate preferred by reporters will \n     beat a candidate who raises more money.\n\n  Let me repeat that, Mr. President. This comprehensive poll of \nAmerican citizens on the influence of newspapers, in late 1997, found \nthat Americans, by a margin of 61 percent to 19 percent, believe that a \ncandidate preferred by reporters will beat a candidate who raises more \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, I am making these points somewhat tongue in cheek \nbecause, obviously, I am not advocating restrictions on newspapers. But \nwhat I find particularly outrageous is newspapers advocating \nrestrictions on everyone else. Who are they to think that they are the \nonly ones who are to have influence in the American political process?\n  Richard Harwood of the Washington Post, on October 15, 1997, made \nsome interesting points along those lines. Mr. Harwood said:\n\n       It is fortunate for the press in the United States that the \n     voice of the people is not the voice of God or the Supreme \n     Court.\n       That is because Americans, in the mass, believe in ``free \n     speech'' and a ``free press'' only in theory. In practice \n     they reject those concepts.\n       That was the troubling conclusion drawn, ironically, from a \n     major study of public opinion commissioned in 1990 by \n     the American Society of Newspaper Editors as part of the \n     observance of the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights. \n     . . .\n\n  .So this was a survey taken, I guess, by the Louis Harris \norganization for the Center for Media and Public Affairs. And Mr. \nHarwood points out the findings are, as he puts it, ``depressing.''\n  The first point in this survey of the American people, Harwood, in \ntalking about the American people, said:\n\n       If they had their way, ``the people''--meaning a majority \n     of adults--would not allow journalists to practice their \n     trade without first obtaining, as lawyers and doctors must, a \n     license.\n\n  The second finding of this survey:\n\n       [The people] would confer on judges the power to impose \n     fines on publishers and broadcasters for ``inaccurate and \n     biased reporting''. . . .\n\n  Third:\n\n       They would empower government entities to monitor the work \n     of journalists for fairness and compel us to ``give equal \n     coverage to all sides of a controversial issue.'' They also \n     favor the creation of local and national news councils to \n     investigate complaints against the press and issue \n     ``corrections'' of erroneous news reports.\n\n  Harwood further points out, at the end of his article:\n\n       So press freedoms remain, as in the past, dependent not on \n     the goodwill of the masses but on the goodwill and \n     philosophical disposition of the nine men and women of the \n     Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n  Mr. President, I make those points to illustrate that the principal \nbeneficiaries of the amendment before us are the huge corporations of \nAmerica that control the press. They almost uniformly support \nlegislation that would quiet the voices, at least in 60 days' proximity \nto an election, of all other American citizens, thereby enhancing the \nability of newspapers to control the outcome of American elections.\n  The good news, Mr. President, is we are not going to pass this \nlegislation. The further good news is the courts would not uphold this \nlegislation if we did pass it. I just mentioned three cases that have \nbeen handed down in the last 6 months indicating that Government \nrestrictions on issue advocacy, tried by State governments, is clearly \nunconstitutional.\n  But what is truly disturbing in this free country, Mr. President, is \nthat these big corporations that own these newspapers are so \naggressively advocating efforts to quiet the voices of other American \ncitizens.\n  It is truly alarming that in 1998 these big corporations, which \nalready have enormous influence in our country, want to have even more. \nIn fact, they want to have a monopoly on influence in proximity to an \nelection. And as we all know, they are perfectly free to do editorials, \nboth on the front page and on the editorial page--and do--up to and \nincluding the day before the election. And I defend their right to do \nit.\n  But what is disturbing is they do not want to let anybody else have \ntheir say. So this legislation, Mr. President, dramatically benefits \nthe fourth estate at the expense of other citizens in our country.\n  Now, finally, before going to Senator Byrd, I have heard it said that \nwe need to pass this kind of legislation. I have heard for over a \ndecade we need to pass this kind of legislation in order to restore the \nfaith of the American people in the Congress. In October of 1994, in \nthe waning days of the end of Democrat control of this Congress, only \n27 percent of the American people approved of the Congress. As of this \npast week, the congressional approval rating was 55 percent. Now, the \n55 percent approval rating Congress has today comes after two Federal \nelections, 1994 and 1996, with record spending, three intervening \nfilibusters of McCain-Feingold and its ancestor, Boren-Mitchell, and \neven the Clinton-Gore fundraising scandal.\n  Clearly, Mr. President, there is no political imperative to pass \ncampaign finance bills that are unconstitutional. To suggest that the \nCongress is still unpopular--which it isn't--or that when it was \nunpopular it was somehow related to this issue simply cannot be \nsupported by the facts.\n  Bill Schneider, a reputable pollster who works for CNN, back in \nFebruary of this year had an interesting article in the National \nJournal. This was when the approval rating of Congress began to turn \naround. He pointed out in February 14 of this year:\n\n       For the first time in at least 25 years, a majority of \n     Americans approve of the way Congress is doing its job. \n     Congress--perhaps the most ridiculed institution in America \n     --has rarely gotten above a 40 per cent job-approval rating \n     since 1974. Now, it's at 56 per cent.\n\n  That was then; it is 55 percent now.\n  ``What's going on here?'' said Bill Schneider.\n\n       A balanced budget, a booming economy and--not the least \n     important--a smaller government. ``We have the smallest \n     government\n\n[[Page S10065]]\n\n     in 35 years, but a more progressive one,'' the President \n     said. Right now, trust in government is at its highest level \n     since the Reagan era, when it was ``morning in America.''\n\n  Now, we clearly do not need to pass this unconstitutional legislation \nin order to deal with cynicism about the Congress, which enjoys a 55 \npercent approval rating.\n  I might say that at the end of the Congress in 1994, I was personally \ninvolved in an all-night filibuster on September 30, 1994. I will never \nforget it. It is the only real filibuster we have had here in 10 years. \nIt was an all-nighter. The cots were out. People were blurry eyed. But \nit was a remarkably uplifting event for those of us who were involved \nin it. We defeated Boren-Mitchell a mere 5 weeks before the greatest \nRepublican congressional victory of this century.\n  Suffice it to say, there is no connection between this issue and \nelectoral success. The responses you get on polls on this issue depend \non how you ask the question. This is an arcane, complicated subject, \nand it is the obligation and the responsibility of Members of the \nSenate to protect the Constitution, to protect political discourse in \nthis country, and to do the right thing one more time.\n  Mr. President, I am confident that, at the appropriate time, this \namendment will be defeated.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Yes, I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wonder if I might get consent to speak on \nanother matter at the conclusion of the Senator's remarks?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Reserving the right to object, I wonder if the Senator \nhas any notion about approximately how much time he would consume?\n  Mr. BYRD. I guess it would be 45 minutes to an hour. It would give \nSenators a chance to get lunch.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would say \nin all due respect to the most respected Senator from West Virginia, we \nhave a limited amount of time to debate this issue. There are Senators \nwho want to talk on it. I say in all respect to the Senator from West \nVirginia, we have just begun this debate. We just had the first opening \nstatements. If we interrupt for 45 minutes to an hour, I think that \nwould certainly disrupt this entire debate, which is of the greatest \nimportance. I hope the Senator from West Virginia, in all great \nrespect, would understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do understand that. I have to be somewhere else from 1:30 \non, for awhile. I had hoped that I might be able to speak out of order \nearlier.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me indicate, if I may, I will not \nobject to this Senator's request. But let me say that after this \naddress I do intend to object to any other discussions about other \nmatters that do not have to do with the issue before us, before the \nscheduled cloture vote. But in this instance I will not object.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I hope \nthat other Senators would permit me to proceed.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, could the Senator at least wait until \n12:30, if he has to be someplace at 1:30? We just began. There have \nbeen two statements that have been given on this very important issue. \nI understand and appreciate the seniority and respect and dignity that \nthe Senator from West Virginia has, but this is incredibly disruptive, \nwhich I am sure the Senator from West Virginia can understand.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, will the distinguished Senator yield so I \nmight reply?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I hope the Senator will remember that debate \non the Interior bill is being interrupted here. I have no objection to \nthat. And there was a request that there be no amendments until, I \nbelieve it was Friday or Thursday, at some point, or until we vote on \ncloture on this matter. I had no objection to that. But I could have \nobjected. That debate was interrupted. I don't interrupt in debates \nvery often. I hope the Senator will allow me to proceed in this \ninstance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object because of the Senator from West Virginia, but the fact is \nwe are debating an amendment just as we normally do. And we are under a \nunanimous consent agreement, which we normally do. The Senator from \nWest Virginia could object to us going into session--we all know that--\nbecause we function by unanimous consent. I think it is very \nunfortunate that when we have, really, now, a day and a half, and we \njust initiated debate on this very, very critical issue, the Senator \nhas to do that at this time. I will not object.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the Senator from Kentucky will yield, I make the request \nI be recognized, upon the conclusion of the remarks by the Senator from \nKentucky, for not to exceed 1 hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCONNELL.  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to make brief \nremarks before the Senator from West Virginia begins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I repeatedly asked the Senator from \nKentucky if he would yield for a question about his statements about \nthe case law, and he refused on several occasions. That is regrettable \nbecause I hope we will have a debate here, but I do appreciate his \nreview of the case law. I think it is helpful, and I do want to hear \nSenator Byrd's remarks very shortly.\n  Let me quickly point out that I heard the Senator from Kentucky \ndiscussing a Nevada case regarding restriction on spending on issue \nadvocacy. But the bill before the Senate has no such restriction. So \nthat case is not applicable to what is before the Senate.\n  The Senator referred to the Cincinnati spending limits case. The \nproblem is, our bill before the Senate does not have any spending \nlimits in it.\n  The Senator is arguing case law that has absolutely nothing to do \nwith what we are debating here today. I think that is regrettable \nbecause this is supposed to be a debate about the amendment before the \nSenate.\n  The Senator discussed a case involving in-state contributions. But \nthere are no in-state limits included in this bill. And the same for \nthe California case involving small donor----\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I will yield for a question, yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Kentucky--if the Senator from \nWisconsin was closely listening--didn't claim the cases were about \nissue advocacy. What the Senator from Kentucky said is that all the \ncases were further reinforcement of the Buckley decision and that \nseveral of the cases were about issue advocacy.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. None of the provisions that were specifically cited \nwith regard to those cases has anything to do with the legislation \nbefore us. I will make the point now and continue to make the point \nthroughout this debate that when case law is cited, it ought to have \nsomething to do with the matter before the Senate, or that clouds the \nissue of constitutionality in a way that is a disservice. If the \nSenator from Kentucky is going to make his arguments based on court \ncases, he should at least recognize and acknowledge that this version \nof the bill does not include many of the red herrings that he keeps \npresenting before the Senate. As we say in the law, these cases are \nreadily distinguishable from the matter before us.\n  With that, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add as \ncosponsors to the McCain-Feingold amendment, in addition to Senators \nThompson, Snowe, Collins, and Jeffords, Senators Levin, Glenn, \nLieberman, and Wellstone, who are long-time and vigorous supporters of \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page S10066]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I very much look forward to the remarks \nof the Senator from West Virginia and appreciate his courtesy in \nallowing me to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWest Virginia is recognized for up to 60 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator, and I \nthank, again, all Senators for allowing me to speak at this particular \njuncture.\n  (By unanimous consent, the remarks of Mr. Byrd, Mr. Gramm, Mr. \nFeingold pertaining to another subject are printed later in today's \nRecord.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the McCain-Feingold bill was first \nintroduced in the fall of 1995, just about 3 years ago. To date, thanks \nto the truly extraordinary efforts of our colleagues in the other \nHouse, we are as close as we have ever been to passing that bill and \nmaking a start on cleaning up the corrupt campaign finance system that \nhas seemed so intractable for so long. As we stand here today, only \neight votes stand between this bill and the President's desk--just \neight votes. Only eight Senators out of all Members of the Congress are \npreventing this body from joining the other body in passing campaign \nfinance reform. Eight Senators are blocking the Senate from banning \nsoft money.\n  Mr. President, the time for excuses is over. It is time to finish the \njob. It is time to pass campaign finance reform and send it on to the \nPresident.\n  Let me first take a moment to remind my colleagues of what happened \nin the other body the week after we in the Senate left for the August \nrecess. This campaign finance reform bill that all the pundits thought \nwas dead and constantly claimed as dead actually passed the other body \nby a very strong vote. The vote was 252 to 179. That is right, Mr. \nPresident, 252 to 179 in the House. It wasn't even close. By any \nmeasure, the passage in the House of the Shays-Meehan version of the \nMcCain-Feingold bill was a landslide. Sixty-one Republicans, over one-\nquarter of the Republican caucus in the entire House, voted for this \nbill. Mr. President, I think that should answer once and for all the \nallegation that the McCain-Feingold bill is a partisan piece of \nlegislation. It is not.\n  Sixty-one Republicans would not vote for a bill that is a Trojan \nhorse for the Democratic Party. No, this bill has now been shown in \nboth Houses to be a bipartisan solution to a bipartisan problem.\n  The House vote was the culmination of literally months of debate on \ncampaign finance reform. The debate actually started, if you can \nbelieve this, on May 21 and did not conclude until August 6. There were \n72 amendments offered to the House version of the Shays-Meehan bill. \nThere were a total of 41 rollcall votes on those amendments. The House \nspent over 50 hours debating campaign finance reform, an amount of time \nthat is almost unprecedented to spend on one bill over there. I think \nwe do it fairly frequently here, but it is almost unprecedented in the \nHouse.\n  The opponents of reform tried to take a page from the Senate playbook \nand openly proclaimed that they were going to try to kill the bill with \namendments. Just like here, they offered poison pills and they tried to \noverwhelm the reformers with just the sheer number of amendments. They \ntried to drown them in amendments, but they failed, and they failed \nmiserably.\n  In the end, a reform bill emerged and passed the House that retained \nall of the essential features of the McCain-Feingold bill--a ban on \nsoft money, improved disclosure of campaign contributions, codification \nof the Supreme Court Beck decision, and provisions designed to deal \nwith campaign advertising that is dressed up as issue advertising.\n  After many months of debate in the House, the bill has come back to \nthe Senate. It is now on the calendar and is awaiting action.\n  The majority leader objected to bringing up the House-passed version \nof McCain-Feingold, but, fortunately, that was not the end of the \nmatter. Because we have the right as Senators to offer amendments to \npending legislation, we were able to bring it up on this bill, and that \nis exactly what Senator McCain and I have done. We would have been \ndelighted if the majority leader had agreed to bring up the House-\npassed version of the bill, and some comments that he made on ``Meet \nthe Press'' this weekend suggested that he was going to do just that. \nBut by offering our amendment, we will assure that the Senate will \nagain vote on this issue, which is what the people of this country \nwant.\n  Once again, I want to say that I am very proud of the solid, 100-\npercent support of the Democratic Senators for this bill. I am grateful \nfor the efforts of the minority leader, Senator Daschle, to keep this \nissue on the agenda and line up our caucus in support of the McCain-\nFeingold bill.\n  But we are not doing this for partisan reasons. We are doing this \nbecause it is the right thing to do for our country. This campaign \nfinance system is sapping the confidence of the American people in \ntheir Government. People have seen time and time again that these huge \nsoft money contributions do influence the congressional agenda. They \nunderstand that we cannot act in the interest of average people if we \nare spending too much time trying to woo the big contributors. They \nknow that soft money must be eliminated before it just totally swamps \nour elections and our legislature.\n  It is absolutely critical that we finish the job now; that we finish \nthe job now before the end of this Congress, otherwise, we will \nundoubtedly see an explosion of soft money fundraising as the parties \nget ready for the next big show, and that is the next Presidential \nelection in the year 2000.\n  If we go home and allow this soft money system to continue into the \nnext Presidential election cycle, we will reap scandals that will make \nthe scandals of 1996 look pale by comparison.\n  Look at what has happened in this cycle already will give you a clue \nas to what is going to happen. Already in this cycle, according to \nCommon Cause, the parties have raised a total of $116 million, and that \nis the most ever in a non-Presidential cycle. Soft money fundraising \nmore than tripled from 1992 to 1996--from an already troubling amount \nof $86 million to the now staggering amount of $262 million. Based on \nthat growth, some estimate that the parties could raise $600 million in \nsoft money in the year 2000 cycle--$600 million. Over half a billion \ndollars in soft money is likely to be the consequence and the \ndisgusting display in the year 2000.\n  Mr. President, we already have a majority in this body, and with just \neight more votes in the Senate we can stop this escalation of soft \nmoney. We can say to the political parties, Enough is enough. Go back \nto raising money under the limits established in the Federal Election \nCampaign Act. And then if somebody says, ``Well, we need more money,'' \nthen start raising money from more people; get more people involved. \nDon't just extort more and more money from the major corporations and \nlabor unions that are eager to curry favor with the Congress or the \nPresident.\n  Mr. President, the American people are sick of tales of big money \nfundraisers. It is a terrible turnoff for a citizen of average means to \nread that people give $100,000, or $250,000 to sit at the head table \nwith the President, or have a special meeting with the majority leader \nof the U.S. Senate. They do not want more stories like the story of \nRoger Tamraz who gave $300,000 to the Democratic National Committee \nhoping for the special access he needed to promote his pipeline \nproject. Tamraz told the Governmental Affairs Committee that as he \nthought about it, the next time he would give $600,000 if he thought \nthis would help his business and that getting special access was not \njust one of the reasons he gave to the DNC, he said it was the only \nreason he gave the $300,000 and would give $600,000--for special \naccess.\n  But these kinds of scandals are bound to come back again and again \nbecause our political parties, Mr. President, are addicted to soft \nmoney. They cannot get enough of it. And the reason is that they have \nfound a way to make soft money work directly for them in Federal \nelections. This is an incredible\n\n[[Page S10067]]\n\ntwist of a loophole that was established by the FEC in 1978. Remember \nthat prior to 1996, most of the parties' soft money went into what were \ncalled party building activities--get out the vote drives, voter \nregistration efforts, and the like.\n  But then in 1996, the parties discovered the issue ad, and it was off \nto the races. Both Presidential campaigns directly benefited from these \nkinds of ads--you know, the ones that do not explicitly say ``vote \nfor'' or ``vote against'' a candidate, but they are nonetheless \nobviously aimed at directly influencing an election, obviously \nintentionally intended to cause someone to vote specifically for one \ncandidate or another. And they used party soft money to pay for the \nads.\n  Now, here is an irony, Mr. President. Just yesterday, Attorney \nGeneral Reno announced yet another 90-day inquiry into the campaign \nfinance scandals of the 1996 campaign. It has to do with issue ads run \nby the DNC, a portion of which were paid for with soft money. The \nallegation is that it was improper for the President to have \nparticipated in the development of that ad campaign. The McCain-\nFeingold amendment that is before us makes it very clear that such ads \ncannot be paid for with soft money and cannot be coordinated by the \nparties with their candidates. Yet some of the very people who are \ncalling on the Attorney General to appoint this independent counsel are \nstaunchly opposed to this amendment anyway.\n  We also already have seen the parties and outside groups preparing to \nexploit the phony issue ad loophole in this election. Over the next \nmonth, more and more election ads will begin appearing around the \ncountry, but because of that loophole, in many cases there will be no \ndisclosure either of the spending itself or of the identity of the \ndonors who are really behind the ads. These issue ad campaigns, Mr. \nPresident, are blatantly targeted at specific elections, but again \ntheir creators intentionally avoid the elections law, but avoiding the \nso-called magic words of ``vote for'' or ``vote against.''\n  Here is an example. The Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call reported in \nJuly that the Republican Party is planning a $37 million issue advocacy \ncampaign to begin running after Labor Day designed to help Republicans \npick up seats in the House in November. Roll Call described the \ncampaign as follows:\n\n       Republican leaders are calling the plan ``Operation Break-\n     Out:'' a comprehensive strategy to blanket as many as 50 to \n     60 battleground districts with ``issue advocacy'' television \n     ads touting the GOP's success in balancing the budget, \n     cutting taxes and reforming welfare.\n\n  The story then states that Republican officials predict that if \nMembers help raise the $37 million, then the party will pick up as many \nas 25 additional seats. So they are candid. They are very upfront about \nthe fact that this issue ad campaign is designed specifically to help \nelect more Republicans to the House, not just to talk about issues.\n  So here you have the leaders of a national political party designing \na huge media plan specifically to elect candidates from that party, and \nspecifically planning to take advantage of the phony issue ad loophole \nso they can at least partially pay for the campaign with soft money.\n  This is what the twin loopholes--soft money and phony issue ads--have \nled us to. And, of course, Mr. President, neither party is exempt. I \nhave consistently maintained a bipartisan approach to this issue in my \nwork with the senior Senator from Arizona and in my other work on this \nissue. And I will do so today.\n  A Democratic Party source is quoted in that same Roll Call story as \nsaying that the Democratic Party is budgeting $6 million for issue ads \nand possibly a lot more. And, of course, the Republican Party justifies \nits plan as a preemptive strike against the labor unions that spent \nabout $25 million on issue ads in the 1996 elections.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the entire Roll Call \nstory be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Roll Call, July 23, 1998]\n\n   GOP Plans To ``Break Out'' in Fall Election, Leadership Wants $37 \n                        Million for Ad Campaign\n\n                           (By Jim VandeHei)\n\n       Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga) and top GOP leaders have \n     devised a $37 million ``issue advocacy'' media campaign and a \n     detailed communications plan to deliver poll-tested messages \n     to dozens of targeted Congressional districts in coming \n     months, according to internal documents and several \n     Republican sources familiar with the strategy.\n       The $37 million media campaign, the centerpiece of the \n     Republicans' strategy, will be launched around Labor Day in \n     an effort to preempt an anticipated ad blitz by the AFL-CIO \n     and to define the agenda heading into November. Republican \n     Members are expected to contribute or raise $15 million to \n     $20 million total for the project, including $8 million in \n     hard money in the next few weeks.\n       Republican leaders are calling the plan ``Operation Break-\n     out:'' a comprehensive strategy to blanket as many as 50 to \n     60 battleground districts with ``issue advocacy'' television \n     ads touting the GOP's success in balancing the budget, \n     cutting taxes and reforming welfare.\n       Gingrich and National Republican Congressional Committee \n     Chairman John Linder (Ga) predict that if Members help raise \n     the $37 million, the GOP will pick up as many as 25 \n     additional seats, according to GOP officials.\n       Operation Break-out, according to GOP leadership sources, \n     also includes a new communications regime and a legislative \n     agenda that caters specifically to the Republicans' financial \n     contributors off Capitol Hill. These contributors, once \n     placated, will be hit up during the August recess to help \n     bankroll the ad campaign.\n       While Gingrich insisted in an interview that a 40-seat gain \n     is possible, GOP strategists have determined that a net \n     pickup of 15 of 25 seats in ``eminently doable'' if Members \n     cough up millions of dollars for their colleagues before the \n     August break, according to a GOP leadership source close to \n     the effort.\n       Privately, top GOP leaders expect a net gain of five to ten \n     seats unless the Operation Break-out is implemented.\n       Gingrich and company rolled out the $37 million issue-\n     advocacy campaign to Members at a private meeting at the \n     Capitol Hill Club yesterday and plan to brief key Members and \n     staffers on the communications plan in coming weeks.\n       If Republican leaders can overcome internal opposition from \n     key Members--including Majority Whip Tom Delay (Texas) and \n     Conference Vice Chairwoman Jennifer Dunn (Wash)--the new \n     election plan will be the vehicle Gingrich and company hope \n     to ride to an expanded majority in November's elections, the \n     sources said.\n       ``I have always felt that we get weak-kneed in the spring \n     and worry we'll lose seats,'' said Appropriations Chairman \n     Bob Livingston (La), who has pledged $500,000 for the \n     project.\n       ``This is the best economy in 50 years, so it's the \n     incumbents' time. This (new strategy) will help expand (our \n     majority) even further.''\n       Democrats are not losing any sleep over the GOP's plan.\n       ``Republicans will spend more than us, but we will be \n     competitive in the area of issue advocacy,'' said Democratic \n     Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Dan Sallick, who \n     added that Democrats will budget more than $6 million for \n     issue advocacy and possibly ``substantially more.''\n       ``As 1996 showed, we do not have to spend more money to be \n     competitive''\n\n\n                         Shaking the Money Tree\n\n       As of today, there are roughly 170 Republican incumbents \n     who either have no opposition in November's election or token \n     opposition from an inadequately funded challenger who has \n     little chance of winning. Combined, these Members are sitting \n     on almost $60 million in campaign funds, according to GOP \n     strategists.\n       If Linder, Gingrich and the rest of the GOP leaders can pry \n     some portion of that money from these Republican incumbents, \n     they are confident that the NRCC can blanket as many as 60 \n     Congressional districts with issue-based ads between Labor \n     Day and Election Day.\n       ``We can sit back, do little on the House floor, get out of \n     here early and probably win five seats,'' said one GOP \n     operative. ``But if we can get Members and (outside groups) \n     to kick in $40 million more than we have budgeted, there's a \n     damn good chance we can expand our majority by 20 to 30 \n     seats.''\n       That's the message Gingrich and Linder delivered to \n     Republican Members at the closed-door meeting yesterday.\n       And they promised to lead by example.\n       Gingrich, Majority Leader Dick Armey (Texas), Livingston \n     and Rep. David Dreier (Calif) all pledged to kick in $500,000 \n     each. Linder promised $200,000 from his personal account and \n     Oversight Chairman Bill Thomas (Calif) pledged $100,000 and \n     will urge other chairmen to follow suit.\n       Deputy Majority Whip Dennis Hastert (Ill) stood up at \n     Wednesday's meeting and promised $150,000, and Reps. Tom \n     Davis (Va), Jim McCrery (La) and Larry Combest (Texas) vowed \n     to pump in $100,000 each. Even Rep. Chris Shays (Conn), a \n     moderate Republican who has worked closely with Democrats on \n     certain issues, pledged $50,000.\n       Top political strategists from the NRCC and certain \n     leadership offices are reviewing campaign data from every \n     Republican Member to determine how much money individual \n     Members can afford to ante up. While no\n\n[[Page S10068]]\n\n     specific targets have been spent, any Republican who is a \n     cinch to win this November will be expected to contribute \n     significantly to the effort.\n       ``Members will be leaned on to help the team,'' said one \n     leadership source.\n       Gingrich, Armey and Linder have formed a ``whip team'' of \n     about 20 Members who will make sure that Members and outside \n     groups are paying their fair share.\n       The whip team--which includes top GOP leaders and the \n     party's most aggressive money men, such as Reps. Mark Foley \n     (Fla) and Bill Paxon (NY)--will twist Members' arms for cash \n     and lobby wealthy business leaders for sizable contributions, \n     the sources said.\n       Their goal is to raise $8 million in hard money by August \n     to prove to business leaders that Republican leaders are dead \n     serious about expanding their majority. ``We know that \n     business leaders are investors. They put their money on the \n     party that will control this place. We want to show them that \n     investing in Democrats is not wise,'' said another GOP \n     leadership source.\n       By September, Gingrich and Linder predict that Members will \n     have kicked in at least $15 million to $20 million and that \n     corporate America and individual contributors will match that \n     amount.\n       The last thing they want, according to strategists, is a \n     repeat of the 1996 elections, when GOP Members sat $30 \n     million-plus and the business community failed to raise one-\n     quarter of what it promised for issue-advocacy ads.\n\n\n                           setting the agenda\n\n       A $35 million issues-based ad campaign financed by the AFL-\n     CIO is widely credited with helping Democrats chip away at \n     the Republicans' House majority in 1996.\n       AFL-CIO president John Sweeney picked about three dozen \n     competitive districts and flooded the airwaves with ads \n     hammering Republicans for gutting Medicare and blocking a \n     minimum wage. The ads, Gingrich and Linder believe, defined \n     the 1996 election before most candidates hit the campaign \n     trails and cost the Republicans nine House seats.\n       The NRCC fired back with a $20 million issue-ad campaign \n     and the pro-Republican Coalition dumped in $5 million more, \n     but it was too little, too late, Republicans say.\n       This year, GOP leaders plan to beat the AFL-CIO and the \n     Democrats' allies to the punch, Linder has told Members.\n       The reason for such an ambitious issue campaign, sources \n     said, was that internal polls found that the Republican \n     message on key issues like education and the budget were more \n     popular than expected in the most competitive districts.\n       Republican operatives picked the 28 most competitive \n     districts and tested the Republicans' positive message versus \n     the Democrats' positive message; on virtually every topic, \n     Republicans learned they could win a head-to-head debate, \n     sources said.\n       ``The bottom line is . . . we are going to be competitive \n     with labor . . . and we are going to have the debate on our \n     turf,'' said NRCC spokeswoman Mary Crawford. ``And with these \n     two goals in mind we will determine where we need to run \n     these spots and when.''\n\n\n                             the play book\n\n       In a recent interview, Gingrich admitted that \n     communications, internally and externally, has been a \n     disaster for Republicans at serveral points since winning the \n     majority in 1994.\n       The behind-the-scenes battle for control over \n     communications has soured Gingrich's relationship with \n     Conference Chairman John Boehner (Ohio) and has been a source \n     of friction during countless leadership meetings. As late as \n     a month or so ago, control over the message led to a nasty \n     fight between Boehner and Dunn, and their relationship \n     remains icy at best, according to several sources.\n       Congnizant that communications is the weakness, top \n     advisers for Gingrich, Armey and Boehner have spent the past \n     two months writing a Republican ``playbook,'' which will be \n     distributed to Members soon. The playbook, which provides \n     Members with the party line on a variety of topics, outlines \n     a unified message for the campaigning Republicans, according \n     to a draft copy of the document.\n       Top Republicans have also revamped the communications \n     structure to make sure the message is filtered down to rank-\n     and-file Members and broadcast outside to Republican \n     supporters and likely voters. Gingrich's office will schedule \n     Members for Sunday talk shows; Armey will control the message \n     on the floor; DeLay will use his whip team to distribute the \n     message du jour to Members; and Boehner will write the \n     overall communications message.\n       Armey's office is also responsible for making sure that \n     hard feelings between GOP leaders do not interfere with \n     disseminating the message. GOP leadership sources said that \n     will not be an easy task.\n       Already, there is concern among some GOP leaders that DeLay \n     and Dunn are spending too much time privately briefing \n     Members on a separate communications strategy that could \n     divert Members' attention away from the overall plan, \n     according to leadership sources. While most leaders are \n     confidant that that problem will be taken care of by week's \n     end, other sources said it shows that distrust and \n     competitiveness could hamper the leadership's campaign \n     problems.\n       But on Wednesday, DeLay spokesman John Feehery said: ``Mr. \n     DeLay supports what they are doing. I think he believes that \n     anything that helps him do his job, like getting more \n     Republicans, is something that should be done. A lot of our \n     concerns have been met.''\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. This arms race of soft money spending on issue ads has \nto stop. And the way to do that is to ban soft money and bring these \ntypes of ads within the election laws in a fair and reasonable way that \nrespects the constitutional rights of all citizens. That is what we \nhave done in the McCain-Feingold bill. Contrary to the completely \ninaccurate and sometimes dishonest advertisements that have been run \nacross the country saying that we use a different approach, we, in \nfact, maintain a clear respect for free speech, which both Senator \nMcCain and I strongly adhere to. We have addressed in our bill, which \nis in the form of the amendment before us today, the two biggest \nproblems in our campaign finance system--soft money and phony issue \nads.\n  Mr. President, if we do not act on this bill, the exploitation of the \nloopholes will continue to spiral out of control. In the year 2000, we \nwill see both Presidential candidates promising to limit their private \nfundraising in order to receive public funds while their parties pursue \nparallel or even intertwined campaigns with issue ads funded by as much \nas $600 million in soft money.\n  Is that the kind of campaign we want to see in the first Presidential \nelection of the next century? I do not think so. We need to make the \nnext campaign a cleaner, less corrupt, less out of control Presidential \ncampaign. We do not want more of the same of what we saw in 1996.\n  Mr. President, all across the country the American people are telling \nus that they do, in fact, overwhelmingly support the McCain-Feingold \nbill. Recent polls conducted in eight States during the month of August \nby the Mellman Group for the advocacy group Public Campaign showed that \nstrong majorities, ranging from 58 percent in Mississippi to 75 percent \nin New Hampshire, are in favor of the McCain-Feingold bill. And this \nsupport is constant --it is constant, Mr. President--across demographic \ngroups and across party lines. In fact, in seven of the eight States \npolled, believe it or not, Republican voters were more likely to \nsupport the bill than Democrat voters.\n  Editorial boards across the country are constantly calling on us to \nact. And it is not just the Washington Post and the New York Times, \nalthough they have been wonderful advocates for this much-needed \nchange; it is also the Hartford Courant, the Kansas City Star, the St. \nLouis Post-Dispatch, The Tennessean, and the Charleston Gazette.\n  The message from each of these editorial boards is that this body, \nthe Senate, has one last chance to salvage some semblance of respect on \nthe issue of campaign finance reform. After all the investigations, all \nthe allegations, and all the finger-pointing of the last 2 years, this \nis the chance to show that we care, that we think there is something \nwrong with such a corrupt system. This is the chance.\n  Now, these writers know that McCain-Feingold is not perfect, and I \nagree with that. But they think it will make a difference and that it \nshould be passed and that it should be sent to the President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent recent editorials from each of \nthe fine newspapers I just mentioned be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Hartford Courant, Sept. 4, 1998]\n\n                     Listen to the Public, Mr. Lott\n\n       After a monthlong summer recess, senators returned to \n     Washington this week to find a full agenda and only a short \n     time to work through it. High on the to-do list should be \n     campaign finance reform. But getting that legislation to the \n     floor for a vote will be a daunting struggle despite the fact \n     reform is favored by a majority of Americans.\n       Appalled by the fund-raising abuses in the 1996 elections, \n     the public wants change. Republican congressional leaders, \n     however, are comfortable with the status quo.\n       It would be a pity to let this opportunity to clean up the \n     political system pass by. Reformers must redouble their \n     efforts. Citizens who want the campaign finance cesspool \n     drained must let Congress know how they feel.\n       Before the August vacation, the House passed the Shays-\n     Meehan bill to eliminate soft money--the unrestricted, \n     unregulated\n\n[[Page S10069]]\n\n     contributions (in effect, payoffs) from corporations, unions \n     and wealthy individuals that are corrupting politics. House \n     reformers triumphed because there were enough Democratic \n     votes and enough courageous Republicans such as Rep. Chris \n     Shays of Stamford to win the day.\n       As considerable risk to themselves, Republican House \n     members bucked their party leadership's opposition to change.\n       The Senate version of the soft-money ban, called the \n     McCain-Feingold bill, was favored by a majority of the 100 \n     senators when the issue was taken up earlier this year. But \n     backers coundn't get the 60 votes needed to shut off a \n     filibuster mounted by Republican leaders.\n       Quashing a filibuster will again be difficult.\n       Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and other top Republicans \n     are ``dead set against reform,'' Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman of \n     Connecticut observed recently. ``They don't feel that they \n     will suffer any consequences if they don't bring it up. They \n     feel that people just don't care.''\n       That isn't what the polls say. But people have to act on \n     the disgust they feel toward a system under which politicians \n     become the wards of favor-seekers with lots of money. The \n     public should apply pressure on politicians who scoff at the \n     idea of cleaning up the system.\n       Connecticut's senators--Mr. Lieberman and Christopher J. \n     Dodd--long have favored change in the way campaigns are \n     financed. They should assume high-profile, leadership \n     positions in making the case for the Senate version of \n     reform. These two Democrats should use their powers of \n     persuasion to bring reluctant colleagues of both parties \n     aboard the reform cause.\n       As Mr. Shays and his Democratic partner, Martin Meehan of \n     Massachusetts, proved, the good fight can be won even against \n     long odds.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Kansas City Star, Sept. 3, 1998]\n\n                    Vote Needed on Campaign Finance\n\n       A showdown on campaign finance reform is shaping up in the \n     U.S. Senate. The test will be whether a minority of the \n     Republican-dominated body can continue to block action on \n     legislation that would outlaw the scandalous fund-raising and \n     spending that occurred in the 1996 elections.\n       The access and influence bought by moneyed interests are \n     contaminating our political system. Ordinary citizens are \n     increasingly locked out of the policy-making decisions on \n     Capitol Hill.\n       The fight in the Senate is over the McCain-Feingold bill, a \n     measure considered dead until recent weeks. Earlier this year \n     a bipartisan majority of the Senate voted for McCain-\n     Feingold, which is co-sponsored by Sens. John McCain, Arizona \n     Republican, and Russell Feingold, Wisconsin Democrat.\n       Despite that vote, a GOP-led filibuster prevented the \n     Senate from a final decision on the bill. Reformers, \n     including all Democrats and some Republicans, failed by eight \n     votes to get the 60 necessary to halt the filibuster. Thus a \n     minority of Republicans blocked a measure that would bring \n     genuine reform to the way campaigns are financed.\n       The issue was revived when the House passed a bill last \n     month similar to McCain-Feingold, setting the stage for new \n     action in the Senate.\n       Based on previous performance, no help is expected from \n     Missouri and Kansas senators. They seem satisfied with the \n     current arrangement.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill and the House-passed measure would \n     prohibit ``soft money,'' the funds that are contributed by \n     corporations, labor unions and wealthy individuals to the \n     political parties. Soft money funding, which is not limited \n     or regulated, is supposed to be used for party-building \n     activities, but not specific candidates. This rule was \n     largely ignored in 1996.\n       The majority votes for campaign finance reform in both \n     houses of Congress this year reflect broad support for \n     change. That sentiment disputes the contention of many \n     members of Congress that the public is not interested in the \n     issue. Opinion polls also show overwhelming public support \n     for reforms.\n       That is why the Senate Republican leadership is obligated \n     to allow a new vote on campaign finance reform before \n     adjournment.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Aug. 31, 1998]\n\n                           Do The Right Thing\n\n       If the two gentlemen running for the U.S. Senate would stop \n     kicking each other in the shins, each would see a monumental \n     opportunity to serve the public good while serving his own \n     political interest.\n       Attorney General Jay Nixon should sit down at the \n     negotiating table and not get up until he has a settlement in \n     the St. Louis school desegregation case. A settlement would \n     be good for the schoolchildren and would mend political \n     fences with African-Americans upset by Mr. Nixon's extreme \n     opposition to the desegregation program.\n       Meanwhile, Sen. Christopher S. Bond, R-Mo., should go back \n     to Washington this week where he holds a key vote for \n     campaign finance reform. Passage of the McCain-Feingold bill \n     would restore people's faith in the political process and \n     spotlight Mr. Bond's willingness to occasionally stand up to \n     misguided GOP leadership.\n\n\n                             Desegregation\n\n       The Missouri Legislature provided Mr. Nixon with the tools \n     to work out a settlement of the school desegregation case \n     with the NAACP, which represents African-American children. \n     The Legislature passed SB 781, which would provide $2 in new \n     state aid to the St. Louis schools for every additional $1 \n     raised locally in taxes. This would enable the city to fund \n     desegregation programs, like the magnet schools.\n       SB 781 also continued the transfer program under which \n     about 12,000 black children from the city attend suburban \n     schools.\n       In this way, SB 781 took away Mr. Nixon's main legal \n     arguments. Across many years and in many courts Mr. Nixon has \n     argued that the transfer program has never been legal and \n     that the state obligation to help fund desegregation programs \n     in St. Louis should end soon.\n       Legally disarmed, Mr. Nixon should be able to settle \n     pronto.\n       There have been recent rumblings that some suburban school \n     districts are  causing problems behind the scenes by making \n     unreasonable demands to get out of the transfer program. \n     Mr. Nixon should simply sidestep that sideshow and settle \n     the case with the NAACP. Those two sides should be able to \n     obtain a final judgment from the court.\n       Mr. Nixon has complained recently that his civil rights \n     record is actually better than Mr. Bond's. Yet some African-\n     American leaders seem to want to judge Mr. Nixon on his deeds \n     rather his words.\n       There is one way for the attorney general to counter: Do \n     something. Settle the case.\n\n\n                            campaign finance\n\n       Distressingly, Mr. Bond joined the GOP leadership to kill \n     the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill earlier this \n     session.\n       The bill had majority support, but needed eight more \n     Republican votes to escape a filibuster. At the time the bill \n     was killed in the Senate, it didn't look as though it would \n     pass in the House. But in Phoenix-like fashion, the House \n     version of the bill--Shays-Meehan--passed this summer.\n       Mr. Bond now has an opportunity to reconsider in light of \n     the changed circumstances. Mr. Nixon, who supports the bill, \n     should keep the heat on this issue.\n       When Mr. Bond helped kill the bill, he said he was acting \n     on First Amendment concerns. Although the free speech \n     questions are not frivolous, the bill appears to be \n     constitutional. The bill would ban ``soft'' money--the huge \n     gobs of dough that political parties raise for campaign \n     purposes from corporate and union treasuries, wealthy \n     individuals and foreign nationals.\n       Federal law now bars ``hard'' money contributions to \n     individual candidates from corporations, unions and foreign \n     citizens. Extending this ban to soft money simply recognizes \n     that soft money is used for electing candidates, too. There \n     should be no First Amendment problem.\n       The other main part of the bill regulates issue ads within \n     60 days of an election or when the ads are clearly intended \n     for campaign purposes. Politically active organizations--like \n     those for or against abortion rights--could not use \n     organization funds for these issue ads. They would have to \n     set up political action committees. That would require \n     disclosure of donors and $5,000 contribution limits. Issue \n     ads are clearly at the core of protected speech, but the \n     Supreme Court has given Congress latitude in regulating \n     speech when it is for campaign purposes.\n       Frankly, Mr. Bond, the First Amendment arguments do not \n     justify the GOP leadership's morally bankrupt position on \n     campaign finance. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott talks a \n     lot about President Bill Clinton's campaign abuses, but he \n     won't reform the system that allowed them.\n       The GOP claims that Mr. Clinton's abuses were illegal. But \n     most of those big $100,000 contributions were legal, soft \n     money contributions, obviously intended to buy access and \n     favorable consideration--and maybe a night between the sheets \n     in the Lincoln bedroom.\n       In the end it comes down to the voters. Holding Mr. Bond's \n     feet to the fire on campaign finance reform and Mr. Nixon's \n     on school desegregation would be a lot better use of this \n     election than sitting idly by and watching the attack ads \n     that distort, demogogue and demean the entire process.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Tennessean, Aug. 31, 1998]\n\n               Salvage Sorry Session With Campaign Reform\n\n       The U.S. Senate comes back from recess today with a long \n     agenda, a short calendar, and an even shorter list of \n     accomplishments to date.\n       It's already snuffed out anti-smoking legislation. It has \n     shoved to the back burner President Clinton's proposal to \n     expand a self-financed form of Medicare to early retirees. It \n     has largely ignored the administration's call to provide more \n     teachers and more federal money to public schools. The \n     prospects for reaching consensus on a massive bankruptcy bill \n     or the so-called Patients Bill of Rights are slim indeed this \n     year.\n       And with five weeks left on the Senate calendar, some \n     members might be satisfied just to pass the necessary \n     appropriation bills and head for home.\n       But such a minimalistic approach from the Senate, however, \n     would shortchange the public. The Senate can still salvage \n     this unproductive year by focusing its energy and effort on \n     one extremely worthy area, the McCain-Feingold campaign \n     finance bill.\n       Since this bill's House counterpart has already passed, the \n     Senate adoption of\n\n[[Page S10070]]\n\n     McCain-Feingold could send the reform measure to the \n     President's desk.\n       The heart of the bill is a ban on ``soft money,'' which is \n     now largely unregulated and can therefore be given in \n     unlimited quantities by individuals, unions or corporations. \n     The elimination of soft money would greatly reduce the \n     aggregate amount of political money.\n       A majority of the Senate is already on record in support of \n     McCain-Feingold. The obstacle, however, comes down to eight \n     votes the number of Republican senators who need to switch \n     their votes on cloture so the bill can come up for a vote.\n       The opponents to this bill, led by Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-\n     Ky., believe they have made it through the August recess \n     without any defections. And in truth, the opponents are \n     counting on public apathy to help kill the measure. McConnell \n     has remarked on several occasions that the public doesn't \n     really care about campaign finance reform.\n       It's not too late to prove him wrong. Although the public \n     may not know the intricacies of campaign law, it cares deeply \n     when it sees its leaders kowtowing to big money while they \n     ignore average citizens.\n       Sen. Fred Thompson has been a strong supporter of McCain-\n     Feingold from the start. Tennesseans who want to see a \n     measure of reason restored to the campaign finance process \n     should contact Sen. Bill Frist, and ask him to vote for \n     cloture on this issue.\n       The McCain-Feingold bill would not cure all that ails the \n     U.S. political system. But it would greatly weaken the ties \n     between big money and politicians. The result would \n     necessarily be a more responsive government. Eight additional \n     votes needed for cloture.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Charleston Gazette, Aug. 27, 1998]\n\n                  Political Cash Clean Up the Cesspool\n\n       Americans have turned cynical about Congress, assuming that \n     big-money pressure groups buy influence by lavishing cash on \n     senators and representatives.\n       High-cost campaigning forces Congress members to be ``bag \n     men,'' carrying home loot from every lobbying interest \n     wanting legislation. Republicans get most industry money, so \n     they resist every attempt to dam the cash river. But they've \n     lost a few battles--and another victory for the public seems \n     within reach.\n       On Aug. 6, the House strongly passed the Shays-Meehan \n     campaign finance reform bill, which bans unlimited ``soft \n     money'' gifts to political parties. Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-\n     Ga., and other GOP leaders fought it, but 61 Republicans \n     defected and voted with Democrats to pass the bill. \n     (Disgustingly, West Virginia Democrats Nick Rahall and Allan \n     Mollohan jumped the other way and joined the Republicans.) \n     Now it's in the Senate, which returns from summer recess \n     Monday. Passage in the Senate is tougher because a GOP \n     filibuster is likely, and a three-fifths majority is needed \n     to break a filibuster. Twice before, attempts to ban soft \n     money were killed by Republican filibusters despite unanimous \n     Democratic support.\n       But this is an election year, and GOP senators don't want \n     voters to see them as defenders of the cash sewer. Perhaps a \n     few more will switch sides, creating the three-fifths \n     majority. We surely hope so. After the House victory, the New \n     York Times said: ``The House action was a milestone in a \n     journey that began with the first disclosure of campaign \n     fund-raising excesses in the 1996 presidential election. \n     Hearings into those abuses last year were clouded with \n     partisan acrimony. But on Monday Republicans and Democrats \n     showed they could work together.\n       ``Gingrich and his henchmen, especially Tom DeLay, tried to \n     portray the legislation as revolutionary. In fact, it simply \n     closes loopholes in the existing law by banning unlimited \n     `soft money' donations to political parties from \n     corporations, unions and rich individuals.'' The newspaper \n     said the House vote ``kindles genuine hope that Congress does \n     listen to the public's yearning for a more accountable \n     political system. Members of the House or the Senate will now \n     ignore that message at their peril.''\n       Exactly. Any senator who opposes the Shays-Meehan bill is \n     voting to keep the money flood pouring--in effect, voting for \n     disguised bribery. We hope that election-year pressure is \n     enough to push through the cleanup.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, again, we are down to 8 votes out of 535 \nMembers of Congress. After a clear demonstration that a bipartisan \nmajority in both Houses support this bill, we are just down to eight \nvotes, eight votes to break the filibuster that is holding up this \nimportant reform bill.\n  This isn't one of those situations where we haven't had votes to see \nif there might be a majority. We have. We had the votes in March, in \nFebruary, and it was clear that a bipartisan majority of this body \nsupports McCain-Feingold. So it is only the filibusterers, a minority \nof this body, who are standing against the majority of this body and \nthe other body. We will soon see whether eight more Senators are ready \nto do what so desperately needs to be done.\n  Time and time again the senior Senator from Arizona and I have said \nwe are more than willing to entertain changes to our bill that will \nallow us to get those eight votes, as long as the basic integrity of \nthe bill remains intact. We reached that kind of agreement with \nSenators Snowe, Jeffords and Chafee, and it led to our proving that a \nclear majority in this body supports McCain-Feingold.\n  I say to all of my colleagues, but especially the 48 who have not yet \njoined the majority, if you are one of the potential eight votes, if \nbefore the end of this year you want to show that you do care about the \ncorrupting influence of money in our political process, and if you have \na particular concern or problem with the amendment that is on the floor \nnow, please come talk with us. I have had several fruitful \nconversations with some of these potential Senators and I look forward \nto more of them. Let's try to come to some agreement that will allow us \nto give the American people what they so desperately want from this \nCongress--a campaign finance reform bill that will make the first \nelection of the next century one of which we can all be proud.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the American body politic has a disease. It \nis a serious disease that some would argue is a critical disease. It is \ncalled ``the money chase.'' No party and few candidates are immune from \nit. The good news is that it is curable. The bad news is that there may \nbe enough Members in this body--the Senate--who want to block the cure \nso that the cure cannot succeed.\n  To inoculate our democratic system against this disease, we passed a \nseries of laws in the 1970s to limit the role of money in Federal \nelections. It was our intent at that time to protect our democratic \nform of government which relies so heavily on the interchange of ideas \nand actions between the government and the private sector and to \nprotect our form of government from the corrosive influence of \nunlimited and undisclosed political contributions. We wanted to ensure \nthat our elected officials were neither in reality nor in perception \nbeholden to special interests who are able to contribute large sums of \nmoney to candidates and their campaigns. These laws were designed to \nprotect the public's confidence in our democratically elected \nofficials.\n  For many years those laws setting limits on campaign contributions \nworked fairly well.\n  The limits that they set were respected, and these limits, indeed, \nare still on the books today. Those same laws that purportedly set \nlimits on how much people can contribute to campaigns are on the books. \nAnd here is what they say.\n  Individuals aren't supposed to give more than $1,000 to a candidate \nper election, or $5,000 to a political action committee, or more than \n$20,000 a year to a national party committee, or $25,000 total in any \none year. Corporations and unions are supposed to be prohibited from \ncontributing to any campaign. Contributions from foreign countries, \nforeign citizens, and foreign corporations are prohibited. And \nPresidential campaigns are supposed to be financed with public funds.\n  That is the law. That is what it says on the law books today. Yet in \nthe last few years we have heard story after story after story about \ncontributions of hundreds of thousands of dollars from individuals, \ncorporations, and unions, and even about contributions from foreign \nsources. And we have heard stories about Presidents and Presidential \ncandidates spending long hours on fundraising tasks.\n  Now, how is that possible? Well, what has happened is that a pretty \ngood law setting limits on the size and source of contributions had \nsome soft spots which, over the years, both parties took advantage of. \nBoth parties pushed up against those soft spots and created holes in \nthe law, big loopholes that allowed the big money to pour in.\n  So now there are effectively no limits at all. That is why we hear \nabout a $1.3 million contribution to the RNC from just one company in \n1996, and a half-million dollar contribution from just one couple to \nthe DNC the same year.\n\n[[Page S10071]]\n\n  Some in this Chamber like it that way. They don't want any limits. \nThe majority leader has said it is ``the American way.''\n  I disagree. We have got to plug those loopholes. We have to make the \nlaw whole again and, in making it whole, to make it effective. If we \ndon't do that, we risk losing the faith the American people have that \nwe represent their best interests.\n  Soft money has blown the lid off the contribution and spending limits \nof our campaign finance system. Soft money is the 800-pound gorilla \nsitting right in the middle of this debate. Some want to pretend that \nit is not there, but it is. Soft money is at the heart of this problem. \nAll soft money means is money which is unregulated and unlimited that, \nfor one reason or another, crawls through that loophole that has been \npierced by both parties in our campaign finance limits.\n  Look at the most recent data. In the 1996 election, Republicans \nraised $140 million in soft money contributions, while Democrats raised \n$120 million--almost as much. In the first 18 months of the 1998 \nelection cycle, Republicans have raised about $70 million, and \nDemocrats have raised about $45 million. That was double the amount \nthat both parties raised in the first 18 months of the 1996 elections. \nThat money currently is legal, and it is legal because of the loopholes \nin the law that we must close with the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  The way both parties have gotten around the law of the 1970s has been \nto establish a whole separate world of campaign finance. It is the \nworld of soft money--contributions that are not technically covered by \nthe limits under current law. Once that soft money loophole was opened, \nonce the loophole was viewed as legitimate, the money chase was on by \nboth parties. Couple that with the high cost of television advertising, \nand you have the money chase involving just about all candidates.\n  The chase for money has led most of us in public office or seeking \npublic office to push the envelope, to take the law to the limits, to \nget the necessary contributions.\n  The money chase led the head of the Republican National Committee, \nHaley Barbour, to use a subsidiary of the RNC, the National Policy \nForum, to obtain some $750,000 in what, practically speaking, became a \nforeign contribution from a Hong Kong businessman to run ads in key \ncongressional races.\n  The money chase drove the actions of Roger Tamraz, a large \ncontributor to both parties who, during last year's investigation, \nbecame the bipartisan symbol for what is wrong with the current system. \nRoger Tamraz served as a Republican Eagle in the 1980s during \nRepublican administrations and a Democratic trustee in the 1990s during \nDemocratic administrations. He was unabashed in admitting his political \ncontributions were made for the purpose of getting access to people in \npower. Tamraz showed us in stark terms the all too common product of \nthe current campaign finance system--using unlimited soft money \ncontributions to buy access. And despite the condemnation by Members of \nCongress and the press of Tamraz's activities, when asked at a hearing \nto reflect on his $300,000 contribution to the Democrats in 1996, \nTamraz said, ``I think next time I'll give $600,000.''\n  What happened to the limits? What happened to the $1,000 limit and \nthe $5,000 limit on PAC contributions, and the overall $25,000 limit \nper year? What happened to the intent of this Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives back in the 1970s to establish limits on contributions \nto candidates? How is it that a Roger Tamraz can unabashedly appear in \nfront of a Senate committee and say, ``Yes, I gave $300,000 to the \nDemocrats. I did it to gain access.'' And when asked, ``Would you do it \nagain?'' indicated that, next time, he'll give $600,000, if necessary.\n  Now, what do we believe the public feels and senses when they hear \nand see that? What do we think goes through the average person's mind \nwhen they see a Roger Tamraz unabashedly, boldly, without any shame, \nsaying, ``Hey, I can give you guys $300,000, I can give you $600,000, \nusing that loophole, and I will do it again''?\n  Is that what we want our election system to be--when we have passed a \nlaw which says $1,000 to a candidate, $25,000 overall in a year, that \nsomebody can just appear in front of a Senate committee and say, ``Yes, \nI gave $300,000, nothing illegal about that. I used the soft money \nloophole, folks. If you don't like it, close it. If you want to put \nlimits on how much money I can give, close the loophole. But until you \ndo it, I am going to keep on giving it''?\n  That is the Tamraz challenge to us. That is the gauntlet that he has \nlaid down in front of us, both parties. Answering his challenge cannot \nbe done on a partisan basis. There is no way we are going to reform \nthese laws unless enough Democrats and enough Republicans come \ntogether, as they did in the House of Representatives, and say enough \nis enough. We intended limits, we intended limits to apply, and we are \ngoing to close the loopholes which have obviated those limits, \ndestroyed them, undermined them and, in the process, undermined the \nconfidence of the American people.\n  The money chase also pressures political supporters to cross lines \nthey should not in order to help their candidates get needed funds.\n  The money chase led a national finance chair of Senator Dole's \npresidential campaign, Simon Fireman, to engage in a 5-year money \nlaundering scheme which funneled $120,000 through a secret Hong Kong \ntrust to his employees who contributed to the candidates he supported. \nSimilarly, the money chase led members of the Lum family, a father, \nmother and daughter, to funnel $50,000 through company employees and \nstockholders to Democratic candidates they supported, resulting in the \nfirst guilty pleas in the Justice Department's ongoing campaign finance \nfraud case.\n  The money chase led a foreign corporation, Korean Airlines, and four \nU.S. subsidiaries of foreign corporations from the same country to \nfunnel illegal contributions through their employees to a Republican \nMember of Congress Jay Kim, resulting in $1.6 million in corporate \ncriminal fines.\n  The money chase in political campaigns is a serious disease that has \nbecome chronic and too many of us have been affected by it. Too many of \nus have spent too much time fund-raising and in the process, pushing \nthe fund-raising rules to their limits. Most of us know in our hearts \nthat the money chase is a bipartisan problem and the bipartisan \nsolution is the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  But we have been here before. During my career in the Senate I have \nlost count of the number of times that this body has debated the need \nfor campaign finance reform, been presented with reasonable bipartisan \nproposals, yet, in the end, failed to get the job done.\n  Will this time be different?\n  The Senate has before it a bipartisan campaign reform bill, the \nMcCain-Feingold bill, that would do much to repair our campaign finance \nsystem. It is not a new bill. It has been before this body for years \nnow and has received sustained scrutiny from Members on both sides of \nthe aisle.\n  It is a bill that recognizes that the bulk of troubling campaign \nactivity is not what is illegal, but what is legal--what is currently \nlegal because of the soft money loophole. The McCain-Feingold bill \ntakes direct aim at closing the loopholes that have swallowed the \nelection laws. In particular, it takes aim at closing the soft money \nand issue advocacy loopholes, while strengthening other aspects of the \nfederal election laws that are too weak to do the job as they now \nstand.\n  I have heard experts and my colleagues condemn the excesses of the \n1996 elections. I've also heard people bemoaning the lack of tough \ncivil and criminal enforcement action against the wrongdoers. But there \nis an obvious reason for the lack of strong enforcement--the existing \nFederal election laws are riddled with loopholes and in many respects \nunenforceable. And as much as some want to point the finger of blame at \nthose who took advantage of the campaign finance laws during the last \nelection, there is no one to blame but ourselves for the sorry state of \nthe law.\n  The soft money loophole exists because we in Congress allow it. The \nso-called issue advocacy loophole exists because we in Congress allow \nit to exist. Tax-exempt organizations spend millions televising \ncandidate attack\n\n[[Page S10072]]\n\nads days before an election without disclosing who they are or where \nthey got their funds because we in Congress allow it.\n  It is time to stop pointing fingers at others and take responsibility \nfor our share of the blame. Congress alone writes the laws. Congress \nalone can shut down the loopholes and reinvigorate the Federal election \nlaws.\n  The Federal Election Campaign Act was first enacted 20 years ago, in \nresponse to campaign abuses uncovered in connection with the Watergate \nscandal. Congress enacted a comprehensive and tough system of laws, \nincluding contribution limits and full public disclosure of all \ncampaign contributions and expenditures.\n  At the time they were enacted, many people fought against those laws, \nclaiming they were an unconstitutional restriction of First Amendment \nrights to free speech and free association. The laws' opponents took \ntheir case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court issued the Buckley \ndecision, which held both contribution limits and disclosure \nrequirements were constitutional.\n  I want to repeat that, because Buckley is thrown around quite a bit \non this floor, so I want to just repeat that last statement. Buckley \nupheld the constitutionality of contribution limits.\n  There are those who say we should not, or cannot, limit the amount of \ncontributions. We do limit the amount of contributions, and Buckley \nsaid that we can. The question now is whether we close the loopholes \nwhich have destroyed those limits. But in terms of the \nconstitutionality under the first amendment, Buckley upheld the \nconstitutionality of limits on campaign contributions.\n  The Buckley court wrote specifically--relative to disclosure \nrequirements, by the way--that:\n\n       While disclosure requirements serve the many salutary \n     purposes discussed elsewhere in this opinion, Congress was \n     entitled to conclude that disclosure was only a partial \n     measure and that contribution ceilings were a necessary \n     legislative concomitant to deal with the problem.\n\n  And the court held in Buckley that:\n\n       We find that under the rigorous standard of review \n     established by our prior decisions, the weighty interests \n     served by restricting the size of financial contributions to \n     political candidates are sufficient to justify the limited \n     effect upon first amendment freedoms caused by the $1,000 \n     contribution ceiling. Congress was justified [the Buckley \n     court wrote] in concluding that the interest in safeguarding \n     against the appearance of impropriety requires that the \n     opportunity for abuse inherent in the process of raising \n     large monetary contributions be eliminated.\n\n  That is Buckley explicitly holding that Congress can set and enforce \ncontribution limits, and that the first amendment does not preclude us \nfrom doing so. The Buckley court also wrote:\n\n       It is unnecessary to look beyond the Act's primary \n     purpose--to limit the actuality and appearance of corruption \n     resulting from large individual financial contributions--in \n     order to find a constitutionally sufficient justification for \n     the $1,000 contribution limitation. Under a system of private \n     financing of elections, a candidate lacking immense personal \n     or family wealth must depend on financial contributions from \n     others to provide the resources necessary to conduct a \n     successful campaign. . . . To the extent that large \n     contributions are given to secure political quid pro quo's \n     from current and potential office holders, the integrity of \n     our system of representative democracy is undermined. . . . \n     Of almost equal concern is . . . the impact of the appearance \n     of corruption stemming from public awareness of the \n     opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large \n     individual financial contributions. . . .\n\n  Roger Tamraz spent $300,000 buying access and said, ``I'll double it \nnext time.'' Buckley, the Supreme Court, said:\n\n       Of almost equal concern . . . is the impact of the \n     appearance of corruption stemming from public awareness of \n     the opportunities for abuse inherent in a regime of large \n     individual financial contributions. . . .\n\n  Congress [the Buckley court held] could legitimately conclude that \nthe avoidance of the appearance of improper influence . . . is also \ncritical . . . if confidence in the system of representative government \nis not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.\n  That is Buckley. That is Buckley ruling on contribution limits. That \nis Buckley saying that Congress could legitimately conclude, to use its \nwords, that ``the avoidance of the appearance of improper influence . . \n. is also critical . . . if confidence in the system of representative \ngovernment is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent.''\n  That is Roger Tamraz' challenge to us.\n  And when he and others say, ``I can give $300,000 because of that \nsoft money loophole, and I'll double it next time,'' the Supreme Court \nsays that Congress can legitimately conclude that the avoidance of the \nappearance of improper influence ``is also critical . . . if confidence \nin the system of representative government is not to be eroded to a \ndisastrous extent.''\n  The Buckley Court also upheld the disclosure limits that we had in \nthe law. In upholding both the contribution limits and the disclosure \nrequirements, the Supreme Court used a balancing test that weighed the \nfirst amendment rights against the integrity of Federal elections, and \nthe Court ruled that the integrity of our elections is so compelling a \nGovernment interest that contribution limits and disclosure \nrequirements are constitutionally acceptable.\n  Some have argued that McCain-Feingold is an unconstitutional \nrestriction of free speech, but that analysis leaves out several key \nlegal considerations.\n  First, although Buckley is often cited in support of that argument, \nBuckley, as a matter of fact, is the decision that upheld contribution \nlimits and disclosure requirements. Buckley did strike down spending \nlimits, but not contribution limits which Buckley affirmed. Spending \nlimits were stricken by Buckley, but no one is talking about mandatory \nspending limits in this bill. What we are talking about is contribution \nlimits and disclosure requirements, exactly what Buckley said is a \nconstitutional means to protect the integrity of our elections, to \ndeter corruption and the appearance of corruption, and to inform \nvoters.\n  Some have correctly cited other court decisions holding that only ads \nwhich contain a short list of so-called magic words can be subjected to \nthe Federal election law requirements and limits relative to \ncontributions, but that analysis leaves out a decision in the ninth \ncircuit in the Furgatch case which holds that the list of magic words, \nwhich those other courts cited, ``does not exhaust the capacity of the \nEnglish language to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a \ncandidate.''\n  The analysis by some relative to issue ads also leaves out, in \naddition to ignoring the ninth circuit Furgatch case, the fact that the \nFederal Election Commission has reaffirmed, on a bipartisan basis, its \ncommitment to a broader test that goes beyond the magic words to unmask \nads that claim to be discussions of issues but which are clearly \nintended to advocate the election or defeat of a Federal candidate.\n  The Supreme Court has yet to rule on the Federal Election Commission \nregulation or whether the magic words must be present before Federal \nelection laws can be applied to ads that clearly attack or support \ncandidates.\n  Despite attempts to depict the constitutional picture as providing \ncrystal clear support for unfettered speech, no matter how corrupting \nof our electoral system, that is not the state of the law. To the \ncontrary. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the integrity of \nour elections is a weighty concern which Congress can consider. The \nquestion is how to balance that concern for the integrity of elections \nagainst the free speech concerns in the first amendment.\n  How do you balance the two? In Buckley, the Court balanced them by \nsaying contribution limits are constitutional; disclosure requirements \nare constitutional; spending limits, expenditure limits are not. That \nis what the Buckley Court ruled. This bill, our bill, is consistent \nwith Buckley, consistent with Furgatch, and consistent with the Federal \nElection Commission s reaffirmation of the broader test for candidate \nadvocacy.\n  The problem with our campaign laws is that candidates and parties \nhave pushed against the limits of the law and found loopholes to such \nan extent that the law's limits are no longer effective. We intended to \nestablish limits after Watergate. Those limits have been destroyed by \nthe soft money loophole.\n  The Supreme Court said we can, in fact, limit contributions. The \nissue before us is whether we will restore those limits on \ncontributions. Individuals can now give parties hundreds of thousands \nof dollars, millions of dollars at a\n\n[[Page S10073]]\n\ntime, claiming that they are providing soft money rather than the hard \nmoney that has to meet the legal limits. Corporations, which are not \nsupposed to make direct contributions at all, now routinely contribute \nhuge sums to both parties, millions to both parties. While those \ncontributors claim to be providing money that is simply for party-\nbuilding purposes and not for candidates, the issue advocacy loophole \nallows parties and others to televise ads that clearly attack or \nsupport candidates while claiming to be discussions of issues beyond \nthe reach of the election laws, but which are indistinguishable from \ncandidate ads which are subject to contribution limits and disclosure \nrequirements.\n  To show the absurd state of the law, at least in some circuits, we \ncan just look at one of the 1996 televised ads that was paid for by the \nLeague of Conservation Voters and which referred to House Member Greg \nGanske, a Republican Congressman from Iowa, who was then up for \nreelection. This is the way the ad read:\n\n       It's our land; our water. America's environment must be \n     protected. But in just 18 months, Congressman Ganske has \n     voted 12 out of 12 times to weaken environmental protections. \n     Congressman Ganske even voted to let corporations continue \n     releasing cancer-causing pollutants into our air. Congressman \n     Ganske voted for the big corporations who lobbied these bills \n     and gave him thousands of dollars in contributions. Call \n     Congressman Ganske. Tell him to protect America's \n     environment. For our families. For our future.\n\n  The ad sponsor claimed that was an issue ad, an ad that discussed \nissues rather than a candidate, and so could be paid for by unlimited \nand undisclosed funds. If one word were changed, if instead of ``Call \nCongressman Ganske,'' the ad said, ``Defeat Congressman Ganske,'' it \nwould clearly qualify as a candidate ad subject to contribution limits \nand disclosure requirements.\n  In the real world, that one word difference doesn't change the \ncharacter or substance of that ad at all. Both versions unmistakably \nadvocate the defeat of Congressman Ganske. But the ad sponsor claims \nthat only one of those ads must comply with election law contribution \nlimits and disclosure requirements. That doesn't make sense, and \nMcCain-Feingold would help close down that interpretation of the law.\n  This is not the first time that loopholes have eroded the \neffectiveness of a set of laws. It happens all the time. The election \nlaws are just the latest example. Congress is here partly to oversee \nthe way that laws operate, to close loopholes that have been \ndiscovered.\n  The question is, What are we going to do about it?\n  The time for crying crocodile tears about campaign fundraising is \nover. Folks should wipe away those crocodile tears from their eyes, \nbecause if they do, they will see a public disgusted with both parties \nfor allowing unlimited fundraising and contributions in our Federal \nelections. Seventy-three percent of American people in a poll conducted \nby the Los Angeles Times believe both parties committed campaign \nfinance abuses in the 1996 elections; 81 percent--81 percent--of the \nAmerican people believe the campaign fundraising system needs to be \nreformed; 78 percent of the American people believe we should limit the \nrole of soft money.\n  Campaign finance reform is an issue that can convert a dedicated \noptimist into a doomsayer, but we have before us a bipartisan bill that \nprovides the key reforms, that has passed the House and that the \nPresident will sign.\n  We have before us a bipartisan bill which a majority in the Senate \nsupport, and we have a bipartisan coalition that is willing to fight \nhard for this bill.\n  So let us stop complaining about weak enforcement of the election \nlaws when the wording of those laws make them virtually unenforceable. \nLet us stop feigning shock at the laws' loopholes while allowing them \nto continue. It is time to enact campaign finance reform. That is our \nlegislative responsibility. Otherwise, we are going to be haunted by \nthe words of Roger Tamraz that in the next election it will be $600,000 \ninstead of $300,000.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. McConnell). The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, let me thank my colleagues. I thank \nSenator Levin for his remarks. I thank him for his unbelievable \ndedication in trying to push through reform legislation. He has been at \nthis a long time. This is the time to do it; I agree with my colleague. \nWe have an opportunity. We have a bill that was passed on the House \nside. It is a bipartisan measure. We have a public that is calling for \nthe change. And I agree with you, I say to the Senator; now is the time \nto pass this legislation.\n  I also thank my colleagues, Senator McCain, Republican from Arizona, \nand Senator Feingold, Democrat from Wisconsin. I have a special kind of \naffection for both of my colleagues. I think Senator McCain is \nprincipled; he speaks out for what he believes in; he is a courageous \nlegislator. I think Senator Feingold has emerged here in the U.S. \nSenate as a leading reformer. He is my neighbor. I am a Senator from \nMinnesota, and I tell you, people from Minnesota who follow Russ \nFeingold's work have a tremendous amount of respect for him. I am \nhonored to be an original cosponsor of this legislation.\n  I do not know exactly where to get started. It is interesting. \nSenator Barry Goldwater told it like it is. I went to Senator \nGoldwater's service in Arizona, not because I was necessarily in \nagreement with him on all the issues. As a matter of fact, some of my \ngood friends, Republican colleagues, who were on the plane with me kept \ngiving me Barry Goldwater's book ``Conscience of a Conservative'' and \nkept telling me if I had read that book when I was 15 I would be going \ndown the right path. I told them I did read the book when I was 15. I \njust reached different conclusions.\n  Senator Goldwater about a decade ago said:\n\n       The fact that liberty depended on honest elections was of \n     the utmost importance to the patriots who founded our nation \n     and wrote the Constitution. They knew that corruption \n     destroyed the prime requisite of constitutional liberty, an \n     independent legislature free from any influence other than \n     that of the people. Applying these principles to modern \n     times, we can make the following conclusions. To be \n     successful, representative government assumes that elections \n     will be controlled by the citizenry at large, not by those \n     who give the most money. Electors must believe their vote \n     counts. Elected officials must owe their allegiance to the \n     people, not to their own wealth or to the wealth of interest \n     groups who speak only for the selfish fringes of the whole \n     community.\n\n  Let me just start out with some examples. I was involved in a debate \nhere on the floor of the Senate last week which was emotional. It was \nkind of heart rending. You had a small group of people who were sitting \nwhere some of our citizens are sitting today. And they were from Sierra \nBlanca. They were disproportionately poor. They were Hispanic. And you \nknow what? They were saying, ``How come when it comes to the question \nof where a nuclear waste dump site goes, it's put in our community? How \ncome it always seems to be the case that when we figure out what to do \nwith these incinerators or where to put these power lines or where to \ndump this waste, it almost always goes to the communities where people \ndon't make the big contributions? They are not the heavy hitters. They \nare disproportionately poor, disproportionately communities of color; \nthus, the question of environmental justice.\n\n  This was a debate where you had the interests of big money, big \ncontributors, corporate utilities, versus low-income minority \ncommunities. I would argue different colleagues voted for different \nreasons, and some voted because it was not their State and they felt a \ncertain kind of, if you will, deference to Senators from other States. \nI understand that. But my point is a little different.\n  I tell you that all too often the conclusion is sort of \npredetermined. Those who have the clout and those who make the big \ncontributions are the ones who have the influence, and those are the \nones we listen to. All too often, a whole lot of citizens--in this \nparticular case, the people from Sierra Blanca--are not listened to at \nall. Big money prevails, special interests prevail, for the same reason \nthat the people in Sierra Blanca cannot get a fair shake in Texas. That \nis to say, they do\n\n[[Page S10074]]\n\nnot give the big contributions, they do not have the political clout. \nFor the same reason, they could not get a fair shake here in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  In about 20 minutes I am going to be at a meeting with some \ncolleagues from the Midwest. We have an economic convulsion in \nagriculture. Let me wear my political scientist hat. I really believe \nthat when people look back to 1998, 1999, going into the next century, \nand raise questions about our economy--because I fear that we are going \nto be faced with some very difficult times--they are going to be \nlooking at this crisis in agriculture as a sort of precursor.\n  What has happened in agriculture is record low prices. Not everybody \nwho is watching the debate comes from a State where agriculture is as \nimportant as it is in the State of Minnesota, the State I come from. \nBut let me say to people who are listening to the debate, if you are a \ncorn grower and you are getting $1.40 for a bushel of corn, you can be \nthe best manager in the world, you can work from 5 in the morning until \nmidnight, but you and your family will never make it. You will never \nmake it. Record low prices. People are having to give up. They are just \nleaving. The farm is not only where they work, it is where they live.\n  It is interesting that we had a farm bill, the 1996 farm bill. It was \ncalled the Freedom to Farm bill. I called it then the ``freedom to \nfail'' bill. It was a great bill--I am not saying anything on the floor \nof the Senate that I have not said a million times over in the last 2 \nyears. It was a great bill for the grain companies because what this \npiece of legislation essentially said to family farmers is, ``We're no \nlonger going to give you a loan rate. We're going to cap the loan rate \nat such a low level that you won't have the bargaining power.''\n  This sounds a little technocratic, but to make a long story short, \nyou have family farmers faced with a monopoly when it comes to whom \nthey sell their grain to. If they do not have some kind of loan rate \nthat the Government guarantees that brings the price to a certain \nlevel, they have no bargaining power in the marketplace.\n  Not surprisingly, the prices have plummeted. There is no safety net \nwhatsoever. And now we see in our part of the country, in the Midwest, \na family farm structure of agriculture which is in real peril. We see \nan economic convulsion. We see many family farmers who are going to be \ndriven off the land.\n  We are going to be coming to the floor of the Senate--you better \nbelieve we are going to be coming to the floor of the Senate--and we \nare going to be saying to our colleagues, ``Look, you could have been \nfor the `freedom to fail' bill or not, but there's going to have to be \na modification. You are going to have to cap off the loan rate, and \nwe're going to have to get the prices up for family farmers.''\n  I would argue that in 1996--and I hope this will not be the debate \nagain--what was going on here was a farm bill that was written by and \nfor big corporate agribusiness interests. That is what it was. It was a \ngreat bill for the grain companies, but it was a disaster for family \nfarmers.\n  So we are going to revisit this debate. And once again, is it going \nto be the grain companies and the big food processors and the big \nchemical companies and the transportation companies, or is it going to \nbe the family farmers? I hope it will be the family farmers. I hope our \nappeal to fairness and justice will work on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  But I tell you, all too often, as I look at these different issues in \nthese different debates, it is no wonder, as Senator Levin said, that \npeople are so disappointed and disillusioned with both political \nparties. It is no wonder that people do not register and do not vote. \nBecause you know what? They have reached the conclusion that if you \npay, you play, and if you do not pay, you do not play.\n  They have reached the conclusion that this political process isn't \ntheir political process. I mean, my God, what happens in a \nrepresentative democracy when people reach the conclusion that they are \nnot stakeholders in the system, that when it comes to their concerns \nabout themselves, about their families and their communities, their \nconcerns are of little concern in the corridors of power in Washington? \nThis is really dangerous. What is at stake is nothing less than our \nvery noble, wonderful, 222-year experiment in self-rule and \nrepresentative democracy. That is what it is really all about.\n\n  (Mr. FRIST assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Now, let me give some other examples. We went through \na debate about whether or not we were going to do anything to provide \nour children with some protection from being addicted to tobacco. Guess \nwhat happened? Tobacco companies, huge contributors, individual \ncontributions to Senators and Representatives, big soft money, hundreds \nof thousands of dollars of contributions to the party, and guess what \nhappened? As a special favor to those big tobacco interests, we didn't \neven provide our children with sensible protection.\n  I fear as a special favor to the big insurance companies we are not \ngoing to eventually provide patients with the kind of protection that \nthey need. I fear that as a special favor to those bottom dwellers of \ncommerce who don't want to raise the minimum wage, we are not even \ngoing to raise the minimum wage for hard-pressed working people.\n  What I see over and over and over again is a political process \nhijacked by and dominated by big money. I tell you, that is the \nopposite of the very idea of representative democracy, because the idea \nof representative democracy is that each person counts as one and no \nmore than one.\n  What we have instead is something quite different. Let's just think \nfor a moment about what is on the table and what is not on the table, \nbecause I think this mix of money and politics, this is the ethical \nissue of our time. We are not talking about corruption as in the \nwrongdoing of individual office holders; we are talking about \nsystematic corruption. What systematic corruption is all about is when \ntoo few people have the wealth, the power, and the vast majority of \npeople are locked out. Some people march on Washington every day and \nother people have a voice that is never heard.\n  Let's just think a little bit about what is on the table and what is \nnot on the table. I think quite often money determines who runs for \noffice. I will talk about who wins, what issues are put on the table, \nwhat passes, what doesn't. Let's talk about what is not on the table \nand maybe should be on the table. What is not on the table is the \nconcentration of power in certain key sectors of our economy which \nposes such a threat to consumers in America.\n  Think for a moment about the concentration of power in the \ntelecommunications industry. If there is anything more important than \nthe flow of information in a democracy, I don't know what it is. This \nis so important to us. Now, we had a telecommunications bill that \npassed a couple years ago, which, by the way, I think has led to more \nmonopoly. What was interesting is that the anteroom right outside our \nChamber was packed wall to wall. You couldn't get in here if you tried \nto get through that anteroom. Personally, I couldn't find truth, beauty \nand justice anywhere. There was a group of people representing a \nbillion dollars here, another group of people representing a billion \ndollars over there. You name it.\n  What is not on the table is a concentration of power in financial \nservices or a concentration of power in agriculture or all the ways in \nwhich conglomerates have muscled their way to the dinner table and are \ntaking over the food industry. What is not on the table is a \nconcentration of power in the health care system, the way in which just \na few insurance companies can own and control most of the managed care \nplans in the United States of America.\n  Again, I would say that we are moving toward this new century. I hope \nthe brave new world isn't two airline companies. I come from a State \nwhere we now have a strike. In Minnesota we don't have a lot of choice. \nWe can't walk from Minnesota to Washington, DC. Northwest Airlines has \n85 percent of the flights in and out. What are we going to have--two \nairlines, two banks, two oil companies, one supermarket, two financial \ninstitutions, two health care plans? It is interesting that this isn't \neven on the table here. Could it be that these powerful economic \ninterests are able to preempt some of the debate and some of the \ndiscussion by virtue of the huge contributions they can make with the \nsoft money loophole that can\n\n[[Page S10075]]\n\nadd up to hundreds of thousands of dollars?\n  What is not on the table is, I argue, a frightening maldistribution \nof wealth and income in America. The goal of both political parties, \nthe goal of political leaders, ought to be to improve the standard of \nliving of all the people. Since we started collecting social science \ndata, we have the greatest maldistribution of wealth and income we have \never had in our country. You don't hear a word about it. It is \nimportant for people, if they work hard, to be able to participate in \nthe life of our country. It is important for people to be able to \nreceive the fruits of their labor.\n  We have this huge maldistribution of wealth and income. We are not \neven going to discuss it. Could it be that some of the people who are \nthe most hard-pressed citizens in this country have basically become \ninvisible? They are out of sight; they are out of mind. They don't have \nlobbyists. They don't make the big contributions. They don't even \nregister to vote because they don't think either political party has \nmuch to say to them. They think both parties have been taken over by \nthe same investors. Unfortunately, there is some truth to that. \nUnfortunately, we have given people entirely too much justification for \nthat point of view.\n  What is not on the table? What is not on the table is a set of social \narrangements that allow children to be the most poverty-stricken group \nin America. One out of every four children under the age of 3 is \ngrowing up poor in America. One out of every two children of color \nunder the age of 3 is growing up poor in America today. That is a \nnational scandal. That is a betrayal of our heritage. Certainly we can \ndo much better.\n  Now, there are organizations like the Children's Defense Fund. They \ndo great work. But it is a very unequal fight. It comes to whether or \nnot you are going to have hundreds of billions of dollars of what we \ncall tax expenditures--tax loopholes and deductions, corporation \nwelfare, money that goes to all sorts of financial interests, some of \nthe largest financial institutions, some of the largest corporations in \nAmerica--or whether or not we are going to make a commitment to make \nsure that every child has the same opportunity to reach his or her full \npotential. This is the core issue. I am convinced that so many good \nthings that could happen here get ``trumped'' by the way in which money \ndominates politics.\n  Now, the House has passed a good campaign finance reform bill, the \nShays-Meehan proposal. It is not everything that some of us would have \nliked. As a matter of fact, what is interesting is that the original \nMcCain-Feingold bill applied to Senate races. I thought that was one of \nthe most important things. We had voluntary spending caps--you can't \nmandate it--and at the same time an exchange for media time. That is \ngone. That was really important. So we are talking about a proposal \nthat is a milder proposal, but it is an enormous step forward. It is an \nenormous step forward.\n  There are other things that are going on in the country that I am \nexcited about, that I wish for, that I think eventually we will get to. \nThe clean money, clean election bill that some of us have introduced \nhere on the Senate side is an exciting proposal. We have a lot of \nenergy behind it at the State level. I think New York City will pass \nit. I think the State of Massachusetts will pass it. The State of Maine \nalready did pass it. The State of Vermont passed it. There are \ninitiatives in other States.\n  Basically, with the clean money, clean election proposal, we get the \nbig private money out. You say to the citizen, listen, for $5 a year, \nwould you be willing to contribute to a clean money, clean election \ntrust fund? And then those candidates who abide by spending limits and \ndon't raise the private money, this money goes to their campaigns. You \nhave a level playing field, and you own the elections, and you own your \nState capitol, and you don't have all of this mix of big money in \npolitics. A lot of people in the country really like this proposal. I \nthink the political problem here is we are not ready for it yet because \nthe system is wired. It is wired to people who can raise the big money, \nand quite often, they are the incumbents. And a lot of people don't \nlike to vote out a system that benefits them. But the McCain-Feingold \nbill represents a very important step forward--following on the heels \nof a really exciting victory in the House of Representatives. It is \nvery important, very similar. It bans the soft money as my colleague, \nSenator Levin--and there is nobody with more intellectual capital in \nthis area--discussed. Senator Levin knows all of the specifics. I am so \nimpressed with him as a legislator, with his ability. He talked about \nit. I will just say that this is a huge loophole. It is all very \namorphous.\n\n  Corporations and unions can make these huge soft money contributions. \nWe all end up calling for this money now because everybody is trapped \nby the same rotten system. It restricts issue advocacy, these phony \nissue ads that are disguised as not really election ads. I went through \nthis. I don't mean this in the spirit of whining, but it started in \n1996, in the spring in Minnesota, and it went on all summer. There were \nall of these ads that would come on TV and they bash you for this and \nbash you for that, but they don't say ``vote against'' whether you are \nDemocrat or Republican; they just say ``call.'' It is unbelievable. \nThey could be financed by soft money. A huge loophole, huge problem. \nThis bill codifies the Beck Supreme Court decision requiring unions to \nnotify their dues-paying members of their right to disallow political \nuse of their dues. It improves disclosure and FEC enforcement. This \nbill would represent a substantial step forward.\n  Mr. President, there is a wonderful speech that was given by Bill \nMoyers in December of 1997, the title of which is ``The Soul of \nDemocracy.'' I want to quote from part of Bill Moyers' speech:\n\n       If Carrie Bolton were here tonight, she could speak to \n     this. The Reverend Carrie Bolton from North Carolina. You'd \n     have a hard time seeing her because she is only so high and \n     her head would barely reach the microphone. But you would \n     hear her, of that I'm sure. The state legislature in North \n     Carolina established a commission to look at campaign \n     financing, and Carrie Bolton came to one of the hearings. She \n     listened patiently as one speaker after another addressed the \n     commissioners. And then it was her time. She spoke softly at \n     first. Then the passion rose, and her words mesmerized her \n     audience. When Carrie Bolton finished, they stood and \n     cheered. This is what she said; listen to what Carrie Bolton \n     said:\n       ``I was born to a mother and father married to each other, \n     who were sharecroppers, who proceeded to have ten children. I \n     picked cotton, which made some people rich. . . . I pulled \n     tobacco. . .I shook peanuts. . .I dug up potatoes and picked \n     cucumbers, and I went to school * * * with enthusiasm. And \n     with great enthusiasm I memorized the Preamble to the \n     Constitution of the United States, I learned the Pledge of \n     Allegiance to the flag, and I was inspired to believe that \n     somehow those things symbolized hope for me against any odds \n     I might come upon.\n       ``I am a divorcee, a single parent divorcee, and I earn \n     enough money to take care of my two children and myself. And \n     I have managed to get a high school diploma, a bachelor's \n     degree, two master's degrees, and do post doctoral work.\n       ``I am energetic. I'm smart. I'm intelligent.\n       ``But a snowball would stand a better chance surviving in \n     hell than I would running for political office in this \n     country. Because I have no money. My family has no money. My \n     friends do not have money.\n       ``Yet, I have ideas. I'm strong, I am powerful (with her \n     right hand she lifts her left wrist)--people can feel my \n     pulse. People who are working, and working hard, can feel \n     what I feel.\n       ``But I can't tell them because I don't know how to get the \n     spotlight to tell them.\n       ``Because I have no money.''\n       Anyone who believes Carrie Bolton's cry isn't coming from \n     the soul of democracy is living in a fool's paradise--a rich \n     fool's paradise.\n\n  That is from Bill Moyers' speech. He is my hero journalist. I think \nhe has done some of the finest work. He concludes his speech by saying \nthis:\n\n       I have three grandchildren--Henry, 5; Thomas, 3; and 10-\n     month-old Nancy Judith. I want them to grow up in a healthy, \n     civil society, one where their political worth is not \n     measured by their net worth.\n\n  That is one of the reasons Bill Moyers goes on to argue that this is \nhis passion, this is his work. He is right. This is the core issue.\n  Now, Mr. President, I don't know that I would have the eloquence of \nCarrie Bolton, but I conclude this way because I see other colleagues \nwho may want to speak. I can't forget my own experience. It is not \nquite Carrie Bolton's experience, but I ran for office in 1990, and it \nwas amazing. I mean, you don't come to the floor to brag, but you don't \nrun for office if you don't\n\n[[Page S10076]]\n\nthink you have the character and ideas. Basically, everywhere I went, \nthe argument was made, ``you don't have a chance.'' I was a teacher, so \nI didn't have much money. My father was an unsuccessful writer. My \nmother was a cafeteria worker, a food service worker. My family didn't \nhave any money. My wife Sheila worked in the library at the high \nschool. Everywhere I would go--including on the Democrat side, not just \nthe Republican side--people were trying to decide whether or not I was \na viable candidate. It had nothing to do with content of character, \nnothing to do with ideas, nothing to do with leadership potential, and \nit had nothing to do with positions on issues. People just wanted to \nknow how much money you raised. You were viable or you weren't viable. \nYou were a good candidate or you were a bad one based upon how much \nmoney you yourself had--and I didn't have it--or how much money you \nwould raise.\n  It is unbelievable, absolutely unbelievable. There are so many people \nwho can't run for that reason alone. I was lucky. I come from \nMinnesota, and I am emotional about how much I owe to them. They were \nan exception to the rule. We were outspent six or seven to one, and we \nwon. Sometimes it happens--if you have a great green schoolbus to \ncampaign in and a great grassroots organization.\n  I am the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled persecution from Russia. \nWe have had a 222-year, bold, important experiment in self-rule in \ndemocracy, representative democracy. That is what is at jeopardy here. \nI have talked to people about potentially running for office. They \ndon't want to. A lot of people, good people, don't want to run for \noffice any longer because they can't stand the thought of this money \nchase. They can't stand doing it. Moreover, if you combine what the \nmoney is used for, with communication technology becoming the weapon of \nelectoral conflict, people using the money for poison politics, all the \nattack stuff on TV, a lot of very good, sane people don't run.\n  I think what is happening is a lot of good people aren't going to be \ninvolved in public affairs. A lot of young people are not going to get \ninvolved in public affairs. You get to where people are either \nmillionaires or they have to raise millions of dollars. I think you get \ninto this awful self-select where a whole lot of good men and women \naren't going to run at all. I am not going to cite the polls because we \nhave the evidence for this. Everybody knows it. Every Democrat and \nRepublican knows full well that people are disengaged and disillusioned \nwith politics in this country, and this is one of the central reasons.\n  So, Mr. President, I simply say to my colleagues that we have a piece \nof legislation on the floor that follows up on an exciting victory in \nthe House of Representatives, and we need to pass this legislation. I \nalso say to my colleagues--Democrats and Republicans alike--frankly, I \ncan't figure out the opposition. People want to see this changed. \nPeople just hate the way in which they feel like money dominates \npolitics. Those of us in office, and even those of us who are \nchallenged for office, hate it. We hate raising the money; we hate this \nsystem. I would think if we wanted the people we represent to have more \nconfidence and faith in us, more confidence and faith in this political \nprocess, more confidence and faith in the U.S. Senate, we would vote \nfor the McCain-Feingold piece of legislation.\n  So the debate will go on. We will have this vote.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side--which doesn't mean just \nRepublicans because there are some Republicans who support this \nlegislation--that I think they are making a big mistake filibustering. \nFrom my point of view, this should go on and on for the next however \nmany weeks it takes. I don't think we should drop this one. This is the \ncore issue. This is the core question. It speaks to all the issues that \nare important to people's lives. It speaks as to whether or not we are \ngoing to have a functioning democracy or not.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, from a good government State, from a \nreform State, from a progressive State, there is no more important \nposition that I can take than to be for this reform legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset that it is tough \nto follow the Senator from Minnesota. Senator Wellstone brings to this \nbody extraordinary talent, and more than that, a conviction and fervent \ncommitment to principle that all of us admire so greatly.\n  His first campaign for the U.S. Senate was legendary. He was a \ncollege professor, I believe, in a small college in Minnesota. He put \nhimself on a school bus--an old, beaten up school bus--and traveled all \naround the State of Minnesota. He was dramatically outspent by a \ngentleman who had formerly served in the U.S. Senate, and, yet, \nprevailed.\n  His presence on the floor of the Senate indicates his reelection to \nthe U.S. Senate and to the fact that there are Members of the Senate \nwho can basically break the rules. He wasn't supposed to win. You are \nnot supposed to have a chance when somebody outspends you 6 or 7 to 1. \nIt might raise some question in some people's minds. Why we are even \ndebating this if someone like Paul Wellstone can win when he is being \nso dramatically outspent? Why do we need campaign finance reform? It is \njust because of the fact that Paul Wellstone, unfortunately, is the \nexception to the rule. The rule is that at the end of a campaign, if \nyou take a look at the amount of money spent by a candidate, in most \ninstances--the overwhelming majority of instances--the candidate, \nwhether it is the incumbent or the challenger, who spends more money \nwill prevail, will win the election.\n  That really tells the story of why this bill--the McCain-Feingold \nbill--the only bipartisan campaign finance reform bill, is so \nimportant, because it strikes at the heart of this money chase.\n  Think about this last Presidential election in 1996--incumbent \nPresident Bill Clinton v. Senator Robert Dole, two extraordinarily \ntalented men with a background in public service running for the \nhighest office in the land. They traversed America from one side to the \nother. They were on every newscast every night. They debated with \nfrequency. There was a great exchange on issues, and a real difference \nof opinion on many important questions.\n  We in America--at least the politicians--were focused on a daily \nbasis.\n  Then came the election in November of 1996. Something historic \noccurred. I am not talking about who won and lost. What was historic \nwas the fact that we had the lowest percentage turnout of eligible \nvoters casting ballots in the Presidential election than we had in 72 \nyears in America. Think of it. Despite all of the publicity, and all of \nthe attention, when the election day came, Americans--American voters--\nstayed home.\n  Let me amend that for a moment.\n  The reason why 72 years applies is that 72 years before 1996 was the \nfirst election in American history when women were eligible to vote, \nand many did not. If you would take that particular election in 1924 \nout of the picture, you have to go back into the early part of the 19th \ncentury to see a lower turnout of eligible voters. Is that important? \nDoes it mean anything that voters stayed home; that they have decided \nfor the most important election in America that they wouldn't \nparticipate? I think it means everything in a democracy, because the \nvoters--the citizens of this country--will not even come forward to \nexpress their choice in an election. It is not only a sad commentary on \nour democracy. It is a threat to our democracy.\n  The McCain-Feingold bill goes to the heart of the problem. Why did \npeople stay home? Did they assume they already knew the results? That \nis possible. But I think a lot of them were sickened by this political \nprocess. They looked at the way that, in this case, men ran for \nPresident; and men and women ran or not for the House and Senate. They \nbasically said, ``We don't care to participate in it. Our family is \ngoing to stay home.'' And they did.\n  What was it about those election campaigns? Was it the groveling that \nall of us as candidates who were not independently wealthy had to do to \nraise the money to be viable? I think that is part of it. I think that \nis the big part of it. They wonder how a man or a woman aspiring to \nserve in this body,\n\n[[Page S10077]]\n\nor the House, can raise literally millions of dollars without dirtying \nthemselves in the process, without sacrificing their own principles and \nvalues. They become increasingly skeptical of politicians in general, \nand the candidates up for election in particular.\n\n  There is another element, too--the advertising that we put on \ntelevision during the course of the campaign. A lot of people are \nturned off by it. Most campaigns hire sophisticated people to make \nthose ads. They hire pollsters who go out and take legitimate samples \nof American opinion--samples within a given State--and convert those \nsamples into messages; 30-second messages that go up on television. \nSome of the messages are positive. Some are negative. It is the \nnegative ones that unfortunately give us the bad name and lead a lot of \npeople to say that this process itself is so fundamentally flawed.\n  This McCain-Feingold bill has one more aspect. And one important \naspect of that says when it comes to these so-called independent \nexpenditures--the issue advocacy ads--at the very minimum let us find \nout who these people are that are paying for the ads. That is not too \nmuch to ask. Let me give you an illustration.\n  The last time we debated this bill on the floor, I left the debate to \ngo to a meeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee before which we had \nwitnesses who were testifying on a variety of subjects, including the \nquestion of term limits. The term limits issue is fairly obvious. It \nsays that we should limit--at least those people argue--that we should \nlimit the number of terms served by Members of the U.S. Senate and \nMembers of the House of Representatives. There is some surface appeal \nto this that has become a hot issue in a variety of elections. I know \nthe issue myself personally, because in the closing days of my Senate \nrace in the State of Illinois they spent about a quarter of a million \ndollars on TV ads criticizing me because I opposed the term limits \nproposal. And those ads were fairly effective. I won. But I had to deal \nwith the criticism that they raised.\n  So there sat before me this gentleman representing the term limits \nmovement who said he agreed with the opponents of McCain-Feingold that \nwe shouldn't reform our campaign finance system. I said to the \ngentleman representing the term limits movement, ``Please, since I as a \ncandidate have to disclose every penny that I raise, the source of the \namount, and my political party has to do the same, I would like for \nyour term limits movement, having spent millions of dollars to defeat \nor elect candidates to office, to do the same. Are you prepared to \ndisclose to the American people the sources of the money that paid for \nthose TV ads?'' His answer in a word was ``no.''\n  Why wouldn't he make a full disclosure? His argument was--follow this \none, if you will--that there would be retribution from elected \nofficials whom they disagreed with. I don't buy it.\n  Men and women organizations come forward on a regular basis to \ncontribute to political campaigns. They understand they have taken a \nposition for a man or woman running for office. The fear of retribution \nis part of the concern. But it is an illustration of how an \norganization with some high-sounding purpose like limiting terms for \nMembers of the House and Senate can literally spend millions of dollars \nof mystery money and never make a full disclosure; never make any \ndisclosure as to the source of those funds.\n  Is it important? It could be. Who knows who is financing term limits \nin America? Is it one person? Is it one company? Is it one special \ninterest group? That is a legitimate question. I can guarantee you that \nyou will not see the term limits movement people standing around the \nshopping centers of America with kettles and bells asking for quarters \nand dimes. They don't do business that way. They deal in big checks \nfrom big players, big expenditures, to make a big impact on the system, \nand they are totally, totally unregulated. That to me is shameful. It \nis disgraceful.\n\n  What is going on here in this debate on McCain-Feingold is an attempt \nto change the system, to clean it up, and to restore some character to \nour political process. I am at the same disadvantage as Senator \nWellstone of Minnesota and Senator Feingold, one of the cosponsors, of \nWisconsin. I was raised in a family that was not wealthy. I had a \nwealthy background in terms of values and education but not a lot of \nmoney. Fortunately, with good education and some good friends, I was \nable to start a career in public service. But now we find this new \nemerging phenomenon in American political life on both sides, Democrat \nand Republican, the so-called middle-aged, crazy millionaire who shows \nup on the scene bored with his life who decides he is tired of \npracticing law, he is tired of making lots of money in business and now \nhas dreams of being Governor or Senator or you name it. They then take \ntheir personal wealth and, under the existing law, spend it to \nbasically buy a campaign, buy their way into office.\n  I think there are some genuinely good people who have done this, but \nI think we have to ask ourselves what will happen to this political \nprocess if more and more of this sort of person become the \nRepresentatives and Senators of America. I think we will lose \nsomething. We would lose something like a Patty Murray, who is a \nSenator from the State of Washington, who has a background of teaching \nin a classroom. I am glad Senator Patty Murray is on the floor of the \nSenate. When we discuss educational issues, I turn to Patty Murray. \nTime and again, I want her perspective because she has been there. She \ncomes from a family of modest means, but she makes a great contribution \nbecause the voters in the State of Washington have allowed her to come \nto this floor. And when you look around this Chamber you find others, \nDemocrats and Republicans, of similar backgrounds. Unless we are \nprepared to reform this campaign finance system, I am afraid it will \nbecome more elite, more plutocratic, if you will, and limited in terms \nof the types of people who do serve it.\n  Let me also, in closing, note the procedural issue that we face here. \nThis is an important issue. It was brought up before the Senate once \nbefore, and it was stopped. Some 57 Senators, if I am not mistaken, \nDemocrats and Republicans, came forward saying they supported it, but \nin this body it really takes 60 in order to stop the filibuster. Sixty \nvotes were not there. Campaign finance died. The House went through \nheroic efforts to bring this to the floor over the opposition of \nSpeaker Gingrich. After weeks of debate, weeks of amendment, they \npassed it, and now this bill sits ready for our approval.\n  Will we vote on it? That would seem the obvious thing. Let's vote on \ncampaign finance reform, up or down. We are going to have it or we are \nnot. If we can pass it, let's send it to the President. Let's try to \nmake sure that we achieve at least one thing in this legislative \nsession. And yet it is not likely we will ever see that opportunity. It \nis not likely because under the rules of the Senate procedurally you \ncan basically stop a vote. I hope that doesn't happen. I hope we have \nan opportunity for the yeas and nays on this question, an up-or-down \nvote. Let the Senators of both parties be on record before they go \nhome. Are they in favor of reform or would they want to obfuscate this \nissue, cover it up with rhetoric? Try to say to the voters back home: \nYou just don't understand; it is much more complicated.\n  I hope that doesn't occur. I hope that we will have the up-or-down \nvote. I hope the men and women of the Senate, Democrats and \nRepublicans, will cast their vote on this issue of campaign finance \nreform. I do believe what is at stake here is more than just a \nbipartisan bill. Senator McCain of Arizona and Senator Feingold of \nWisconsin are the chief sponsors. At stake here is the question of the \nfuture of this democracy. We are just a few scant weeks away from an \nimportant election, an election which will ask the American people to \nmake their choices again.\n  I guess it sounds almost hackneyed now to talk about the legacy that \nwe have in this country, that we so often take for granted.\n  I can recall just a few years ago when I was given an opportunity to \nvisit the tiny country where my mother was born, the country of \nLithuania. Lithuania, which has for over 50 years been under Soviet \ndomination, was given for the first time a chance at democracy, the \nfirst time in half a century. I was there as then-President Gorbachev \nsent\n\n[[Page S10078]]\n\nin the tanks in an effort to quell this democratic movement, and, \nfortunately, he was not successful. People of that country risked their \nlives. They certainly risked their political futures because they \nwanted to vote. They wanted to elect their leaders. It was gratifying \nthat they would invite me and others from the United States, because we \nrepresented to them what this was all about--democracy, the people \nspeaking.\n  I found it curious. As each one of these leaders would emerge in \nthese new countries, they would visit around the world, but the first \nstop would always be right here in this building, on Capitol Hill, \nbefore a joint session of Congress. Whether it was Lech Walesa, Vaclav \nHavel, the leaders of the Philippines and other places, in order to \nvalidate their democratic experiment, in order to come to what they \nconsidered to be the cradle of liberty, they came here to this \nbuilding. They recognized in our country what many of our citizens are \nfailing to recognize--what this democracy really means and what it is \nall about.\n\n  There are some who will argue this issue and say that the speech I \nhave just made is too idealistic, it is way beyond practical politics. \nThey are right. It is about ideals. It is about the democratic ideals \nthat are at stake if we don't reform this system. I hope those who \noppose this bill will in all fairness give us a chance for an up-or-\ndown vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the first amendment to the Constitution of \nthe United States reads in relevant part:\n\n       Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech \n     or of the press.\n\n  No law, Mr. President, and I pick up this relatively long and \ndetailed proposal for a new law, and I read the title of one of the \nsections, the title appearing on page 16: ``Prohibition of Corporate \nand Labor Disbursements for Electioneering Communications.'' Let me \nread that once again, Mr. President. Section 200B of this bill is a \n``Prohibition of Corporate and Labor Disbursements for Electioneering \nCommunications.''\n  Now, what is an electioneering communication? According to the bill, \nand again I quote, ``electioneering communication means any broadcast \nfrom a television or radio broadcast station which refers to a clearly \nidentified candidate for Federal office; is made or scheduled to be \nmade within 60 days before a general, special, or runoff election for \nsuch Federal office.''\n  Mr. President, I go back to the first amendment. The first amendment \nsays:\n\n       Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech \n     or of the press.\n\n  It is impossible for me to see how the proponents of this legislation \ncan claim that these detailed restrictions on what corporations or \nlabor unions and within the body of the bill, individuals, political \nparties or organizations, can do when they are communicating about an \nelection and so much as naming a political candidate.\n  The American Civil Liberties Union, in writing about this provision \nin connection with last February's debate, wrote:\n\n       This unprecedented provision is an impermissible effort to \n     regulate issue speech which contains not a whisper of express \n     advocacy simply because it refers to a Federal candidate who, \n     more often than not, is a congressional incumbent during an \n     election season.\n\n  This argument doesn't even go to the desirability of such a provision \nbut simply to the fact that it is clearly a violation of the first \namendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  One can go beyond that and wonder why this phrase ``electioneering \ncommunication'' only applies to radio and television. I think at the \ntime of our previous debate the definition was broader than that. But \nhere we have a situation in which a particular form of communication \nabout public issues--of speech about public issues--is banned but an \nidentical speech about the same public issues using the same words is \nnot banned or controlled in any respect whatsoever--radio and \ntelevision; not newspapers, not handbills, not direct mail. I believe \nit is likely that these provisions would be found unconstitutional if \nonly because of that distinction without a difference between forms of \ncommunication; that if one form of communication is allowed, how can \nyou possibly prohibit another form of communication?\n  The rationale, I believe, is that the sponsors of this provision \nbelieve that radio and television communication is somehow more \neffective than other forms of communication and so they will ban it \nonly. But the fundamental position of the opponents to this bill is \nthat this whole section, the whole subtitle dealing with independent \nand coordinated expenditures, dealing with what can and cannot be done \nwithin 30 days of a primary election and 60 days of the general \nelection, clearly abridges the ``freedom of speech'' clause of the \nfirst amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n  In both Congress and the courts, there have been frequent appeals to \ncertain limitations on certain forms of speech and the broadest \ndefinition of that word when that speech is asserted to be obscene. \nMuch of that debate revolves around whether or not James Madison and \nthe Founding Fathers would have protected certain forms of speech--\nobscenity, even advertising and the like. We debated that issue in \nconnection with proposed tobacco legislation earlier this year. But \nclearly the draftsmen of the first amendment, the Founding Fathers, \nwere absolutely certain and clear in their belief that political \nspeech, the debate about political ideas, be absolutely free and \nunfettered. And they succeeded in doing just exactly that.\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, the Court said:\n\n       A restriction on the amount of money a person or group can \n     spend on political communication during a campaign \n     necessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting \n     the number of issues discussed, the depth of their \n     exploration, and the size of the audience reached. This is \n     because virtually every means of communicating ideas in \n     today's mass society requires the expenditure of money.\n\n  I may return to this issue in a few moments, but it does represent \nonly one-half--one section of this bill. The other element of the bill, \nthe prohibition of what is called ``soft money,'' probably is not \nsubject to the same constitutional strictures. It is simply \noverwhelmingly undesirable. Congress, in 1974, in a portion of its \ncampaign finance regulations passed in that year, limited the amount of \nmoney that one individual could give to another individual's political \ncampaign for Federal office. That portion of the 1974 statute was found \nto be valid, though the limitations on actual expenditures by a given \ncandidate from that candidate's own money or from other sources was \nfound to be invalid, under the Constitution, for the very reasons that \nI have just read, from the Supreme Court's opinion in Buckley v. Valeo.\n\n  What has been the inevitable result of those restrictions? What has \nbeen the inevitable result of those restrictions as the limitations \npassed in 1974 have shrunk by the operation of inflation in our society \nso that the $1,000 per individual per campaign limitation in 1974 is \nworth roughly $380 or $390 today? Mr. President, the response on the \npart of people who feel strongly about political ideas and about \npolitical campaigns has been to cause them to switch a great deal of \ntheir support from individual candidates to the political parties under \nwhose aegis those candidates run for office.\n  Now, I think that this is, at least, a modest step in the wrong \ndirection. Why? Because, of course, every dollar spent by a candidate--\nwhether that candidate has written a check out of his or her own pocket \nor whether or not that money has been solicited from others--every \ndollar spent by an individual candidate on a communication is subject \nto criticism from the newspapers, television stations, and from other \ncandidates to exactly the extent that it is deceptive or dodges the \nperceived real issues in a political campaign. Each candidate, in other \nwords, can be held responsible, and candidates are generally held \nresponsible, for the quality of their own communications. A candidate, \nhowever, cannot nearly so easily be held responsible for communications \ncoming from that candidate's party. So to exactly the extent that we \nhave limited--have choked off the ability of candidates other than the \nwealthiest of those candidates to raise--\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S10079]]\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Let me first express my admiration for the Senator from \nWashington's interest in first amendment and free speech issues, and \nhis very careful presentation.\n  I would just like to ask, in light of his earlier comments, if he \nbelieves the Buckley v. Valeo decision was correctly decided?\n  Mr. GORTON. He does, though in this case I am not sure that Buckley \nv. Valeo would have been so decided, even with respect to the \nlimitation on contributions to individual candidates, had those \nlimitations been, say, $380 or $390 today. That is to say, a \nrestriction or a limitation that is constitutional under one set of \ncircumstances could easily find itself to be unconstitutional under \nanother set of circumstances, if the Court deemed those limitations to \nbe unreasonably restrictive.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I recognize the point that in Buckley v. \nValeo the Court did suggest that there was some magnitude of \ncontribution that might be needed to constitute a corrupting influence \non the political process. But the Senator apparently accepts the notion \nthat it is constitutional to have some kind of limitation on what a \nperson can give to a candidate.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is the decision in Buckley v. Valeo, and while I \nquestion the wisdom of the limitation, I don't question the \nconstitutionality.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I think the Senator has been--if I can continue, Mr. \nPresident--has been very candid on the floor as to whether it would be \nconstitutional to prohibit soft money contributions. I think you have \nspoken to that. Correct me if I am wrong, but I believe you have \nindicated you believe that, under Buckley v. Valeo, it would be \nconstitutional to do that although it may not be wise to do so. Is that \na fair statement of the Senator's position?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. The point the Senator from Washington was making was \nsimply this, Mr. President: That limitations, constitutional as they \nmay be, on the ability of candidates, other than those who can finance \ntheir own campaigns, to solicit money from others, has forced that \nmoney into a channel in which the electioneering communications are far \nless the responsibility of the individual candidate than they are when \nthat candidate spends for himself.\n  From a public policy point of view, it is the view of this Senator at \nleast that money spent by political parties is less desirable because \nthere is less responsibility for it than money spent by individual \ncandidates. But of course those aren't the only two alternatives for \nspending money for political purposes.\n  As and when these limitations on contributions to political parties \nbecome law, to the extent they are found constitutional, the interest \nof those who feel a vital necessity to communicate political ideas to \nadvance causes of either ideas or for candidates is not going to be \neliminated, it is not even going to be diminished.\n  What do we have under those circumstances, Mr. President? Under those \ncircumstances, we have the individual who can no longer give a \nsignificant amount of money to a candidate of his or her choice, can no \nlonger give what he or she considers a sufficient amount to the \npolitical party of that candidate engaged in one or two other political \nactivities: Either in independent expenditures on behalf of an \nindividual candidate or an idea or in issue advocacy. Under those \ncircumstances, the communications are even less the responsibility of \nthe candidate who benefits from them than they are when the money is \nspent by that candidate's political party.\n  The political party is not responsible for the content of any such \nelectioneering communications either, but we then get to the very \nunconstitutional limitations on express advocacy that are included in \nthis bill. The sponsors of the bill run up against the fact that the \nlimitations that they can impose constitutionally simply force money \nused on politics into areas that they cannot constitutionally touch \nbecause the Constitution says Congress shall make no law abridging the \nfreedom of speech.\n  The amount of money spent on political ideas and political advocacy \nis no less--in fact, in many respects it may be more--it is simply that \nit is, for all practical purposes, impossible to criticize a candidate \nfor money that is, for all practical purposes, being spent on behalf of \nthat candidate.\n\n  That, Mr. President, is the fundamental reason that even those \nportions of this bill which are arguably constitutional are highly \nundesirable. They will not lessen the amount of money spent during the \ncourse of political campaigns. They will make the spending of that \nmoney less responsible than it is at the present time. They have \nnothing to do with an argument about corruption, other than to \nencourage the kind of subterfuge which so marked the 1996 elections.\n  If, for example, the money spent in 1996 could have been legally \ngiven directly to the candidates and disclosed at the time, we wouldn't \nbe in the midst of one more search for an independent counsel to \nexamine the results of those elections.\n  The net results of this bill, it seems to me, are twofold: They are \nto force political money into less and less responsible channels in \nwhich disclosure is less than it is at the present time and, to the \nextent that they attempt to control those expenditures, to come afoul \nof the first amendment to the Constitution of the United States. No, \nMr. President, we would be far, far better off in encouraging, rather \nthan discouraging, contributions directly to candidates and requiring \ntheir immediate disclosure, and in encouraging rather than discouraging \nsupport of our political parties.\n  Most of us who are engaged in partisan politics through most of our \ncareers have been exposed to the academic proposition, at least, that \none of the shortcomings of the American political system, in comparison \nwith the parliamentary systems of most other democracies, is the almost \ntotal absence of party discipline and party responsibility. We are \noften criticized for the fact that each one of us as an individual--\nthat a voter cannot be at all certain when he or she votes for a \ncandidate of the Republican Party, or the Democratic Party, for that \nmatter, that they will get what they believe to be the platform of that \npolitical party adopted, because the candidates, in each case, are \nindependent agents.\n  Most academics would ask us to increase the power, the degree of \ninfluence, of political parties over their members, especially over \ntheir elected officials, so that we could have a brighter line of \ndistinction between the parties and their platforms, so that voters \nwould have what they consider to be a more significant choice.\n  I may say that I don't necessarily buy that argument. I am not sure I \nbuy it at all. But there are few arguments put forward by either \nacademics or, I think, by practicing politicians that political party \norganizations of the United States should be weaker and of less account \nthan they are today.\n  This bill, to the extent that it is constitutional, weakens, \nmarginalizes, almost eliminates, the effect of political party \norganizations, and it does so to exactly the extent that it increases \nthe authority and the influence of nonparty organizations of the most \nnarrow of special interest organizations in political campaigns.\n  No, Mr. President, we should strengthen the candidates' \norganizations. We should require candidates to be more responsible for \nthe money that is spent on their behalf, and we should probably be \nstrengthening political party organizations at the same time.\n  What we do in this bill is to continue the weakening of the \ncandidates, to add to that the weakening of the parties, and we \nencourage, because of the unconstitutional nature of the second part of \nthis bill, the portion of spending in our political system for which \nthe spenders and the political parties and the candidates are least \naccountable.\n  This bill is no better than it was in February when it was defeated. \nIt is no better than it was nearly 2 years ago when it was defeated.\n  The comments during the course of the debate a year ago last fall \nfrom George Will are as applicable today as they were then. And I will \nconclude by quoting him:\n\n       Nothing in American history--not the left's recent campus \n     ``speech codes,'' nor the right's depredations during 1950s \n     McCarthyism, or the 1920s ``red scare,'' not the Alien\n\n[[Page S10080]]\n\n     and Sedition Acts of the 1790s--matches the menace to the \n     First Amendment posed by campaign ``reforms'' advancing under \n     the protective coloration of political hygiene.\n\n  That was true last year. It is true this year. It will be true next \nyear. It is the fundamental reason that this bill violating first \namendment rights of free speech should be rejected by this body once \nagain.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator has yielded the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I was wondering if the Senator would briefly be willing \nto continue the discussion of the constitutional issues.\n  Mr. President, I appreciated the Senator's candid responses on the \nrelationship of the Buckley v. Valeo decision to the issues of \ncontributions. He also talked a little bit about corporate and union \nspending and what should be done there.\n  Does the Senator have a constitutional problem with the current law's \nban on corporate union spending in connection with Federal elections?\n  Mr. GORTON. This Senator has some question on that subject, but this \nSenator is completely convinced that, as undesirable as he regarded the \npolitical campaigns in 1996 by labor unions, that they were, are, and \nwill remain completely constitutional, totally within the rights of \nthose unions, and that they cannot be restricted in any respect \nwhatsoever by the Congress.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is the Senator aware that since 1904 corporations have \nnot been able to make contributions directly, and since 1943 labor \nunions cannot? That is current law.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is current law, but that has to do with the direct \ncontribution to a candidate. It has nothing to do with the express \nadvocacy that is covered by the second part of this bill.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. If the corporation or union simply ran campaign ads, \nthe prohibition would apply as well, would it not?\n  Mr. GORTON. It is very difficult to see the difference between what \nwas done during the course of the 1996 elections in direct campaign \nads, and they were distinctions without a difference.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. That is exactly the point.\n  To continue, is that not a reason that a majority of this body, as \nexpressed in the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, believes that this is a very \nsimple and logical extension on the ban of corporate and union \ncampaigning by saying that a corporation and union cannot directly fund \nissue ads that directly mention a candidate's name in the last 60 days? \nIs that not simply an extension of, in effect, what has always been the \nlaw?\n  Mr. GORTON. No, I do not believe under any circumstances that it is. \nThere is an absolute prohibition against so much as mentioning the name \nof a candidate in a 60-day period before an election in this bill. I \nsimply refer the Senator to the first amendment. If that is not a law \nabridging the freedom of speech, we could not pass a law abridging the \nfreedom of speech. Any other limitation or restriction would be valid. \nIt flies directly into the teeth of the plain meaning of the first \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. It is interesting that the Senator makes that comment \nbecause a few years ago, for example, there was no question that Philip \nMorris could not write out a million-dollar check and run ads like \nthat, but somehow now it is almost standard practice. Somehow the law \nhas been moved away from almost a century-long prohibition on corporate \nspending in connection with Federal elections to the ability to have \nunlimited spending on Federal elections through the ruse of pretending \nthat an issue ad is an issue ad when it actually does everything but \nsay the words, of course, ``vote for'' or ``vote against'' a certain \ncandidate.\n  Isn't that just, in effect, eliminating the whole corporate \nprohibition that has existed for such----\n  Mr. GORTON. The quarrel that the Senator from Wisconsin has is not \nwith this Senator but the Supreme Court of the United States and the \nfirst amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, that is exactly what we would hope to \ndetermine with the passage of this bill. We would find out if in fact \nthe Supreme Court would find that an ad that does everything to promote \na candidate or attack a candidate but say ``vote for'' really is an \nissue ad. That would be a matter for the Supreme Court to determine.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nWashington in responding to a series of questions.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Bryan, be \nadded as a cosponsor of the McCain-Feingold amendment before the body.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Wisconsin, and I \nthank him and the senior Senator from Arizona for their leadership on \ncampaign finance reform. They have been faithful to the cause. They \nhave been leaders on the floor and they have, I think, engaged the \nAmerican people at long last in a colloquy so that I believe, as I will \ncomment later in my remarks, the American public now has a better \nunderstanding of what is at issue here.\n  Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor and strong supporter of \nthe legislation brought to the floor by Senators McCain and Feingold. I \nmust say that I am pleased--``overjoyed'' may be an understatement--\nthat the Senate has at last an opportunity to revisit this issue.\n  Although campaign finance reform has been derailed in the past by a \nperennial filibuster, the event of passage of the Shays-Meehan \nlegislation in the House has provided us with a golden opportunity to \nmove past the procedural maneuvering that has obstructed this important \nlegislation for far too long.\n  The volume of evidence from our most recent Federal elections clearly \ndemonstrates that our current system has spiraled completely out of \ncontrol. It is no longer a system of rules but a system of loopholes, \nand through these loopholes has poured a staggering amount of money \nthat continues to escalate each and every campaign cycle.\n  We no longer have a system in which candidates are encouraged to \ndebate their records and their positions on the issues. We no longer \nhave a system in which candidates are encouraged to look for votes by \nshaking hands at a coffee shop or greeting workers at a factory gate \nand knocking door to door at residents' homes.\n  Sadly, the system in place today encourages candidates to look not \nfor votes but for money. It is a money chase, Mr. President. And all of \nus are part of this unsavory system. And only we can change it. It is a \nshameless and demeaning system. And that just speaks to the \nextraordinary sums of money that candidates themselves are required to \nraise and spend.\n  Add to that the millions and millions of dollars raised and spent by \nthe national political parties and outside special interest groups who \nhave perfected the art of saturating an entire State with political ads \nmonths and months before the election day.\n  Mr. President, those who continue to oppose meaningful campaign \nfinance reform must be living in a different world. I simply cannot \nfathom how anyone can look at the chaos of our past and current \nelections and suggest that the response of the U.S. Senate should be to \ndo nothing.\n  During the recent August recess, I had the opportunity to travel \nwidely throughout my home State of Nevada and to meet face to face with \nthousands of my constituents. In fact, by automobile I traveled more \nthan 3,000 miles through Nevada, visiting with some of the smallest \ncommunities in our State and holding 17 townhall meetings during the \ncourse of this recess.\n  Time and time again, the issue of campaign finance reform was raised \nat these townhall meetings. It was deeply unsettling to see firsthand \nhow disgusted the American people are with the absolute scandal taking \nplace in our campaign finance system. These were not politicians \ntalking about the need for reform. These were ordinary people who have \nbecome so disillusioned with our political process that they no longer \nfeel any sort of connection to our democratic system. This is a \ndangerous threat to democracy itself.\n\n  Let me also point out that as often as this issue was raised, not a \nsingle person, not one, expressed opposition\n\n[[Page S10081]]\n\nto the McCain-Feingold bill on campaign finance reform. No one. \nAbsolutely no one.\n  Thankfully, the House of Representatives has provided us with the \nopportunity to at least stop the hemorrhaging of our current finance \nsystem. Several weeks ago, on a strong, bipartisan vote, the House \npassed the Shays-Meehan bill which was modeled on the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation before us today. This was not just a handful of Republicans \nvoting with Democrats to pass this legislation. In point of fact, one \nquarter of the entire House Republican conference voted for that \nbipartisan bill which passed by a margin of 252-179.\n  Now, I have heard some of our colleagues, in expressing opposition to \ncampaign finance reform, argue that just because the House has passed \nthis legislation, it does not mean we should do so. I must say I have a \ndifferent interpretation of the present situation. Shame on the Senate \nfor not passing campaign finance reform in the past; shame on the \nSenate if we refuse to do so now when we have the opportunity to do so.\n  Some of us, myself included, would have preferred more comprehensive \nreform legislation than McCain-Feingold offers. But it is an important \nstep, a vital step, on the road to campaign finance reform. Its \ncenterpiece is the ban on the so-called soft money. Banning these \nunlimited and unregulated contributions would represent the most \nimportant political reform enacted by the Congress in more than two \ndecades. Let me repeat this: Banning these unlimited and unregulated \ncontributions would represent the most important political reform \nenacted by the Congress in more than two decades.\n  Despite the 3-year long filibuster of this legislation, we have heard \nvery few opponents come down to the floor and stand up and defend the \nvirtues of a $250,000 in soft money contribution or more. Soft money is \nan embarrassment to the American political system. It is the mother of \nall campaign finance loopholes and perhaps the most ingenious money-\nlaundering system in history. Soft money as we know it refers to the \nunlimited and unregulated contributions from corporations, labor unions \nand wealthy individuals that flow to the political parties, unchecked \nand unregulated, outside the accepted contribution limits and reporting \nrequirements of Federal law. This soft money, with little or no \ndisclosure, is then poured into what have become known as issue ads, a \nnickname given to television and radio advertisements that skirt \nFederal election laws and fall under no regulations. This money is \nraised and spent with virtually no limits and no disclosure.\n  How much soft money can be contributed? Sadly, the sky is truly the \nlimit. In fact, there are no limits to this incredulous, bizarre \nsystem. In 1992, just 6 years ago, the two parties raised and spent a \ncombined $86 million in soft money. In just 4 years, soft money more \nthan tripled, exploding from $86 million in 1992 to $262 million in \n1996; $260 million that was raised and spent, completely outside the \nscope of Federal election law.\n  Perhaps the only thing worse than to know how this soft money is \nraised is to know how this soft money is being spent. In recent years, \nthe airways have been bombarded, saturated with political ads paid for \nwith soft money. These political ads specialize in shredding various \ncandidates without telling the viewers who paid for the ad, where the \nmoney came from, and who was responsible for its content.\n  It should come as no surprise to any of us that more and more \nAmericans are repulsed by these anonymous assaults and the sheer volume \nof money pouring into our election system. As a consequence, they are \ndistancing themselves from the political process. That is the greatest \ntragedy of all. Americans are so turned off by our political system \nthat they don't even vote on election day. When they do vote, often it \nis not the sense of voting for the better of two candidates; it is a \nperception that they are voting for the lesser of two evils on the \nballot.\n  With a tidal wave of campaign cash flowing into our political system, \nthe torrent of negative advertising on the airways, and the lack of \nmeaningful disclosure or accountability, it is becoming increasingly \ndifficult, almost impossible, for the American people to feel good \nabout any candidate, or their participation in the democratic process.\n  Just last week, in my home State of Nevada, we had a critically \nimportant primary election. Not only is there an open gubernatorial \nseat in a hotly contested primary, there were primaries for the U.S. \nSenate, an open House seat, and a number of seats in the State \nlegislature. I am sad to report that only 28 percent of all registered \nvoters in Nevada turned out for this election--28 percent. Let me make \nan important distinction. That is not 28 percent of all Nevadans who \nwere eligible to register and to participate in the system. That is 28 \npercent of those who are actually registered. This is a tragedy. It is \nnot good for our system. Seventy-two percent of all registered voters \nin Nevada did not vote. And Nevada is not alone.\n  I have heard it said that if one looks at the entire primary election \ncycle this year--and I presume they are factoring in those who are \neligible to register and chose not to do so, as well as those who are \neligible to vote, having registered but chose not to vote--less than 17 \npercent of the people in America have participated in the electoral \nprocess this year. This is a disaster wherever one comes down in the \npolitical scale. Whether one registers himself or herself more closely \naligned with Democrats or Republicans, independent Americans or \nLibertarians, wishes to revive the old Know Nothing party, would like \nto see the old Whig party revived, or want to be part of the avant \ngarde 1990s and become a member of the vegetarian party, wherever one \ncomes down on the political spectrum, 72 percent of those registered to \nvote not participating is a system that we cannot sustain and still \nhave a representative democracy in America.\n  In addition to cutting down the soft money system, the McCain-\nFeingold proposal would place significant restriction on the issue ads \nwhich I have just described. Under the Snowe-Jeffords modification, if \na radio or television advertisement mentions a candidate's name within \n30 days of a primary election or 60 days of a general election, the \nfunds used to pay for that advertisement must be raised under Federal \nelection law and must be fully disclosed. Some outside organizations \nhave suggested that they have a constitutional right to freely discuss \nan issue with the electorate. I agree. In fact, under this legislation, \nany organization can run an advertisement on any issue they want--\nwhether it is health care reform, gun control, or any other issue--with \nno restrictions.\n  That is a true issue ad and a sort of communication that the Supreme \nCourt has said is free from government regulation, and properly so. The \nSupreme Court has also said that we can regulate advertisements that \nare not meant to advocate issues, but instead are meant to advocate \ncandidates. That is what this legislation provides. True issue ads \nwould be exempt from this legislation. However, if an organization \nchooses to run an ad in the weeks before an election, and if that ad is \nclearly designed to advocate for or against a particular candidate who \nis involved in that election, this legislation will define that \nactivity as election related, and the money used for those ads will be \nrequired to be raised and spent under the provisions of Federal \nelection law.\n  Finally, in addition to banning soft money and enacting tough \nrestrictions on candidate ads, the legislation includes a number of \nprovisions that will improve the disclosure of fundraising activities \nand provide the Federal Election Commission with greater tools to \ndetect and to investigate campaign finance abuses.\n  Unfortunately, it appears that once again it will require 60 votes to \nmove this important legislation through the U.S. Senate. I, for one, \nwould like to see us move past these procedural games and start having \nreal votes and real issues and debate campaign finance reform on the \nmerits, on the substance. Let's vote on whether or not we should ban \nall soft money. Let's vote on whether these thinly disguised attack ads \nshould be considered election and campaign ads subject to Federal \nelection law, and let's vote on whether we should strengthen our \ndisclosure requirements under the Federal Election Commission and \nprovide that Commission with greater tools to ensure that\n\n[[Page S10082]]\n\nall candidates and all parties and outside groups are playing by the \nrules.\n  After the outrageous amount of money spent in the 1996 election, \nafter all the charges and countercharges of abuse, impropriety and quid \npro quo, and after what we have already witnessed in the opening months \nof the election season this year, it would be appalling, in my \njudgment, if the 105th Congress were to adjourn without passing a \nsingle reform of this deplorable system.\n  Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the McCain-Feingold \nlegislation and begin the process of restoring a sense of integrity and \nconfidence to our democratic process.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GORTON. Madam President, I note that at least two Senators are on \nthe floor who wish to introduce a resolution on another subject, a \nsubject that I think is appropriate. At this point, I yield to the \nSenator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of the remarks of the Senator from Missouri, I be granted \ntime to express my support for what he is about to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10060-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10082-S10084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING MARK McGWIRE OF THE ST. LOUIS CARDINALS FOR BREAKING THE \n                        HISTORIC HOME RUN RECORD\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 273.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 273) recognizing the historic home \n     run record set by Mark McGwire of the St. Louis Cardinals on \n     September 8, 1998.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, it is a great honor and with pleasure that \nI introduce this resolution for myself, Mr. Ashcroft, the Senator from \nCalifornia, and others who may wish to join us.\n  Yesterday, I was on this floor describing a very difficult \npredicament that Major League baseball was encountering. It seemed, as \nof early yesterday morning, that the Internal Revenue Service might say \nthat a fan who caught a historic home run ball hit by Mark McGwire and \nturned it back to him might be liable for $150,000 or more in gift \ntaxes on that ball. We pointed out that that made no sense. I am proud \nto say that we had bipartisan support for that proposition, Madam \nPresident. There are very few things that have brought this Chamber \ntogether more than that one simple proposition.\n  I was very pleased yesterday afternoon to have a call from \nCommissioner Rossotti of the IRS, who understood the magnitude of the \nproblem this could cause. He advised me that he has issued a release \nfrom the IRS saying that, while resolving gift tax issues is as \ndifficult as figuring out the infield fly rule, it made sense that we \ncongratulate a fan who returns the baseball rather than hit him with \ntaxes. That is particularly good news to Deni Allen, a 22-year-old \nmarketing representative from Ozark, MO, Mike Davidson, a 28-year-old \nSt. Louis native, and Tim Forneris, a 22-year-old from Collinsville, \nIL, a member of the St. Louis grounds crew. They all just wanted to \ngive Mark McGwire the baseball and didn't want to be taxed on it. \nThanks to the support of this body and the action of the Commissioner, \nthey will not be taxed. I am very pleased with that.\n  I was also pleased to join many friends and colleagues last night in \nrooting for the historic home run hit by Mark McGwire. Mark McGwire's \nachievements are there for all to see on television, or to read about \nin the sports page, because this is one tremendous athlete. He hit home \nrun ball No. 62 in his 144th game of the season.\n  The purpose of our resolution is to recognize that historic \ncontribution to baseball. But I also want to just spend a minute on \nMark McGwire, the person. I have in my hand a copy of Sports \nIllustrated, which features a picture of Mark McGwire and his son, Matt \nMcGwire. The article is entitled ``One Cool Dad.'' I think a lot of \npeople who watched Mark McGwire in the year he has been in St. Louis, \nand probably before that in California, know that he is a dedicated \nfather and he is a community leader. He has shown his willingness to \nserve his community by his generosity.\n  This man is a great role model for young people in our country today, \nand the way he approached this record-setting mark, with due \nrecognition for Roger Maris--also a tremendous athlete, one I greatly \nrespected, who held the record prior to him--reflects extremely well on \nMr. McGwire. I hope that I will have many cosponsors who will join in \nthis resolution. I see several colleagues on the floor who want to \ndiscuss it, but suffice it to say that Mark McGwire has made a historic \ncontribution to baseball. He has brought the country together. The only \nthing we are talking about in Missouri is Mark McGwire, not a lot of \nthe other problems. His dedication to leadership and family values, his \nspirit of community contribution and leadership mark him as an \noutstanding gentleman who I trust all of us in this body are willing to \nrecognize.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Missouri for \nhis eloquent remarks, and I thank both Senators for introducing this \nresolution.\n  I rise to salute a native son of California, a man who grew up in the \nplaying fields of southern California, a graduate of California public \nschools and honed his skills at the University of Southern California \nand developed into a mature professional in Oakland, CA, where I saw \nhim play many a game; a man who has since settled in Missouri, but will \nalways remain a favorite son of California; a man who brought immense \ntalent, hard work, energy, enthusiasm and, above all, dignity and grace \nto one of America's most revered institutions.\n  I grew up, when I was a kid, six blocks from a Major League ballpark. \nI heard the sound of those home runs all through the years I was \ngrowing up. I went to many a game and sat in the bleachers. I am a \nbaseball fan. Yet, I haven't seen such excitement in so many years that \nwe have seen in the last month or so.\n  This man has really helped reinvigorate the game of baseball, further \nenshrining it as our national pastime. He has thrilled countless \nlifelong fans of baseball, and he has made millions of new fans who \nknew very little about the game. This is a man who has put us in touch \nwith baseball heroes of the past, and he has inspired baseball heroes \nof the future--a giant of a man, playing a game that we learned to love \nas children, and who has made us all feel like little kids again at a \ntime when we need that every once in a while. Of course, I speak of \nMark McGwire.\n  I think it is also important to recognize the Cubs' Sammy Sosa. Both \nof these men have pursued Babe Ruth's and Roger Maris' home run \nrecords, and they did it under intense pressure, but with grace and \njoy, rooting for each other, appreciating their fan support, and \ninfecting us all with good humor, poise and good sportsmanship.\n  Today is a day of heroes--one particular hero, Mark McGwire. I wanted \nto say on behalf of all of California--and I know Senator Feinstein \njoins me in this--that we are very proud of Mark McGwire.\n  In closing, I want to say that it is hard to join a nexus between one \nthing and another here. But I have two heroes here today on the floor \nof the Senate--Russ Feingold and John McCain--because I am really proud \nof the way they have pursued their goal, a goal that I think will make \nthis democracy stronger, a goal of good, solid campaign finance reform.\n  On the one hand, we laud the baseball heroes. I wanted to laud a \ncouple of Senate heroes of mine on campaign finance reform.\n\n[[Page S10083]]\n\n  Let me again thank the Senators from Missouri for giving us a chance \nto get to see this praise in writing in the Record for all time.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Madam President, let me extend my appreciation to the \nsenior Senator from the State of Missouri, Senator Bond, for having \npresenting this important resolution; and my thanks as well to the \nSenator from California, Senator Boxer.\n  I was elated when I saw what we had all anticipated for so long--that \nMark McGwire would learn uniquely how to pay the price for greatness, \nwould achieve something that some had said could never happen. We \nwatched and I watched in anticipation as I believe it was in the fourth \ninning last evening when the first pitch was, incidentally, not what I \nwould call a home run pitch. It looked to me like it was a borderline \nstrike zone, low and away, and Mark reached out and, on the low and \naway pitch, pulled the ball like a rifleshot over the wall in Busch \nStadium in St. Louis.\n  I stand today to commend him for his outstanding baseball. To see him \nand Sammy Sosa embrace and salute each other in a friendly kind of \ncompetition that brings out the very best is a story about what America \nreally needs and ought to be--how we don't have to be, because we are \nopponents, enemies. Those two are opponents in most every way and in \nevery sense of the word. But, my goodness, they are not enemies. They \nelevate each other's performance, and they bring out the best in each \nother. What a tremendous thing.\n  Of course, I was so happy to see this happen in St. Louis, MO, a city \nwhose baseball heritage is--well, frankly, it is just unparalleled; a \ncity with baseball fans who understand the game, who know what it means \nto take a pitch, to hit behind the runner, to make the sacrifice. They \nknow baseball. They know character. They saluted Mark McGwire last \nnight, and properly so.\n  I was very thrilled to see the Missouri fans be consistent in wanting \nto share the achievement with Mark McGwire, but not necessarily to take \nit from him, and the willingness of Missouri fans over and over again \nto give the baseballs back--to make them part of Mark's heritage and \nhistory, to make them part of the national treasure. It is kind of an \ninspiration at a time when some would lead us to believe that America \nis nothing but a place of greed.\n  Too often, sports heroes themselves have participated in the idea \nthat the memorabilia is so valuable that it is only to be sold. I think \nof these fans who would sort of teach some of our sports heroes lessons \nthat the memorabilia is so valuable that it is not to be sold but it is \nto be shared. I salute those in St. Louis who decided that this part of \nAmerican history was too valuable to be sold but it was so valuable \nthat it ought to be shared.\n  Let me make a few remarks about Mark.\n  In the pictures--and I just hope the rest of America sees these \npictures, if they haven't seen them--in the pictures we see a picture \nof what we need to be, how we need to think, and how we need to act. \nPerspective and balance are perhaps the most important characteristics \nof life. Knowing where you stand at the magic of the moment is \ncertainly a valuable thing. Understanding where you stand in the \nperspective of history is a valuable thing. Having a respect for the \nfuture is a valuable thing. In just one tight little moment there on \nnational television, as Mark McGwire finished rounding the bases, he \nshowed us that he was a person who not only understood the magic of the \nmoment--driving the ball over the left field wall and celebrating the \nincredible exhilaration and joy of that personal achievement, the \ncrowning achievement of years of training, practice, and insistent \npersistence toward a goal--he understood the magic of the moment, but \nhe also told us that he understood his place in history, because he \nwent to the stands and he embraced the family of Roger Maris. Roger, of \ncourse, died tragically young as a result of cancer. But his family was \nthere to understand not only his place in history but to understand \nthat history marches on. Mark McGwire not only understood the moment \nbut he understood his place in history. He embraced history.\n  America needs again to have a lesson in embracing history, in \nrespecting our past and understanding that it is only from the \ngreatness of our past that we draw inspiration for surpassing events in \nthe future.\n  What a tremendous thing that picture was of Mark McGwire with those \nhuge arms around the Roger Maris family.\n  Then, perhaps as inspiring as anything else, there was the fact that \nwhen he rounded the bases and was trading high fives, really before he \ngot into the serious commendations of the rest of his teammates, Mark \npicked up Matt, the future. He understood that, yes, the past is \nimportant, and the magic of the moment is to be cherished, but there is \nalso always the future that is ahead of us. He picks up young Matt, and \nhe elevates young Matt to a position above his father. What a \ntremendous picture that is. If we as Americans would have an \nunderstanding of our youngsters that we need to place them ahead of \nourselves, place their interests above our interests, invest in the \nfuture, if we would, indeed, hold up our youngsters and elevate them to \na place of understanding and the opportunities for greatness, what a \ntremendous lesson that would be.\n  So I really have a degree of excitement that is difficult to contain \nabout the tremendous lesson that we can all take out of the joy and \nexuberance of celebrating the achievements of one whose acts really \njust stun us and marvel us.\n  There is just one last point.\n  There were lots of people--I have been among them--who have said, \n``Well, Babe Ruth's record and Roger Maris' record''--Babe Ruth, if you \nwanted to count one game at one game level, and Roger Maris at \nanother--``would never be broken.'' I am kind of glad that Mark McGwire \nstraightened me out on the breakability of those records, because I \nbelieve that maybe as much as anything else, Mark McGwire tells us that \nthe best is yet to come, that every record in the book is one we should \nlook to break, that America is not a place whose primary and monumental \nachievements are all behind us, but America is a place where the best \nis yet to come.\n  Last night, Mark McGwire set a new record of 62 home runs. He might \nset another record the next time he bats. I am confident that he will \nset another record before the end of this season over and over and over \nagain.\n  I think part of the American spirit is such that we should all think \nabout America as a place where the best is yet to come. When we learn \nto pay the price, maybe when we have the balance and perspective that \nMark demonstrated, understanding the magic of the moment, respecting \nhistory, and having a full dedication to the fabulous future, maybe \nthat is when we will begin to understand that the best is yet to come \nand we can be part of it.\n  To Mark McGwire, to the fans of St. Louis, to Sammy Sosa, who \nhappened to be there when it happened and who, with such class, saluted \nMark, I say thanks for an inspiring game, which turns out to be a \nlesson teacher far bigger than just a game. I am delighted to commend \nthem and thank them for the greatness that they remind us should be a \npart of all that America is and stands for.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, \nwants to be added as a cosponsor to this resolution and to note that \nRoger Maris, who was a great hero in St. Louis, was a North Dakotan. We \nare very proud of the Maris family. We extend our very best wishes to \nSammy Sosa, and we hope he gets into the sixties.\n  If there are other Senators asking to add their names to the \nresolution, I would be happy to do that.\n  May I add the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, \nthe Senator from Utah, Senator Bennett, and I believe the Senator from \nConnecticut, as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I came to the floor to speak about \ncampaign finance reform, and I will do that\n\n[[Page S10084]]\n\nin a moment, but I thank my colleague from Missouri for adding me as a \ncosponsor of the resolution. As is obvious to my colleagues, I am \nneither from Missouri nor California, so my claim to being added is my \nstatus as a baseball fan. And even though my colleagues may think I am \nreaching, the fact is that when Roger Maris set the record I was in \ncollege together with the junior Senator from Missouri. So it gives me \nsome standing.\n  I do want to identify myself with his comments just to stress the \nobvious personal achievement here that has inspired the country, and \nalso the way in which Mark McGwire did it. It was an act of fate, but \nsomehow so correct, that he tied the record at the 61st homer on the \nday of his father's 61st birthday, because baseball, in my experience \nin this country, is very much a matter of one generation passing on the \nexperience to another.\n  My own memories of baseball, first memories, come from my dad taking \nme to games, and they are cherished memories. I can tell my \ncolleagues--I hope I am not violating her privacy--when my youngest \nchild was 4 days old, in March, I held her up to a TV set and said, \n``Sweetheart, this is baseball, and you're going to love it.'' \nFortunately, for me, she has, and we have shared that experience. As \nSenator Ashcroft indicated, Mark McGwire beautifully continued that \nwith his son there as a batboy.\n  The second is the obvious rapport between Mark McGwire and Sammy \nSosa, as they compete for this but do it with extraordinary mutual \nrespect. To make the point that is obvious but maybe still worth \nmaking, here we have one person whose family has been in this country a \nlong time, from a family of relative success and comfort, another a new \nAmerican born in poverty in another country, coming here, joined \ntogether in this remarkable American game to I think this year break \nrecords that were previously thought to be impossible.\n  And a final word about Roger Maris, who did set the record in the \nyounger days of both my life and Senator Ashcroft's life. I felt that \nMark McGwire probably brought the whole country to give more tribute to \nRoger Maris than he ever had before, and we owed it to him. So I am \nproud to be added as a cosponsor.\n  Did the Senator from Missouri wish to add anything before I proceed \nto the topic of campaign finance reform?\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. If so, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 273) with its preamble reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 273\n\n       Whereas, since becoming a St. Louis Cardinal in 1997, Mark \n     McGwire has helped to bring the national pastime of baseball \n     back to its original glory;\n       Whereas, Mark McGwire has shown leadership, family values, \n     dedication and a love of baseball as a team sport;\n       Whereas, in April, Mark McGwire began the season with a \n     home run in each of his first four games which tied Willie \n     Mays' 1971 National League record;\n       Whereas, in May, Mark McGwire hit a 545-foot home run, the \n     longest in Busch Stadium history;\n       Whereas, in June, Mark McGwire tied Reggie Jackson's record \n     of thirty-seven home runs before the All Star break;\n       Whereas, in August, Mark McGwire became the only player in \n     the history of baseball to hit fifty home runs in three \n     consecutive seasons;\n       Whereas, on September 5, Mark McGwire became the third \n     player ever to hit sixty home runs in a season; and\n       Whereas, on September 8, 1998, Mark McGwire broke Roger \n     Maris' thirty-seven year old home run record of sixty-one by \n     hitting number sixty-two off Steve Trachsel while playing the \n     Chicago Cubs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes and congratulates St. \n     Louis Cardinal, Mark McGwire, for setting baseballs' revered \n     home run record, with sixty-two, in his 144th game of the \n     season.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair, and I thank all of my colleagues for \ntheir courtesy in allowing me to proceed.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, if I may continue the stretch to link \nthe two subject matters, baseball and campaign finance reform, may I \nsay that unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers of old, those of us who support \nMcCain-Feingold are not willing to wait until next year, and since \nMcGwire and Sosa are setting the standard for doing what we thought was \nimpossible, we hope they are an eye-opener for those who think adopting \ncampaign finance reform is impossible for this Chamber this year.\n  I make the comparison without wanting to set it too closely, but \nwouldn't it be great when this is over if we could refer to McCain-\nFeingold as the legislative equivalent of McGwire and Sosa?\n  I will cease and desist and proceed with my remarks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10082-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10084-S10090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3554\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I rise to speak on behalf of McCain-Feingold, the \namendment offered, to thank my two colleagues for the extraordinary, \nprincipled, persistent, and practical leadership that they have given \nthis critical effort, and to urge my colleagues to support the cloture \nmotion that comes up tomorrow.\n  Madam President, we have a cherished principle in this country that \nevery person gets one and only one vote, that a citizen's influence on \nour government's decisions rests on the power of his or her ideas, not \nthe size of his or her pocketbook. The campaign finance system we have \non the books protects this privilege. May I repeat, the campaign \nfinance system we have on our law books protects this principle. It \nimposes strict limits on the amounts individuals can contribute to \nparties and to campaigns. The law prohibits unions and corporations \nfrom making most contributions or expenditures in connection with \nelections to Federal office, and it requires disclosure of money spent \nin advocating the election or defeat of candidates for Federal office.\n  That is what the campaign laws as they are on the books today \nrequire. But as we learned sadly during the 1996 campaigns and the \nvarious investigations that have followed, those laws appear to be \nwritten in invisible ink, which is to say that they have been honored, \nif one can use the term satirically, only in the breach. They have \nlargely been evaded.\n  It has been several months since the Governmental Affairs Committee's \ninvestigation into the 1996 campaigns ended, but none of us who were \npart of that investigation will forget, nor I hope will others forget, \nwhat we learned there or our feeling of outrage and embarrassment upon \nlearning it. We learned not only of hustlers like Johnny Chung, who saw \nthe White House like a subway--put some money in and the gates will \nopen, he said--or of opportunists like Roger Tamraz, who used big \ndollar donations to gain access that was originally denied to him by \npolicymakers at the same time he declined even to register to vote \nbecause he saw the vote which generations of Americans have fought and \ndied to protect as a meaningless exercise, a process which would gain \nhim no real power, particularly not when compared to the power that \n$300,000 would give him.\n  We also learned in the Governmental Affairs hearings last year of \nsomething that was in its way even more disturbing because it was more \npervasive and had a far greater effect on our elections and on our \ngovernment. We learned that we no longer have a campaign finance \nsystem, that the loopholes have become so large and so many that they \nhave taken over the entirety of the law, leaving us with little more \nthan a free-for-all money chase in its place. We learned last year that \nit was somehow possible, for example, for wealthy donors to give \nhundreds of thousands of dollars to finance campaigns, even though the \nlaw was clearly intended to limit their contributions to a tiny \nfraction of those sums. That is what the\n\n[[Page S10085]]\n\nlaw on the books says. It was possible for corporations and unions to \ndonate millions of dollars to the parties at the candidate's request \ndespite the decades-old prohibition on those entities' involvement in \nFederal campaigns. That is clearly on the law books. It was possible \nfor the two Presidential nominees to spend much of the fall shaking the \ndonor trees, even though they had pledged under the law, in this case \nthe Presidential campaign finance law, not to raise money for their \ncampaigns after receiving $62 million each in taxpayer funds. It was \npossible for tax-exempt groups to run millions of dollars worth of \ntelevision ads that clearly endorsed or attacked particular candidates, \neven though they were just as clearly barred by law from engaging in \nsuch partisan activity.\n\n  Madam President, the disappearance, if I may call it that, of our \ncampaign finance laws, which is to say the evasion of the clear intent \nof those laws, has serious consequences that none of us should \noverlook. Because our current system effectively has no limits on it, \nour political class, if you will, lives in a world in which a never-\nending pursuit for money is often the only road--the only perceived \nroad to survival. With each election cycle the competition for money \ngets fiercer and fiercer, the amounts needed to be spent get bigger and \nbigger, and consequently the amount of time Presidential candidates, \nnational party leaders, fundraisers--all of us need to raise for our \nparties gets greater and greater.\n  In the 1996 election cycle the national parties raised $262 million \nin so-called soft or unregulated money, 12 times what they raised in \n1984. And what about the current cycle, the 1997-1998 cycle? National \nparty committees in the first 18 months of the 1998 election cycle have \nraised almost $116 million in soft money, more than double the $50 \nmillion raised during a comparable period by national party committees \nin 1994, which was the last non-Presidential election cycle.\n  Let none of us deceive ourselves that this unrelenting and ever-\nescalating money chase has no impact on the integrity of our Government \nand the impression our constituents have of our Government and those of \nus who serve in it. That clearly is the sad story, told by the \nGovernmental Affairs investigation last year, and by the host of other \ninvestigations, journalistic and otherwise, that have been done of that \n1996 election. Our country is focused at this moment in our history on \nthe misconduct which our President acknowledged in his statement on \nAugust 17. The consequences of that misconduct were great, but that was \nthe failure of one person. The failure that we speak of today, on the \nother hand, if we do not act to correct it, belongs to us all. It is \nsystemic, and none of us should doubt that it will get worse unless we \ndo something to change it.\n  Senator McCain was right, the Senator from Arizona, when he said a \nwhile ago that probably the biggest scandal in Washington today is the \ncurrent state of our campaign finance laws. How can any of us justify a \nsystem in which our elected officials repeatedly appear at events \nexclusively available only to those who can give $50,000 or $100,000 or \nmore, amounts that are obviously out of reach for the average American \nand above the annual incomes, in fact, of so many of our citizens--the \nannual incomes of so many of our citizens. How can any of us justify a \nsystem in which we, public servants, must divert so much of our time \nfrom the people's business to the business of fundraising? How can we \njustify a system that has so disenchanted our constituents that, \naccording to an October 1997 Gallup survey, only 37 percent of \nAmericans believe that the best candidate wins elections; 59 percent \nbelieve elections are generally for sale; in which 77 percent of \nAmericans believe that their national leaders are most influenced by \npressure from their contributors, while only 17 percent believe we are \ninfluenced by what is in the best interests of our country? That is a \nsearing indictment of what we are devoting our lives to--public \nservice, the national interest; and it comes, I believe, directly from \nthe way in which we raise money for our campaigns, certainly at the \nPresidential and national level.\n  How can any of us justify not taking action, some action, to reform \nour campaign finance system this year, in this 105th session, after all \nof the time and energy and resources Members of both sides of the aisle \nhave spent investigating, in effect denouncing, the conditions that \nprevail under the current system? The fact is, I respectfully suggest, \nthat we cannot justify such a system and we cannot justify inaction.\n  In the additional views that I was privileged to submit to the \nGovernment Affairs Committee report on its investigation of the 1996 \ncampaigns, I wrote that I came away from that year-long investigation \nwith an overarching sense that our polity has fallen down a long, dark \nhole into a place that is far from the vision of values of those who \nfounded our democracy. I find it hard to see how others can come away \nfrom that experience, or any other experience which allows them to \nexamine what has become of our campaign finance laws, without reaching \na similar conclusion. We no longer live in a system in which every \ncitizen's vote counts equally, or anywhere near equally. Instead, we \nlive in a system in which what seems to matter most is how much money \nwe can raise.\n  It is time to act to restore a sense of integrity to our campaign \nfinance system, to restore the public's trust in it and us. This is not \na radical idea. All we are really asking is to restore our system to \nwhat it was meant to be, to what in fact the letter of Federal law is \ntoday: a system where individuals can participate in our political \nsystem, but they are limited in their ability to use their incomes to \ninfluence their Government; where only individuals, not corporations \nand unions, may use their money to directly influence our elections, \nand where we all know, through disclosure, who it is that is \ncontributing and the public may judge to what extent those \ncontributions are influencing our actions and our votes.\n  Madam President, I hope that our colleagues will do what most \nobservers seem to think we will not, which is to vote for cloture \ntomorrow to take up this bill and to clear this cloud from over our \npolitical system.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, we have heard a good deal in this \ndebate about people buying access to politicians. Indeed, there has \nbeen a tremendous amount of time and printer's ink and television \nsignals spent on debating how you buy access to a politician. I want to \nturn this debate around, for the sake of looking at it from a different \npoint of view. It may take me some time to do this because there has \nbeen so much expenditure in one direction, but I think the core of this \nissue requires us to look in another direction, and that is not access \nto the politician, but access to the voters.\n  Let me develop this for just a minute. We live in a democracy. \nUltimate power in a democracy lies with the voters. Madam President, \nwhen you and I wished to become an elected official, in order to get \nhere we have to have access to the voters, and this whole political \nprocess is about that challenge--how does the Presiding Officer gain \naccess to the voters of Maine in order to get her message across?\n  How do I get access to the voters of Utah in order to convince them \nthat I am a better person than others who are seeking this opportunity? \nThat is the focus that has never come into this debate. It is always \nassumed that the politicians are the constant and the voters somehow \nare the variable. It is, in fact, the other way around. The voters will \nalways be with us in a democracy. It is the politicians who come and go \nand who are variable, and the question of how a politician becomes an \nofficeholder depends entirely on how effectively the politician can get \nhis or her message across to the voters so the voters can then make a \nchoice.\n  What I am about to say for the next half hour to 45 minutes, will be \nfocused in a whole new direction than the direction that we have been \nhaving in this debate.\n  I begin, Madam President, by going back to a historical review of the \nwhole issue of money in politics. For this, I am dependent on a number \nof sources. One is the Wilson Quarterly published in the summer of \n1997, with the cover article being entitled ``Money In Politics, The \nOldest Connection.'' This gives us a historic point of view that will \nstart us off in this direction that I think we ought to explore.\n\n[[Page S10086]]\n\n  In this particular article, it points out that in the beginning of \nour Republic, a politician had access to the voters because he knew \nthem all. They all lived in his neighborhood. George Washington was \npersonally known to the people who voted to put him in Virginia's House \nof Burgesses. Thomas Jefferson was personally known to the people who \nhe would turn to for political support. He had no problem gaining \naccess to the voters.\n  I find it interesting, out of this Wilson Quarterly article, that \neven then, however, the subject of money did come up. If I can quote \nfrom the article:\n\n       George Washington spent about 25 pounds apiece on two \n     elections for the House of Burgesses, 39 pounds on another, \n     and nearly 50 pounds on a fourth, which was many times the \n     going price for a house or a plot of land.\n\n  Interestingly, many times the price of a house for a seat in the \nState legislature. Oh, what fun we could have with the rhetoric about \nthat in this Chamber when we are saying that a seat in the House was up \nfor sale.\n  Quoting from the article again:\n\n       Washington's electioneering expenses included the usual rum \n     punch, cookies and ginger cakes, money for the poll watcher \n     who recorded the votes, even one election-eve ball complete \n     with fiddler.\n\n  An interesting footnote about that appears in the article later \nrelating to one of Washington's fellow State members, James Madison. \nQuoting again from the article:\n\n       James Madison considered ``the corrupting influence of \n     spiritous liquors and other treats . . . inconsistent with \n     the purity of moral and republican principles.'' But \n     Virginians, the future president discovered, did not want ``a \n     more chaste mode of conducting elections.'' Putting him down \n     as prideful and cheap, the voters rejected his candidacy for \n     the Virginia House of Delegates in 1777. Leaders were \n     supposed to be generous gentlemen.\n\n  Madison decided to enforce his own form of campaign finance reform, \nrefused to treat the voters in Virginia, and they responded by refusing \nto send him to Virginia's House of Delegates.\n  As the country grew, obviously the circumstances changed. We got to \nthe point where no longer could a candidate announce for office and \nassume he would be known to all the voters. Even if he bought some rum \npunch or ginger cakes, he still could not sway voters' opinion and, as \nthe article says, quoting again:\n\n       Leadership was no longer just a matter of gentlemen \n     persuading one another; now, politicians had to sway the \n     crowd.\n\n  As the article goes on to point out:\n\n       In fact, the more democratic, the more inclusive the \n     campaign, the more it cost.\n\n  In that one sentence, we have a summary of the challenge of a \npolitician gaining access to the voters. I will repeat it:\n\n       . . . the more democratic, the more inclusive the campaign, \n     the more it cost.\n\n  Stop and think of the challenge today in that context where the \nSenator from New York has to reach millions, tens of millions, the \nSenator from California even more millions than that, in campaigns this \nfall. And the more democratic and more inclusive those campaigns are, \nthe more they will cost.\n  Cost to do what? To gain access to the voters; to get your message \nacross to the voters. The cost is directly connected with how \ndemocratic, how inclusive, and in the case of the larger States, how \nbig the electorate is going to be.\n  We come into the present century, and we find things are getting \nworse in terms of the high cost of reaching the voters. One of the \nthings, paradoxically, that has driven the cost of campaigns through \nthe roof has been the cause of campaign finance reform. The reforms \nthemselves have added to the burden of cost on a candidate who is \nseeking to have access to the voters.\n  Again from the article:\n\n       Some reforms, such as the push for nomination of \n     presidential and other candidates by primaries, made \n     campaigning even more expensive. Ultimately, the reformers' \n     decades-long efforts to improve the American political system \n     did at least as much harm as good. They weakened the role of \n     parties, lessened faith in popular politics, and hastened the \n     decline of voter participation.\n\n  I find that very interesting. A historical analysis of America's \npolitics written in an outstanding academic journal says that it has \nbeen the reformers' efforts that have ``weakened the role of parties, \nlessened faith in popular politics and hastened the decline of voter \nparticipation.'' We heard on this floor this morning the statement that \nvoter participation is going down, and the reason is because we do not \nhave campaign finance reform; indeed, that the more money we put into \npolitics, the less people vote and the lower the level of participation \nand that there is a direct correlation between the money chase and the \nvoters being turned off.\n  We were told that in the State of Arizona, they just had a primary \nthat set an all-time low for voter participation in this era when we \nhave an all-time high in spending.\n  Madam President, I offer the case of my own State and what happens \nwith respect to voter participation and money. If I can go back in my \nown political career, the one career I know better than any other, I \ncan tell the Members of the Senate that the highest voter participation \nin history in a primary in the State of Utah occurred in 1992 when I \nwas running for the Senate.\n  We had an open seat for the Senate, and originally five candidates on \nthe Republican side and two on the Democratic side. We had an open seat \nfor Governor, and originally there were five candidates for Governor on \nthe Republican side, and I believe three on the Democratic side, plus \nan independent thrown in who ran on a third party ticket.\n  By virtue of the Congressman in the Second District in Utah \nchallenging for the Senate seat, we had an open seat in Salt Lake City, \nthe media center of the State. So even though it was not a statewide \noffice, it nonetheless called for purchase of statewide media.\n  We had the largest spending amount of money in the history of the \nState as we went through that primary.\n  In the Senate primary alone--there were only two candidates, I say, \nbecause under Utah's law a convention eliminates all but two--we had \nthe highest expenditures in the State's history. My opponent spent $6.2 \nmillion in the primary in the State of Utah, setting an all-time record \nfor money spent per vote. I struggled by with second place in spending \nwith $2 million, which would have beaten the previous high if it had \nnot been for the amount of money my opponent was spending. So that is \nover $8 million spent on a Senate primary in the State of Utah that has \nfewer than 1 million voters.\n  At the same time, we had a heated race for Governor with primaries in \nboth parties. Fortunately, the gubernatorial candidates did not spend \nin the millions that the senatorial candidates did, but they spent a \nlot of money for a primary. And we had spending in the House race in \nthe Second Congressional District.\n  If we believe what we were told on the Senate floor this morning, \nthat should translate into the lowest voter turnout in history, people \nturned off by the money chase. But in fact it produced, as I said, the \nlargest voter turnout in the history of the State.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield to my friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Following the astute observations of the Senator from \nthe State of Utah, in fact that is where the correlation is, is it not? \nYear after year after year, we see that there is a direct correlation \nbetween spending and turnout, a fact that makes good sense. If there is \na contested election, with two well-financed candidates, the turnout \ngoes up. If very little money is spent, very little interest is \ngenerated and turnout goes down.\n  So I ask my friend from Utah if the Utah experience that he related \nto us is not almost always the case?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding that it is, Madam President. And \nI would like to underscore that point by going to the primary in 1998. \nIn 1998, there were no Senate candidates on the primary ballot from \neither party, I having eliminated my challenger within the party within \nthe convention, and my Democratic opponent having had no challenger in \nhis convention. We did not have a gubernatorial race. There was no \nchallenge in the Second Congressional District, which is in the large \nmedia market.\n  But there was a primary in the Third Congressional District, where \nthe incumbent Congressman was challenged by a gentleman who made it \nvery clear that he not only would not accept PAC\n\n[[Page s10087]]\n\nmoney, he would not accept party contributions, he would not accept \nindividual contributions. He said, ``I will take my message directly to \nthe people without accepting any money''--as he put it, in biblical \nterms--``gold and silver, from anyone.'' And the result of that primary \nwas the lowest turnout that anyone can recall.\n  His opponent did not spend any money. I talked to his opponent, the \nincumbent Congressman. I said, ``Aren't you going to spend anything?'' \nHe said, ``I'm nervous it will look like overkill if I do.'' He did \nspend a little money on a get-out-the-vote campaign, but he did not buy \nany ads. There were no television broadsides and no radio ads. Most of \nthe people in the district, by virtue of the lower spending, did not \nknow an election was going on, and you had the lowest turnout in Utah \nhistory in that district.\n  So I submit, Madam President, that at least on the basis of the \nanecdote with which I am the most familiar, the more participation that \nyou want, the more money you had better be prepared to spend. And if \nyou are in fact decrying the low level of turnout and the low level of \nparticipation and you want to do something about that, then you defeat \nthis amendment, because this amendment would take us down the road to \nfurther lowering the ability of candidates to access the voters and \nthereby let the voters know that an election is going on.\n  If I may go back to the historic pattern that I was outlining as to \nwhat has happened in this century, I would refer once again, Madam \nPresident, to the quote that I gave from the article in the Wilson \nQuarterly that ``the reformers' * * * efforts to improve the American \npolitical system did at least as much harm as good * * * and hastened \nthe decline of voter participation.''\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Twentieth-century politicking would prove to be far more \n     expensive than 19th-century . . . politics . . . And as the \n     century went on, politicians increasingly had to struggle to \n     be heard above the din from competing forms of entertainment \n     . . .\n\n  That is a very interesting way of putting it, Madam President. \nPoliticians had to compete with the din of competing forms of \nentertainment. If you read the history books, there was a time when \npolitics was the leading form of entertainment in this country. If you \nwere going to have a rally, a bonfire, something to do, you went out \nand got involved in politics. As other forms of communication and \nentertainment came along, it became increasingly difficult.\n  I have a personal experience I can share on this which is perhaps not \npolitical but which makes the point. I served as a missionary for the \nchurch to which I belong in the early 1950s. And I served in the \nBritish Isles, where one of the great traditions of the British Isles \nis what is known as a street meeting. You stand on a street corner, you \ntalk as loud as you can, and you hope somebody stops and listens to \nyou.\n  On a good evening in the summertime, when the weather is fine, you \ncould almost always draw a crowd. I would go down to the city square in \nEdinburgh, and the Salvation Army would be on that corner, and the \nChurch of Scotland would be on that corner, and the Scottish \nnationalists would be over here, and I and my companions would be here.\n  The square would be filled with people, and you would compete with \neach other to see who could draw the biggest crowd and then who could \nhold the crowd as the other orators were speaking on their issues--the \nScottish nationalists demanding that Scotland separate itself from the \nBritish tyranny, the Salvation Army putting forth--they were unfair in \nmy book because they had a band. We did not have a band, we just had \nour own voices to carry it on. It was a great British tradition and \nstill, presumably, goes on in some parts of Hyde Park in London, but I \nthink only rarely now.\n  What happened to dry up the crowds that would show up and listen to \nthe orators on politics and religion and everything else? Television. \nAs soon they could stay home and watch television, they were not \ninterested in coming down to the city square in Edinburgh to listen to \na tall bald kid from America. However entertaining that may have been \nin an earlier time, all of a sudden there was competition. Politicians \nused to be at that square. Politicians have discovered, in the words of \nthe article, that they have to ``struggle to be heard above the din \nfrom competing forms of entertainment.''\n  And how are they heard? They buy an ad. They go on television \nthemselves. They go on radio themselves. How are they going to get \naccess to the voters? They are going to have to compete in the same \nplaces where the voters are. It makes you feel wonderful to stand on a \nstreet corner and give an absolutely brilliant speech, if there is \nanybody listening.\n  But I can tell you from real experience, it makes you feel quite \nfoolish to stand on a street corner and give an absolutely brilliant \nspeech to a group of pigeons that keep flying in and out. If you are \ngoing to get access to the voters, you have to go where the voters are, \nand the voters are by their radio sets and in front of their television \nsets, and that is where you have to be, however much you might not like \nit.\n  Back to the article:\n\n       By letting politicians appeal directly and ``personally'' \n     to masses of voters, television made money, not manpower, the \n     key to political success. Campaigns became \n     ``professionalized,'' with ``consultants'' and elaborate \n     ``ad-buys,'' and that added to the cost. So did the fact that \n     as party loyalties diminished, candidates had to build their \n     own individual organizations and ``images.''\n\n  I go back to the question of, Why did the party loyalties diminish? \nBecause the reformers showed up and said, ``Parties are evil.'' It was \nthe reform movement that diminished the power of parties, so that it \ndid not make enough difference for an individual to win his party's \nnomination, he had to have his own organization, his own campaign \nconsultants, and his own ad-buys.\n  Again, if I can give a personal anecdote to demonstrate this, my \nfirst experience with politics was in 1950 when my father ran for the \nU.S. Senate. Who managed his campaign that first year? It was the \nRepublican State Party chairman who showed up when dad won the \nnomination and said, ``OK, we have a party organization in place and we \nare going to run your campaign.'' When my father ran for his last term \nin the U.S. Senate in 1968, I am not sure I remember who the Republican \nState chairman was, because by that time we had created our own \norganization--Volunteers for Bennett, Neighbors for Bennett, our own \ndoor-to-door system of handing out information. We had our own \nadvertising budget and our own advertising program. We had to take it \nall over ourselves if we were going to get access to the voters in a \nmeaningful way. And all of that costs money. It was the cost of the \npoliticians gaining access to the voters that was going up and that was \nwhat was driving the fundraising challenge.\n  Then we got to what is considered the great watershed in American \ncampaign finance problems, Watergate. The article addresses that, as \nwell. If I might quote once again:\n\n       Yet for all the pious hopes, the goal of the Watergate era \n     reforms--to remove the influence of money from presidential \n     elections--was hard and inescapable fact, ridiculous. Very \n     few areas of American life are insulated from the power of \n     money. Politics, which is, after all, about power, had \n     limited potential to be turned into a platonic refuge from \n     the influence of mammon. The new Puritanism of the post-\n     Watergate era often backfired . . . Tinkering with the \n     political system in many cases just made it worse.\n\n  I can offer anecdotes about that, as well. Let me give one. We heard \nin the hearings to which the Senator from Connecticut referred in the \nThompson committee with respect to campaign finance reform, we heard \nthere about a campaign that many can argue changed the course of \nAmerican history. It was the McCarthy campaign in New Hampshire in \n1968. Eugene McCarthy, a distinguished member of this body, decided \nagainst all political wisdom that he was going to challenge an \nincumbent President within his own party over an issue he considered to \nbe a moral issue, the Vietnam war. Conventional wisdom said a sitting \nSenator does not do that to an incumbent President. The sitting Senator \ndoes not take on an incumbent President of his own party. But Eugene \nMcCarthy did. He went to New Hampshire. He did not win, but he came \nclose enough to scare Lyndon Johnson and his advisers so badly that \nwithin a relatively short period of time after the McCarthy challenge, \nLyndon Johnson announced that\n\n[[Page S10088]]\n\nhe would not run for reelection as President of the United States.\n  Now, we heard in the Thompson committee this bit about the McCarthy \ncampaign. He went to five individuals, individuals of wealth, and said, \n``I want to challenge Lyndon Johnson on the basis of principle; will \nyou support me?'' And each one of those five said yes. Each one gave \nhim $100,000. So he went to New Hampshire with a war chest of half a \nmillion dollars--which at the time was sufficient for him to gain \naccess to the voters.\n  Again, the theme that I am trying to lay down here, the whole issue \nis not access to the politician; the issue is access to the voters. \nEugene McCarthy could not have had access to the voters without that \n$500,000. We would, perhaps, not have had history changed the way it \nwas as a result of the McCarthy campaign if those five men had not put \nup $100,000 apiece.\n  Now, someone connected with the McCarthy campaign testified before \nour committee and he gave this very interesting comment. He said those \nwho signed the Declaration of Independence were so concerned about \ntheir Government that they were willing to pledge, in the words of that \ndeclaration, ``their lives, their fortunes and their sacred honor.'' \nThen he said, in today's world it would say, ``your lives, your \nfortunes and your sacred honor, just as long as it does not exceed \n$1,000 per cycle.''\n  Now, I think the McCarthy campaign and the result of that \ndemonstrates how the reforms of the Watergate era have backfired, how \nthey have made it impossible for many people who would otherwise have a \nmessage worth hearing, to gain access to the voters.\n  Let me give an example out of the last campaign. One of the more \nenergetic of America's politicians is a former Member of the House, \nformer member of the Cabinet named Jack Kemp. He brings to politics the \nsame enthusiasm that he used to display on the football field. \nSometimes he has the same suicidal motives that he seemed to have on \nthe football field, but he plays the game with that kind of zest. Jack \nKemp dearly wanted to run for President in 1996. He had run once before \nand he still had it in his blood and he was ready to go. I talked to \nJack Kemp and said, ``Are you going to do it?'' And he said, ``No.'' I \nsaid, ``Why not?'' He said, ``I can't bring myself to go through the \nagony of raising the money.''\n  This is not cowardice on his part. If there is anything Jack Kemp is \nnot, it is a coward. This is not lack of enthusiasm on Jack Kemp's \npart. It was a recognition of the fact that the so-called reforms out \nof Watergate meant that he could not do what Eugene McCarthy did. He \ncould not go to five individuals and say, ``Give me $100,000 a piece to \nget me started.'' He had to do it $1,000 at a time. He said to me, \n``Bob, I would have to hold 200 fundraisers between now and the end of \nthe year to do it, and I simply cannot eat that much chicken.''\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator's point, I gather, is that the last reform \nof the mid-1970s has, in fact, secured the Presidential system to favor \neither the well-off, for example, Steve Forbes; or the well-known with \na nationwide organization, for example, Bob Dole, to the detriment of \nevery other dark horse who might have a regional base or some dramatic \nissue that they cared about, like Eugene McCarthy.\n  In fact, is the Senator's point that regional candidates or \ncandidates with a cause are now out of luck as a result of the last \nreform?\n  (Mr. GORTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator is entirely correct. That is my point. If, \nindeed, we want to increase the amount of public confidence in the \nsystem and candidate participation in the system, we should remove the \nrestrictions that now make it virtually impossible for anybody other \nthan the well-known or the well-funded.\n  I used Jack Kemp as an example. The Senator from Kentucky has \nmentioned Steve Forbes. It is widely assumed--I have not discussed it \nwith him directly, but I think it is probably accurate--that Steve \nForbes would have backed Jack Kemp in the last election if Kemp had \nbeen able to run. It is widely assumed --and I think it is correct--\nthat if Jack Kemp, pre-Watergate reforms, had gone to Steve Forbes and \nsaid, ``Steve, give me $1 million,'' Steve Forbes would have done it. \nBut because he can't do it under the Watergate reforms, Steve Forbes \nends up getting in the race himself because the only way he can make \nhis money available to his causes is to spend it on himself.\n  The reforms we have make it impossible for him to spend it supporting \nanybody else, unless, of course, he does it in the terrible, dreaded \nform of soft money. And I will talk about that in a minute. But right \nnow I want to focus again on the historic fact that, in the name of \ncampaign finance reform, we have restricted rather than expanded the \nopportunities of politicians to get their message across. We have made \nit more difficult for a politician to gain access to the voters than it \nused to be before we had all of these reforms.\n\n  Back to the article for just a moment. A summary of this point, and \none other aspect of it:\n\n       In an age of growing moral relativism, reformers raised \n     standards in the political realm to new and often unrealistic \n     legal heights. Failure to fill out forms properly became \n     illegal. This growing criminalization of politics, combined \n     with the media scandal-mongering, did not purify politics, \n     but only further undermined faith in politicians and \n     government.\n\n  We are all familiar with that, Mr. President. Failure to fill out \nforms properly--oh boy, what a terrible sin that is, and how dearly we \npay for it. I have remained silent on my own experience with the \nFederal Election Commission, but I suppose the time has come now for me \nto confess my sins. My campaign in 1992, staffed primarily by \nvolunteers, failed to fill out some forms properly--indeed, they failed \nto fill some of them out on the proper timeframe. They filled them out \nproperly, they just didn't submit them in the proper timeframe. And for \nthat, after spending about $50,000 in legal fees to convince the \nFederal Election Commission that I was not some kind of an ax murderer, \nwe finally achieved an out-of-court settlement that cost me another \n$55,000.\n  In the negotiations between my campaign and the Federal Election \nCommission, my attorney made it very clear. He said, ``You will settle \nat the amount they know is below what it would cost you to litigate \nthis issue.'' It has nothing to do with what constitutes an \nillegitimate penalty; it has to do with how much they know they can get \nfrom you because you would rather spend money to have this thing over \nthan you would spend it for legal fees. As I say, I spent about $50,000 \nin legal fees. The settlement figure was $55,000. It is clear that it \nwould have gotten to more than $55,000 if I had to go to litigation, \nand so financially I made the decision to settle. That is another one \nof the fruits of reforms.\n  In the words of the article, ``Criminalization of politics, combined \nwith media scandal-mongering, did not purify politics, but only further \nundermined faith in politicians and government.''\n  All right. I started this by saying the focus of this is on access to \nthe voters. All of the debate we have had has been on how we must \nsomehow deal with access to the politicians. Let's talk about access to \nthe politicians for just a minute before we come back to the main \ntheme. We are told again and again that the only reason people give any \nmoney, the only reason people make any contribution is because they \nwant access. I will again refer to the article, but I will have other \nreferences out of a more current publication:\n\n       Wealthy people who purchase status with payoffs to museums \n     are admirable philanthropists. When they plunge into public \n     service, they risk being called ``fat cats'' who want \n     something more in return for their generosity than \n     advancement of their notion of the public good and something \n     more sinister than status by association. Donors are \n     ``angels'' if they champion the right candidate or the right \n     cause, but ``devils'' if they bankroll an opponent.\n\n  In this week's issue of Fortune Magazine, Mr. President, there is an \narticle on money and politics that brings up to date that observation \nfrom the article I have been quoting. It talks about fundraisers for \ncampaigns and makes this point in concert with the point that was just \nmade:\n\n       Conspiracy theorists will be disappointed to learn that the \n     majority of money raisers don't seek quid pro quos. Most have \n     made\n\n[[Page S10089]]\n\n     their fortunes and dabble in politics because they are \n     partisans and get a kick out of it.\n\n  That has been my experience. The people who give really big money--\nRich DeVos of Amway, for example, for the Republicans, and a gentleman \nI believe named DeMont, who gave over $2 million to George McGovern and \nthe Democrats, were not expecting an ambassadorship and not expecting \nto be appointed to the Cabinet. They made their fortunes; they are \npartisans and they get a kick out of it.\n\n       What they really crave is status and minor celebrity in the \n     Nation's Capitol. The nastiest battles between fundraisers \n     are often over who gets to sit next to the President or \n     Presidential ``wannabes.'' It may seem absurd to the \n     uninitiated, but among fundraisers, top pols are the rock \n     stars of the beltway. In some ways, the real scandal of the \n     White House coffees and overnights that got President Clinton \n     in such pre-Monica trouble is that many sophisticated people \n     were willing to raise or give so much to be little more than \n     Washington groupies.\n\n  Buying access? It is not automatically the motive on the part of \nthose who give. They give because they believe that this is good for \nthe country. They believe in the cause. In this same article in \nFortune, there is a specific example of one of these gentlemen--Arnold \nHiatt. He is highlighted in the article. Mr. Hiatt believes in many \nthings in which I do not believe. He is of the opposite political \npersuasion than I, and the article reports that:\n\n       In 1996, Arnold S. Hiatt, 71, was the second-largest \n     individual contributor to the Democratic Party. His $500,000 \n     gift was second only to the $600,000 given by Loral's Bernard \n     Schwartz, who is now better known for his Chinese missile \n     connections.\n\n  According to the article, Mr. Hiatt has decided not to give any more \nmoney to the Democrats. He gave $500,000 a month before the November \n1996 election, specifically to help unseat 23 vulnerable House \nRepublicans and return the House to Democratic control. Quoting the \narticle:\n\n       It was the failure of his money to produce that result--not \n     just a fit of conscience--that spawned Hiatt's change of \n     heart. Asked why he decided to stop contributing to \n     politicians so soon after giving so much, he admits that it \n     was because his Democrats didn't win.\n\n  He gave the money for what he believes is a public-spirited reason, \nand he stopped giving to the parties because he didn't get the result \nthat he wanted. Being a good businessman--he is the former CEO of \nStride Rite, the company that makes Keds--he discovered he wasn't \ngetting a return on his investment--not a return in corruption, not a \nreturn in access--I am sure he still has access to all the Democrats he \nwants--but a return on his ideological investment. He wanted the \nDemocrats to control the House. He gave money to the Democratic \nNational Committee. The Democrats didn't control the House so he \ndecided to do something else.\n  What is he going to do? He is going to give his money directly to \nspecial interest groups. Now, according to the article, he doesn't \nbelieve that the groups to which he gives money are special interest \ngroups; it is the groups he opposed that are the special interest \ngroups.\n  The article says:\n\n       Hiatt then having gotten religion, has changed tactics. \n     Rather than relying on the Democrats to press his agenda, he \n     is now giving heavily to organizations like the Washington \n     based public campaign which lobbied for publicly financed \n     elections. Since the business interests that Hiatt so \n     dislikes tend to have more money than the green groups he \n     backs, Hiatt believes taxpayer funded elections would curtail \n     the clout of the bad guys. Both the House and Senate would be \n     controlled by the voters and less by special interests, Hiatt \n     insists. But what he means is that Congress would be \n     controlled by the people he agrees with.\n\n  Once again, Mr. President, the issue is access to the voters. Mr. \nHiatt thought he could help get his agenda if he gave money to the \nDemocrats. It didn't work. So he is seeking access to the voters \nthrough special interest groups. He has decided that the parties are \nnot able to help him advance his agenda, and he is going to fund other \ngroups to help advance his agenda. He has every right to do that. I \napplaud his willingness to get engaged and involved in American \npolitics. But, if we pass the amendment that is before us, he will be \ncurtailed, and the groups to which he contributes will be curtailed in \ntheir effort to gain access to the voters.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, over the last decade, the Senator from \nKentucky asked numerous witnesses at hearings on campaign finance to \ndefine what a special interest is. I say to my friend from Utah that I \nhave not yet gotten a good answer. So I have concluded--and I ask the \nSenator from Utah if he thinks this is a good definition of a special \ninterest--I say to my good friend from Utah that I have concluded that \na special interest is a group that is against what I am trying to do. \nDoes the Senator from Utah think that probably is as good a definition \nof special interest as he has heard?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Kentucky that \nis what I have heard referred to as a good working definition.\n  I might add to that a comment that came out of the Thompson committee \nhearings from my friend from Georgia, Senator Cleland, when he talked \nabout tainted money and the definition of tainted money in Georgia. He \nsaid, ``Taint enough; taint mine.''\n  Yes. Every man's special interest is the other man's noble cause.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, in fact, I ask the Senator from Utah, \nwas it not envisioned by the framers of our Constitution and the \nfounders of this country that America would, in fact, be a seething \ncaldron of interest groups, all of which would enjoy the first \namendment right to petition the Congress; that is, to lobby, to involve \nthemselves in political campaigns, and to try to influence, in the best \nsense of the word, the Government? And in today's America where the \nGovernment takes $1.7 trillion a year out of the economy, I ask my \nfriend from Utah, is it not an enduring and important principle that \nthe citizens should be able to have some influence on the political \nprocess and the government that may affect their lives?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky is now getting \ninto grounds that I love but that some others have sometimes scorned in \nthis debate; that is, the basis of the free speech position of the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  If I may respond to the Senator from Kentucky by quoting from James \nMadison and the Federalist Papers that support exactly what he said, \nthey didn't use the term ``special interest'' back in Madison's \ncentury. The term of art then was ``faction.''\n  This is what James Madison had to say:\n\n       By a faction I understand a number of citizens, whether \n     amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are \n     united and actuated by some common impulse of passion or of \n     interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens.\n\n  That sounds like the definition of a special interest group to me.\n  Madison goes on to say:\n\n       There are . . . two methods of removing the causes of \n     faction: The one, by destroying the liberty which is \n     essential to its existence; the other, by giving to every \n     citizen the same opinions, the same passions, and the same \n     interests.\n       It could never be more truly said than of the first remedy \n     that it was worse than the disease. Liberty is to faction \n     what air is to fire.\n\n  Certainly we do not want to eliminate air that we cannot breathe in \nthe name of stopping a fire that might occur, and we do not want to \neliminate liberty.\n  So Madison makes that point.\n  Referring to the second, giving everyone the same opinions, passions, \nand interests, Madison says:\n\n       The second expedient is as impracticable as the first would \n     be unwise. As long as the reason of man continues fallible, \n     and he is at liberty to exercise it, different opinions will \n     be formed.\n\n  Absolutely the Founding Fathers created the Constitution for the sole \npurpose of protecting the rights of every one to have his own special \ninterest, belong to his own faction, and hold his own opinion. An \nattempt on the part of the Senate of the United States to destroy that \nright is clearly going to be held unconstitutional as it has been again \nand again, as my friend from Kentucky has pointed out so often on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask my friend further is it not the \ncase that the underlying amendment which we have been debating seeks to \nmake it impossible for groups of citizens to criticize the politician \nby name within\n\n[[Page S10090]]\n\n60 days of the election? Is that the understanding of the Senator from \nUtah?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it is my understanding that is the way \nthe bill is written. I think James Madison would be turning over in his \ngrave, although I think he would take comfort from the fact that the \ninstitution he helped create--the Supreme Court--would clearly strike \nit down.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend, so if you have the situation that \non September 3rd of a given year a group of citizens could go out \nwithout registering with the Federal Election Commission, without \nsubjecting themselves to that arm of the Federal Government, and \ncriticize a politician by name, but then on September 4th, I ask my \nfriend from Utah, that would become illegal. Is that correct?\n  Mr. BENNETT. It is my understanding that the bill would make that \nillegal and improper.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, will the Senator from Utah yield for a \nquestion?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Yes.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Does the Senator realize that under the Snowe-Jeffords \namendment, which is included in the version of McCain-Feingold that is \nbefore the Senate, at this time there is no restriction on individuals \nsuch as Mr. Hiatt? Are you aware that was the rule by a majority vote \nof this body?\n  Mr. BENNETT. I was unaware that Mr. Hiatt would be allowed to spend \nhis soft money for a faction. I think it is still true that he would \nnot be able to spend his soft money for a party. Is that not the case, \nI ask my friend?\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. As I understand it, he would still be able to do it for \nthe types of ads the Senator was indicating. The question that I would \nask is, if you have a concern with regard to the bill at this point \nconcerning individuals and groups that are not corporations or unions, \nthe whole purpose of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment was to make it clear. \nAnd in the spirit of compromise that it would not affect what the \nindividuals have been able to do in the past in that area, I just \nwanted to make sure the record is clear, because much of the comments \nof the Senator from Utah have to do with individuals who are not \nrestricted in the way that the Senator has suggested.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would suggest that individuals are \nseriously restricted under this bill because they cannot exercise their \nconstitutional privilege of giving the money to a political party. Mr. \nHiatt has made the choice not to give the money to the political party, \nif the article is to be believed solely on the basis that it didn't \nwork, not because he was motivated by some other higher spirit. He \ndecided to give the money directly to a faction because he thought it \nwould be more effective.\n  If this bill passes, as I understand it, Mr. Hiatt would be \nprohibited from changing that decision. That is, if he were to decide \nthat, ``Gee, I could make things better if I gave it directly to the \npolitical party, I want to go back to what I was doing before,'' he \nwould be prohibited from doing that on the grounds that this is soft \nmoney, and he is forced by the law to give his money to a special \ninterest group rather than to a political party or to a political \ncandidate.\n  This puts us in the position of paradoxically strengthening the hands \nof special interest groups at the expense of political parties and \npolitical candidates. This puts us in the position of saying that \neventually political discourse in this country will go the way that it \nis going in California. I lived in California for long enough to know \nthat the California pattern of putting issues directly on the ballot \nwith no spending limitation whatsoever eclipses elections for \ncandidates. The amount of spending that went on in the last California \nelection on the various referenda vastly outstripped and eclipsed the \namount that any candidate was able to spend. And if we get to the point \nwhere political candidates are squeezed out of access to the voters by \ngroups funded by people like Mr. Hiatt who have unlimited amounts to \nspend, we are going to be in great difficulty.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have a question about that very point. \nMr. President, I thank the Senator from Utah. Many of his remarks were \ndevoted to the proposition that Mr. Hiatt couldn't give to various \ngroups; independent groups.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I didn't say he couldn't give to various groups.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I believe I heard several comments to the effect that \nhe would be prevented from doing that. I just want the record clear \nthat the only concern the Senator from Utah has at this point in light \nof the effect of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment is the amendment's effect \non what he can give to parties.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Exactly.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I want that clear for the record.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Sure.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Because I was not certain in light of your remarks.\n  Mr. BENNETT. That is not the only effect. If I can repeat once again, \nthis bill, in light of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment, would hasten the \nday when people would abandon candidates and abandon parties and give \ntheir money directly to special interest groups, as Mr. Hiatt has \nvoluntarily decided to do in this situation, and I think that would be \ntremendously deleterious to the cause of worthwhile political discourse \nin this country.\n  I pause at this example. Let us suppose that in the State of Utah the \nSierra Club were to decide that their No. 1 goal was to drain Lake \nPowell. Indeed, they have announced many places that that is soon to be \ntheir No. 1 goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10084-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10090-S10093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Time for debate between now and 5 p.m. will be \nequally divided between the Senator from Iowa and the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume from my portion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to say a few words today before \nwe have our cloture vote on S. 1301, and that is the Consumer \nBankruptcy Protection Act. That is going to occur, as stated by the \nChair, at 5 o'clock. We are going to vote at that time on whether we \ncan even consider this very important piece of legislation that is \ncalled the Consumer Bankruptcy Protection Act.\n  As I said yesterday, I think the necessity of having a cloture vote \nand the objection to taking this bill up was a desperation tactic. If \nthe opponents of reform want to fight reform, let's have a fight about \nthe merits of bankruptcy reform. I would like to get to the bill. I \nwould like to have everybody vote for cloture on the motion to proceed, \nand then we are there debating this legislation. When we get to the \nbill, I want to\n\n[[Page S10091]]\n\nassure everyone that I am going to work hard to further accommodate \nconcerns expressed by members of the minority. I have proceeded in this \nfair way since we started to consider bankruptcy reform, and we have \nbeen at this at the subcommittee and committee level probably almost a \nyear to this point.\n  In subcommittee, when we marked up the bill, I personally saw to it \nthat many of the changes which my distinguished ranking minority \nmember, Senator Durbin, wanted were inserted into the bill, and at the \nfull committee markup I worked with Senator Hatch to ensure that a \nnumber of Democratic amendments were offered. I did not accept these \nprovisions because I supported them or thought these provisions were \nthe best policy choice. I accepted these amendments out of a desire to \naccommodate the concerns of the Democratic Members. So there is no \nreason for them to filibuster this bill at all. If the Democratic \nMembers want to be respected, then it seems to me that the members of \nthat party also have to act responsibly when those of us in the \nmajority go out of our way to accommodate the concerns of the minority. \nThere is no need to clutter up the bill with amendments that are \ntotally irrelevant or unrelated to the issue of bankruptcy.\n  For instance, I have heard that the issue we just left, campaign \nfinance reform, might be offered. I have heard that the minimum wage \nbill might be offered. I have heard that it is health care reform, that \nany or all of these could be added to this bill. That is why we have to \nvote for cloture now and, later on, on the bill. Otherwise, without \nimposing cloture, the bill becomes a vehicle for people who oppose \nreform to load this bill up with excess baggage.\n\n  As I have said repeatedly here on this floor, the American public \noverwhelmingly favors bankruptcy reform: 68 percent of the people in a \nnational poll; in my State of Iowa, 78 percent of the people. So let's \nstop playing games and get to the business of the country. The cloture \nvote is one of the key votes on bankruptcy reform. A vote against \ncloture is a vote against a piece of legislation that deals head on \nwith an issue of extreme national importance. The Consumer Bankruptcy \nReform Act that we have before us, or will have before us if we vote \ncloture, is fair and balanced. It passed out of the Judiciary Committee \non a 16-to-2 vote. How could a bill that got out of committee 16 to 2 \nbe subject to a filibuster? So, let's get to the bill and, hopefully, \npass it.\n  The Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act is a bipartisan effort. It is a \nbipartisan effort which keeps the best of old law while curbing abuses. \nS. 1301 continues to help those who need the protection of the \nbankruptcy laws but implements measures to screen out those who use the \nbankruptcy system to avoid paying debts that they can afford to repay.\n  The fair nature of this bill is represented by the overwhelming \nbipartisan support that it received in committee. The near unanimous \nconsensus of the committee action reflects a belief that something must \nbe done to curb the skyrocketing rate of bankruptcies, which reached an \nall-time high last year, and that this bill is thus a necessary step in \nrestoring common sense to our bankruptcy laws and the system of \nbankruptcy.\n  As the prime sponsor of this bill and chairman of the subcommittee \nwith jurisdiction over bankruptcy, I went out of my way to make sure \nthe minority was treated fairly. At my hearing we invited every witness \nthe minority requested. And every time my distinguished friend, Senator \nDurbin, sought to insert language into the bill, I personally saw to it \nthat his desires were accommodated. The only time that I could not \naccommodate his desires was sometimes he asked for certain language to \nbe deleted.\n  American business lost around $40 billion last year as a result of \nbankruptcies. This translates into a hidden tax of $400 per family. We \nneed to cut this hidden tax and put more money into the pockets of \nAmerican families. We do this by reducing or eliminating the costs that \nwe have of goods and services in America to every family of four by a \nfigure of $400.\n  Efforts to burden this bill with minimum wage and other completely \nunrelated amendments ought to be resisted. This bill is too important \nand time too short to allow political stunts and unrelated side issues \nto impede or delay its passage. As I said, 68 percent of the American \npeople support bankruptcy reform. In its letter to the Judiciary \nCommittee, the administration of President Clinton indicated its \nsupport for reform, and I thank the President and his people for \nhelping this legislation along. I think there is a real consensus that \nnow is the time to act. We have a fair, effective, bipartisan bill \nwhich deserves to be considered. As I said, we are willing to work with \nthe minority to accommodate their concerns even further.\n  It comes down to this. Do the Members of this body support bankruptcy \nreform? Will they vote for cloture today? And will they also follow on \nvoting for cloture of the bill itself? I ask my colleagues to vote \n``yes'' at 5 o'clock.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset, I am going to \nsupport this motion for cloture to proceed on the bill because I agree \nwith my colleague and friend, the Senator from Iowa, that this is an \nimportant issue that should be addressed by this Congress. He has been \neminently fair in all of his dealings with me on this legislation. \nBeing a member of the abject minority, I appreciate that, and that sort \nof fairness I hope will be rewarded in the passage of a bankruptcy \nreform bill which both Senator Grassley and I will be proud of.\n  I am hoping during the course of this debate we can point out those \nareas of the bill that need to be addressed and address them in a \nresponsible way. I think this is, at its heart, a good bill. I think \nthere are some elements of it which can be changed and improved to make \nit better.\n  Let me address at the outset his frustration, and mine, too, over the \nfact that this bill may become a vehicle for other issues. First, why \nis this necessary? Why would any Senator want to come and put a measure \nsuch as an increase in the minimum wage on the bankruptcy bill? It does \nnot seem to follow very closely. I guess there is some connection to \nit, but by and large you would think we could vote separately on the \nminimum wage bill. The honest answer is, we should. The honest answer \nis, we cannot. The Republican leadership refuses to afford an \nopportunity for many of the more serious measures that have been \nbrought before this Congress to be considered. Some of my colleagues, \nin frustration, look for virtually any bill, any vehicle, to move \nimportant measures such as reform of HMOs, campaign finance reform, or \nan increase in the minimum wage. I hope, while Senator Grassley and I \naddress the merits of this legislation, that the Republican and \nDemocratic leadership in a bipartisan fashion can come to an agreement \nas to the proper time and place for us to consider important measures \nsuch as an increase in the minimum wage.\n\n  Having said that, let me address the issue of bankruptcy reform. As I \nmentioned the other day, it is truly an area that deserves our \nattention. The dramatic increase in the filings in bankruptcy in \nAmerica suggest that we should look at the bankruptcy system. We have \ntried to do that in the committee, both in the full committee and the \nsubcommittee. We will address it again on the floor of the Senate. \nThere are many people who have many explanations for the increase in \nthe filings in bankruptcy. One of the most cogent explanations that I \nhave found is demonstrated by this chart.\n  Why do more people file for bankruptcy in a time when the American \neconomy is expanding and more jobs have been created, people are \nbuilding homes and starting businesses, and inflation is down? Why in \nthe world would more people be filing for bankruptcy? I think this \nchart answers that question. Bankruptcy cases track consumer debt. As \nAmericans become more deeply indebted, particularly unsecured debt--not \ntheir home or their car, but unsecured debt like credit card debt--they \nbecome more vulnerable. One bad occurrence in a person's life--the loss \nof a job, a divorce, a serious illness in the household --and they find \nthemselves pushed over the edge. A lot of people find that as their \ndebt increases they are more vulnerable to bankruptcy.\n\n[[Page S10092]]\n\n  Just look at this chart which tries to track the number of filings in \nbankruptcy per capita along with the debt-to-income ratio. It is no \nsurprise to me that they are in lockstep. So the credit industry that \ncomes to us and talks about bankruptcy reform must accept some share of \nresponsibility for the increases in filing.\n  Who are the people filing for bankruptcy? There are clearly \nexceptions to the rule, but if you look at the average person filing \nfor bankruptcy, you will see that consistently the income of the person \nfiling for bankruptcy has been descending, going down over the years; \nthe average income in 1997, $17,652. These are people who are making \nless than $10 an hour who are filing for bankruptcy. So they are not \nthe fat cats, the ones who are going to the canny attorneys who can \nfind some way to bring them to bankruptcy court. These are genuinely \nlow-income Americans. The average debt of the person filing for \nbankruptcy is about $28,000. That is the average.\n  What this bill tries to address is not that average person but the \nperson who is the exception filing for bankruptcy, the one who is, \nperhaps, trying to take advantage of the system.\n  The reason this debate is important--and I hope my colleague, the \nSenator from Iowa, will note in the information that we have shared \nwith him--is our belief that we should address not just the bill as it \nis written and some changes in it but some other aspects of this \nquestion. I do believe, as does Senator Sarbanes of Maryland and \nSenator Dodd of Connecticut, who are joining me in offering an \namendment, that we should call on the credit card companies to accept \nmore responsibility, too. If the people who are incurring debt are \nasked to be more responsible, so, too, should these companies.\n  How many credit card solicitations have you received in the last \nmonth or two? You almost have to shovel them away from the mailbox. \nWhether you have asked for it or not, a lot of people want to offer you \ncredit, perhaps more credit than you should have. Time and again, more \npeople take these credit cards and get more deeply in debt and then \nstruggle to find a way to pay for them.\n  I also think we have to address the billing system, the minimum \nmonthly payment on your credit card. I think the credit card companies \nshould tell you how long it will take to pay off your balance and how \nmuch interest you will pay if you pay the minimum monthly amount. Is \nthat unreasonable? I think it is only fair. It really gives a person at \nleast some sobering message, perhaps, that they cannot continue to pay \nthe minimum monthly balance and expect to ever come out of debt.\n  Finally, you may not realize it but some of the credit cards that we \nown, when we go to charge on a purchase, establish a security interest. \nWhat does that mean? It means that if you find yourself in hard times, \nthe credit card company can claim the item you purchased. You didn't \nknow that? A lot of people do not. I don't think it is unreasonable \nthat the credit card companies make that disclosure.\n\n  We also want to make sure the credit card solicitations are done in \nan honest way. We find a lot of people, and some nonhumans, I might \nadd, who are receiving credit card solicitations who should not--people \nwho are mentally incompetent, people who are too young to own a credit \ncard in any State. I think this needs to be cleaned up.\n  We also need to protect retirement income in bankruptcy. If you file \nfor bankruptcy, did you know your 401(k) plan is protected but your IRA \nis not? Why would that be? One of the amendments we are offering is to \nmake sure that there is equal treatment of retirement income.\n  We also want to change the area of farm bankruptcy. That has not been \ntouched in 15 years, and it should be.\n  In the area of reaffirmations, when it comes to the debts that the \ncreditor should convince you that you shouldn't step away from, you \nshould still accept responsibility for, let's make a level playing \nfield. Let's make certain there is not too much pressure on the debtor.\n  We also talk about tax returns with this bill. As it is written, if \nyou walk into bankruptcy court and file a petition and do not produce \nwithin 65 days your income tax returns for the previous 3 years and \nyour pay stubs for the previous 6 months, you are thrown out of court. \nI asked the Internal Revenue Service, if I asked for my income tax \nreturns, how long would it take me to receive them? They said 60 days, \nif you are lucky. But you ask somebody who writes to the IRS, and they \ntell you it takes a lot longer. We ask that there be some provision in \nthe bill that is sensitive to this.\n  One of the other areas of the bill says you can't file for bankruptcy \nunless you have been to a consumer credit counselor. That sounds \nreasonable, but the consumer credit counseling industry came to us and \nsaid, ``We can't handle this. We can't handle over 1 million people \ncoming through our doors each year. We can't be the threshold for \nbankruptcy court.'' That is what this bill does. I am afraid it goes \ntoo far.\n  Another thing that concerns me is, in bankruptcy there are certain \ncategories of debt that are protected. One of them is the area of child \nsupport. If we are going to have a mother with children, who was \nperhaps involved in a divorce and now relies on child support, receive \nenough money to raise her children, we can't send her into a bankruptcy \ncourt that diminishes her ability to recover those child support \npayments. Unfortunately, this bill does.\n  I have just outlined a handful of the amendments that we think are \nimportant to make this a better bill. I believe that my colleague, the \nSenator from Iowa, is going to accept some of these or some form of \nthese, as he has been very responsive and open in the past to talk \nabout some changes, constructive changes in the bill.\n  When it is all said and done, I believe we can pass a good Bankruptcy \nReform Act, one that is a credit to both parties that have been \ninvolved in this debate, and particularly a credit to the chairman of \nthe subcommittee who has worked so long and hard on this measure.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Four minutes, 52 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I probably will not use all that. I can yield back some \ntime. I will comment briefly.\n  First of all, in order to get to the point where Senator Durbin needs \nto be to get consideration of his amendments, we have to get through \nthis cloture vote and a cloture vote on the bill so we can get down to \ntalking about these very serious matters.\n  Many of the things that Senator Durbin has stated that he is \ninterested in changing I would not want to say right out that I agree \nwith every one of those. Some of them, I think, maybe go a little bit \ntoo far, but I have not seen--maybe I shouldn't say I haven't seen any, \nbut I have seen few issues that he brought up in the course of the last \nyear as we constructed this bill, that it wasn't possible for us to \nwork out a lot of differences, particularly for those things that are \nincluded in the bill.\n  As I said in my opening remarks, some things that he wanted removed, \nwe didn't remove. I look forward to that opportunity, if we get it by \ngetting through two cloture votes, to sitting down with Senator Durbin \nand some of his colleagues on his side of the aisle who now have an \ninterest in this legislation to see what we can work out and even \nminimize the number of votes or the length of debate we ought to have \non this bill.\n  I will make one comment about one of the things Senator Durbin made \nreference to about opposition from the National Foundation for Consumer \nCredit to some of the ideas of Senator Sessions. To Senator Sessions' \ncredit, he did work out some compromises that needed to be done. We \nhave a letter dated August 6 from the National Foundation for Consumer \nCredit that says that they support those provisions of the legislation \nas well, and there is a copy of that letter to Senator Durbin.\n  I think we have a process here that has worked so well. If you would \nstop and think--and Senator Durbin has worked in this spirit--for the \nyears I have been on this subcommittee, either as chairman or as \nranking member--and I served 16 years with the predecessor of Senator \nDurbin, and that was\n\n[[Page S10093]]\n\nSenator Heflin from Alabama--there has not been a single piece of \nbankruptcy legislation to get through this body in that 16-year period \nof time that didn't have the cooperative effort of the Democrat \nchairman or ranking member and the Republican chairman or ranking \nmember, depending on who was controlling the committee at that time in \nhistory. That reputation has been continued through Senator Durbin at \nthis point.\n  If we can just get everybody on Senator Durbin's side of the aisle to \nbe in that same spirit that has promoted good bankruptcy legislation \nthrough this body for that period of time, we can be successful, not \nonly with this piece of legislation, but also to emphasize that this is \na needed piece of legislation. Even Senator Durbin, working with us, \nhas helped us develop the first major change in legislation to be \nconsidered on the floor of this body since the passage of the 1978 \nbankruptcy law.\n  I hope that the spirit that former Senator Heflin of Alabama and I \nhave worked in, and has been continued by Senator Durbin and me thus \nfar, can be fully accepted by people from his side of the aisle. I know \nhe has to satisfy a lot of interests. I even have, I say to Senator \nDurbin, some interests on my side that are not satisfied with the \nlegislation we brought out of committee. So I have some problems with \nwhich I have to work.\n  The point is, if, since 1981, this effort can be successful, it can \nbe successful this time. I just plead with everybody who might want to \nfilibuster this for some extraneous issues that probably can be brought \nup in some other way on other bills that would satisfy the Senate \nmajority leader, we can get there.\n  I urge, as Senator Durbin has, a very positive vote on this. I hope \nit will be followed, assuming we are successful this time, with a \npositive vote later this week on cloture on the entire bill.\n  I yield the floor, and I yield back what few seconds I have \nremaining.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time having been yielded back, the hour of \n5 p.m. having arrived, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the \nSenate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provision of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to Calendar No. 394, S. 1301, the Consumer Bankruptcy \n     Protection Act.\n         Trent Lott, Orrin G.

Mr. President, I want to pause for a few moments to \nacknowledge that many of us, particularly those of us from \nMassachusetts, are feeling the loss this week of one of our Nation's \nmost savvy political strategists and one of our most contributing and \nadmirable citizens. Kirk O'Donnell was a man who lived his life in a \nway that proved not only can you work in politics without losing your \nsoul but that politics from Fields Corner in Dorchester to city hall in \nthe heart of Boston, all the way up to the lofty office of the Speaker \nof the House of Representatives, can in fact be a most honorable \nprofession.\n  Mr. President, we all know that we live in very difficult political \ntimes, where endless cynicism seems to find too many citizens turning \naway from political dialog that they seem to find disappoints them. But \nKirk O'Donnell, through every fiber of his body and in every step that \nhe took in life, reminded us that political parties can stand for a set \nof ideals and that politics can still be an art form mastered in order \nto advance the common good--not individual good, but the common good. \nThat is what Kirk always fought for.\n  Like so many of us in Massachusetts--and many are Republicans--Kirk \nO'Donnell was a Democrat by birth. But through his decades in public \nservice he became a Democrat by conviction and a Democrat by sacrifice \nand by life work. The young man who fell in love with football at the \nBoston Latin School and at Brown University--so much so that at Boston \nLatin he was enshrined in their sports hall of fame--found his passions \nattracted him to an equally rough and tumble game on the field of \nBoston politics.\n  Kevin White's 1970 campaign for Governor in Massachusetts inspired \nKirk to get involved in politics for what he thought was a ``brief \nstint.'' That ``brief stint'' became a remarkable career. When Kevin \nWhite made good on his promise as mayor of Boston to ``bring city hall \nto the neighborhoods,'' he turned to Kirk O'Donnell to run his Fields \nCorner little city hall. From his office in a trailer, Kirk brought \ncity government to street corners, to newsstands, and to neighborhood \npicnics. He knew how important it was to show his fellow Bostonians \nthat government worked for them, if only they knew how to work within \nthe system. And within that system, Kirk was their devoted guide. Tip \nO'Neill could not have chosen a more dedicated or more skillful \nindividual to be his counsel than Kirk O'Donnell, a man who said, in \nhis own unassuming way, ``if you can understand Fields Corner, you can \nunderstand Congress.'' Kirk was right--and Tip O'Neill knew it. For 8 \nyears, it was Kirk O'Donnell who gave the Speaker the extra set of eyes \nand ears he needed to hold a Democratic majority together in spite of \nall of the force of President Reagan and the Reagan era. Kirk talked \nwith Members of Congress the same way he would with a friend of 20 \nyears or a constituent in Fields Corner or West Roxbury--warm, honest, \nstraightforward. Tip O'Neill knew that in Kirk O'Donnell he had found a \ntrue friend.\n\n  Thousands of people to this day will tell you they were friends with \nTip O'Neill, the Speaker. Tip O'Neill was a politician who never forgot \na name and\n\n[[Page S10094]]\n\nloved to talk with everyone he met. He had more than his share of \nfriends and acquaintances. But Kirk O'Donnell was a special kind of \nfriend and so it was that he was one of the few asked to help carry Tip \nO'Neill's casket when our beloved Speaker passed away. That gesture \nalone spoke volumes about the kind of relationship forged between the \nolder, wiser, more experienced Tip O'Neill and the younger, idealistic, \nand committed Kirk O'Donnell.\n  Even after he lost his friend, Tip O'Neill, Kirk kept fighting for \nthe Democratic Party and the causes in which he believed so strongly. \nHe breathed life into the Center for National Policy, leading seminars \nand meetings with Democratic activists, supporters, and even with those \nwho Kirk believed might someday run for office. His message always came \nfrom the heart--Democrats stand for something, something real, \nsomething which could not be measured alone in an election. And he \ncared passionately about that something. On the darkest days for our \nparty--and he went through some--Kirk reminded us to never give up the \nfight. He knew the importance of staying involved, of staying \ncommitted. He understood the full measure of democracy--and tried to \nbring it to others starving for freedom through his work in the \nNational Democratic Institute for Foreign Affairs. Wherever, Kirk went, \nhis message was the same; find out what matters to you and never stop \nfighting for it.\n\n  Kirk O'Donnell never forgot what really mattered in life. More than \nanything that was his devotion to his family--to his wife of 26 years, \nKathryn Holland O'Donnell and their children, Holly and Brendan. That \ndevotion was absolute.\n  I am proud to say that Brendan was going to join us as an intern in \nour office. Now that may be somewhat delayed, but, obviously, we look \nforward to the day when he will be there with us continuing in his \nfather's footsteps.\n  Whenever I ran into him either in Washington, DC, or in \nMassachusetts, Kirk's first question wasn't about politics; he always \nasked me how my daughter was enjoying her education in his alma mater, \nBrown University. And he was always quick to share with me his latest \nstory about his own daughter--Holly's experience on that same campus, \nor the story of the last trip to Foxboro Stadium with his son Brendan \nto watch Patriots football. It goes without saying that as much as all \nof us will miss him, obviously we feel the special pain that Kathryn, \nHolly, and Brendan feel at this time with their lost which is so much \ngreater.\n  Today, we remember Kirk O'Donnell with words that cannot do any \njustice to a life that was both tragically short and joyfully filled \nwith meaning and with accomplishment. We will miss Kirk O'Donnell, a \nfriend and an adviser to all of us in Massachusetts politics and in the \nDemocratic Party. But we know that his spirit will continue to inspire \nus with the faith that he had in our common ideals as Americans and in \nhis commitment to working to make life better for other people.\n  I thank the President.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank our friend and colleague for his \nsuperb recollections and comments about this son of Massachusetts, Kirk \nO'Donnell. Kirk O'Donnell was really a committed public servant right \nfrom the earliest days. He started out as a schoolteacher. He came from \na working-class family. He entered politics. He served with great \ndistinction, as the Senator has pointed out, with a great friend of \nboth of us, Congressman O'Neill, in a very significant time in the \nhistory of this country. And then after our friend and colleague, \nSpeaker O'Neill, left, Kirk O'Donnell went to run the Center for \nNational Policy. He kept his interest in public policy, believing that \npublic policy can make a difference in people's lives.\n\n  He really was an extraordinary human being in his common sense, his \ngood judgment and his real desire to advance the common interests of \nworking families in our State.\n  So I wish to commend my colleague, Senator Kerry, for bringing this \nmatter to the Senate. This man was a very rare human being, a rare \nindividual, a very loving person, certainly for his wife and his family \nbut also to his friends. He also cared very deeply about the condition \nof the people that he met over his journey of life. He had a strong \ncommitment to make this world a better world and our State of \nMassachusetts a better State.\n  I thank my colleague for bringing these remarks to the Senate. I \ncommend these remarks to our colleagues and to his family because we \nmiss him not only as a friend, but as an extraordinary public servant. \nWe should not let his name and his memory leave us. Those who knew him \nand loved him will certainly carry his memory in their hearts \nthroughout their lives.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. We both benefited \nenormously from the generous friendship of Kirk O'Donnell and from the \nremarkable quality of wisdom he had well beyond his years, great common \nsense, great roots in the streets, the city that he worked for, and of \nthe State that he loved, and we will both miss him. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10093-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10094-S10099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONSUMER BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the motion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coats). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand the parliamentary \nsituation, we are in the post-cloture period, which allocates up to one \nhour to each Member of the Senate. Am I correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use.\n  Mr. President, we have just a few moments ago decided as a Senate to \nconsider the bankruptcy legislation that was reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee a few weeks ago. I mentioned at the time that this \nmeasure was being considered by the leadership, that I had hoped we \nwould have the opportunity at the time that the leadership was \nconsidering calling up the bankruptcy legislation to consider other \nlegislation that had been pending for some period of time.\n  The legislation that I was hoping would be considered is the \nPatients' Bill of Rights. It has been introduced by the Democratic \nleader, Senator Daschle, and supported by a number of us. Or, \nalternatively, I had hoped that the Senate would have been able to \naccept the proposal of the minority leader, Senator Daschle, that we \nwould lay down before the Senate the Republican managed care proposal \nthat passed the House of Representatives in July. This would have \nprovided us with an opportunity to debate an issue that is enormously \nimportant to families in this country.\n  I mentioned before, the bankruptcy legislation deals with 1,200,000 \npeople or occasions in this country per year. The Patients' Bill of \nRights, however, affects 160 million Americans. The concerns that these \nfamilies have are very real and very powerful.\n  Time and again, we hear of insurance company abuses that cripple or \nkill patients in states around the country. Yet, the response of the \nRepublican leadership has been, well, you can either take it or leave \nit. That's it. Take the alternative that is advanced by the Republican \nleadership--which allows one vote on Senator Daschle's bill, one vote \non the Republican bill, and perhaps three other amendments, but no more \nthan those amendments in number that are designated by the majority \nleader--or leave it and do nothing. Mr. President, this proposal \neffectively gags the Senate from having full debate and discussion on \nthis legislation. But, we have been told that was the position of the \nleadership and that was what we were going to be stuck with.\n  Mr. President, this is unsatisfactory because it excludes the \nopportunity to debate the major differences that exist between the \nRepublicans and the Democrats on the issues of health care.\n  I have here before me a comparison of each of the patient protection \nbills--the proposal that has been advanced by the Republicans, and also \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights proposal introduced by the Democrats. At \nthe heart of this debate is a very simple concept: Are medical \nprofessionals, the doctors and nurses, going to make the health care \ndecisions that affect patients? Or are\n\n[[Page S10095]]\n\ninsurance company accountants going to make those judgments and make \nthose decisions, which is the case in too many instances in our country \ntoday? We believe that in all of these circumstances medical decisions \nought to be made by the health professionals who have been trained, \nqualified, and certified to be able to deal with the health care \nchallenges that will affect our families in this country.\n  We believe there should be a prohibition on gag practices; access to \nemergency rooms when there is a need for services, which is not \nguaranteed in too many instances today; access to the Ob/Gyn providers; \nthe ability to keep your doctor; and guaranteed access to the \nspecialists, including out-of-network providers, when those needs are \nimportant.\n  We believe that there should be standing referrals to specialists or \nthat specialists should be allowed to act as primary care providers \nwhen that is important for particular patients, such as cancer \npatients, or persons with disabilities or HIV; the ability to have \naccess to doctor-prescribed drugs when the various formularies override \na physician's decision; and access to clinical trials, which are \nabsolutely essential for patients who have life-threatening \nconditions--such as breast cancer-- that have failed to respond to \nconventional therapies. The failure to promote and cover routine costs \nfor participation in these clinical trials is something that the Senate \nought to make some judgment and decision about.\n  The interesting point about clinical trials is that it really is not \nmore costly to the HMOs, because the drug and biotechnology companies \nor the government continue to assume the burden for the \nexperimentation. The HMOs are simply asked to shoulder their fair share \nof the routine costs that the patient would incur anyway. So it really \nis not costly to the HMOs to guarantee this access to clinical trials. \nWe ought to have the opportunity to debate that here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate.\n  We ought to be able to ensure there is going to be protection for \npatient advocacy, and that we are going to have information on plan \nquality. People need to understand which plans present themselves to be \nquality plans, and which do not. And, perhaps most importantly, there \nshould be a clear right to a timely and independent appeal process and \nthe ability to hold health plans accountable for their actions. These \nare the areas of public policy that we ought to have an opportunity to \ndebate and discuss.\n  We have not heard from the Republican leadership what particular \naspect of this list, which basically includes the President's \nreservations about the Republican proposal, that they object to. All \nthey say is: We are not going to debate it. We are not going to discuss \nit. You can get one amendment, two amendments, three amendments, but we \nare just not going to tie the Senate up to debate these particular \nmeasures, even though these are the items which have been embraced by \nnot just Members of the U.S. Senate but by nearly 190 organizations \nacross this country that represent--who? Represent the Congress? The \nSenate? No. They represent the doctors, represent the nurses, represent \nthe researchers, represent the patients and consumers.\n  Nearly every single major and minor consumer group has effectively \nendorsed the proposal that we have advanced, and we have not heard of a \nsingle group that has endorsed or embraced the Republican proposal--not \none. Not one. They do not have a single group--doctors or patients or \nnurses or health delivery professionals--that endorses their proposal. \nAll of them endorse ours. Yet we are told by the Republican leadership \nthat you are going to be denied the opportunity to even raise these \nissues in an orderly way, to have debate and discussion and an outcome \ndecided on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  These are the areas that need to be discussed. These are the gaps in \nthe Republican bill. Some of them probably could be worked on through \nan agreement--not a great number. But they certainly are the ones that \nhave been mentioned and identified by the health professionals in this \ncountry that are essential if we are going to provide quality health \ncare for the American people. And we are denied this. We are being \nstonewalled, those of us who believe the patients' interests should be \nadvanced. The Republican leadership have closed us out. They say, ``No. \nNo.''\n  They don't mind getting consideration for the bankruptcy bill. They \ndon't say we will take the bankruptcy bill up, but there are only X \nnumber of amendments. No. They just went ahead and scheduled the \nbankruptcy bill, which, interestingly, is supported by major financial \ninstitutions and credit companies that have spent over $50 million in \nsupport of the legislation. Whom does that bill protect? It protects \nthe banking and the financial interests over, I believe, the interests \nof the consumers. So we have seen that legislation that protects big \nbusiness is on the fast track, and the legislation that protects \npatients and families is being denied the floor of the U.S. Senate for \ndebate and discussion.\n  I do not think, in the remaining time that we are here, outside of \nthe various appropriations bills, there is any piece of legislation \nthat is more important than this legislation. But we have been in a \nconstant position now, for week after week after week, month after \nmonth after month.\n  We were denied the opportunity to get even a markup in the relevant \ncommittee, in the Human Resources Committee. We were denied an \nopportunity to consider this as an amendment on other legislation. We \nhave been denied the opportunity to have a full debate and discussion. \nWe are told, ``You take it or leave it. You take the three-amendment \nstrategy or you just do not get any debate or discussion.'' That is not \nsatisfactory. Although the leadership has been able to prevent us from \nthe opportunity of having that kind of debate and discussion up to this \nperiod of time, they will not be successful in denying us the chance to \nhave the kind of debate that we need in order to protect the consumers \nof this country.\n  So I think we have, again, missed an extraordinarily important \nopportunity to do the public business, to do the people's business, to \ntry to do something about the quality of health care for the American \npeople. We here this evening would like to give the assurance to the \nAmerican people, as the leader has, as our Democratic leader has, that \nwe will have the opportunity one way or the other to have consideration \nof this legislation before we adjourn. We should be able to do it in \nthe way in which we deal with important legislation, where we call the \nlegislation up and move toward the consideration of these various \namendments, trying to work through a timeframe to get the final \nresolution. The Democratic leader even indicated that we were prepared \nto deal with these issues at nighttime, at 6 o'clock tonight, 6 o'clock \nin the evening. There is no reason in the world that the Senate of the \nUnited States should not work tonight, from 6 o'clock to 10 o'clock, \nfor the next 4 hours, debating these particular issues, and do so \ntomorrow night, too. We could have done it last night as well. There is \nno reason, no reason in the world. If we believe this legislation is \nimportant, why aren't we here debating this issue tonight? What is so \nimportant, in terms of Members' schedules, that we are not debating or \ndiscussing this?\n  I have been in the Senate for a period of time and we have had \nevening sessions. We have had two-track sessions many, many times. At \nthis time in the session when there is important legislation to \nconsider, Senator Daschle has proposed that to the majority leader, \nsaying, 6 o'clock this evening, why aren't we out here considering and \ndebating these issues tonight for 3 or 4 hours and having resolution of \nthose? But we have been told no, we cannot do that either. We cannot \ntake the time this evening or tomorrow evening, or Friday evening, or \nnext week, or any of the evenings of next week to try to deal with the \nissues on the Patients' Bill of Rights--no. We are told we will not do \nit. You are not entitled to have that kind of debate and discussion. \nEvidently, the public interest with regard to health care will not be \nconsidered by the Republican leadership.\n  So we will be forced, as the leader pointed out, to take the \nextraordinary steps that can be taken from a parliamentary point of \nview to move ahead and consider this at another time. We will continue \nto press the leadership for that consideration, because we believe that \nthis issue is of such overpowering importance to children, to women, to \ngrandparents, to\n\n[[Page S10096]]\n\nmembers of the family, and it is essential that we deal with it. And we \nwill, as our leader has pointed out.\n  Now, we are told, as we are moving towards the consideration of the \nbankruptcy legislation, we will have a cloture motion filed so we will \nnot be able to have debate on various amendments that are relevant to \nthe issue at hand. They may not fall within the particular framework of \nthe technical provisions of the cloture motion. So we are facing the \nprospect of another cloture vote coming up on this Friday.\n  I am hopeful that we will be able to consider, on that particular \npiece of legislation, a modest increase in the minimum wage. But we are \ntold that the leadership will not permit a debate or discussion on any \nincrease in the minimum wage.\n  I have been asked why we should consider having an amendment on \nincreasing the minimum wage on this legislation. I have been asked, \nwhat is its relevancy to bankruptcy? The fact of the matter is that the \naverage wage of people filing for bankruptcy is just over $17,000 a \nyear. One of the principal reasons that individuals file bankruptcy is \nbecause their income has declined--their purchasing power has been \nreduced. No one in this Nation has seen a greater decline in their \npurchasing power than minimum wage workers.\n  Mr. President, I have here a chart that reviews where the minimum \nwage has been in the past 40 years.\n  As we can see, the real value of the minimum wage went up to $6, and \nthen to $6.50, until it reached $7.38 in the mid to late 1960s. Again, \nit bounced up and down through the 1970s at about $6 or slightly above. \nThen we saw a continued decline down to $4.34 in 1989. We saw an \nincrease again in 1991 and then the increases in 1996 and 1997 which \nbrought it up to $5.15.\n  The proposal I have made will increase the minimum wage in two \nstages--50 cents on January 1, 1999 and 50 cents on January 1, 2000. \nThat will bring the nominal value of the minimum wage to $6.15, but the \nreal value, because of inflation, will be only $5.76.\n  Even if this body accepted the increase in the minimum wage, we would \nstill be well below the historical value of the minimum wage for some \n20 years in the 1960s and 1970s. These individuals on the lower rung of \nthe economic ladder, the men and women who work 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year, hard-working men and women trying to provide for \ntheir families--they will still be earning well below what the minimum \nwage was worth for more than 20 years.\n  This issue is a woman's issue, because 60 percent of all minimum-wage \nworkers are women. It is a children's issue, because many, many of \nthose women are single moms and, therefore, their income is going to \ndictate what they can provide for their children. It is a family issue.\n  I will always remember the witness who described what an increase in \nthe minimum wage would mean to her. She said, ``It is very simple, \nSenator, we will only have to work two jobs now instead of three.'' \nOnly two jobs instead of three. What that means is increasing the \nability of those parents to spend time with their children, increasing \nthe ability of those parents to take a little time and work with their \nchildren on homework. The additional money may allow them to take their \nchild to a ball game. Maybe they can afford a birthday present. Maybe \nthey can afford to take a child out to dinner, or even see a movie. Of \ncourse, a vacation is completely out of reach--it is not even being \nconsidered.\n  This is what I mean when I talk about family issues. We hear a great \ndeal of discussion about family issues and about family values. The \nminimum wage is a family value. It is a working family value. It is \nsaying to someone who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year that \nwe are going to honor their work, and that in the United States of \nAmerica working people are not going to live in poverty. These are \nfamily values.\n  We are going to hear, Mr. President, when we get a chance to debate \nthis--and I can understand why the Republican leadership does not want \nto permit us to debate it--we are going to hear that we don't need to \nhave an increase in the minimum wage. The market will take care of \nthese workers. If we do increase the minimum wage, opponents will claim \nit will add to inflation and unemployment. This is against the \nbackground of the most extraordinary economic growth in the history of \nthis country, with the greatest prosperity, the lowest inflation, the \nlowest unemployment in a generation. We will hear, ``We can't afford \nit; we're going to lose jobs.'' We will hear that from Members of \nCongress who have experienced an increase in their own salary of more \nthan $3,000 only last year.\n  We will hear, ``We just can't afford to do that for working \nAmericans.'' It is the working Americans, the working poor who have \nfallen further and further behind in their purchasing power--further \nbehind than any group in our society.\n  I think some of us remember those wonderful charts Secretary Reich \nused to present at the Joint Economic Committee when he talked about \nthe five different economic groups and what has happened in the postwar \nperiod from 1947 right up to 1979. And it showed that the wage rates of \nthese groups increased at similar rates. Incomes of those at the lower \nrungs went up in percentages as high as if not higher than those at the \nhighest levels. This is not true any more. It is the top 1 percent, the \ntop 5 percent, the top 20 percent. Their incomes are going up through \nthe roof. Those at the lower end have been going right down through the \ncellar. This is an issue that we have an opportunity to do something \nabout.\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to answer some of the \narguments that will be made with regard to an increase in the minimum \nwage, of what that means in terms of inflation. When we debate this \nissue, I will review some of the statements that our friends and \ncolleagues made during those final hours of the 1996 debate about the \neffect on inflation and unemployment of the increase. These were the \nmost extraordinary statements. I will not take the time of the Senate \nto go through them now, but they are just so out of touch with reality \nthat it really is extraordinary.\n  Raising the minimum wage does not fuel inflation. This chart shows \nwhat the inflation rate was per month during the year or two before the \nincrease in 1996. The rate of inflation was relatively flat between \nFebruary of 1996 and October 1996. It was pretty flat--it held fairly \nsteady at three-tenths of 1 percent per month.\n  The minimum wage increased to $4.75, and look what happened to \ninflation. The rate stayed steady. In October 1996, the inflation rate \nwas maintained at three-tenths of 1 percent. Inflation declined in \nDecember 1996, and then went up and down slightly between January and \nSeptember 1997.\n  Then the minimum wage increased in September 1997 to $5.15. Here we \nsee the continued decline of inflation. In June of 1998 the inflation \nrate was one-tenth of 1 percent. This chart puts the lie to claims that \nthe minimum wage increase added to the rate of inflation in the United \nStates.\n  I believe that the overwhelming power of this argument comes from \nnotions of basic fairness and justice. But if the opponents are going \nto claim that increasing the minimum wage will increase inflation, let \nus look at what happened over the period of the last two increases, \ngoing back to October 1996 and then the increase in September 1997.\n  Mr. President, I would like to consider at the other argument that is \nmade in opposition. That is the claim that raising the minimum wage \ncauses unemployment to rise.\n  Opponents always say, ``If you increase the minimum wage, you're \ngoing to see a rise in unemployment.'' I will come to teenage \nunemployment in a minute. Unemployment overall declined dramatically \nsince the minimum wage increased in October 1996.\n  And then, after the minimum wage increased again in September 1997, \nunemployment continued to drop. Now we are at 4.5 percent unemployment, \nwhich is virtually the lowest unemployment level in a generation. Since \n1996, the nation has experienced the lowest rate of inflation and the \nlowest rate of inflation in a generation.\n  So you cannot make the argument, Mr. President, that if we increase \nthe minimum wage, it will add to the rate of inflation or add to the \nrate of unemployment.\n\n[[Page S10097]]\n\n  Mr. President, what is always said is, ``Well, all right, you don't \nreally understand it. It is teenagers, teenage unemployment. They are \nthe ones who really get squeezed.'' Let us look at teen unemployment, \nages 16 to 19, over this same period. Before the minimum wage increase, \nyou had some 16 percent teenage unemployment in 1996. Since the 1996 \nand 1997 increases, it has dropped to 15 percent unemployment. The fact \nof the matter is, Mr. President, that about a quarter of those who earn \nthe minimum wage are teenagers. Many of those teenagers are trying to \ngo out and work their way through their first or second year of \ncommunity college. They are teenagers. These kids, in many instances, \nare the ones who are trying to earn in order to continue their \neducation. They need that increase as well.\n  So, Mr. President, this chart makes the point that the total \nunemployment for teenagers is down.\n  Mr. President, the greatest opposition to this has come from the \nretail industry. But retail employment has grown by leaps and bounds \nover this period. It is growing 31 percent faster. Before the minimum \nwage increased, from September 1995 to September 1996--394,000 new \nretail jobs were added. The minimum wage increased in October 1996, and \nthen again in September 1997.\n  This is a 1-year period before the minimum wage went up. From \nSeptember to September, 394,000 new retail jobs were added. Then in the \n11 months after the increase took effect, 517,000 new jobs were added. \nThis is very dramatic growth.\n  The point about it is, Mr. President, that there is not a valid \neconomic argument to be made. I wish we had the opportunity to engage \nin that debate on the floor of the U.S. Senate with those who are \nopposed to the increase because they claim they are concerned about \nteenage unemployment, about inflation and about the effect on people \nwho work in retail stores and will lose their jobs. The facts belie \nthose claims.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about individuals who are still earning \n$2,900 below the poverty level for a family of three.\n  What will this $1 an hour increase mean to minimum wage workers? It \nwould buy almost 7 months of groceries. $1 an hour may not mean much to \nmany in this country. Certainly, it doesn't mean a lot to the people \nwho saw the stock market go up 370 points yesterday, gain over $1 \ntrillion in value in one day. Of course, all of us are glad to have \nseen the stock market go up these past few days.\n  $1 an hour might not make so much difference to those who are \ninvesting in the stock market, but it represents about 7 months of \ngroceries to an average family of four. It buys about 8 months of rent \nfor that family. It pays three-fourths of a year's tuition and fees at \na community college. It is a matter of enormous importance and it is a \nmatter of critical need for working families.\n  When you come right down to it, this issue is really about dignity. \nIt is about dignity for individuals who can pay their bills. It is \nabout dignity for people who don't have to go on welfare. It is the \ndignity of a family knowing they will not have their electricity or \ntheir water turned off because they can't pay the bill. Raising the \nminimum wage is really about dignity. It is about a sense of pride. It \nis the way parents look at children and the way children look at \nparents. This is an issue of fairness, an issue of whether we as a \nsociety honor work, for people who will work and want to work; those \npeople who are the child-care helpers, the teachers' aides in our \nschools.\n  We talk a great deal about education. Teachers' aides are important. \nMany of them earn the minimum wage. We talk about the importance of \nMedicare and Medicaid and making sure that our parents are going to be \nable to live in dignity. Much of that dignity is provided for by health \naides who earn the minimum wage. The men and women who clean office \nbuildings at nighttime, by and large, are minimum-wage earners. These \nare people who have a sense of dignity and pride in themselves, as they \nshould.\n  This is an issue of fundamental fairness. In the past, this body has \nresponded. It has responded at other times when the minimum wage has \nsunk this low. It has responded with Republican and Democratic \nleadership, with Republican Presidents and Democratic Presidents, \nalike. But we are now being told by the Republican leadership that we \nare going to be denied the opportunity even to address this issue on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate. We are told, ``We will not give you the \ntime.'' We will not have that debate tonight, here in the U.S. Senate, \nand vote at 10 o'clock tonight.\n  What is more important to the 12 million Americans who would benefit \nfrom an increase than a debate this evening and a vote at 10 o'clock \ntonight? I can understand that many of my Republican colleagues don't \nwant to vote on this issue. But that isn't a good enough reason. We are \nsent here to make choices. This is a choice that ought to be made in \nthe light of day, or even in the evening, but it ought to be made here \non the floor of the U.S. Senate. Parliamentary tricks should not be \nused to deny us the opportunity to address it. This is not a \ncomplicated issue, involving constitutional questions. This is a simple \nissue of fairness and justice. The Members of this body know it. The \nMembers of this body understand it. We don't need any more hearings on \nthis issue.\n  People know what this issue is all about. It is simple and plain: \nHere in the U.S. Senate, are we going to take steps that will guarantee \nsome fairness to American workers who need that increase and have been \nfalling further and further behind? Are we going to say, as a society, \nthat we are all going to move together, that we have a sense of common \npurpose and common direction? Will we make sure that our fellow \ncitizens can participate in this extraordinary economic expansion? Or \nare we going to say, no, we will let you stay out there in the cold, we \nwon't even debate any kind of increase? Sure, you are providing for \nyour kids, but we will not even permit the U.S. Senate the opportunity \nto debate this and vote on this, up or down; up or down.\n  Mr. President, that is why this issue is so important. I believe it \nis one of fundamental fairness. It is a defining issue. It has been a \ndefining issue at other times, and it is at this time. I am hopeful \nthat we could have a time to debate this issue. We are not interested \nin prolonged debate and discussion. As I mentioned, we would settle for \na reasonable period of time to debate this and have a vote. It is not a \ncomplex issue. We are going to continue to pursue it because we believe \nit is right and it is just and it is fair. Those are values which I \nthink most of us were sent here to uphold in the U.S. Senate.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 41 minutes 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized to \nuse such time as I may consume with respect to bankruptcy reform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today we have voted to move to consideration \nof the Bankruptcy Act. One of the sad but true causes of so many \nbankruptcies of families throughout this country is the fact that they \nare overwhelmed by medical bills. Now, this is obvious when it comes to \nthose people without insurance, because for those people, getting sick \nin America not only means being ill, it also very often means going \nbroke.\n  But one of the other aspects that is startling to so many is that \nmany families with insurance, particularly health maintenance \norganization insurance, find themselves in similar situations where the \ninsurance they paid for, they thought they bargained for, evaporates \nwhen they actually have a health care crisis.\n  That is why it is so very, very important to engage in a thorough \ndebate and legislative action with respect to the Patients' Bill of \nRights. I join all of my colleagues in issuing a challenge to the \nleadership of this body to bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights so we \ncan debate it, we can consider it, and hopefully we can pass it.\n  Indeed, we should be here tonight debating this worthy measure, or \nthe minimum wage, as my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nhas suggested, because that is truly the people's business. When I go \nback to Rhode Island, people are concerned about many things, but they \nare most\n\n[[Page S10098]]\n\nconcerned about the status of the health care and about whether or not \nworking families in my State and across this country can provide for \nthemselves.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights, the legislation that we should be \ndebating tonight, is about applying fair rules of the game to health \ncare. When it comes to health care, consumers should get the health \ncare they pay for and they should get it when they need it. But sadly, \nthis is not always the case. In many cases, it is the exception to the \nrule. It is time for this Congress to accept the President's challenge \nand pass legislation to enact guarantees for quality health care in \nthis country and important consumer protections.\n  The Patients' Bill of Rights introduced by Democratic leader Daschle, \nprotects patients' rights, while the opposing version introduced by \nSenator Lott and Senator Nickles leaves too many loopholes and does not \nprovide adequate protections for consumers. By addressing only self-\nfunded, non-ERISA plans, the Lott-Nickles bill excludes 113 million \nAmericans from the protections that are necessary, and, indeed, if you \nfollow the logic of their bill, if a portion of Americans need \nprotection in their health care plan, if a portion of Americans need \nthese protections from insurance companies that are too much oriented \ntoward the bottom line and not quality health care, why should all \nAmericans in private health care plans not have these protections?\n\n  That is what the Daschle bill does. It would provide coverage for all \n161 million Americans who aren't privately insured. This bill submitted \nby Leader Daschle provides full protection to patients, including, for \nexample, access to specialists, pediatric specialists for children, \ncoverage for emergency services, an internal and an independent \nexternal appeals process, and allowing patients to hold health plans \naccountable in court.\n  All of these protections are important to the health and well-being \nof all Americans. And all of these protections deserve full debate and \nconsideration on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Now, an offer of a \nsingle vote on the bill with an extremely limited opportunity for \namendments is not the full, vigorous debate that this issue requires--\nin fact, that this issue demands. The health care of the American \npeople is too important to try to squeeze in between other issues here \non the floor of the Senate. I think we should move today to bring up \nthis legislation, debate it vigorously, pass it and send it forward. \nOur colleagues in the other body have done so. Now the challenge is \nwith this body to move forward deliberately and purposefully to pass \nprotections that will ensure quality health care and access to all \nAmericans.\n  There is a particular aspect of this debate that I am extremely \ninterested in, which is ensuring that there are adequate protections in \nmanaged care plans for children. Too often, children are ignored in the \npreparation of these plans. Too often, pediatric illnesses are \nrelegated to just another variation of adult illnesses. Too often, \nchildren are just seen through these lenses as smaller adults when, in \nfact, pediatric care is a very specialized part of the health care \ndelivery system. And too often, parents discover that what they bargain \nfor and what they thought they had in terms of protections evaporate \nwhen their child is ill.\n  Earlier this year I introduced my own legislation that would ensure \nthat children are not left out of this great debate about managed care, \nthat children would, in fact, be the focal point of very specific \nprocedures within managed care plans, that there would be access to \npediatric specialists. A family could choose a pediatrician as a \nprimary care provider, and pediatric specialists would evaluate \noutcomes relative to children. In working with the pediatric hospitals \nand with the American Academy of Pediatrics, I have come to understand \nthe very specialized care that is necessary to deliver such care to \nchildren. Without such care, illnesses that may have been treated \nsuccessfully and cheaply in children become traumatic and complicated \nillnesses that are more expensive and more threatening to the health of \nthis child and later to that adult.\n  My words are less compelling than the words of the people in my home \nState of Rhode Island who have dealt with this health care morass. A \nfew weeks ago, I had the opportunity to share a podium with Dr. Karen \nLaMorge. She detailed the problems she had in getting adequate health \ncare for her father and the fact that the insurance company would not \nprovide a second opinion, and they would not make easy referrals to \nspecialists. One of the great ironies of her story is that Dr. LaMorge \nis a podiatrist and, in fact, a member of the professional panels of \nthis particular HMO. Now, she, a skilled professional, a provider \nherself, cannot easily and quickly get adequate care for her father.\n\n  What happens to the average citizen who confronts this morass of \nregulations and rules and consents and approvals and daily calls and \ntracking down people to give the right approval? It becomes a daunting \nexperience. Many, many Americans simply get exhausted trying to get \nbasic health care for their families and themselves. Some give up. \nOthers press on, enduring huge costs in time, efforts and energy. That \nis not the way our health care system should operate.\n  With the Patients' Bill of Rights, we will go a long way toward \nensuring that it doesn't operate that way, that there is an opportunity \nfor high-quality care that is accessible and, indeed, also affordable, \nbecause, frankly, there is a lot of money being spent by these health \ncare plans on administrators and bureaucrats. Maybe more could be \ndirected to health care and to the American citizens.\n  There is a particular aspect of this which I find particularly \ncompelling, and I mentioned it before; that is, the aspect of pediatric \nhealth care. A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to visit the \nHassenfeld Children's Cancer Center at New York University Hospital in \nNew York City. There I saw the care they are giving to dying children. \nI heard from the frontline professionals, the social workers, nurses, \ndoctors, about the daily frustrations they face and endure in trying to \nget adequate care for these children from HMOs. The idea that they \nwould spend days trying to get hospice care for a child who is dying, \nthe idea that they would have to get daily approval and reapprovals for \na course of treatment that is clear and obvious and has been prescribed \nis just an example of the state of this system, which is, in many \nrespects, a crisis for so many families in this country.\n  We can do better. We must do better. But we can only do that if we \nhave the will. We must bring this legislation to the floor. We must \nbring this legislation to this floor promptly. There are few days left, \nbut in those days it is our obligation to serve the interests of the \nAmerican people. At the top of their list is a more rational, more \nappropriate health care system. We are within striking distance of \nthat, if we just act.\n  As I mentioned before, the other body has acted. It is our \nresponsibility, our turn to step up to the plate and to get a greater \nhit than even Mark McGwire, because this hit will ensure that every \nfamily in America has good access to health care and will help that \nprocess to continue along. We should stay here tonight and every night \nand not simply make speeches with respect to this underlying bankruptcy \nbill, but actively debating and actively voting on, in a robust, wide-\nopen debate, HMO protections for the people of America. As Senator \nKennedy suggested, we should also take up the minimum wage because \nthat, too, is a way to address the real problems that face America.\n  I hope that our resolution tonight would be to take up these \nmeasures, debate them fairly and honestly, and to vote and give the \nAmerican people what they so desperately want and deserve--a health \ncare system that works for them, and for those low-income working \nAmericans a decent wage which will lift them out of poverty. I hope we \ndo that. Certainly I think I and my colleagues will continue to urge \nthat action on this Senate, and hopefully these words will take heart \nand take hold.\n\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the \nfloor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10099]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate completes its legislative business today, it then proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 505, H.R. 4250, the House-passed HMO \nreform bill, that only relevant amendments be in order, and that the \nbill become the pending business every day thereafter upon completion \nof legislative business.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the hour is again upon us, as it was last \nnight. I suggested last night that we move to a second shift, that at \napproximately 7 o'clock every night we take up legislation our \nRepublican colleagues say we don't have time for during the day.\n  I am very disappointed, once again, that our Republican colleagues \nhave objected to doing that. There is absolutely no reason why, with \nless than 6 weeks left in the session, we leave this Chamber at 10 \nminutes to 7. There is no reason for that. How many businesses would \nsurvive with an incredible amount of production in front of them if \nthey were to say: We are going to take off work early, we are not going \nto work a second shift, we are not going to work as if we are in a \nstate of emergency, we are going to treat the situation as business as \nusual?\n  Mr. President, that is what we are doing with the schedule right now. \nIt is remarkable to me that with little time left in the session, our \nRepublican colleagues are content to go home and in a sense tell the \nAmerican people: Look, we don't have time to consider your problems. We \ndon't have time to consider the importance of HMO reform or to pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights. We don't care; we are going home.\n  Mr. President, that ought not be the message we send the American \npeople. So that is why we have suggested working a second shift. That \nis why we have suggested coming to the Senate floor at this hour each \nevening to pick up where we left off the night before, to recognize \nthat we will never be able to address this and other serious problems \nunless we are willing to stay here and do our work. We have worked hard \nto bring the Senate to the point of passing a meaningful Patients' Bill \nof Rights. More than 170 organizations wait for us to act tonight. \nMillions and millions of people who have high expectations about the \npossibility of realistically dealing with this problem wait for us to \nact tonight.\n  I am disappointed, disappointed, No. 1, that our Republican \ncolleagues again would rather go home than do their work, disappointed \nthat legislation which has now passed in the House languishes in the \nSenate without any hope of passing unless we stay here tonight or \ntomorrow night or the next night. And I am disappointed by what it \nmeans in terms of the real prospects for accomplishment, the real \nprospects for getting something done, the real chance that we can leave \nand close down the 105th Congress feeling good about having addressed \none of the most serious problems facing the American people today.\n  There are too many insurance companies making decisions for doctors. \nThere are too many women who are being turned out of hospitals too \nearly. There are too many patients who are not being given the \nopportunity to choose their doctor. There are too many people whose \ndoctors prescribe a medicine only to be overturned by an insurance \ncompany.\n  Mr. President, it goes on and on. The problem we have is that unless \nwe act, unless we are willing to do our work, unless we take this \nsecond shift, we will never have the opportunity to bring this \nimportant issue to closure.\n  Obviously, there is one other way to do it, and that is to eat up the \nday throughout the day. We have already indicated that if we can't take \na second shift approach, then we have no other recourse but to offer \nthis legislation in the form of an amendment on any vehicle that comes \nalong. Whatever bill may be pending, we will have no other option but \nto offer it as an amendment, and we will do that just as we have done \nit before. We will offer it on a bill that will require our colleagues \nto vote.\n  So it is not a question of avoiding the vote. We will either do it in \na constructive way on a second shift or we will do it in a \nconfrontational way during the day on the first shift. But we are going \nto do it. We have said that in the remaining days of this session we \nmust have a vote on minimum wage, we must have a vote on a Patients' \nBill of Rights, we must have a vote on campaign finance reform, we must \nhave a vote on pay equity, and we must have a vote on a series of \namendments that will improve the crisis in agriculture today. Those are \nvotes we must have, and we must find a way with which to accommodate \neach other's priorities to allow that to happen.\n  Again, let me express my disappointment, my sorrow, my frustration at \nour Republican colleagues' unwillingness to cooperate with us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I would be happy to yield to the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator has pointed out, it is 7 o'clock this \nevening. We had last evening, we will have tomorrow evening. There is \nno reason we can't go from 7 to 10 or 10:30. The Senator remembers the \ntimes where we have had these double sessions. They are not a very \nunusual process and procedure. I will include in the Record tomorrow \nthe instances when we have had these, generally at the end of sessions, \nbut they have been a two-track process by which we deal with certain \nmeasures during the day and others during the course of the evening.\n  Does the Senator agree with me, for example, on the Patients' Bill of \nRights that if we took Tuesday and Wednesday and Thursday evenings and \ndid it from 7 to 10, 10:30 probably this week, three different \nevenings, there would be a good opportunity where we could probably \nfinish that legislation, or perhaps take one or more evenings of next \nweek to address the issues which the Senator has talked about. We could \nhave a good debate on the question of minimum wage--whether it has been \ninflationary, whether there has been loss of employment, the impact on \nsmall employment, the various kinds of arguments that have been made--\nand we would be able to dispose of that in a fair and reasonable time, \nas well as the agriculture and farm issues, pay equity, and other \nissues?\n  Does the Senator believe, if we knew now that we were going to do \nthis, the membership would become engaged in this legislation, \nparticularly if we had notice that we were going to consider various \nlegislation with due notice, in 2 or 3 nights we would consider X \nlegislation, which is sort of a time-honored way that we have proceeded \nhere? Is that the kind of arrangement that the Senator is looking for \nso that the membership would have notice of the legislation and we \ncould have that kind of debate during the course of the evenings? Does \nthe Senator think there is any other business that is more important \nfor us to be involved in at this time than those issues which people \nhave expressed an interest and concern about such as the Patients' Bill \nof Rights issue?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate very much the question of the Senator from \nMassachusetts. The answer is, ``No.''\n  I know the Senator, who is a real student of history and has a wealth \nof experience, can go back to those occasions over many, many years \nwhen we have found nighttime debates to be the best debates because \nthere are no interruptions. Why? Because Senators don't have to be in \ntheir offices with appointments and phone calls. They can be here on \nthe Senate floor. If we are here, we get more interaction.\n  There have been some extraordinary debates on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate after 7 o'clock at night. And the reason for that is because, \noftentimes, we do\n\n[[Page S10100]]\n\nnot have so many other tugs and pulls on our schedules.\n  So, first of all, the Senator is right when he comments about the \nhistorical precedent for this approach. Second, he is correct that not \nonly is it a common Senate practice, but actually the quality of the \ndebate oftentimes is enhanced. Third, unless we do it this way, I fear \nthat we really are not going to have the opportunity to address the \nissues, as the Senator from Massachusetts has pointed out, that have \nthe highest priority when you ask the American people what we should be \naddressing.\n  So from the perspective of priority, from the perspective of quality, \nfrom the perspective of history, the Senator from Massachusetts is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. Would he not agree with me that we \nhave a general understanding that Thursday nights are the late night in \nthe Senate? We do that with the idea that we hope we can finish various \nmeasures that may go on over to Friday out of consideration to some of \nthose Senators who live in different parts, some distance away from the \nNation's Capital, to try at least to accommodate some of their \ninterests.\n  So the idea that we have a night session is not really unique or \nspecial. Members are here during the period of the week. They are on \nnotice now. We have just come back from a good break in the period of \nAugust, but we have a limited time that is available. I must say, I \nfail to find an adequate response by the Republican leadership to the \nSenator's eminently fair and reasonable proposal. It would seem to me \nwe ought to at least try it for a week, try it for a week or two and \nfind out how we are proceeding. We could consider the Patients' Bill of \nRights, for example, a measure of enormous importance to the millions \nof families in this country. We have been denied that opportunity to \nhave the debate. We have always been told we cannot have that debate \nbecause we are not going to take up a lot of the Senate's time.\n  The way I understand the leader's proposal is we might be able to do \nthat in the evening time until we reach a conclusion on that so we \nwould not interfere with the appropriations legislation.\n  What is possibly the justification not to do it? Are we saying our \nown personal requirements are of greater importance than trying to deal \nwith the business of America's families--whether they are in South \nDakota or in Massachusetts--who are very, very much affected by what we \nfail to do here in reaching some resolution on the Patients' Bill of \nRights?\n  I do not know whether the leader had an opportunity to see the list \nof the various parts of the Patients' Bill of Rights bill that I had on \nthe floor a short time ago, but I know the Senator is very familiar \nwith them. Doesn't he agree that probably 17 or 18 topic areas are \nabout it with regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights, and probably even \nsome of those areas could be accommodated by individual Members on both \nsides who are really interested in trying to reach a resolution? We \ncould deal with these other measures--whether women are going to be in \nclinical trials; whether we are going to have appeals procedures; \nwhether we are going to have gag rules--and the various other \nprotections the Senator mentioned earlier.\n  Doesn't the Senator feel we could work that through in a reasonable \nperiod of time if we involved the Senate in debate during these weekday \nnights?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator has asked a couple of very good questions. \nThe first question he asked is why we are quitting work at an hour that \ncould easily accommodate debate on important issues? I think the answer \nis, we all appreciate a family-friendly environment. We all enjoy being \nable to go home to our families. By and large, in the last couple of \nyears, we have been able to do that. We have had a family-friendly \nlegislative session that has accommodated personal needs. I think that \nis understandable, and for the most part, I think I have supported it.\n  I think there comes a time, though, when you get to this period at \nthe end of the Congress--not the end of a session, we are talking about \nthe end of a Congress. We have just a few weeks left, and our work has \nto take priority.\n  As the Senator noted, usually Thursday nights have been nights where \nwe work late. What we are suggesting is that we at least take Tuesday, \nWednesday and Thursday nights, for the balance of the time that remains \nin this session, and use that time productively. Let's take 3 or 4 \nhours and see what we can accomplish--particularly on something as \nimportant as the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  The second question is about the degree to which we want to be able \nto offer amendments. I heard the Senator so compellingly speak about \nother bills that have required hundreds of amendments, in some cases \nwell over 100 amendments for bills of great import. We are not even \nasking for that, as the Senator has noted. I think his chart points \nthat out.\n  There are categories for which there are legitimate differences of \nopinion. We want to be able to offer amendments in those areas, to be \nable to have a good debate and discuss them. But to say you are going \nto be forced into this three-amendment limit with no ability to talk \nabout all the very serious concerns is just unacceptable and does not \ndo justice to the issue. They say we don't have time for a full debate. \nWe have 3 hours of time. They say we have to limit ourselves to three \namendments, even though other bills have taken 150 amendments--we have \nthe time. We have the interest. What is holding them up? No one can \nreally answer that for us. Obviously that is the perplexing question. \nThe bill has passed in the House. Why not debate it here in the Senate \nas well?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the leader for, again, his leadership in this \nimportant area. Next time there is objection to the proposal--the \nRepublican leadership says we can't afford the time for this; we can't \nafford the time to debate it-- it is going to ring very hollow after we \nhave seen the very reasonable request of the leader to debate those \nissues this evening. The Senator from South Dakota has introduced the \nlegislation. He is here tonight to debate it, and I welcome the chance \nto join with him in debating that. We are here ready to go on this \nlegislation. We could do it this evening or any night this week. It is \nnot satisfactory enough for the American people, just to say, as the \nRepublican leadership has, ``No, we are not going to do this, and we \nare going to refuse to permit this debate and discussion.'' That is not \nreally in the great traditions of this body. This body was supposed to \ndeal with the public interest, the unfinished agenda.\n  There is nothing more important than protecting American families \nfrom decisions being made by insurance companies rather than health \nprofessionals. There is nothing more important, in terms of the health \ncare of these families, before the Senate this year. I think it is \ngrossly unfair.\n  So I commend, again, the leader for bringing this up. I know the \nleader will bring up the amendment. Then we will hear from the other \nside, ``Oh, my goodness, we can't do that; we can't do this. It's \nimpossible to do it.'' We could have done it this evening; probably \nlast night and the other nights this week. I certainly join in \nsupporting his efforts to insist that we are going to debate these, and \nwe are going to reach resolution on these matters before we conclude.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nthoughtful comments and for his willingness to engage in this colloquy.\n  I think the legislative history ought to demonstrate that there are \nthose of us who truly want this issue resolved. We really are prepared \nto put in the time and effort to come to closure on what is the most \nimportant health question facing this Congress, and that is, how do we \ndeal with the array of problems we are facing in managed care today.\n  No one has put more time and effort and leadership into this question \nthan the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. I am grateful for \nthe partnership and extraordinary effort he has demonstrated and put \nforth in bringing us to this point.\n  Mr. President, unless there are further comments, I yield the floor, \nand I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10101]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Lott] for Mr. Grassley, \n     for himself and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3559.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provision of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the substitute \n     amendment to Calendar No. 394, S. 1301, the Consumer \n     Bankruptcy Protection Act:\n         Trent Lott, Orrin G. Hatch, Charles Grassley, Arlen \n           Specter, Strom Thurmond, Connie Mack, Ben Nighthorse \n           Campbell, Thad Cochran, Tim Hutchinson, Wayne Allard, \n           Christopher Bond, Rick Santorum, Chuck Hagel, Larry E. \n           Craig, and Jon Kyl.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, this \ncloture vote would occur, then, on Friday 1 hour after the Senate \nconvenes unless changed by unanimous consent or unless we get something \nworked out.\n  I yield to Senator Daschle for his comments on this or his \nsuggestions as to how we might proceed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the leader's comments \nearlier. I do believe that there is an opportunity here for us to come \nto some procedural conclusion on how we might address this bill. I \nthink that Senators Grassley and Durbin have been working in good \nfaith. I have had the opportunity to discuss this matter with Senator \nKennedy. I personally don't believe the cloture motion is the most \nconstructive approach, but I also recognize that the majority leader \nhas noted that that could be vitiated were we to come to some \nagreement.\n  I think it is a fair statement that if we are forced into a cloture \nmotion, nothing will happen. If we can reach an agreement, there may be \nan opportunity for us to have a good debate and to have some votes on \nkey amendments, both directly relevant to the bill and perhaps not as \ndirectly relevant, but certainly relevant to the American agenda.\n  I am hopeful that we can accommodate the needs of Senators who have \nexpressed an interest in amending this bill. I am confident that we \ncan, and I hope this cloture motion will not be necessary.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, just in conclusion, once again, I urge all \nof the Senators that are interested in this legislation that they begin \nwork right away, tomorrow, so that we will not let the whole day pass \nwithout trying to work something out. Senator Daschle and I will talk \nas the day progresses. That would be the wise thing to do, I think, if \nwe can work something out that is reasonable, to allow us to continue \nto complete campaign finance reform, and so we can go on and hopefully \ncomplete the Interior appropriations bill.\n  This is a positive move and I appreciate the opportunity to work on \nit to see if we can get something agreed to.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask that the mandatory quorum under \nrule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. On behalf of the managers of the bankruptcy bill, I hope \nMembers will file their amendments in a timely manner. I know there are \namendments that Senators are very interested in that would even be \nrelevant postcloture, and then there are others that obviously Members \nare interested in, too. I hope they will file them. The managers are \nattempting to clear as many amendments as possible and would like to \nreach a consent agreement limiting amendments, if that is at all \npossible, and perhaps that could be taken care of in our agreement that \nwe are working on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10101-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, we appear to be only days away from \nreceiving the Independent Counsel's report on President Clinton. The \npressure on Congress is escalating. Talk of impeachment is in the air \nalong with suggestions of resolutions of reprimand and censure. Some \nhave even suggested that we ought to get on with impeachment and ``get \nthis thing behind us.''\n  There had to come a time, sooner or later, when the boil would be \nlanced. The problem is, that with the lancing, a hemorrhaging may be \nonly one of those continuing symptoms of a greater lancing--perhaps \neven an amputation--that still lurks in the shadows up ahead.\n  There is no question but that the President, himself, has sown the \nwind, and he is reaping the whirlwind. His televised speech of August \n17 heaped hot coals upon himself, coals causing wounds which continue \nto inflame and burn ever more deeply. Coming, as the speech did, so \nsoon after the President's appearance before the Grand Jury, his words \nwere ill-timed, ill-formed, and ill-advised. Perhaps if he had only \ndelayed his televised speech for 24 hours, he may have, upon \nreflection, avoided some self-inflicted wounds that have since festered \nand continue to fester.\n\n       The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,\n       Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit\n       Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,\n       Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.\n\n  When the scribes and Pharisees brought before Jesus a woman taken in \nadultery, saying that, under Moses, the law commanded that she be \nstoned, they sought to tempt Jesus that they might accuse him. He said \nunto them: ``He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a \nstone at her.'' And that ancient admonition, that he who is without sin \nshould cast the first stone, applies to every human being in this \ncountry today. Someone else has said: ``No man's life will bear looking \ninto.'' These admonishments should give all of us pause and should \nencourage reflection and self-examination. In this instance, the \nPresident, himself, has, by his own actions and words, thrown the first \nstone at himself and thus made himself vulnerable to the stoning by \nothers.\n  What a sorrowful spectacle! To maintain that Presidents have private \nlives\n\n[[Page S10110]]\n\nis, of course, not to be denied, but the Oval Office of the White House \nis not a private office; it is where much of the business of the Nation \nis conducted daily; it is the people's office; and the only real \nprivacy that any President can realistically claim is in the third-\nfloor living quarters of the White House with his family. What the \nPresident had hoped to claim was ``nobody else's business'' has now \nbecome everybody else's business.\n\n  His speech was a lawyer-worded effort--as in the reference to \n``legally accurate'' testimony--and the people have long since grown \ntired of having to pick and sift among artfully crafted words that have \ntoo often obscured the truth rather than revealed it.\n  The White House's apparent strategy of delay and attack over so many \nlong months has only succeeded in stringing out a judgment day that is \nincreasingly threatening, and has only made bad matters worse. Former \nPresident Nixon, in an earlier tragedy for the Nation and for all of us \nwho were here and lived through it, tried the same thing--delay, delay, \ndelay, and counter-attack, attack, attack--and it failed in the end.\n  We seem to be living recent history all over again. As the Book of \nEcclesiastes plainly tells us, ``There is no new thing under the sun.'' \nTime seems to be turning backward in its flight, and many of the \nmistakes that President Nixon made are being made all over again.\n  We also must stop and remember that this is a sad time for the \nPresident and his family, a sad time for his friends and supporters \nthroughout the country, a sad time for the devoted members of his staff \nwho have labored and sacrificed and given so much for a man in whom \nthey implicitly believed. It is a sad time for members of his cabinet \nand heads of agencies who publicly defended him and who depended on his \nword.\n  But it is an even sadder time for the country. As a schoolboy, I \nlooked upon George Washington and Thomas Jefferson and James Madison \nand Abraham Lincoln as my idols to be emulated; I looked upon Babe Ruth \nand Jack Dempsey and Charles Lindbergh and Benjamin Franklin and Thomas \nEdison and Nathan Hale and Daniel Morgan and Nathaniel Green and \nStonewall Jackson as my heroes. I was taught, as most of us were, to \nrevere God. I was taught to believe the Bible, and that a judgment day \nwould surely come when we would all be punished for our sins or be \nsaved by our faith and good works.\n  The old couple who raised me taught me by their example and their \nwords not to lie but to tell the truth, not to cheat but to be honest; \nbut what will parents tell their children today? Can they tell them to \nplow a straight furrow and that honesty is still the best policy? To \nwhom can our young people look for inspiration?\n  I recently asked a question on this floor, ``Where have all the \nheroes gone?'' I ask that question again today. Where have all the \nheroes gone? Fortunately, we do have a Mark McGwire and a Sammy Sosa, \nboth of whom have captured the Nation's admiration with their home \nruns. But where are the Nation's leaders to whom the children can look \nand be inspired to work hard and live clean lives?\n  The political and social environment in which parents must today \nraise their children is, unfortunately, an environment in which \nanything goes; politicians try to be all things to all people; family \nvalues and religious values which made us a great Nation are looked \nupon as old-fashioned, unsophisticated, and the product of ignorance \nand rusticness. Profanity and vulgarity, sex and violence are pervasive \nin television programming, in the movies, and in much of today's books \nthat pretend to pass for literature. The Nation is inexorably sinking \ntoward the lowest common denominator in its standards and values. \nHaven't we had enough?\n\n     I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;\n       It weeps, it bleeds, and each new day\n       A gash is added to her wounds.\n\n  Yes, talk of impeachment and censure and resignation is in the air. \nIt is on almost everybody's mind with whom I have talked.\n  As we find ourselves being brought nearer and nearer, as it would \nseem, to a yawning abyss, I urge that we all step back and give \nourselves and the country a little pause in which to reflect and \nmeditate before we cast ourselves headlong over the precipice.\n  To say we ought to get on with impeachment and ``get the thing behind \nus'' is a bold thing to say; but boldness, to the point of \ncavalierness, can come back to haunt us.\n  I suggest that we Senators should let the House do its work and wait \nto see what action that body takes. The Senate cannot vote on Articles \nof Impeachment--we all know that--until the House formulates such \narticles and presents them by its managers to the Senate--if it ever \ndoes so. I also suggest that putting ``this thing behind us'' is not \ngoing to be an easy thing to do. If Congress reaches that stage of \nvoting on Articles of Impeachment it is going to be a traumatic \nexperience for all of us, both here in this city and throughout the \ncountry. The House is in no position to formulate Articles of \nImpeachment prior to its receipt and consideration of--and I emphasize \nconsideration--the Starr report. The Judiciary Committee--I am talking \nabout the Judiciary Committee in the House--will undoubtedly want to \nhold hearings before it formulates any Articles of Impeachment if such \nappear to be called for.\n  That is the House's charge; that is the House's responsibility, not \nours. If and when such Articles are presented here to the Senate--they \nare not amendable here, and the Senate, in such cases, is limited to an \nup-or-down vote on each Article--that will be a matter of the utmost \ngravity. All Senators will be sworn. I tell you. That will be a matter \nof the utmost gravity. Caution should be the order of the day.\n  If, sometime in the future, the American people should come to \nbelieve that this President, or any other President, has been driven \nout of office for what they may perceive to be political reasons, their \nwrath will fall upon those who jumped to judgment prematurely. That is \nnot something that we can so easily ``put behind us.'' Both the media \nand those of us who may ultimately be called upon to sit in judgment \nshould exercise restraint in pressing toward a particular conclusion \nbefore all of the facts are known. There is a constitutional process in \nplace. We should all let it work.\n  It is my suggestion that everyone should exercise some self-restraint \nagainst calling for impeachment or censure or for the President's \nresignation.\n  Who knows? I may do that before it is all over. But not now. We \nshould exercise some self-restraint against calling for impeachment, or \ncensure, or for resignation--until the other body has had an \nopportunity to study and sift through the Starr report.\n  There are many avenues down which we could travel as we grapple with \nthis matter. Among them is the path of official censure which some have \nsuggested. Others may think that censure is ``meaningless.'' Let me \nstate for the record that that is not my view. I have written in my \nwork on the Senate that censure has no constitutional basis.\n  It doesn't mean that censure is unconstitutional. Just as ``holds'' \nthat are placed on bills and resolutions have no basis in the Senate \nrules, they nevertheless have grown up as a custom here, and such \n``holds'' are practiced.\n  I have observed that censure is not mentioned in the Constitution. \nBut, certainly censure is not ``meaningless.'' It is a serious and \nemphatic expression of condemnation and disapproval. Censure by the \nCongress is a major blot on the record and reputation of a public \nofficial. While at this point, I prefer to reserve judgment on that \ncourse, it should not be simply brushed off as ``meaningless.''\n  And we must not fail to consider the lessons of history. For my part, \nI have seen history repeat itself. I served on the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and was the Democratic Whip during the weeks and months of \nthe Nixon tragedy. Some of the aspects of that tragedy can be seen in \nthe problems that are today confronting us. Some aspects are different. \nMuch is the same.\n  By April 1973, there had been talk of impeachment of President Nixon, \nwith some people saying that he should resign. On May 23 of that year, \nI said, ``As of now, there is no reason for President Nixon to resign, \nand talk of impeachment is at best, premature, and, at worst, \nreckless.'' Citing the lack of hard evidence ``to date,'' I also\n\n[[Page S10111]]\n\nsaid, ``It is a time for restraint and sobriety in our words, our \nactions, and our judgments.''\n  I later said that impeachment would require ``hard evidence'' of \nNixon's complicity in Watergate and would also require strong ``public \nopinion to support'' impeachment and conviction. And I say to my \ncolleagues here today, it will require strong ``public opinion to \nsupport'' impeachment and conviction of any President in the future.\n  ``We all shrink from taking a step that is the most drastic step \nauthorized in the Constitution,'' I said. I added that ``the bare \npossibility of resignation of Mr. Nixon at some point is a more likely \nevent than impeachment.'' Those are my quotes as I look back.\n  On January 28, 1974, I was a guest on ``Washington's Straight Talk,'' \na 30-minute public television interview show. In reference to the \nimpact that the Watergate Affair was having on the President, I stated: \n``There is no question but that his influence has been greatly eroded. \nI doubt that he can ever regain the confidence of the American \npeople.'' I also said that impeachment of the President ``is becoming a \nmore realistic possibility, but there is still no groundswell for \nimpeachment.'' I was talking about a Republican President in that \ninstance. ``There is an uneasiness on impeachment because of the \nparalysis that would come with it,'' I said then.\n  I cosponsored a resolution directing the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration--on which I served and still serve--to review all \nexisting rules and precedents that applied to impeachment trials in \norder to recommend any revisions to the rules that might be necessary. \nThe result of our work was an exhaustively researched publication, \ntitled, ``Procedure and Guidelines for Impeachment Trials in the United \nStates Senate.'' The Senate was, indeed, gearing up for an impeachment \ntrial--if needed.\n  But, on Thursday, August 8, 1974--almost a quarter of a century ago--\nPresident Nixon resigned, his resignation to be effective at noon the \nnext day. And promptly after noon on Friday, August 9, Gerald Ford was \nsworn in as the 38th President.\n  Mr. President, just as I urged caution and patience in 1973 and 1974, \nI urge that same course now. I suggest that we try to restrain \nourselves and wait until the House of Representatives has had an \nopportunity to examine the contents of Mr. Starr's report. It will be \nforthcoming soon, I hear. Perhaps before the week is out. Let us, as \nSenators, remember that if the House ultimately votes to impeach this \nPresident--and we all should be careful not to attempt to influence the \nother body--when I say ``we all'' I have reference to ourselves, to the \nexecutive branch and to the media--in any way in a decision which \nshould rest with the House, and it alone--we Senators, who must sit as \njurors if the worst ever comes to worst, will carry a heavy burden in \nthat event. We must not compromise any final decision by rushing to \njudgment in advance. I trust that we will all weigh carefully, in our \nown minds and hearts, the possible consequences to the nation of our \nwords and actions and judgments if that duty ultimately should beckon \nus. If it does, there will be many difficult questions.\n  What is an impeachable offense? We read in last weekend's newspaper. \nAnd what is meant by ``high crimes and misdemeanors''? We heard the \nquestion asked on television. Gerald Ford, in remarks to the House of \nRepresentatives in April 1970, stated: ``The only honest answer is that \nan impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of \nRepresentatives considers [it] to be at a given moment in history; \nconviction results from whatever offense or offenses two-thirds''--not \njust 60--``of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to \nrequire removal of the accused from office.''\n  Even though the debates and actions at the Philadelphia Convention \nregarding impeachment appear on the record to have been comparatively \nsparse, they seem to indicate clearly enough that the framers intended \nthe phrase ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' to subsume corruption, \nmaladministration, gross and wanton neglect of duty, misuse of official \npower, and other violations of the public trust by officeholders.''\n  The interpretation of the Constitution's clause on impeachable \noffenses entered into the ratification debates. James Iredell, speaking \nat the North Carolina Convention, declared that the ``power of \nimpeachment'' given by the Constitution was ``to bring great offenders \nto punishment. . . . for crime which it is not easy to describe, but \nwhich every one must be convinced is a high crime and misdemeanor \nagainst the government.'' Iredell, who would later serve as a Supreme \nCourt justice, said that the ``occasion'' for exercise of the \nimpeachment power ``will arise from acts of great injury to the \ncommunity, and the objects of it may be such as cannot be easily \nreached by an ordinary tribunal.''\n  Alexander Hamilton, hoping to influence the critical New York \ndecision on ratification, explained in The Federalist No. 65:\n\n       A well constituted court for the trial of impeachments, is \n     an object not more to be desired than difficult to be \n     obtained in a government wholly elective. The subjects of its \n     jurisdiction are those offenses which proceed from the \n     misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or \n     violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which \n     may with peculiar propriety to be denominated political, as \n     they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the \n     society itself. . . . What it may be asked is the true spirit \n     of the institution itself? Is it not designed as a method of \n     national inquest into the conduct of public men?\n\n  A misconception that has surfaced during impeachment trials is the \nnotion that criminal or civil standards of proof are somehow required \nin order to convict. Such standards run the gamut from the lowest \nthreshold, proof by ``preponderance of the evidence,'' which must be \nmet by plaintiffs in most civil cases; to the next highest standard, \nproof by ``clear and convincing evidence,'' employed in some classes of \ncivil cases; to the most rigorous standard, ``proof beyond a reasonable \ndoubt,'' imposed for criminal cases. Of course, Mr. President, a \nSenator may apply any standard of proof he or she desires, or may \nchoose to apply no set standard whatever. But, given the history of \nimpeachment in the United States and the fact that neither civil \npenalties nor criminal punishments are applicable in impeachment cases, \nany talk of standards of proof seems rather pointless and likely to be \nunproductive.\n  If they have taught us nothing else, the events of recent months at \nleast should have taught us the essential importance of restraint. As \nMembers of this body, we are all likely to be sorely tested in this \nmatter. The nation will look to us for leadership. And in critical \ntimes, real leadership often requires one to turn one's back on the \ndaily hue and cry and quietly sort through the noise of competing \ninterests for the one overriding, essential interest. Such a course \ndemands restraint and discipline. We, who may one day be called upon to \nbear the brunt of the responsibility of deciding the fate of a \npresident, must reach for those qualities at this time.\n  And so, I respectfully urge everyone in this town to calm down for a \nlittle while and contemplate with seriousness the impact that our \nactions may have on the well-being of the nation, and the paralysis \nwhich we may be spawning if we continue to be mesmerized with each new \nrumor, and each new titillating whisper. The President's situation--and \nthe Congress', the media's, and the public's all-consuming obsession \nwith it--has contributed to a loss of focus on, and attention to, many \naspects of our national life that have far-reaching consequences; and \nwe shall see a continuation of that loss of focus when and if the time \never comes that we have to vote on an impeachment resolution. Nowhere \nis this more true than in the realm of foreign policy. In the few \nsnippets of newspaper and news shows which attempt to turn our \nattention from our unfortunate domestic travails and focus instead on \nevents overseas, we can see the troubling signs of a long and difficult \nwinter ahead.\n\n  In the Balkans, the Serb-dominated Yugoslav Army has reportedly \nrounded up ethnic Albanian men and boys of fighting age in the province \nof Kosovo, labeling them all ``terrorists.'' This action bears the \nbloody stains of earlier Serbian ``ethnic cleansing'' in neighboring \nBosnia that eventually led to a massive intervention by NATO. What \naction, if any, should the U.S. take? I fear that our lack of attention \nmay\n\n[[Page S10112]]\n\nallow the situation to get even further out of hand.\n  In Iraq, troubling questions have been raised about an unwillingness \nto deal with continued Iraqi intransigence over weapons inspections. \nRussia's economy and indeed her very government appear on the verge of \ndissolution. North Korea has launched a long range missile right over \nour ally, Japan. In China and elsewhere, many tens of thousands of \npeople face the coming winter hungry and homeless as a result of floods \nand fires and droughts. And, not least, acts of terrorism against U.S. \nembassies and interests continue to threaten. All of these unhappy \ncircumstances will challenge the U.S. economy and U.S. leadership. It \nill behooves us all to become so enmeshed in the current web of scandal \nthat we ignore or obscure opportunities to deal with these serious \nchallenges before they escalate into full-blown crises.\n  We cannot continue to swirl in this miasma of misery if we are to \njudiciously carry out our duties as the representatives of the people. \nImpeachment is among the most serious, if not the most serious, duty \nmeted out to us in the Constitution that we are sworn to support and \ndefend. Let us wait for the facts to come out before we rush to \njudgment as to the action we should take. Let us wait for the House to \ndetermine those facts from the report that will shortly be presented to \nit. And then, hopefully, we can all see what the facts are.\n  There are serious challenges to our nation ahead. Here in the Senate, \nwe may be called upon to help restore such forgotten qualities as \ncourage, integrity, dignity, fairness, and thoughtfulness to a \nsituation marked, for the most part, by the absence of those \ncharacteristics. For my part, I shall pray that we who serve here will \ndo our best to restore the sense of serious contemplation and quiet \nduty expected of us under the Constitution and by the good people of \nthis nation during times of testing and crisis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I wanted to respond, if I might, for just a \nminute, to Senator Byrd. First of all, I would like to thank him for \nthe lesson of his speech today. Our founders did not write the \nConstitution and then sit down and wonder about what they would do \nabout corruption in public men. In fact, when they wrote the \nConstitution the first power enumerated for the House of \nRepresentatives in the Constitution is the power to impeach. This was \nno afterthought. When the founders wrote, in article I, section 3, \nabout the first power of the Senate, it was the power to try all \nimpeachments. So Senator Byrd, I would like to thank you for reminding \nus that this is a high constitutional responsibility.\n  None of us will be judged based on what the President did or did not \ndo, but we will be judged on what we do or what we do not do. One of \nthe quotes from the Federalist Paper No. 65, from Alexander Hamilton, \nthat you did not use, which I think defines the role you have taken in \nthis debate, is the line where Hamilton sees a Senate which is ``unawed \nand uninfluenced.'' I think your lesson today to us is we should be \nunawed, but we should also be uninfluenced. And I can say that if I \nwere to be tried in the Senate, if I were innocent, I would look to \nSenator Byrd as my greatest hope; if I were guilty, I would look to him \nas my greatest fear.\n  Finally, before yielding the floor, the Senator asked, Where are the \nheroes? I would like to say that for those who know him, Robert C. Byrd \nis a hero. When I think of great men and women who have sat in this \nbody as Senators whose names you might want to put up next to Cicero \nand Cato, I include the name of Robert C. Byrd on that list. I am very \nproud to serve in the Senate with him.\n  I think his comments today really reflect on the posture that the \nSenate should take. I have no doubt that Senator Byrd will take that \nposture. I intend to do my best to take it as well. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \nwords, which I take very seriously, and for his kindness, as always, to \nme.\n  I hope that I have spoken wisely. I hope that I will not be \nmisunderstood. I simply think that before we reach a judgment on this \nPresident or any other President--and I said this when Mr. Nixon was in \nthe docks, as it were--I hope that we Senators will not advocate \nimpeachment or censure or resignation at least until the Starr report \nhas reached the House and the House has had an opportunity to conduct \nhearings, if it so chooses, and has formulated articles, if it so \nchooses. There will be plenty of time then for Senators to reach that \njudgment. In the meantime, we have much to do.

Mr. President, I want to commend to my colleagues the \nexceptionally thoughtful lead editorial in yesterday morning's \nWashington Post. It is entitled ``The Test Ban and Arms Control,'' and \nit makes some cogent points about the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty and \na Senate where few objections are raised to the Treaty itself, but most \nRepublicans still cast symbolic votes against it.\n  The Post notes correctly that leading Senate Republicans seem to \nassume that a national missile defense is the only answer to the \nproblems of nuclear proliferation and the risk of nuclear war.\n  As the Post concludes, however, treaties like the Chemical Weapons \nConvention and the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty ``are capable of \nserving American requirements well.'' Whatever one's views on national \nmissile defense, those treaties ``would strengthen the American \nposition in the world.''\n  I would note two areas in which I disagree with the Post editorial. \nFirst of all, the Test-Ban Treaty was signed 2 years ago, rather than \n``earlier this year.'' The Treaty was submitted to the Senate nearly a \nfull year ago, and has languished because the Republican leadership is \nafraid to let it come up.\n  I do not accept the Post's pessimistic view, moreover, of the Test-\nBan Treaty's chances on the floor. In last week's vote, moderate \nRepublicans could support their Leader without doing any tangible harm.\n  When the Test-Ban Treaty finally comes up for a vote on ratification, \nhowever, I am confident that at least 67 members will support it, just \nas they supported the Chemical Weapons Convention last year.\n  With those two caveats, I strongly urge my colleagues to read \nTuesday's Post editorial and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed \nin the Record.\n\n[[Page S10113]]\n\n  There being no objection, the editorial ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 8, 1998]\n\n                     The Test Ban and Arms Control\n\n       An early Senate vote on funds for implementation of the \n     comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty indicates that the two-\n     thirds majority needed to ratify the test ban may be lacking. \n     There would be some votes from the Republican majority for a \n     treaty, but at this moment the dominant blocking position of \n     the party leadership looks strong. The evident resistance to \n     ratification is attributed not simply to dissatisfaction with \n     some of the treaty's terms--there isn't all that much \n     dissatisfaction--but to a fundamental and wrongheaded quarrel \n     with the premises of arms control itself.\n       Modern arms control was invented during the Cold War to \n     restrict the nuclear armories of the then-two great powers \n     and, if not to bring something deserving of the name of peace \n     between them, then to lessen the risks and costs of their \n     preparing for nuclear war. There were ups and downs, and \n     their ultimate worth can be argued, but there is no denying \n     that at a certain point Ronald Reagan demolished arms control \n     as everyone had known it.\n       From being a policy aimed at producing nuclear parity or \n     stalemate in a condition of reduced but continuing political \n     hostility, arms control became under President Reagan a bold \n     program to end Soviet-American nuclear competition and beyond \n     that, to close out the Cold War itself by seeing to the \n     transformation of the Soviet Union. Many other hands, \n     especially Mikhail Gorbachev's, shared in this task. But \n     Ronald Reagan was a leading contributor to the different \n     state of affairs we enjoy with Russia to this day.\n       Since the Cold War's demise, the urgency has gone out of \n     classical arms control. The United States, far from deterring \n     Russia and preserving a balance of terror, is helping Russia \n     dismantle its excessive and expensive nuclear capability, \n     concentrating on the specter of ``loose nukes''--weapons \n     under uncertain official control and vulnerable to private \n     theft and misuse. Still, the weapons that most trouble the \n     United States and Russia are those in the hands, or in the \n     aspirations, of third countries. Nonproliferation or counter-\n     proliferation is at the heart of post-Cold War arms control.\n       This is the context in which the comprehensive test ban \n     treaty, which was decades in the making, finally was signed \n     earlier this year. This arms-control perennial had changed \n     from being a check on Russian and American arms programs into \n     a restraint on the spread of weapons of mass destruction \n     among assorted regimes around the world. This is the test \n     ban's 21st century mission: to give the multitude of nations \n     an additional lever with which to press Iran and Iraq, North \n     Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel--and rogues elsewhere--to \n     abandon or slow their nuclear urges.\n       Leading Senate Republicans perversely persist in blaming \n     the test ban, and by extension the whole updated post-Cold \n     War framework of arms control, for nuclear and chemical and \n     other programs being pursued by various countries. These \n     naive senators seem to believe that arms-control measures are \n     magically self-enforcing. They fail to understand that the \n     signatories of arms-control agreements must take upon \n     themselves the burdens of observing their terms and of \n     enforcing compliance to others' formal pledges of self-\n     denial. If the signatories fall short, the responsibility \n     falls on them, not on the agreements.\n       The senators also profess to rely on American power and \n     American technology alone--especially on a new national \n     missile defense--to ensure the security of the United States. \n     Such a missile defense is in the works, but questions remain \n     about its strategic purpose, efficacy and cost. The pace of \n     pondering these questions has itself become a sharp political \n     issue. Meanwhile, some senators carelessly would throw away \n     the increments to American security that could be added by \n     cooperation with other friendly countries in matters such as \n     the chemical weapons treaty, the nuclear nonproliferation \n     treaty and the test ban.\n       These are imperfect instruments, but they are capable of \n     serving American requirements well. Even if a missile defense \n     of minimal cost, deadly accuracy and reliability were ready \n     today, which it is not, those instruments would strengthen \n     the American position in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10112-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10113-S10114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTHE PROPOSED UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT FOR REPUBLICAN JUVENILE CRIME \n                              BILL, S. 10\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last Thursday, after Senators had been \ninformed that there would be no more votes that day and after I had \nalready headed for home to Vermont, Republicans came to the floor to \npropose a narrow procedural device in connection with the Republican \njuvenile crime bill, S.10.\n  No one had advised me that the Senate Republican leadership planned \nto proceed to S.10 on Thursday. After a year of inaction on this bill--\nwhich was voted on by the Judiciary Committee in July 1997--the \nRepublicans did not even seek a response to their proposal. Instead, \nthey rushed to the floor in ambush fashion.\n  The failure of this Congress to take up and pass responsible juvenile \ncrime legislation does not rest with the Democrats, and no procedural \nfloor gimmick by the Republican majority can change that fact.\n  Over the past year, I have spoken on the floor of the Senate and at \nhearings on several occasions about my concerns with this legislation. \nAt the same time, I have expressed my willingness to work with the \nChairman in a bipartisan manner to improve this juvenile crime bill.\n  I am not alone in my criticisms and in wanting to see changes in this \nbill. It has been blasted by virtually every major newspaper in the \nUnited States. The Philadelphia Inquirer concluded that the bill ``is \nfatally flawed and should be rejected.'' The Los Angeles Times \ndescribed the bill as ``peppered with ridiculous poses and penalties'' \nand as taking a ``rigid, counterproductive approach'' to juvenile crime \nprevention. The St. Petersburg Times called the bill ``an amalgam of \nbad and dangerous ideas.''\n  The bill has also been criticized by national leaders ranging from \nChief Justice Rehnquist to Marian Wright Edelman, President of the \nChildren's Defense Fund.\n  In May, the Chief Justice criticized S.10 because it would \n``eviscerate this traditional deference to state prosecutions, thereby \nincreasing substantially the potential workload of the federal \njudiciary.'' Earlier in the year, the Chief Justice raised concerns \nabout ``federalizing'' certain juvenile crimes, noting that ``federal \nprosecutions should be limited to those offenses that cannot and should \nnot be prosecuted in the state courts.''\n  The National District Attorneys Association (NDAA) and other law \nenforcement agencies have also written me with their concerns about \nthis bill. In May, William Murphy, President of the NDAA, expressed \nNDAA's serious concerns about parts of S.10, including the fact that \n``S.10 goes too far'' in changing the ``core mandates'' which have kept \njuveniles safer and away from adults while in jail for over 25 years. \nMr. Murphy also criticized S.10's new juvenile record keeping \nrequirements as ``burdensome and contrary to most state laws.'' He \nfurther noted that S.10 failed to provide ``any lee way to give \njuveniles a second chance by providing for the option to seal or \nexpunge records.''\n  I have also heard from numerous State and local officials across the \nU.S., including the National Governors' Association, the Council of \nState Governments (Eastern Regional Conference), the U.S. Conference of \nMayors, the National Association of Counties and the National \nConference of State Legislatures. All of them have expressed concerns \nabout the restrictions this bill would place on their ability to combat \nand prevent juvenile crime effectively. Last June, the President of the \nNational Conference of State Legislatures cautioned that the new \nmandates placed on the States by S.10 could ``imbalance the \nconstitutionally designed relationship between the federal government \nand the states.''\n  He further noted that ``[s]tates handle crime in a more flexible and \nmore responsive manner than the federal government'' and urged the \nSenate not to impose a single ``federal `fix' upon all fifty states and \nthe territories.''\n  In short, S.10 as reported by the Judiciary Committee is a bill laden \nwith problems--so much so that, at last count, the bill has lost a \nquarter of its Republican cosponsors since introduction.\n  The unanimous consent agreement proposed by the Republicans would \nlimit debate of juvenile justice and other crime matters. Ironically, \nit would permit the Republicans to offer a substitute to their own \nbill, but not allow Democrats the same opportunity. The only additional \namendments in order under their plan would be five on each side.\n  When the Judiciary Committee Chairman indicated on the floor that the \nminority has had the text of the proposed Hatch-Sessions substitute for \n``well over a month,'' he was incorrect. In fact, we only got a copy of \nthe substitute on the same day that the Republicans proposed their \nunanimous\n\n[[Page S10114]]\n\nconsent agreement and had not had an opportunity to review it.\n  While I appreciate that we are short of time in this Congress and \nthat, consequently, the Republican leadership would like to limit the \nnumber of amendments the Democrats may offer, I must point out that the \nHatch-Sessions substitute alone contains substantial changes to over \n160 separate paragraphs of this reported bill.\n  While I do not believe that Democrats will have close to 160 \nadditional amendments to the bill, I believe that we will want to offer \nmore than five.\n  We are continuing to pare down the amendments that Democrats plan to \noffer to S.10 to address the substantial criticisms leveled at this \nbill. We are continuing to negotiate in good faith on a unanimous \nconsent agreement to ensure that Senate consideration of this \nlegislation is fair, full and productive. The attempted ambush at the \noutset of this process, however, suggests that the Republican \nleadership is more interested in placing blame for its inaction than in \nactually moving to consideration of the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10113-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       BOSTON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE CELEBRATES 150 YEARS\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Boston \nUniversity School of Medicine on its 150 anniversary. The School of \nMedicine has a long and distinguished history, and I am proud to join \nin paying tribute to its remarkable leadership for the city of Boston \nand the nation.\n  Boston University School of Medicine was founded in 1848 as the New \nEngland Female Medical College, and was the first institution in the \nworld to offer medical education to women. In 1864, the school \ngraduated its first African-American female physician, Rebecca Lee. In \n1873, Boston University merged with the New England Female Medical \nCollege to establish a co-educational School of Medicine.\n  In addition to being the first medical school to graduate women, \nBoston University School of Medicine was also the first school to \nestablish Home Medical Services, an educational and patient care \nservice that continues today. The School of Medicine has constantly \nintroduced innovations in medical education and played a central role \nin developing the Boston University School of Public Health.\n  Down through the years, Boston University School of Medicine has \nprovided outstanding service to our community. It is renowned for its \nclinical care and its professional training in a vast network of \naffiliated hospitals including Boston Medical Center, community health \ncenters, and physicians' offices. In 1995, this commitment to service \nearned the school the Association of American Medical College's \nOutstanding Community Service Award.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate Boston University School of Medicine on \nits 150 years of excellence, and I know that its outstanding tradition, \nprofessional commitment, and community service will continue in the \nyears ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10114-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCORRECTIONS TO THE LIST OF OBJECTIONABLE PROVISIONS IN THE FISCAL YEAR \n                   1999 INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday I submitted a list of \nobjectionable provisions in the FY'99 Interior Appropriations bill for \nthe Record. I wish to make two clarifications to that list which came \nto my attention.\n  First, I learned that the Navajo Indian Irrigation Project was not \nrequested for a funding level of more than $97 million. Instead, the \nallocated amount for the NIIP project was equal to the requested level \nof $25.5 million, but this information was not clear in the committee \nbill. I removed this item from my list of objectionable provisions.\n  Second, two separate listings for the removal of the Elwha dam \nremoval project were requested for funding, based on its authorization \nin P.L. 102-495. These items should not have been listed as \nobjectionable according to my established ``pork criteria.'' These two \nitems are removed from the list: (1) $29,500,000 for the purchase of \nthe Elwha Project and Glines Canyon Project; and, (2) $2,000,000 for \nplanning and design, removal of Elwha Dam in Olympic National Park, WA.\n  I wish to thank the individuals who brought these matters to my \nattention and for providing the necessary information to clarify this \nmistake.\n  Mr. President, I wish to state that the revised total amount of \n$222.4 million included in this bill still represents an inordinately \nhigh level of wasteful spending. I sincerely hope that we will do \nbetter by the American people with stricter fiscal spending that abides \nby the appropriate legislative process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10114-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10114-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         enrolled bills signed\n\n  At 6:24 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bills:\n\n       S. 1379.

A bill to make technical corrections to the National Capital \nRevitalization and Self-Government Improvement Act of 1997; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              The Lorton Technical Corrections Act of 1998\n\n Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I introduce the Lorton \nTechnical Corrections Act of 1998, along with my colleague Senator \nRobb.\n  As you know, I along with my colleague Congressman Tom Davis and the \nrest of the delegation from the Commonwealth of Virginia succeeded in \n1997, in passing the National Capital Revitalization and Self-\nGovernment Improvement Act to close the Lorton Complex in its entirety, \nand relocate prisoners to other facilities outside of northern \nVirginia.\n  Under this act, transfer of the Lorton facility would go to the \ncontrol of the U.S. Department of the Interior after 2001. Since that \ntime, however, discussions with both the affected communities and the \nDepartment of Interior have concluded that this is not the best option \nfor ultimate disposal of this property, and that the General Services \nAdministration would be a better agency to assume title to the property \nfor ultimate disposal.\n  Fairfax County would then be able to submit a reuse plan to the \nGeneral Services Administration delineating preferred permissible or \nrequired uses of the land. It should also be noted that the Department \nof Interior will still have the authority to use a portion of this \nproperty for land exchange, to expand the properties of the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service properties, as originally envisioned.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to resolve this most \nimportant issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL:\n  S. 2451. A bill to improve protection and management of the \nChattahoochee River National Recreation Area in the State of Georgia; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n     chattahoochee national recreation area boundaries legislation\n\n Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nwhich would modify the boundaries of the Chattahoochee River National \nRecreation Area to protect and preserve the endangered Chattahoochee \nRiver and provide additional recreation opportunities for the citizens \nof Georgia and our nation. This legislation authorizes the creation of \na greenway buffer between the river and private development to prevent \nfurther pollution from continued development, provide flood and erosion \ncontrol, and maintain water quality for safe drinking water and for the \nfish and wildlife dependent on the river system. In addition, this \nlegislation promotes private-public partnerships by authorizing $25 \nmillion in federal funds for land acquisition for the recreation area. \nThis $25 million will be matched by private funds but only if Congress \nacts quickly. The State of Georgia, private foundations, corporate \nentities, private individuals, and others have already given or pledged \ntens of millions of dollars to protect and preserve the Chattahoochee \nRiver for future generations of Georgians to enjoy.\n  The legislation I introduce today is a Senate companion to \nlegislation introduced by Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. I applaud \nthe leadership Speaker Gingrich has shown on this important issue. It \nis crucial for Congress to act quickly on this legislation in order to \nprotect the Chattahoochee River, a vital natural resource. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this proposal \nand urge its speedy consideration.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 2452. A bill to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act \nto require States receiving funds under section 106 of such act to have \nin effect a State law providing for a criminal penalty on an individual \nwho fails to report witnessing another individual engaging in sexual \nabuse of a child; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                          sherrice iverson act\n\n Mr. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Congressman \nNick Lampson of Texas today in introducing the Sherrice Iverson Act. \nThis ``good samaritan'' legislation is named in honor of the 7-year old \ngirl molested and murdered in a Nevada casino in May of 1997, while a \nbystander did nothing.\n  Nevada authorities report this vicious attack was at least partially \nwitnessed by David Cash, Jr. the best friend of the assailant. Mr. Cash \nwas in a position to stop this brutal murder, yet he did nothing. He \nthen failed to report the crime to the proper authorities. Nevada \nofficials considered prosecuting Mr. Cash for his callous disregard of \nhuman life but found no legal basis for a criminal prosecution.\n  Nevada officials had no legal recourse because the state does not \nhave a ``good Samaritan'' law requiring witnesses to report crimes to \nthe proper authorities.\n  This is wrong and we need to address that aspect of our laws. That is \nexactly what the Service Iverson Act does. It requires that states pass \nlaws requiring witnesses of child sexual abuse to report that crime to \nthe police. If they do not pass such laws, states would become \nineligible for federal Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act funds. \nThe details of these laws, including the penalties imposed, are left to \nthe states.\n  The bill only requires people to report the crimes they witness; it \ndoes not require them to intervene in potentially dangerous situations. \nOnly two states, Vermont and Minnesota, currently have such ``good \nsamaritan'' laws.\n  I want to thank Representative Nick Lampson for all his hard work on \nthis issue, and I look forward to working with him to pass this \nimportant legislation; I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2452\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe credit for producing electricity from certain renewable resources; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n               poultry electric energy power legislation\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation that would \namend section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code to provide a tax credit \nto biomass energy facilities that use chicken manure as fuel.\n  Joining me as original cosponsors are Senators Biden, Mikulski, \nSarbanes, Jeffords, Harkin, Helms, Huchinson, and Bumpers. \n  Mr. President, I am bullish on poultry's future in America. It is \nhard not to be with world-wide poultry consumption growing at double-\ndigit rates.\n  In the United States, poultry production has tripled since 1975. We \nnow produce almost 8 billion chickens a year to feed the growing world-\nwide demand for poultry.\n  In particular, Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia produce some of the \nworld's finest poultry. Just last year Delmarva poultry farmers \nproduced over 600 million chickens. Our poultry farmers are among the \nmost productive and efficient in the world.\n  As the amount of chickens we produce as a nation has grown, so too \nhas the amount of manure.\n  Due to environmental pressures, spreading manure on land is no longer \nan option in some areas for our rapidly growing poultry industry.\n\n[[Page S10120]]\n\n  In the United Kingdom, several companies have been able to do what \nmedieval alchemists dreamed of--turning a base element into gold--in \nthis case an agricultural waste product into electricity.\n  The UK has two utility plants that use poultry manure to generate \nelectricity. These two poultry power plants will, when combined with a \nthird scheduled to open this fall, burn 50 percent of the UK's total \nvolume of chicken manure.\n  The electricity generated by these plants will supply enough power \nfor 100,000 homes. These plants have the support of both the poultry \nindustry and the international environmental community.\n  The way this system works is simple.\n  Power stations buy poultry manure from surrounding poultry farmers \nand transport it to the power station. At the station the manure is \nburned in a furnace at high temperatures, heating water in a boiler to \nproduce steam which drives a turbine linked to a generator. The \nelectricity is then transfered to the local electricity grid.\n  It is then used to supply electricity to commercial and residential \ncustomers.\n  There are no waste products created through this process. Instead, a \nvaluable by-product emerges in the form of a nitrogen-free ash, which \nis marketed as an environmentally friendly fertilizer.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide a tax credit to \nenergy facilities that use poultry manure as a fuel to generate \nelectricity.\n  It will build on concepts in the tax code that provide incentives for \nenvironmentally friendly energy production.\n  I am introducing this legislation in an effort to encourage the \ndevelopment of another environmentally-friendly method of producing \nelectricity, while at the same time tackling a thorny animal waste \ndisposal problem.\n  This legislation will provide incentives to build an energy plant \nthat will not only dispose of poultry manure and create clean \nelectricity, but will also supply our nation's farmers with a clean \nfertilizer free of nitrates.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring my bill, the Poultry \nElectric Energy Power Act, affectionately known as the PEEP Act. It is \nimportant for future generations that we continue to explore green \ntechnologies that will protect our environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

Mr. President, I rise today to convey my \nstrong support for the $3,000,000 this bill contains for land \nacquisition at Lake Tahoe. This funding is crucial if we are to control \nthe erosion problem that is robbing Lake Tahoe of its striking water \nclarity.\n  Lake Tahoe is the crown jewel of the Sierra Nevada. The clarity of \nits blue waters, and the beauty of its surrounding forests and high \nmountains, inspired Mark Twain to call it ``the fairest view the whole \nearth affords.''\n  Mark Twain would still recognize the Lake Tahoe Basin today, but it \nis no longer a pristine wilderness surrounding a perfectly clear lake. \nToday Lake Tahoe is a year-round recreational mecca, drawing millions \nannually to its ski slopes, hiking trails, and crystal clear waters. \nLake Tahoe is a major economic force in both California and Nevada, \ncontributing $1.6 billion annually to the economy from tourism alone.\n  The environment and the economy are inextricably linked at Lake \nTahoe. The famous azure lake and its surrounding pristine forests are \nthe primary reasons that people visit the region. Protecting \nenvironmental quality at Lake Tahoe is key to preserving the economy of \nthe Sierra region.\n  Scientists agree that the Lake is in the midst of an environmental \ncrisis. Lake Tahoe is one of the largest, deepest, and clearest lakes \nin the world, but that remarkable clarity is disappearing at the rate \nof over a foot a year.\n  In the 1960s, you could drop a white plate into Lake Tahoe and watch \nit fall 105 feet before it disappeared. Now you can watch the same \nplate fall only 70 feet. As the Lake's water clarity decreases, algae \nis taking over. In 10 years, the effects could be irreversible.\n  Why the troubling decline? The answers are quite simple: air \npollution and erosion. Algae is fed by nitrogen, a key component in car \nexhaust, and phosphorous, a key component of run-off that flows into \nLake Tahoe from streams, paved roads, old logging roads, golf courses, \nand even private homes.\n  Lake Tahoe was once ringed by wetlands that filtered out most of this \nharmful sediment and debris. But most of the wetlands have been filled \nin to provide more lakefront property. The lake's clarity continues to \ndeteriorate.\n  For nearly 20 years, the Forest Service has been slowing this \ndeterioration by acquiring environmentally sensitive land at Lake \nTahoe--land especially prone to the erosion that is slowly strangling \nthe Lake--and protecting it from development. Since 1980, the Forest \nService has purchased 11,000 acres at Lake Tahoe. This acquisition \nprogram has the wholehearted support of Lake Tahoe's elected officials, \nas well as both environmental and business groups.\n  The $3 million for land acquisition contained in this bill will help \nbuy parcels like the Wells property, an 18.5 acre site adjacent to a \nCounty park that includes some of the few remaining wetlands \nsurrounding Lake Tahoe, as well as a stretch of Burke Creek that \nprovides a vital wildlife corridor. If the Forest Service is not able \nto buy this property, it may end up being developed into 50 condominium \nunits.\n  Land acquisition funds may also be used for a phased-in purchase of \nHigh Meadows, a 2300-acre parcel that remains the largest private \ninholding in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The meadows include the headwaters \nfor Cold Creek, one of Lake Tahoe's most sensitive watersheds. \nProtecting the property could dramatically reduce the amount of \nsediment and debris that flows currently flow into Lake Tahoe from Cold \nCreek.\n  I commend the Committee for including these land acquisition funds \nfor Lake Tahoe in this bill. I am disappointed that the House did not \ninclude any funds in its version of the bill. I intend to urge the \nSenate conferees on this legislation to protect the full $3 million in \nconference.\n  Unfortunately, this $3 million barely scratches the surface of what \nis needed to restore the environment at Lake Tahoe. The region's \nenvironmental problems extend well beyond its famous azure lake.\n  Insect infestations have killed over 25 percent of the trees in the \nforests surrounding Lake Tahoe, creating a severe risk of catastrophic \nwildfire that could destroy communities and have a devastating impact \non water quality at the Lake. The millions of cars that visit the Lake \nTahoe Basin each year worsen erosion problems from roads and produce \nnitrogen that ends up feeding algae in the Lake.\n  The Federally-chartered Tahoe Regional Planning Agency estimates that \npreserving the Lake's water quality, restoring its fragile forest \necosystem, and establishing a public transportation system that would \nreduce air pollution and road run-off could cost $900 million in \nFederal, State, local, and private funds.\n  The Federal government, through the United States Forest Service, \nowns nearly 80 percent of the land in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Therefore, \nwe have a unique responsibility for protecting Lake Tahoe. Two \nimportant Federal reports that are currently pending will help \ndetermine what steps the Forest Service must take to stop the \nenvironmental decline at the Lake.\n  One report is the Watershed Assessment, a study being conducted by an \nindependent team of scientists, that will create a model of Lake \nTahoe's ecosystem to help us determine the impact of proposed \nenvironmental restoration projects. Lake Tahoe is so fragile that we \nneed to be sure prescribed burning to reduce the risk of\n\n[[Page S10138]]\n\ncatastrophic fire at one end of the lake does not cause too much \nerosion or air pollution in another part of the Lake. The Watershed \nAssessment will provide the Forest Service with the tools to make those \ntough judgment calls.\n  The other Federal effort underway is an interagency review of the \nEnvironmental Improvement Program, a list of more than 500 \nenvironmental improvement projects that the Tahoe Regional Planning \nAgency proposes to implement at Lake Tahoe. The Environmental \nImprovement Program has the full support of Lake Tahoe's local \ngovernments, business leaders, and environmental groups. Now the \nFederal government is assessing which of the environmental projects on \nthis list should have high priority for Federal funding, and whether \nnew programs are needed to provide that funding.\n  I plan to act upon the results of these studies as soon as they are \ncomplete in December 1998. I am hoping to offer legislation in the next \nsession that would authorize a new Federal initiative, led by the U.S. \nForest Service, to address Lake Tahoe's erosion and forest health \nproblems. I am working with a bi-partisan group of Tahoe's business, \nenvironmental, and community leaders to develop a proposal, and I hope \nthat the Forest Service will become an active player in the process as \nwell.\n  In 1997, President Clinton and Vice President Gore visited Lake \nTahoe. I attended the Forum they sponsored, as did Senators Boxer, Reid \nand Bryan. We applauded the President as he announced an ambitious \nTahoe initiative that included $50 million over two years for land \nacquisition, prescribed burning, watershed restoration, public \ntransportation, upgrades to wastewater pipelines, erosion control, and \nscientific research at the Lake.\n  Unfortunately, since then, Lake Tahoe seems to have dropped off the \nAdministration's radar screen. The Administration never even fulfilled \nthe $50 million in commitments the President made at Tahoe, let alone \nextend those commitments to fiscal year 1999.\n  In his 1999 budget request, President Clinton did not make any \nspecific requests for Tahoe, and the Forest Service will be lucky if \nthey receive $5 million from the Administration next year for forest \nhealth and erosion control projects.\n  Forest Service officials at Lake Tahoe are doing a heroic job of \nreducing fire risk in the forest while simultaneously protecting Lake \nTahoe's water quality. They need more resources if they are going to \nreverse declining environmental quality at the Lake and its surrounding \nforests.\n  Time is running out for Lake Tahoe. If we do not act quickly with a \nfull commitment of Federal resources, the crown jewel of the Sierra \ncould become permanently tarnished. I urge my colleagues in the Senate \nto join me in preserving this national treasure for generations to \ncome. Let's look at this $3 million for land acquisition as a down \npayment, not the last word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10137-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             OUR LADY QUEEN OF ALL SAINTS 40TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nCovenant House in St. Louis, Missouri on its 25th Anniversary. Over the \nyears, Covenant House has been an important and integral part of the \nlow-moderate income housing community for the elderly. The Anniversary \ncelebration will take place on September 13, with special honorees \nHarvey and Wilma Gerstein.\n  The Gersteins have dedicated a great deal of their lives to the \ndevelopment of quality housing for the elderly. Harvey was the first-\never President of the Covenant House and still serves on the Board of \nDirectors. Wilma is a member of the Board and serves as Chair of the \nVolunteer Committee.\n  Covenant House is publicly financed and has 434 units of housing to \nserve its 484 elderly residents. With the continuing need for more \nestablishments like the Covenant House, they founded the Community \nAging Corporation. This Corporation provides a variety of social \nservices to guarantee safety for the elderly in an independent setting.\n  It is a great privilege to honor this high caliber living community \nand its special honorees. Dedication to one's community has become an \nincreasingly rare quality in our society. The St. Louis community is \nlucky to have such a facility and I want to express my sincere \nappreciation to everyone who makes the Covenant House excel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10138-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10138-S10139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO HERBERT MABRY, THE 1998 RICHARD B. RUSSELL PUBLIC SERVICE \n                            AWARD RECIPIENT\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 1998 \nRichard B. Russell Public Service Award recipient, Herbert Mabry of \nSandy Springs, Georgia.\n  Herb is a man who truly defines public service. Over the years, he \nhas been actively involved in serving the people in many capacities, \nincluding his own campaign for public office.\n  The Richard B. Russell Award is given each year to an individual who \ntruly ``raises the bar'' for us all and goes the extra mile for his or \nher community and state. The honor is bestowed upon an individual who \nworks tirelessly to promote the ideals of the State of Georgia and who \nstrengthens and shapes our State for the future. Senator Russell \nunderstood that public service and political involvement is a\n\n[[Page S10139]]\n\ntool of citizenship, and this year's honoree is a man who believes that \nbeing an active public servant defines citizenship.\n  Herb has been the President of the Georgia State AFL-CIO since 1972, \nand has truly defined and shaped the labor movement throughout Georgia \nduring the past several decades. He is also very involved in other \norganizations including the Georgia Labor Committee, the Georgia Trade \nUnion Council for Histradut, the AFL-CIO Appalachian Council, the \nGeorgia Democratic Party and the Fulton County Personnel Board. He has \nbeen a member of Carpenter's Local Union #225 since 1950 and served as \nits President for the past 25 years. He also serves as the President of \nthe Southeastern Regional Council of Carpenters.\n  Herb Mabry is a native of Fulton County, Georgia. He and his wife \nColleen have six children and 11 grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, I ask that you join me and our colleagues in honoring \nHerbert Mabry's innumerable contributions and unselfish and inspiring \nhard work and dedication to the State of Georgia and our Nation. Herb \npersonifies the definition of a true and loyal American and sets the \nstandard for all citizens to live by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10138-4", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PONTIAC AREA HISTORICAL AND GENEALOGICAL SOCIETY CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nPontiac Area Historical and Genealogical Society's Citizen of the Year, \nMr. John A. Riley of Pontiac, Michigan.\n  Mr. Riley, born December 8, 1912 has been chosen as the Citizen of \nthe Year on the basis that he has given tremendously of his time and \nresources to many causes. His professional career consisted of 40 years \nof service to the Pontiac Daily Press as vice-president of marketing. \nAdditionally, Riley has served voluntarily in many positions. He was a \nmember of the Pontiac Osteopathic Hospital Board for 36 years, \npresident of the Pontiac J.C.s, president of the Pontiac Chamber of \nCommerce, member of the Boys Club and a 50 year member of the Kiwanis \nClub of Pontiac.\n  Currently, Mr. Riley sits on the committees for the Key Club for \nPontiac High Schools and the Terrific Kids Program. He also serves as \nChairman of the Board for the General Hospital Authority, First \nChairman of the Economic Development Commission for the City of \nPontiac. He was instrumental in the raising of the funds to build the \nPontiac Silverdome. In addition, John Riley is a man of strong faith as \nreflected in his service to All Saints Episcopal Church where he is \nSenior Warden for the Vestry.\n  Mr. Riley's accomplishments are numerous. It is clear to see that he \ncommits himself selflessly and completely to many causes. He is \nundoubtedly deserving of the Citizen of the Year award being given to \nhim by the Pontiac Historical and Genealogical Society. It is with \ngreat pleasure that I extend my congratulations to Mr. John A. Riley on \nthis special occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10139-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10139]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REFORMING THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, late last week the Majority \nLeader indicated that the Senate would be unable to complete efforts \nthis year to reform the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act as it \npertains to remediation waste. For many months, Senators Lott, Chafee, \nSmith, Baucus, Breaux and I have worked on ``rifle-shot'' legislation \nin this area. I regret that we were unable to bring these negotiations \nto a successful conclusion. However, I believe that we made a lot of \nprogress in narrowing differences and developing a bill that could have \nimproved the RCRA hazardous waste cleanup program through a series of \nresponsible reforms. Our work provides a solid foundation upon which to \nbuild in the next Congress.\n  Mr. President, last fall, in October, the GAO issued a report \nrecommending targeted reforms which, in conjunction with adequate \nresources for state and federal agencies, could have resulted in \nsubstantial savings in cleanup costs; encouraged treatment remedies; \nand sparked brownfields cleanup and redevelopment efforts. As Chairman \nof the Subcommittee in the Senate with jurisdiction over these issues \nfor many years, and more recently as Ranking Democratic Member, one of \nmy priorities has been to encourage such efforts, and to return these \ncontaminated parcels to valuable uses. I believe such reforms can yield \nsubstantial national economic and environmental benefits while \nprotecting human health and the environment. Such reforms would \nespecially benefit my state of New Jersey, which is one of the five \nstates with the largest volume of remediation waste.\n  For these reasons, I was pleased that Senators Lott, Chafee and Smith \ninvited Senator Baucus and me to join in developing a targeted \nconsensus reform package. We spent many hours at this effort and we \nreached agreement in a number of areas. I regret that we did not come \nto final closure on this legislation. I want to thank my colleagues and \nthe Administration for the considerable efforts they all made in \nthoughtfully resolving many of the complicated issues in this debate. I \nwant to also thank Senator Breaux, who has been instrumental in \nchampioning reform in this area. Finally, I want to thank the many and \nvaried stakeholders--representatives from industry, environmental \norganizations, as well as state and local agencies and community \ngroups--that provided us with inestimable assistance in understanding \nthis highly complex statute.\n  Mr. President, I regret that we did not have the chance to resolve \nall of the issues this year. We made significant progress in resolving \na host of thorny questions. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act \nhas significantly reduced the generation of hazardous waste, and \nprevented new generations of Superfund toxic waste sites. I am \noptimistic that we can resume this process next year and achieve \nresponsible reforms at that time. I pledge myself to these \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10139-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10139-S10140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO BERTIE SWEENEY GAMMELL PARISH\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to my \nfriend Bertie Sweeney Gammell Parish, a lifelong resident of Clayton, \nAlabama, hardworking wife and mother, dedicated member of the \ncommunity, newspaper professional, and an inspiration to all who knew \nher. Bertie passed away at her home on Wednesday, August 26, 1998.\n  Born on June 4, 1915 in Dothan, Alabama, Bertie was the daughter of \nWilliam Lee and Pearle Ennis Gammell. From her earliest beginnings, \nBertie was an active member of the Clayton United Methodist Church \nwhere she combined her love of music with her service to God as \norganist and choir director for almost 50 years. Bertie held a \nbachelor's degree in music from Alabama College, teaching music briefly \nat Montgomery County High School and later in Clayton.\n  A former member of the Eufaula Music Guild, Bertie was a Paul Harris \nfellow of the Rotary Foundation of Rotary International---an award \npresented by the Clayton Rotary Club, a lifetime member of the Alabama \nFederation of Garden Clubs and a member of the Clayton Garden Club.\n  In addition to the many awards and community service position she \nheld, Bertie is probably best known as the editor and publisher of The \nClayton Record---a post she assumed in 1960 after the deaths of her \nfather and later her mother---both held the position in consecutive \nterms before her. She passed this torch to her daughter Rebecca Parish \nBeasley who holds the position today. The Clayton Record is one of only \na few remaining family-owned and operated newspapers.\n  Bertie's column ``One Comment,'' which appeared on the front page of \nThe Clayton Record, was a favorite of subscribers. From her astute \nobservations on everything from politics to gardening, Bertie thrilled, \ninspired and delighted her readers, including local gardeners who hoped \nto receive mention in one of her columns.\n  Bertie was well known not only in Clayton, but across Alabama. She \nreceived many awards and kudos from colleagues in the news business \nincluding a listing in Who's Who of American Women, and the News Media \nService to Education Award. She was also a staunch preservationist who \nworked diligently to preserve history and local historic structures in \nand around Clayton.\n\n[[Page S10140]]\n\n  Despite a demanding schedule, Bertie never forgot what matters most: \nfamily and friends. She is survived by her husband Thomas William \nParish, Sr.---to whom she would have been married for 59 years on \nAugust 30, 1998; three children: Dr. Thomas William Parish, Jr., of \nGeneva, Joseph Edward Parish, Sr., of Clayton; and Rebecca Parish \nBeasley of Clayton; six grandchildren: Joseph Edward Parish, Jr. of \nMontgomery; Lucile Martin Parish of Columbus, Georgia; Edna Elane \nParish Gulledge of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Thomas Frank Kelly, Jr., \nof Montgomery; Rebecca Parish Kelly of Clayton; and Thomas William \nParish, III, of Geneva; three great-grandchildren; other relatives and \nfriends too numerous to mention.\n  I will miss Bertie. She was a good friend for many years. My heart \ngoes out to her family as they remember her love, her many \naccomplishments, and the important role she set for them and for others \nin and around Clayton, Alabama. My prayers are with you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10139-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE PROGRESS OF PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to reflect for a \nmoment on recent events in Northern Ireland, highlighted by the \nPresident's trip there last week. As every member of this body knows, \nthe violent political and religious conflict in Northern Ireland has \nclaimed the lives of more than 3,200 people since 1969. In April of \nthis year, after many failed attempts at a political solution to this \nviolence, a settlement was announced that was deemed acceptable to all \nsides of this conflict. The so-called Good Friday peace agreement is an \nhistoric achievement in the struggle for peace in Northern Ireland. It \nseemed that finally, peace had won out over war and intolerance, and \nthat the children of Northern Ireland, both Protestant and Catholic, \nwould finally be able to move hand-in-hand toward a shared future.\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, I have \nclosely monitored that Northern Ireland peace process, and I welcomed \nthis peace agreement, which was expertly brokered by our former \ncolleague, and the former Majority Leader of this body, Senator George \nMitchell.\n  In a May 22, 1998, referendum, a convincing majority of the people of \nNorthern Ireland and the Irish Republic embraced this peace plan. On \nJune 25, 1998, the people of Northern Ireland went to the polls and \nelected representatives from Protestant, Catholic, and non-sectarian \nparties to sit in the newly created Assembly, which will gradually \nassume rule of Northern Ireland from Great Britain.\n  This election was perhaps one of the most historic aspects of the \nNorthern Ireland peace agreement. For the first time, the people of \nNorthern Ireland elected representatives for an Assembly that will not \nbe located in Westminster, but rather in Northern Ireland itself. The \nBritish Parliament must still draft and adopt legislation that will \ntransfer the necessary powers to the Assembly that will make that body \ntruly independent from Westminster, and I hope this will be done at the \nearliest possible time.\n  This brief but promising time of peace and cooperation was shattered \non July 5, 1998, during the annual and often contentious ``Marching \nSeason,'' during which time it is common for Protestant groups to \nconduct sectarian marches throughout Northern Ireland. Tensions rose as \nmany would-be marchers resisted a Parades Commission decision to \nreroute a march through a Catholic neighborhood in Drumcree planned by \na Protestant group to commemorate the Battle of the Boyne, a 1690 \nskirmish in which the Protestant King William III of Orange defeated \nthe Catholic King James II. The ensuing riots and violence culminated \nin a firebombing on July 11 in Ballymoney that left three young \nCatholic brothers dead. Both the Protestant and Catholic communities \ndenounced this attack, which has been attributed to a loyalist \nparamilitary group.\n  This senseless attack was particularly ironic because it appears that \nthe house of the three young victims was targeted because their family \nwas mixed--part Catholic and part Protestant.\n  Violence ripped through Northern Ireland again one month later, on \nAugust 11, when a car bomb exploded in a busy marketplace in the town \nof Omagh. Twenty-eight people, including an elderly woman, her pregnant \ndaughter, and her young granddaughter, were killed, and more than 200 \nwere injured. It is ironic that the most horrible act of violence to \noccur in the last 30 years in a country that has suffered so much \nthroughout its tumultuous history occurred just as the people of \nNorthern Ireland finally embarked on the road to peace.\n  Reports indicate that a warning was issued to police prior to the \nbombing, but that the terrorists gave false information which lead \npolice to move those in the marketplace to the site where the bomb was \nlocated, thereby increasing the number of casualties.\n  A fringe group which calls itself the ``Real IRA'' has claimed \nresponsibility for this monstrous attack. This group, and one other \nanti-British fringe group, have since announced cease-fires. It is my \nstrong hope that those responsible for this cowardly act will be \nidentified and prosecuted for their crimes.\n  Recently, British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Irish Prime Minister \nBertie Ahern recommitted themselves to the success of the Northern \nIreland peace agreement and vowed that this attack would not destroy \nthe progress of the last several months. They also announced new \nsecurity measures that will be put in place to help prevent future \nattacks, and that the British Parliament plans to take a hard look at \nways to improve security.\n  I am pleased that President Clinton visited Northern Ireland, and the \ntown of Omagh, last week and met with some of the victims of the attack \nin Omagh and their families, as he did last Thursday. The United States \nhas invested much in the long and sometimes harrowing journey toward a \nlasting peace in Northern Ireland, and we must remain engaged there and \ncontinue to offer our encouragement and friendship to the people of \nNorthern Ireland. While tremendous progress has been made in the last \nyear, there is still much work to be done as the people of Northern \nIreland strive to live and govern together in peace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10140-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10140-S10141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 2375\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask that the Congressional \nBudget Office Cost Estimate for S. 2375 the ``International Anti-\nBribery Act of 1998'' be printed in the Record.\n  The cost estimate follows:\n\n               Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate\n\n\n                 international anti-bribery act of 1998\n\n       CBO estimates that implementing this legislation would not \n     result in any significant cost to the federal government. \n     Because enactment of the bill could affect direct spending \n     and receipts, pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. However, \n     CBO estimates that any impact on direct spending and receipts \n     would not be significant.\n       CBO has determined that this legislation is excluded from \n     the application of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) \n     under section 4 of that act, because it would amend the \n     Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) in ways that are \n     necessary to implement the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development Convention on Combating Bribery \n     of Foreign Public Officials in International Business \n     Transactions. Section 4 of UMRA excludes from the application \n     of that act any legislative provisions that are necessary for \n     the ratification or implementation of international treaty \n     obligations.\n       The bill would expand the FCPA to cover additional offenses \n     relating to corporate bribery of foreign officials. As a \n     result, the federal government would be able to pursue cases \n     that it otherwise would not be able to prosecute. CBO expects \n     that the government probably would not pursue many such \n     cases, however, so we estimate that any increase in federal \n     costs for law enforcement, court proceedings, or prison \n     operations would not be significant. Any such additional \n     costs would be subject to the availability of appropriated \n     funds.\n       Because those prosecuted and convicted under the bill could \n     be subject to civil and criminal fines, the federal \n     government might collect additional fines (which are \n     categorized as governmental receipts) if the bill is enacted. \n     However, CBO expects that any additional fines would be \n     negligible because of the small number of cases involved. \n     Collections of criminal fines are deposited in the Crime \n     Victims Fund and spent in the following year. Because any \n     increase in direct spending would equal the fines collected \n     with a one-year lag, the additional direct spending from the \n     Crime Victims Fund also would be negligible.\n       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz, \n     who can be reached at 226-\n\n[[Page S10141]]\n\n     2860. This estimate was approved by Paul N. Van de Water, \n     Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10140-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH SNYDER\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Elizabeth \nSnyder, a longtime civic leader who helped pave the way for women to \nassume positions of leadership in California. She died in Los Angeles \non August 26, 1998.\n  Elizabeth first came to national attention in 1954, when she was \nelected Chair of the California Democratic Party, becoming the first \nwoman in the United States to be elected chair of a major political \nparty in any state. In a career that spanned more than half a century, \nElizabeth worked prominently in the California presidential campaigns \nof Harry Truman, Adlai Stevenson, and Lyndon Johnson and served as the \nCalifornia Co-Chair of President Jimmy Carter's 1976 Presidential \ncampaign.\n  Born on April 8, 1914, in Minnesota of immigrant parents, Elizabeth \nand her family moved to San Diego in the early 1920s. Following the \ncollapse of her father's business at the outset of the Great \nDepression, Elizabeth, her mother and two brothers relocated to East \nLos Angeles where life was, in her words, ``lean, precarious and \nhard.'' Elizabeth graduated with honors from Garfield High School in \n1931. She studied at Los Angeles City College and graduated as a \npolitical science major from the University of California at Los \nAngeles in 1933. She went on to become one of the first two doctoral \ncandidates in UCLA's political science department.\n  After World War II, Elizabeth became involved in the first of many \nCongressional campaigns on behalf of her lifelong friend and mentor, \nCongressman Chet Holifield. In 1959, she co-founded one of California's \nfirst political campaign management firms, Snyder-Smith. Although she \nremained committed to what she believed were the true ideals and \nprinciples of the Democratic Party, Elizabeth never hesitated in non-\npartisan races to support Republicans whom she believed to be best \nqualified to serve in office.\n  None of her political activities was more important to Elizabeth than \nher lifelong effort to bring about greater participation by women in \nthe political arena. During the 1970s, Elizabeth devoted herself to the \nmentoring of Los Angeles women in politics, holding weekly luncheon \nmeetings of The Thursday Group at her Bunker Hill apartment.\n  Her dedication to improving our society extended beyond the realm of \npolitics. She was especially proud of her work on the prevention of \nfetal alcohol syndrome which culminated in ordinances requiring the \nrestaurants and bars to post warnings to women regarding the dangers of \nalcohol consumption during pregnancy. In addition to all her varied \ncivic activities, Elizabeth will be remembered fondly by the literally \nthousands of men and women to whom she provided comfort and assistance \nin overcoming the adversities of alcoholism and substance abuse.\n  In 1994, she received the prestigious CORO Public Affairs Award in \nrecognition of her lifelong commitment to the reform of the American \nsystem of government in which she so deeply believed. As Elizabeth \nherself once wrote, In the last analysis, the most significant single \npolitical activity is not winning elections and defeating opponents, it \nis improving, expanding and correcting government structure, so that \ndemocracy works.\n  On behalf of my colleagues in the Senate, I extend my heartfelt \ncondolences to her husband, Nathan, and her daughter, United States \nDistrict Judge, Christina A. Snyder.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10141-1", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 2454\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provision of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 1645, the Child Custody Protection Act:\n         Trent Lott, Orrin Hatch, Spencer Abraham, Charles \n           Grassley, Slade Gorton, Judd Gregg, Wayne Allard, Pat \n           Roberts, Bob Smith, Paul Coverdell, Craig Thomas, James \n           Jeffords, Jeff Sessions, Rick Santorum, Mitch \n           McConnell, Chuck Hagel.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. For the information of all Senators, this cloture vote will \noccur on Friday, 1 hour after the Senate convenes, unless changed by \nunanimous consent. I am making an effort to make sure that we have some \nvotes on Friday, but as is usually the case, we would do our best to \naccommodate Members and have the votes before noon on Friday so we \ncould have cloture vote on this bill, possibly on bankruptcy reform, \nbut I am still hoping we can work that out.\n  I now ask that the mandatory quorum under rule XXII be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I now withdraw the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I think that a short explanation may be \nin order with regard to the objection I just made to the motion that \nhas just been filed by the majority leader.\n  Obviously, there are varied opinions about the nature of this \nlegislation and its propriety and how we might pursue some resolution \nto the issue of individuals transported from one State to another. I \nthink the fundamental question, once more, is simply procedural. Can we \nfind a way to take into account legitimate concerns that should be \nraised under a debate of this nature? I believe that there are many \nrelevant amendments that will be declared nongermane but that are \ncertainly relevant to this very complex question.\n  If a cloture motion on the bill were to be successful, it would \npreclude those amendments. It is for that reason that I objected.\n  It is also worth noting that we are being asked to proceed to yet \nanother bill that has had little debate at the same time we are being \ntold that there is not enough time left in the session to debate HMO \nreform. That causes me concern as well.\n  Perhaps we could explore the possibility of coming up with a \ndefinitive list on this legislation as we are attempting to do on \nbankruptcy. I don't know. But I do know this, that filing cloture prior \nto the time we had a debate, filing cloture prior to the time we have \neven considered whether that option is available to us, in my view, is \npremature, and for that reason I had to object.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, could I just inquire of Senator Daschle, the \nDemocratic leader, is there some Senator that I should get Senator \nAbraham to contact about this particular bill, or just talk through \nyou?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There are a number of Senators, and I will certainly \nprovide the Senator with the information. I wouldn't want to preclude \nsomebody\n\n[[Page S10142]]\n\nby simply giving him a name off the cuff, but there are some Senators \nthat will address this issue, and I am willing to share that with you.\n  Mr. LOTT. Or if you ask them if they would get in touch with us \ntomorrow, maybe we can work something out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10141-3", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 1998\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

For the information of all Senators, when the Senate \nreconvenes on Thursday, Senator Brownback will be recognized to speak \nin morning business until 10 a.m. Following morning business, the \nSenate will resume the McCain amendment with the time until 12:00 noon \nequally divided for debate. At noon, Senator Feingold will be \nrecognized to offer a motion to table the McCain amendment. If the \namendment is not tabled, the debate time will continue equally divided \nuntil 1:45 p.m. At that time, a cloture vote will occur on the McCain \ncampaign finance amendment.\n  Following that vote, assuming cloture is not invoked, there will be a \nbrief period of morning business, and then the Senate will continue \noffering and debating amendments to the Interior bill. Therefore, \nSenators should expect rollcall votes throughout Thursday afternoon and \ninto the night, with the first vote, of course, occurring at 12:00 noon \non Thursday.\n  I really hope that we can make some progress on the Interior \nappropriations bill. If Senators have amendments they would like to \noffer, I urge them to come to the floor on Thursday afternoon and \nThursday night and we could possibly even carry over a vote or two \nuntil Friday and have a sequence of stacked votes. Of course, that will \ndepend on what we are able to get done Thursday afternoon and Friday \nmorning. This is an important bill. There are some important amendments \nthat need to be debated and voted on. I hope we can get started.\n  Unfortunately, it has kind of been sandwiched between campaign \nfinance reform amendments and cloture votes on national missile defense \nand also bankruptcy. These are all important, but we need to get more \nfocused on Interior appropriations tomorrow afternoon and tomorrow \nnight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/09/09/senate-section/article/S10142-2", "month": "09", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
