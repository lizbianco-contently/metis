This is the Bingaman-Murkowski amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 937\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate now \nconsider amendment No. 937, offered by the Senator from New Mexico [Mr. \nBingaman].\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me just speak briefly on this \namendment. We are still in morning business, as I understand it; is \nthat correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not correct. The Chair advises the \nSenator from New Mexico we are now in consideration of S. 1023.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. OK. Let me speak for a few minutes about this \namendment.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, if I could ask for just a moment?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I yield to the Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Will the Chair tell us the pending business and the \ndivision of the time on this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado has 4 minutes 39 \nseconds; the Senator from New Mexico 3 minutes 25 seconds.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Was there a unanimous-consent request dividing the \ntime, 2 minutes equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, there were 10 minutes equally divided. \nThis is the time remaining.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Yes. I thank the Chair and thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me briefly describe what the \namendment is. The amendment which I am offering along with Senator \nMurkowski, the chairman of the Energy Committee, would strike section \n630 out of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill which is pending \nbefore the Senate. The reason we are trying to strike section 630 is \nthat it would impede Federal agencies from using energy conservation \nprograms that are now being offered to all customers by electric \nutility companies. This section would override both the Energy Policy \nAct of 1992 and the National Defense Authorization Act of 1993. There \nis nothing anticompetitive about eliminating section 630. Many energy \nconservation measures, such as agreements to use certain amounts of \nenergy at certain times of the day, can only be made--those types of \nagreements can only be made with the local utility.\n  We are in a period where we are moving toward a restructured electric \nutility industry, but we are not there yet. In most parts of this \ncountry today, customers still deal with one electric utility. So the \nopportunity to enter into these energy conservation measures is with \nthat one electric utility. If there is only one source offering a \nparticular service--in this case the providing of electricity--there is \nno point in outlawing a sole-source procurement, as section 630 would \ndo.\n  Existing law tells Federal agencies to use energy conservation \nservices offered by local utilities if those same services are offered \nto other customers in that same location. This amendment overrides \nsection 630 of the bill, which we are dealing with here and which we \nare trying to eliminate. It would override these mandates and would \nhave the following negative consequences.\n  First of all, there are 58 existing contracts between the General \nServices Administration and utilities that will be adversely affected \nby this provision, according to the Department of Energy. Second, the \nDepartment of Defense will be forced to scrap its model energy \nconservation agreement that it has with members of the utility \nindustry.\n  Since the law allows sole-source contracts, and since the sole source \nis sometimes the only option for the Government, section 630 is not \nabout making agencies comply with the law; it is about the Senate \nintervening on one side of an electric industry dispute without having \nall of the facts. Energy conservation law is obviously complex. We \nshould not be trying to change this law in an appropriations bill. \nBefore we change the law, we need to hear from all of the affected \nparties.\n  The chairman of the Energy Committee, who is cosponsoring my \namendment, has agreed to hold hearings on the concerns raised by the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee. Given that good-faith offer \nto investigate and resolve these concerns, I believe the Senate should \nsupport our amendment and take out section 630 until we have all the \nfacts.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment from \nthe Senator from New Mexico to strike section 630 of this legislation. \nSection 630 addresses substantive issues regarding the energy \nefficiency requirements for Federal agencies under the Energy Policy \nAct of 1992. That act had many provisions designed to improve the \nenergy efficiency of Federal facilities. Two are at issue here. First, \nthere are so-called energy savings performance contracts [ESPC's]. \nThese are a mechanism for use of private sector funds to finance \nFederal energy efficiency improvements. These are competitively bid. In \naddition, there are utility programs. EPAct also provided for Federal \nparticipation in utility demand management programs that are authorized \nby the State regulators.\n  The ESPC's haven't been used as much as they could be. The ESPC's \nrequired new regulations, which DOE took a long time to issue. The \ncontracting process was complicated and cumbersome. However, DOE is now \nentering into regional contracts for all Federal facilities, which is \nexpected to speed up the contracting process. In the meantime, Federal \nagencies have been participating in utility demand management programs \nto reduce energy use.\n  The language of section 630 is very broad--it prohibits participation \nin all utility demand management programs. Even more troublesome, it \nprohibits payment under existing contracts. This, despite the fact that \nthere may be some services that only utilities can provide--an example \nis a meeting system that provides real-time pricing information. But \ntoday, I do not wish to debate whether or not this is the right thing \nto do. This change in a law that is within the jurisdiction of the \nEnergy Committee.\n  The promoters of the amendment have claimed that obtaining energy \nefficiency measures through sole source contracting--through utility \ndemand management programs--is already against the law. This is not so. \nSection 152 of EPAct amended section 545 of National Energy \nConservation Act to include the following language:\n\n       (c) Utility Incentive Programs.--(1) Agencies are \n     authorized and encouraged to participate in programs to \n     increase energy efficiency and for water conservation or the \n     management of electricity demand conducted by gas, water, or \n     electric utilities and generally available to customers of \n     such utilities.\n       (2) Each agency may accept any financial incentive, goods, \n     or services generally available from any such utility, to \n     increase energy efficiency or to conserve water or manage \n     electric demand.\n       (3) Each agency is encouraged to enter into negotiations \n     with electric, water, and gas utilities to design cost-\n     effective demand management and conservation incentive \n     programs to address the unique needs of facilities utilized \n     by such agency.\n\n  According to a letter I have received from the Department of Defense, \nthe ``Department uses a combination of contracting authorities to \nachieve energy efficiency. It is [the Department's belief that [the \nDepartment's] current approach provides better results for the U.S. \nGovernment than would be the case'' if section 630 were enacted into \nlaw. The Department concludes that ``this provision would have the \neffect of reducing the amount of work defense installations are able to \ncontract to all sectors of the energy community, and therefore, \nsignificantly reducing the savings we achieve.\n  There are many issues raised by the Government's implementation of \nthe provision of EPAct. However, these provisions are the jurisdiction \nof the Energy Committee. The concerns that the Department of Defense, \nand others, have raised with section 630 show that this is a complex \nissue that should be the subject of a hearing and deliberate \nlegislative by the authorizing committee. An appropriations bill is not \nthe appropriate forum to address these concerns.\n  I ask my colleagues support for the Bingaman amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letter I received from \nDefense Deputy Under Secretary Goodman be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S7787]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the letter was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Office of the Under\n\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Subject: Section 630, Senate Treasury and Postal Service \n       appropriations bill.\n\n     Senator Frank H. Murkowski,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       This is in response to the telephone request from a member \n     of your staff for a Defense position on the proposed section \n     630 to the Senate Treasury and Postal Appropriation bill. \n     Section 630 would preclude any Federal agency from obtaining \n     energy conservation services on a sole source basis.\n       The Department of Defense is concerned that this provision \n     would have the effect of reducing the amount of work defense \n     installations are able to contract to all sectors of the \n     energy community, and therefore, significantly reducing the \n     savings we achieve.\n       The Department of Defense is the single largest energy user \n     in the country and is committed to achieving the energy \n     efficiency improvement goals of the Energy Policy Act and \n     President Clinton's Executive Order 12902. If those goals are \n     achieved, we will realize a billion dollar reduction in our \n     annual energy bill by 2005 and implement the most cost-\n     effective environmental improvement result possible through \n     pollution prevention.\n       The Department uses a combination of contracting \n     authorities to achieve energy efficiency. These authorities \n     allow us either competitively to contract or sole-source for \n     the technical and capital resources we need. There are two \n     important cases in which the Department may want to contract \n     sole-source for energy conservation services, both in the \n     interest of achieving best value for the United States \n     Government. In the first case, we may contract sole source if \n     the firm has proprietary information or a significant \n     technological innovation--for instance, if a company has \n     produced a new type of fuel cell or control system that is \n     unique or proprietary. In the second case, under the recent \n     agreement with the Edison Electric Institute, we can access a \n     franchised utility company's energy conservation service \n     program (which must be a sole-source contract because these \n     are State-sanctioned sole-source programs). Under our \n     agreement with the Edison Electric Institute, the franchise \n     utility companies are required to subcontract competitively \n     the actual conservation work. The Department therefore \n     derives the benefits of competition even though the prime \n     contract was not competitive.\n       It is our belief that our current approach provides better \n     results for the United States Government than would be the \n     case if our current authority to contract sole-source, where \n     justified, were eliminated. Our current system allows more \n     work to be done by the energy savings performance contractor \n     and Architect/Engineer communities. Because this system \n     allows us to take advantage of situations where the greatest \n     savings derive from a sole source provider, it also increases \n     our ability to undertake energy conservation efforts and \n     therefore achieve greater savings.\n       We recommend that section 630 be deleted from the Treasury \n     and Postal Service Appropriation Bill.\n       We have not had an opportunity to have the Office of \n     Management and Budget review this to make sure that it \n     comports with Administration policy.\n                                                  John B. Goodman,\n                                Deputy Under Secretary of Defense.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Mexico has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, my colleague is not yet here, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that no time \nbe charged against Senator Stevens during that quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the provision in this bill requires \ncompliance with existing law. Our information is that the cost of \nmodernization of these facilities to the Federal Government is \napproximately $4 billion. Unless existing law is complied with, it will \ncost us $1 billion more than it would if we had true competition. The \nfigures show it would cost $3 billion if they complied with the law; it \nwould cost $4 billion if they continue to flout and ignore the law.\n  The Bingaman amendment would take out of the bill the requirement no \nfunds can be spent except in compliance with existing law. I do not \nunderstand a refusal to accept the fact that that is the law. If the \ncommittee of jurisdiction doesn't like the law, they should come to the \nfloor with suggestions to amend it. But we should, supporting \nexpenditures of Federal funds, require compliance with the law that \nmandates competition in this area.\n  I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask, is there additional time \npreserved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator from New Mexico has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Was there 2 minutes before each vote that was provided \nfor in the unanimous-consent agreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from New Mexico \nthat there was. However, we have already had 10 minutes on this debate, \nso the Chair declares the time has expired.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia [Mr. \nRockefeller] is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, let me take just 1 minute to explain this \namendment.\n  This amendment is a very simple one. A ``yes'' vote means that we \ncontinue the current law. A ``yes'' vote on the amendment would \ncontinue in force the current prohibition on the taxpayer subsidy of \nabortions for Federal workers. It would permit Federal\n\n[[Page S7788]]\n\nemployee health plans to cover abortion only in the cases of rape, \nincest and threats to the life of the mother.\n  This has been the law for most of the last 14 years, from 1984 to \n1993, and from 1995 until the present. A ``yes'' vote continues current \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, in 1996 the Federal Government paid an average of 74 \npercent of the cost of a Federal employee's health premium. That is \ntaxpayer money. And the Senate has twice voted to be sure tax dollars \nwere not used to fund abortions.\n  In 1995, this body endorsed this policy by a vote of 50 to 44. In \n1996, we approved it again by a vote of 53 to 45. It is good policy. It \nought to remain in force, consistent with the well-being of the \nAmerican people.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment which is aimed at curbing the \nlegal rights of women who work for the Federal Government to obtain \nabortion services through their health insurance. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this amendment offered by Senator DeWine.\n  Who is impacted by the DeWine amendment? There are 1.2 million women \nof reproductive age who rely on the Federal Employees Health Benefits \nProgram for their medical coverage. They will be stopped from using \ntheir own insurance to exercise their right to obtain a perfectly legal \nabortion.\n  Women who are employed by the Federal Government work hard. They \npersonally pay for their health premiums out of their own pockets. And, \nwhen it comes to health care coverage, they deserve the same health \nbenefits as women who work in the private sector.\n  To me the question is clear: Should women Federal employees or their \ndependents be treated the same as other women in the work force or \nshould they be singled out, punished, have their rights taken away from \nthem and be treated differently?\n  In 1993, a majority of the Senate voted to restore the coverage of \nabortion services, and Federal employees were once again given equality \nwith other women. Unfortunately, this Republican Congress overturned \nthose rights. The Senate Appropriations Committee bill now before us \nprovides funding for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. We \nshould ensure that this funding remains in the bill.\n  Anti-choice forces are chipping away at the right of women in this \ncountry to obtain safe, legal abortions by making a women's ability to \nexercise that choice dependent upon the amount of her paycheck and the \nemployer who signs it.\n  If there were an amendment to stop a man who happens to work for the \nFederal Government from getting a perfectly legal medical procedure, \none that might protect his health, there would be an uproar on this \nfloor. People would say, how dare you do that to the men of this \ncountry? Why not treat the men who work for the Federal Government the \nsame way we treat men who work in the private sector?\n  The bottom line is--this is a tough personal, private matter, and I \nreally think it is time we trusted women to make that choice. Who are \nwe to say that a woman who happens to work for the Federal Government \nor her dependents should not have this right?\n  Let's ensure that all Federal employees have the rights, the \nprotections, and the health care coverage they deserve.\n  The DeWine amendment singles out female Federal employees and denies \nthem a medical benefit available to all other working women. It is \nwrong.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Murray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the DeWine \namendment (No. 936) to the Treasury, Postal Service appropriations bill \nfor fiscal year 1998. This amendment is nothing more than another \nattempt to attack basic reproductive health services for Federal \nemployees and their dependents. This has become an annual tradition \nduring consideration of appropriations bills.\n  What always surprises me about this amendment is the arguments used \nin defense of denying Federal employees access to the same reproductive \nhealth and choices afforded most private sector employees. We are told \nthat this is a matter of not allowing for the use of Federal funds for \nabortion related services. But, this is not argument does not make \nsense when one considers that most Federal employees contribute to \ntheir own health insurance through premiums, deductibles, and \ncopayments. In addition, health insurance benefits are a form of \ncompensation for services rendered. They are not viewed as a direct \nFederal payment, but rather a cost of labor. If we believe that Federal \nhealth insurance benefits are not a form of compensation, but rather a \ndirect Federal payment to employees, then we should be looking to \nrefund women who selected health insurance based on the reproductive \nservices provided. If it was a direct Federal payment, why would the \ninsurance companies be reluctant to reimburse all female Federal \nemployees the cost of these services?\n  If one were to take this argument to the next level, then supporters \nof this amendment should be looking to forbid any Federal employee from \nusing their salary to pay for abortion related services. Maybe we \nshould have whole list of things that Federal employees cannot use \ntheir own salaries to support. But, we know that offering this type of \namendment would expose the true motivation behind this continued attack \non a woman's right to a safe and legal abortion.\n  That is what we should be discussing; the continued erosion of access \nto safe and legal abortion services. Instead of these piecemeal \nattempts, perhaps we should have a full and open debate on banning a \nwoman's right to chose. That is what this amendment is all about. It is \nnot Federal funding, but rather another attempt to further restrict and \ncontrol access to safe reproductive health services. Using Federal \nfunding simply allows those who oppose a woman's right to chose the \nchance to hide behind a baseless argument.\n  I feel confident that few Members in the U.S. Senate would be \ncomfortable telling all women that they are no longer protected and can \nno longer be guaranteed access to a safe, affordable abortion \nregardless of the circumstances. Few Senators would want to tell their \nconstituents that the issue is not for them to decide, but rather the \ndecision has been made by the U.S. Senate. So instead, the strategy is \nto hide behind issues like the use of Federal funds, or Federal \nfacilities.\n  Putting aside the issue of abortion for a moment, as guardians of the \nFEHBP and Federal employees, we must ask if it is right to deny a \nFederal employee access to a safe and affordable abortion. Currently, \nthere are approximately 1.2 million women of reproductive age who rely \non the FEHBP for their medical care. These women, by simply choosing a \ncareer in public service, agree to be discriminated against every day \nwhen it comes to health insurance coverage.\n\n  Approximately, two thirds of private fee-for-service plans and 70 \npercent of HMO's provide abortion coverage. Many of these same plans \nparticipate in the FEHBP and must offer a different level of benefits \nfor Federal employees. They are legally allowed to discriminate against \nwomen who are also Federal employees. In no other situation would \nCongress stand for this form of discrimination within a plan that \nparticipates in the FEHBP. But, today we are voting to do just that.\n  I am always surprised by the lack of understanding of the real \nproblems facing real people, shown by some of my colleagues. Supporters \nof this amendment state that a woman can still get an abortion, but she \nsimply cannot receive health insurance coverage for this care. This may \nsound reasonable until one considers that costs for this type of care \ncan be anywhere from $400 to several thousand dollars depending upon \nthe severity of the problem. For many female Federal employees, who are \nin most cases the lowest paid, this is a lot of money. It might as well \nbe $10,000. In addition, what guarantee is there that the care will be \nadequate and meet the standard of care for all FEHBP participants? \nUnfortunately, there are no guarantees.\n\n[[Page S7789]]\n\n  This could also create additional costs and problems for insurance \nplans. We all know that an unsafe abortion can be life threatening. We \ncan also assume that there is followup care required to ensure the \noverall health of the woman. Who is responsible for this care? Who is \nfinancially responsible for the effects of unsafe abortion or in a \nsituation where the woman could not afford the followup care required? \nSome of my colleagues seem to think that an abortion is a decision made \nwith little or no thought, they must also assume that the procedure is \ndone with little or no thought. I can assure you, no woman makes this \ndecision lightly and like all surgical procedures there is always some \nrisk.\n  I strongly oppose this discriminatory attempt to deny 1.2 million \nFederal employees and their dependents access to safe, affordable \nhealth care coverage and urge my colleagues to think very carefully \nabout voting to continue this discrimination.\n  This is not about the use of Federal funds. We all know that not one \nFederal employee received a refund when Congress acted to eliminate \nthis coverage. For most insurance plans, abortion related services are \na part of a package of reproductive health benefits--they do not single \nout abortion. This amendment is simply about denying some women access \nto safe, affordable and comprehensive reproductive health care \nbenefits.\n  Mr. President, time and again, Members come to the floor to talk \nabout how they support women's health. Once again, we are going to take \nreproductive health of women away from women.\n  This is about the health of women. It is denying Federal employees \nthe ability to make choices about their own reproductive health.\n  I urge you to vote ``no'' on the DeWine amendment.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Very briefly, this is a gratuitous slap at women's \ncitizen rights. We are equal citizens. We should not be singled out for \nthis kind of treatment.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, from 1984 through 1993, language was \nincluded as part of the Treasury/Postal Service appropriations bills \nwhich prohibited taxpayer money from going to fund abortions through \nFederal employee health benefits plans. In 1993, President Clinton \npushed a change in that policy through Congress. For 2 years, people \nwho were unalterably opposed to abortion were forced to pay for an \nestimated 17,000 abortions each year for any reason. In 1995, Congress \nrestored the policy of restricting abortion funding and has continued \nto maintain that policy. The narrow question before us today is whether \nAmericans who stand in defense of life should be forced to pay for its \ndestruction with their taxes. I do not believe they should and thus \nstrongly support my colleague from Ohio's amendment.\n  Whether they choose to call themselves pro-choice or pro-life, the \nAmerican people overwhelmingly reject public financing of abortion. A \nCBS/New York Times poll conducted in April 1993, about health care \nreform issues asked adults what should be included in a basic, \nGovernment-subsidized health care plan. Only 23 percent thought \nabortion should be covered. Some 72 percent said abortion should not be \nincluded a benefit in a Government-sponsored health plan.\n  A Wirthlin poll conducted in May 1992, found that 55 percent of \nAmericans opposed using tax dollars to pay for abortions for women who \ncannot afford to pay for them. I would speculated that the number would \nbe even higher if the question reflected the issue we are considering \nhere, which is Government-subsidized abortions for women who can afford \nthem.\n  Employers determine the benefits employees get. Taxpayers are the \nemployers of Federal employees and a large majority of taxpayers do not \nwant their tax dollars to pay for abortions. In 1995 the Federal \nGovernment contributed, on average, 72 percent of the money toward the \npurchase of health insurance for its employees. Thus, taxpayers \nprovided a majority share of the funds to purchase health insurance for \nthe Federal civilian work force.\n  The abortion funding restriction in this amendment addresses the same \ncore issue as the Hyde amendments: Should the Federal Government be in \nthe business of funding abortion? Should taxpayers be forced to \nunderwrite the cost of abortions for Federal employees?\n  This amendment does not in any way hinder an individual's free \nexercise of their choice in regard to abortion services. What it does \ndo is prevent such an individual's choice from being subsidized by \nfunds taken from taxpayers who object to an unfettered exercise of the \nchoice to abort an unborn child.\n  No matter what private arrangements individuals wish to make \nregarding abortion and insurance. Most American do not wish to see \nabortion services included among a federally guaranteed package of \nhealth care benefits. Despite its articulation of a constitutional \nright to privacy regarding abortion, the Supreme Court ruled in 1980 \nthat abortion funding restrictions are constitutionally permissible. \nThere is a clear distinction between supporting the private choice of \nabortion and requiring citizens through their tax dollars or federally \nmandated health premiums, to pay for such a service.\n  I hope that this overwhelming evidence will lead my colleagues to \nunderstand the imperative nature of this issue, and I urge them to vote \nin favor of this necessary amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator DeWine.\n  The bill reported by the Senate Appropriations Committee would enable \nFederal employees, whose health insurance is provided under the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan, to receive coverage for abortion \nservices.\n  The DeWine amendment would prohibit coverage for abortion, except in \ncases of life endangerment, rape, or incest. It would continue a ban \nwhich has prevented Federal employees from receiving a health care \nservice which is widely available for private sector employees.\n  I oppose this amendment for two reasons. First of all, it is it is an \nassault on the earned benefits of Federal employees. Second, it is part \nof a continuing assault on women's reproductive rights and would \nendanger women's health.\n  In the 104th Congress we saw vote after vote designed to roll back \nthe clock on women's reproductive rights. In the last Congress, there \nwere 53 votes in both the House and Senate on abortion-related issues. \nIt's clear that this unprecedented assault on a woman's right to decide \nfor herself whether or not to have a child is continuing in this \nCongress.\n  Well, I support the right to choose. And I support Federal employees. \nAnd that is why I strenuously oppose this amendment.\n  Let me speak first about our Federal employees. Some 280,000 Federal \nemployees live in the State of Maryland. I am proud to represent them. \nThey are the people who make sure that the Social Security checks go \nout on time. They make sure that our Nation's veterans receive their \ndisability checks. At NIH, they are doing vital research on finding \ncures and better treatments for diseases like cancer, Parkinson's and \nAlzheimers. There is no American whose life is not touched in some way \nby the hard work of a Federal employee. They deserve our thanks and our \nsupport.\n  Instead, Federal employees have suffered one assault after another in \nthe last year or two. They have faced tremendous employment insecurity, \nas Government has downsized, and eliminated over 200,000 Federal jobs. \nTheir COLA's and their retirement benefits have been threatened. They \nhave faced the indignity and economic hardship of three Government \nshutdowns. Federal employees have been vilified as what is wrong with \nGovernment, when they should be thanked and valued for the tremendous \nservice they provide to our country and to all Americans.\n  I view this amendment as yet another assault on these faithful public \nservants. It goes directly after the earned benefits of Federal \nemployees. Health insurance is part of the compensation package to \nwhich all Federal employees are entitled. The costs of insurance \ncoverage are shared by the Federal Government and the employee.\n\n[[Page S7790]]\n\n  I know that proponents of continuing the ban on abortion coverage for \nFederal employees say that they are only trying to prevent taxpayer \nfunding of abortion. But that is not what this debate is about.\n  This is about prohibiting the compensation package of Federal \nemployees from being used for a legal and sometimes vital medical \nservice. Health insurance is part of the Federal employees pay.\n  If we were to extend the logic of the argument of those who favor the \nban, we would prohibit Federal employees from obtaining abortions using \ntheir own paychecks. After all, those funds also come from the \ntaxpayers.\n  But no one is seriously suggesting that Federal employees ought not \nto have the right to do whatever they want with their own paychecks. \nAnd we should not be placing unfair restrictions on the type of health \ninsurance Federal employees can purchase under the Federal Employee \nHealth Benefit Plan.\n  About 1.2 million women of reproductive age depend on the FEHBP for \ntheir medical care. We know that access to reproductive health services \nis essential to women's health. We know that restrictions that make it \nmore difficult for women to obtain early abortions increase the \nlikelihood that women will put their health at risk by being forced to \ncontinue a high-risk pregnancy.\n  If we continue the ban on abortion services, and provide exemptions \nonly in cases of life endangerment, rape, or incest, the 1.2 million \nwomen of reproductive health age who depend on the FEHBP will not have \naccess to abortion even when their health is seriously threatened. We \nwill be replacing the informed judgment of medical care givers with \nthat of politicians.\n  Decisions on abortion should be made by the woman in close \nconsultation with her physician. These decisions should be made on the \nbasis of medical judgment, not on the basis of political judgments. \nOnly a woman and her physician can weigh her unique circumstances and \nmake the decision that is right for that particular woman's life and \nhealth.\n  It is wrong for the Congress to try to issue a blanket prohibition on \ninsuring a legal medical procedure with no allowance for the particular \nset of circumstances that an individual woman may face. I deeply \nbelieve that women's health will suffer if we do so.\n  I believe it is time to quit attacking Federal employees and their \nbenefits. I believe we need to quit treating Federal employees as \nsecond class citizens. I believe Federal employees should be able to \nreceive the same quality and range of health care services as their \nprivate sector counterparts.\n  Because I believe in the right to choose and because I support \nFederal employees, I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating the \nDeWine amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question occurs on agreeing to amendment No. 936. The yeas and \nnays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD.

As my colleagues will recall, the IRS has a large computer \nfacility in my home State, in the city of Martinsburg. This facility \nshould be an integral part of future IRS modernization efforts. \nTherefore, I have a question for the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee about this matter.\n  In its report, the committee supported the IRS' modernization \nblueprint. With respect to private sector involvement, the committee \nsaid:\n\n       In 1997, Congress directed the IRS to turn over a majority \n     of its tax systems modernization work to the private sector. \n     The committee is pleased that the IRS is planning to develop \n     and implement the modernization plan through new partnerships \n     with the private sector.\n\n  Having said this, however, the committee included no funds in the \nbill for this purpose. My question is this: does the subcommittee \nchairman intend to recommend funding for the modernization program when \na contract is let?\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia \nfor his interest in this important program. While the committee chose \nnot to fund modernization for fiscal year 1998, I support appropriation \nof funds at that time in the future when the contract is awarded. I am \npleased to put this on the record. Otherwise, those in the private \nsector spending extensive funds helping develop the concept of \nperformance--based contracts, reviewing the ``Request for Comment,'' \nand lending their expertise to the IRS so that the ``Request for \nProposal,'' when issued, is in the best possible shape, may stop doing \nso because of uncertainties about Congress' commitment to fund the \nprocurement.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1023, the fiscal \nyear 1998 Treasury and general Government appropriation bill, and \ncommend the chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee, Senator \nCampbell and Senator Kohl, for their very fine efforts in managing this \nbill. This is the first year that these distinguished Members have had \nan opportunity to manage this important bill which provides over $25 \nbillion for the operation of the Department of Treasury and general \nGovernment activities.\n  The bill is $456 million less than the amount requested in the \nPresident's budget. The Members are to be commended for their efforts \nto keep a tight rein on funding and trim back wherever possible. The \nbill is consistent with the 602(b) allocations for both budget \nauthority and outlays for the subcommittee.\n  Again, I congratulate Senators Campbell and Kohl for their effective \nwork. I also commend the work of the subcommittee staff: Barbara \nRetzlaff and Liz Blevins for the minority and Pat Raymond, Tammy \nPerrin, Lula Edwards for the majority.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, are there any further amendments to S. \n1023?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator from Colorado \nthat there are no further amendments.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that S. 1023 not \nbe engrossed and that it remain at the desk pending receipt of the \nHouse companion measure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill will be read the third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, the staff and Senator Kohl have worked\n\n[[Page S7791]]\n\nvery hard on this bill. We have tried to accommodate all of the \nMembers' suggestions. It is probably not a perfect bill, but we think \nit is a good bill.

The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 944\n\n  (Purpose: To reduce the appropriation for the implementation of the \n   space station program for the purpose of terminating the program)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers], for himself, Mr. \n     Kohl, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Bryan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n     Wellstone, and Mr. Feingold proposes an amendment numbered \n     944.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this is the sixth year that I have stood \nat this desk and lamented the fact that we have become inured to \nprojects which have massive cost overruns if it means a few jobs in our \nState or if it means you can cast a cheap vote and not pay a price for \nit back home.\n  Now, I have been here for 22\\1/2\\ years, and I have watched this body \ntime and time again proceed continuously to vote for such things as the \nspace station whereas if it were a secret ballot it would not get 25 \nvotes. The facts and the evidence are absolutely overwhelming against \ngoing forward with the space station, and yet because of the issue of \njobs back home, it is very seldom that anyone casts a vote against it.\n  Also, there is no political price to pay, even if you do not have \njobs back home, hinging on going forward with the space station. There \nis no political price to be exacted against you for voting for \nsomething that people know very little about and have never honed in \non.\n  My wife, Betty Bumpers, a woman I admire very much for her courage, \nstarted a peace organization in 1981, and I said, ``What you have done \nis just assured your husband's defeat in the next election.'' She said, \n``Yes, and you men are going to get my children killed.'' And so I had \nto dance around that issue until I ran the next time fully expecting to \nbe confronted by my opponent about my wife's activities in the peace \nmovement.\n  Now, isn't it a strange dichotomy in America, that one has to be \ndefensive about being for all the things that would promote peace. That \nis how strange this place is at times.\n  Of course, Betty has been active in childhood immunizations all of \nher life, and all of my political life--she had started a program in \n1972 to immunize all the children in my State, which had one of the \nlowest immunization levels of any State in the country. We immunized \n300,000 children one Saturday. She was known then and is still known as \nthe one of the foremost leaders in immunization programs in this \ncountry. I remember one day in 1973 some smart reporter said, \n``Senator, do you think your wife's activities''--he was referring to \npeace, of course--``Do you think your wife's activities are going to be \na big detriment to you in your campaign?'' I said, ``Well, it will be \namong all those people who favor war and not immunizing children.'' And \nI never got asked another question about it.\n  I do not mean to sound arrogant about being willing to stand up \noccasionally for something I strongly believe in, but occasionally I \nchastise some of my colleagues who could save the taxpayers billions of \ndollars and hasten the day we balance the budget, but who refuse to do \nit because there is no political accounting for voting for the space \nstation, particularly now when the rover is roving around on Mars. As a \nmatter of fact, I know this is pure coincidence, but if you want to go \nover to the Dirksen Building, it just so happens that, at the same time \nwe are considering the space station and the entire space budget in the \nChamber, NASA has a thrilling show in the Dirksen Building for all the \nSenators to see of the rover roving around on Mars sniffing rocks.\n  Let me say--and I have said this for 6 straight years--I favor the \nspace program. I have never once lamented the fact that we have a \nshuttle program and that we have the ability to place all kinds of \nscientific and communications satellites in orbit. And in sending the \nrover to Mars, NASA is doing exactly what it should do, because that \nproves another point. We do not need a manned mission to do science on \nMars.\n  Mr. President, almost all the scientists in the country, virtually \nevery Nobel physicist, virtually every scientific group in America, \nopposes the space station. Unfortunately, they don't have enough \npolitical clout to fill a thimble. I admire them, I respect them, but \nthe truth of the matter is, they have very little impact on this body \nor the House of Representatives on what they favor or don't favor.\n  One day on this floor, I said even Carl Sagan was opposed to the \nspace station. Carl Sagan, whom I had known for several years--we \nweren't close friends, but I had been thrown in contact with him a few \ntimes--called to say that I had misstated what he believed. What he \nsaid was, ``I believe the space station is a legitimate thing, a highly \ndesirable thing, as a way station to get to Mars. But,'' he said, to \nfollow that up, something that I have always strongly believed, ``it is \nnot--it is not a wise expenditure of money if you are talking about \nscientific experiments to be conducted on the space station.'' That is \none of the reasons the American Physical Society and so many other \ngroups oppose the space station.\n  People around here are sometimes influenced by how somebody feels \nabout it. I will tell you who strongly opposes going forward with the \nspace station: The Concord Coalition, which was headed up by our now \ndeceased, highly respected colleague, Paul Tsongas and by Warren \nRudman, also our former colleague from New Hampshire. The Concord \nCoalition, Citizens Against Government Waste, the Cato Institute, the \nProgressive Policy Institute, the National Taxpayers' Union, and \nCitizens for a Sound Economy.\n  Then, in the scientific community, listen to this: the American \nPhysiological Society, the American Society for Biochemistry and \nMolecular Biology, the American Society for Pharmacology and \nExperimental Therapeutics, the American Society for Investigative \nPathology, the American Institute of Nutrition, American Association of \nImmunologists, American Society of Cell Biology, the Biophysical \nSociety, the American Association of Anatomists.\n  Who comprises the American Physical Society? It is 41,000 physicists. \nDr. Robert Park, a professor of physics at the University of Maryland \nat College Park, has testified time and again here about the folly of \njustifying the space station by alluding to the kind of scientific \nexperiments they are going to do on it.\n  Mr. President, my amendment says we will terminate the space station \nat a cost of $600 million and we will save $1.5 billion to put on the \ndeficit. Sometimes my staff presents me with some alternatives. ``Why \ndon't we say we are going to put this $1.5 billion in savings into some \nother popular program?'' I said, ``I have been there and done that.'' I \nremember when I first got into trying to torpedo the space station, I \nwould have transferred the money over to Veterans Affairs. That is \nusually an item that causes Senators to jump under their desks. If you \nare going to give it to the veterans, most people around here will look \nvery cautiously before they vote no. But I didn't get any more votes \nthan I have been getting since.\n  We have become so inured to cost overruns, we just simply cannot stop \na big project once it is started. Only two things that come to mind \nthat we finally did stop. One was the Clinch River breeder reactor, \nwhich incidentally was also my amendment. Howard Baker was majority \nleader. Maybe you think that wasn't an uphill battle. But the American \nscientific community began to rise up in arms, and the \nenvironmentalists threw a fit. So, finally we decided that we did not \nwant to follow the breeder reactor method of generating electricity in \nthis country and\n\n[[Page S7805]]\n\nwe finally killed it after I spent 4 years standing at this desk, \ntalking about the folly of that project. We had already started digging \nground down in Clinch River to build it.\n  The other thing we terminated was the super collider. That's another \none of my amendments. I guess the reason they happen to come to mind is \nthat I happen to be the architect of killing both of them. The super \ncollider, this massive hole in the ground in Texas, nobody really \ntalked much about the science of the super collider. All they talked \nabout was all the jobs it was going to create in Texas, which indeed it \nwould have.\n\n  Let me just, while I am on the subject of jobs, point something out. \nThe space station--if you want to make it a jobs program go home and \ntell the chamber of commerce that it costs $140,000 for every job it \ncreates. Take the same proposition to General Motors or anybody else: \nYou come into our community and we will give you $140,000 for every job \nyou create. They will be standing on line from here to New York to try \nto take you up on that offer.\n  You think about the fact it costs $10,000 to $12,000 a pound for \nevery pound of material we send to the space station. And now there is \nan estimate, if you have four astronauts on board, they can only devote \n4 hours a day each to research-related activities. So, if you have four \nAmerican astronauts, that's 16 hours a day that they could put into \nscience. Do you want to know how expensive that is? Well, NASA says it \nwill cost $1,300,000,000 a year to operate the station. So, it will \nonly cost the taxpayers $230,000 for each hour the astronauts put in \nactually working on scientific experiments on the space station. Do you \nwant to hear one better than that? The space station is to have a 10-\nyear life and it will cost all-told about $100 billion. Figure that one \nout: $25 million a day is going to be the cost of keeping the space \nstation up there.\n  Do you have any idea, when we sit in the Agriculture Committee \ntalking about research, how we have to grovel and fight and scratch and \nclaw for every dime we get for research? Do you have any idea what $25 \nmillion will do? Do you know the National Institutes of Health can only \nfund one out of every four good scientific projects that are brought to \nthem? And we are talking about honest to God research. Research on \ncancer, on AIDS, on arthritis--every conceivable kind of disease that \nafflicts mankind is handled through the National Institutes of Health, \nto which we give about $13 to $14 billion a year. And they can only \nfund one out of every four experiments. That is real science. You can \nbook it. Do you know what real medical research could be done if we \nsimply gave them the cost of one space shuttle flight? They could fund \none out of every three proposals.\n  Last week I conducted a hearing on immunizations. There is going to \nbe a big to-do over at the White House tomorrow on the remarkable \nsuccess we have had on immunizations. In a hearing last week it was \nrevealed by some pharmaceutical companies, and the Centers for Disease \nControl in Atlanta, that we now face the possibility of eliminating \nmeasles worldwide, as we are about to eradicate polio worldwide. We now \nhave new vaccines, even for children's earaches; even for dysentery. \nLast year we had 50,000 hospitalizations last year of children with \ndysentery, and 20 children died--but worldwide those figures are \nnothing. Worldwide, dysentery kills so many children--but not as many \nas measles. Does that shock you? Measles is still the biggest killer of \nchildren in the world; 1 million children a year die of measles.\n  At the hearing they told us about all these new vaccines. For \nexample, for infants--put a little something in each nostril of the \nnose and they will never get flu. You can also use that in combination \nwith another vaccine which, as I say, will keep them from getting \ndysentery.\n  I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll stand on my head on the top of this \nCapitol if you ever get anything even remotely close to those kinds of \nadvances after you spend $100 billion. For 6 years I have listened to \nSenators come over here, they are my friends and colleagues and I don't \ndenigrate their feelings about it, but when you start asking, ``What \nare the scientific experiments we are going to conduct?'' ``Well, we \ndon't know. We have to get up there and find out what we are looking \nfor.''\n  It was Dr. Nicolaas Bloembergen, of Harvard, who made the best \nstatement I ever heard about research on the space \nstation. Incidentally, he is adamantly opposed to it. I'll come back to \nthat. I'm going to take about 20 minutes just reading quotes from the \ntop physicists, medical doctors, you name it, about the space station, \nbefore I sit down. Do you know what he said about microgravity \nresearch, which is the big thing everybody talks about; that is \nresearch you do in weightlessness? He said, ``microgravity is of \nmicroimportance.'' That says it all. Why else would we be sending a \nstation up there to do scientific experiments except it is a weightless \nsituation?\n\n  Another great physicist whom I will quote in a moment said, ``It is \nthe worst place to do microgravity research with men on board or women \non board.'' That is because, if you are looking for an experiment that \nrequires weightlessness and you have people tromping around in the \nstation and vibrating it, you lose the benefit. You would expect a 6-\nyear-old to understand that.\n  Mr. President, let me just bring you up to date. In 1996, the General \nAccounting Office to do a report on the space station. It was not the \nmost devastating report I ever read in my life, and of course I was \nlooking for something that I might hang my hat on that just might jar \nthis place into action. But there were really no bombs in the 1996 GAO \nreport, except they predicted that unless certain things happened \ncertain other very undesirable things were going to happen, namely \nunless the Russians came through with their part of this project the \ncost was going to skyrocket.\n  One Senator came to me in 1994 and said: ``Dale, I think this \ncooperation with Russia is a tremendous idea. We can keep their space \nscientists busy and they won't be off in Iraq and Iran, building \nmissiles for some of the rogue nations.'' And he said, ``You know, we \nhave to help the Russians all we can. They have big problems.''\n  I said: ``That's right. But if we are going to send them $200 million \nfor openers, just to say they will be a part of the international space \nstation, I say send it to them in economic aid or food. That is what \nthey need. They do not need to be participating in one of the biggest \nboondoggles ever conceived. What they need is something to help their \npeople with their infrastructure, build industry, feed their people.''\n  So what has happened, as predictable as night following day, is \nRussia has reneged. We gave them close to $200 million for openers to \nbuild the first section of the work they were supposed to do. We gave \nthem that money.\n  They were supposed to build the service module. There are nine \nmodules on this space station. They were supposed to build the third \none, but a very important one, called the service module, and they have \nnot been able to come up with all the money, nor are they likely to. I \nwill return in a moment to some of the consequences of that.\n  But back to the GAO report. Congressman Dingell and I asked the GAO \nto update their 1996 report. Here is the update, which we received last \nnight and which anybody else who wants it can get this morning. Here is \nwhat the GAO update says. If there is anything people around here \ndetest, it is somebody going around telling them, ``I told you so,'' so \nI won't say it.\n  Listen to this:\n\n       The prime contractor's--\n\n  That is Boeing's----\n\n     cost and schedule performance on the space station, which \n     showed signs of deterioration last year, has continued to \n     decline virtually unabated. Since April 1996, the cost \n     overrun has more than tripled.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       Since April 1996--\n\n  A little over a year ago--\n\n     the cost overrun has more than tripled and the schedule \n     slippage has increased by almost 50 percent.\n\n  Does it not take nerve to come in here asking us to go forward with a \n$100 billion project in the light of that?\n\n       Financial reserves are dwindling with up to 6 years \n     remaining until on-orbit assembly of the space station is \n     completed.\n\n  That is what we are looking at now. We still have 6 years to go \nbefore we\n\n[[Page S7806]]\n\neven get that sucker assembled in space:\n\n       . . . with up to 6 years remaining until on-orbit assembly \n     of the space station is completed. NASA has already \n     identified actual and potential resource demands that exceed \n     the station's remaining financial reserves.\n\n  As the French say, here comes the piece de resistance:\n\n       NASA transferred $462 million from its science budget to \n     the space station development budget in fiscal years 1996 \n     through 1998.\n\n  Why did NASA transfer $462 million from its science account to the \nmanufacturing of the space station? To cover the cost overruns. And the \n$462 million comes out of the science budget. Either you are going to \nreduce the scientific experiments on this thing by $462 million, or \nNASA is going to come back to Congress and say we need $462 million \nmore. Which do you think that is going to be? We all know what it is \ngoing to be, and this is just the beginning:\n\n       It is also planning to transfer another $70 million in \n     fiscal 1999 from the science fund to the station development \n     budget.\n\n  Mr. President, NASA says that to assemble and build the space \nstation, the cost will be $17.4 billion, and within that are these \nscientific funds. They are taking money from Peter to pay Paul, but \nthey are taking money out of the account that they say is absolutely \nessential to justify the space station, namely, the science that we are \ngoing to get. You can't have it both ways, or you can, too, in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Congress approved the transfer of $200 million this year. We approved \na $200 million transfer from the space shuttle. I just told you that \nthey have transferred $462 million from their science account over to \nthe space station account. Now we are giving them authority to transfer \nmoney from the shuttle account, the manned space program that most \npeople around here applaud, and are putting it into the space station. \nWhy? To cover the cost overruns on the space station. It is the most \ntraditional, time-honored shell game that any of us know anything \nabout, and that is to cover the cost incurred because the Russians have \nbeen so late in coming up with their money.\n\n  There is another $100 million pending in Congress for the year 1998. \nThat is in the House bill; that is not in the Senate bill. But, in \naddition to allowing them to take $200 million out of the shuttle fund \nand put it into the space station, now the House has said, ``We will \ngive you another $100 million to transfer to the space station.'' This \nis actually outside the $17.4 billion. The $462 million in science \nfunds is inside the $17.4 billion and can only be classified as a \nwhopping cost overrun.\n  This is one of the most interesting things that the GAO report said:\n\n       When NASA redesigned the space station in 1993. . . .\n\n  You remember, President Clinton looked at a whole list of them and \nfinally came up with what was finally called International Space \nStation Alpha:\n\n       When NASA redesigned the station in 1993, it estimated that \n     Russia, as a partner, would reduce program costs by $1.6 \n     billion because the station's assembly would be completed \n     sooner.\n\n  It would be finished in June 2002 instead of September 2003, the \nproposition being that if the Russians came through, we would build it \nfaster and, therefore, save $1.6 billion.\n  Mr. President, those are not my figures, those are NASA's figures, \nthose are NASA's statements. And this is what GAO said about it:\n\n       NASA has recently acknowledged that completion of the \n     station's assembly would indeed slip to 2003. . . .\n\n  Fifteen months later than we have been told since time immemorial \nthis thing would be finished.\n  While NASA has not acknowledged the 2003 date, they have yet to tell \nus what the new milestone will be. And the GAO says:\n\n       Consequently, most, if not all, of the reduced costs \n     claimed by accelerating the schedule by 15 months would be \n     lost by slipping the schedule by a similar amount.\n\n  In short, now we are back to the old time schedule, and the $1.6 \nbillion that NASA said they would save by bringing Russia into the \nprogram and, therefore, building it 15 months sooner than we would \notherwise have built won't be saved.\n  NASA has not told us yet precisely when they expect to have this \nthing finished, nor precisely what a 15-month slippage at this point is \ngoing to cost, though I can tell you, based on the conversations I had \nwith people who know more about this program than anybody else, it is \n$2 billion.\n  Mr. President, I tried to torpedo the space station since the memory \nof man runneth not. I have tried in almost more times than there have \nbeen design changes, new partners, and new promises by NASA, and until \nthis very moment, NASA is trying to con the Senate by showing this \nmagnificent film about Mars over in the Dirksen Building and still \nsmoothly promising that everything is running on target, on schedule, \nand the only reason we know that isn't true is because GAO has done two \nstudies that contradict NASA 180 degrees.\n  We don't need a space station. The Mir is the seventh Russian space \nstation. The Mir has been in orbit, how long? Eleven years. The Mir has \nbeen up there 11 years, and now it is in big trouble. I am not saying \nthat is predictable. I will say this, and this is not to bash Russia--I \nbelieve in doing everything we can to help their economy and keep them \nviable--but their space program is not as sophisticated as ours. While \nI understand all the arguments for bringing Russia into this, I am not \nsure scientifically and from a safety standpoint it is good to do it.\n  But the point I wanted to make is, again, I have stood on this floor \nfor 6 long years and said show me, tell me what are the scientific \nachievements Russia has achieved in 20 years of having a space station \nin orbit. And I have been met by a deafening roar of silence. There are \nnone. The only justification for a space station is as a way station to \nMars.\n  Mr. President, look at this chart, and I will say that in 1984, \nRonald Reagan, I think it was in a State of the Union Address, said we \nwere going to build a space station--that was in 1984; that has now \nbeen 13-plus years--we were going to build a space station for $8 \nbillion and deploy it and operate it. That was the initial promise of \nthe President. At that time, here were the justifications. Look at \nthem.\n  It was going to be a staging base, presumably to go to Mars.\n  It was going to be a manufacturing facility. We were going to \nmanufacture a new kind of sophisticated crystal in a microgravity \natmosphere.\n  It was going to be a space-based observatory.\n  It was going to be a transportation node.\n  It was going to be a servicing facility, presumably for people on \ntheir way to Mars.\n  It was going to be an assembly facility, again, to assemble the parts \nof a space station to go to Mars.\n  It was going to be a storage facility.\n  And, finally, it was going to be a research laboratory.\n  You can see from my chart how many of those exist today. Seven of \nthem have been torpedoed, and only one remains standing.\n  Go back to the original $8 billion that President Reagan said it was \ngoing to cost. Here is an update on that. I tell you, I cannot keep the \ngrin off my face as I go through these things. You just cannot believe \nit, you cannot believe it, and yet Senators will come in here and vote \nfor this thing.\n  The President said $8 billion. Here is what we spent on the Reagan \nplan--$11.2 billion. That is gone. What we got out of that is so \ninfinitesimal you might as well have thrown the money off the \nWashington Monument. It would have helped a few poor people.\n  So when Bill Clinton became President, he said this thing is out of \ncontrol, we have to have another look at it. So we have a big design--a \ndesign-off I guess you would call it. And they look at dozens of plans \nover at the White House about what kind of a space station it ought to \nbe.\n  Obviously, the first one was much too grandiose, going to be much too \ncostly. So they come up with the International Space Station Alpha. And \nwe are going to participate with Europe and Canada and Japan, and now \nof course Russia.\n  And here is what the construction cost was going to be between 1994 \nand 2002--$17.4 billion. I have alluded to that figure several times \nalready.\n  Now, anybody who believes that the construction and development of \nthe international space station is going to be $17.4 billion, you go \nahead and vote for it. You have my permission. You\n\n[[Page S7807]]\n\ncertainly will not lose my friendship, if you actually believe that. \nBut if you actually believe that, you haven't got enough you-know-what \nto be a Member of Congress. But if you believe that, go ahead and vote \nfor it.\n  The GAO had just gotten through issuing a report this morning saying \nthat is nonsense. And here is the operating costs for 10 years, $13 \nbillion.\n  Mr. President, do you know the cost of this program and the cost of \nall the 83 shuttles it is going to take to get it up there and supply \nit? The cost is going to be staggering. You know, the cost of gold is \n$325 an ounce today. That is peanuts compared to what a pound of water \nwill cost to supply these astronauts, just peanuts. It is like 33 times \nmore to send a pound of water. Maybe not that much. I do not want to \nexaggerate too far. So here is your operating cost, $13 billion.\n  Here are the shuttle flights needed to launch, service and use the \nstation in space--$50.5 billion. Mr. President, let me tell you \nsomething about that. At present, that is 83 launches that are going to \nbe necessary to deploy it and supply it for 10 years after it is \ndeployed--$50.5 billion. That is calculated I think on the basis of the \nspace shuttle, the flights running around $475 million each.\n  I can remember when I used to get teary-eyed seeing that shuttle take \noff when they first developed it. Such a magnificent thing to see. One \nday somebody told me each launch cost almost $500 million, and my eyes \ndried up almost immediately.\n  Here are just the related costs of the space station--$1.9 billion on \nthese shuttle flights. Let me tell you, if you believe that 83 shuttles \nwill leave within a 5 to 7 minute launch window without a hitch over \nthe next 15, 16 years, you vote for it, if you believe that every \nshuttle is going to go up without a hitch, rendezvous with the space \nstation without a hitch, take the needed supplies to the astronauts, \nall of that, and every launch launched within a 5 to 7 minute \ntimeframe, which is absolutely necessary. And if you do not make it \nwithin that 5 to 7 minute envelope, you delay the launch and the costs \nsoar.\n  I have a chart here, Mr. President, about the cost of gold. I guess \nwe can all relate to gold. Here it is. The present cost of the space \nstation is estimated by GAO--incidentally, this is not Dale Bumpers; \nthis is GAO--$94 billion. That is 25 times its weight in gold. And, as \nI said earlier, that is $25 million per day of operation.\n\n  It is a jobs program. I said 140,000 jobs. Each job costs $147,000. \nThree States--California, Texas, and Alabama--they get about 78 percent \nof all the money. The other 22 to 24 percent goes to virtually every \nother State. There are only a handful of States that do not have a \nlittle piece of the action. NASA is not stupid. They took a leaf out of \nthe Pentagon's book. And they put those contracts into almost every \nState. I think there is a little $50,000 contract in Arkansas on the \nspace station. That is just not quite enough to influence me. It \nprovides no commercial value. And it costs $12,880 to transport one \npound of material to the station.\n  Mr. President, let me now go to what some of the scientists say about \nthis project.\n  Before I do that, here is another little overrun. You cannot compute \nthe cost on this--this is manhours--but I want you to think about this. \nIn 1993, NASA said that the assembling of the space station would \nrequire about 311 hours of EVA--extravehicular activity. It is space \nwalking. In 1993, they said it would take 311 hours of space walks to \nassemble it. Then they decided they miscalculated, and they moved it up \nto 434 hours. And then they decided they miscalculated it again, and in \n1996 they said, ``We miscalculated, and it's going to take 1,104 hours \nof space walking to assemble the station.'' And now, just very \nrecently, believe it or not, 1 year from the time the first launch is \nsupposed to occur, they say it is going to take 1,519 hours. NASA has \nonly miscalculated by 500 percent the number of hours it will take to \nassemble the space station. And their calculations on everything else \nare running pretty close.\n  Mr. President, let me tell you what people who know a lot more about \nthe science than I do are saying.\n  Incidentally, I watched Senator Glenn yesterday. He is not just one \nof my very dearest friends, he came to the Senate with me in 1975. He \nis one of the finest men--I think just the finest, most decent man I \nhave ever known. We do not disagree very often, but we disagree \nstrongly on this. We battle back and forth in the cloakroom about it.\n  He has circulated a brochure that ties the space station to research \non aging. God knows, I ought to be interested in that. Well, ironically \none space shuttle flight to the space station will cost almost as much \nas the entire $454 million budget of the National Institute on Aging. \nOne space shuttle flight would finance the National Institute on Aging \nfor 1 year.\n  Now, you ask yourself, do you think you are really going to get \nanything about aging out of the space shuttle? What you are going to \nget is an expensive $450 million, and you are going to get nothing. If \nyou gave it to the National Institute on Aging, you at least have an \noutside chance of something happening.\n  Here are the editors of Discovery Magazine from May 1997, 2 months \nago. Listen to this:\n\n       There is no use belaboring the point. Only the naive or the \n     vested still maintain that there is any good pragmatic reason \n     to spend the tens of billions of dollars it will take to \n     complete what started out in the early 1980s as Freedom and \n     now endures as the International Space Station. . . . Is it \n     possible to imagine a technological undertaking so enormous \n     that could garner less respect from the scientific community?\n\n  That says it all, but I am not going to quit.\n  Here is what Marsha Smith, who was interviewed in Aerospace America \nin June 1995, said I visited with her in my office yesterday. She is \nthe brightest person in this country on this subject. She does not try \nto tint it one way or another. She just calls it like it is. She is not \nunalterably opposed to the space station, for that matter. But I say \nthis simply to demonstrate publicly my intense and high regard for her.\n\n       I don't know of any breakthroughs that have come out of \n     [Russian] space station programs in terms of new or cheaper-\n     to-produce materials or scientific discoveries . . . . Mostly \n     they have learned how to operate a space station for long \n     periods of time.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I again issue the call. What have the Russians \ngot for 20 years of having the space station in orbit that is worthy of \nthe name ``scientific''?\n  Listen to what Tim Beardsley of Scientific American said in June \n1996, a little over 1 year ago.\n\n       The value of biological and health research in orbit has \n     been challenged by Elliott C. Levinthal, a former program \n     director of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency \n     [that is called DARPA over at the Defense Department] . . . \n     Levinthal, who has been a professor of genetics and \n     mechanical engineering at Stanford University, asserts that \n     no neutral committee handing out funds for basic research in \n     biology would support microgravity studies.\n\n  And that is all the scientific justification you can find for the \nspace station--microgravity research. Anything else obviously you can \ndo here on Earth. As a matter of fact, you can do this in the shuttle. \nYou can even do it in unmanned flights.\n  James Ferris of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Scientific \nAmerican:\n\n       Nothing has come out of microgravity research to convince \n     me that a material can be fabricated in orbit that is going \n     to be better than what you can make on Earth.\n\n  Why do we want to spend $100 billion to manufacture something we can \ndo just as well on Earth, and for a fraction of the cost?\n  Here is what the German Physical Society said. And incidentally, \nGermany is involved in paying for some of the costs.\n\n       Except for investigations carried out on humans themselves, \n     all experiments in this area of research can be carried out \n     unmanned, without loss of precision. This also applies to \n     microgravity. Therefore it is improper [it is improper] to \n     use microgravity as an effective argument in favor of manned \n     spaceflight.\n\n  That statement was endorsed by the European Physical Society, all the \nphysicists in Europe, the Physical Society of Japan--our physicists' \ncounterpart in Japan--the Canadian Association of Physicists and the \nAmerican Physical Society.\n  So, Mr. President, there you have it. International space station \nFreedom, partly being paid for by the Japanese, by the European Space \nAgency, by\n\n[[Page S7808]]\n\nCanada--forget Russia for the time being. And how do their physicists \nfeel about it? There is the European Physical Society, the Japanese \nPhysical Society, the Canadian Physical Society and the American \nPhysical Society, and that takes just about every physicist in America, \nwho says this is improbable nonsense. It reminds me of going to a \ndoctor and saying, ``Doctor, I have this hurting in my chest,'' and he \nx-rays me and says, ``It looks to me like you have cancer.'' And I say, \n``Well, it may be, but I will go find a Senator to validate this. I'm \nnot taking your word for it; I want to take the word of the U.S. Senate \nand see if I have cancer of the lung.'' That is not far off. The \nscientists all oppose the space station. Yet, as I said in my opening \nremarks, it is so impossible to convince the Senate.\n  Incidentally, when it comes to the American Physical Society, its \nspokesman in the past, as I said a moment ago, has been Dr. Park. Dr. \nPark said, in July 1993:\n\n       It is the view of the American Physical Society that \n     scientific justification is lacking for a permanently manned \n     space station in Earth orbit. We are concerned that the \n     potential contribution of a manned space station to the \n     physical scientist has been greatly overstated and that many \n     of the scientific objectives currently planned for the space \n     station can be accomplished more effectively and at a much \n     lower cost on Earth.\n\n  Unmanned robotic platforms or on the shuttle. All he represents is \n41,000 physicists in this country. He goes on to say, quoting Professor \nNicolaas Bloembergen of Harvard--and I said earlier I thought he was a \nNobel laureate, and he is, in physics--Dr. Bloembergen of Harvard, a \nNobel laureate and physicist, summed it up bluntly in testimony before \na Senate committee 2 years ago: ``Microgravity is of microimportance.''\n  How is it we know so much more here? After all, we are throwing $2.1 \nbillion of the taxpayers' money at this project every year, and you saw \nthe figures and where we are headed-- $94 billion today, Lord knows how \nmany billions ultimately.\n  I think there is an assumption, says one physicist, that any program \nthat spends $15 billion per year is bound to produce something that \nsociety can use, but few of NASA's claims stand up. Indeed, an interim \nNASA study of technology transfer which became public in January \nacknowledged that NASA spinoff claims were exaggerated. That is an in-\nhouse memo that NASA's claims were exaggerated, including such famous \nexamples as Velcro, Tang, and Teflon. Contrary to popular belief, the \nstudy found NASA created none of these. They merely publicized them.\n  Here is what Carl Sagan said: ``A space station is far from an \noptimum platform for doing science.'' And the Space Sciences Board said \nit ``sees no scientific need for this space station during the next 20 \nyears,'' and went ahead to say, ``Continued development of Space \nStation Freedom . . . cannot be supported on scientific grounds.''\n  Mr. President, I have two or three other scientists I will quote and \nthen I will turn it back to the managers of the bill. Incidentally, I \nlistened yesterday and I listened again today to all these gigantic, \nfrankly, highly specious, spurious claims about how we will find a cure \nfor this and a cure for that. If the doctors in the scientific \ncommunity say that is hogwash, who are we to question them? Somebody to \nkeep a few jobs in our State.\n  Here is what Dr. Rosenthal said on cancer research:\n\n       Statements have been made and published to the effect that \n     vital cancer research would be done in space, and that is \n     cited as a reason for supporting space station funding. We \n     cannot find valid scientific justification for these claims \n     and believe it is unrealistic to base a decision on funding \n     the space station on that information . . . Based on the \n     information we have seen thus far, we do not agree that a \n     strong case has been made for choosing to do cancer \n     research in space over critically needed cancer research \n     here on earth.\n\n  That was David Rosenthal, Harvard Medical School, testifying on \nbehalf of the American Cancer Society.\n  Dr. Shaun Ruddy, on behalf of the Arthritis Foundation:\n\n       Space station proponents have indicated that the Space \n     Station . . . will provide a ``first class'' laboratory . . . \n     We used to have ``first class'' laboratories in universities \n     and medical schools across the country . . . Reports by the \n     National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation \n     have indicated that over 51 percent of the biological \n     laboratory research is deemed inadequate for the conduct of \n     research . . . Furthermore, the National Science Foundation \n     report estimated that the capital construction backlog is \n     approximately $12 billion . . . Should our priorities now be \n     a ``first class'' laboratory in space, or correction of a \n     longstanding deficiency in laboratories throughout this \n     Nation?\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I bring to the Senator's attention that it is 12:10.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I appreciate the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. My question is, does the Senator wish to continue \nbefore we adjourn at 12:30?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I apologize for going longer than I intended. I was \nhaving such a good time. As I told the Senator earlier, I do have a \nlittle thing I need to tend to during the noon hour. Let me just \nsuggest I be permitted to leave while people on your side speak on the \nother side of this issue, and then perhaps we can rejoin the issue \naround 2:30 after the caucuses.\n  However, I understand there may be something else coming up.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I bring to the Senator's attention that at 2:15, the \nSenate will go to consideration of military construction. Upon \ncompletion of that, we will return to the bill.\n  Perhaps before the Senator leaves for his other Senate commitment, \nyou and I can talk about that.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am delighted to do that. I am sure we can reach an \nagreement on a time certain to vote and even a wrap-up time for each \nside, if that is possible.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We would like very much to be able to do that for the \nSenator. We go to MilCon at 2:15 for 30 minutes, and from there we will \nfirst have a vote on MilCon. Then we resume consideration of the bill. \nAt such time, I believe Senator Wellstone wishes to talk about \ncompelling needs of veterans, and you have to be in an agricultural \nmarkup. We wonder if then around 4 o'clock, you could go to wrap-up and \nwe could have a vote?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me suggest we agree on this without getting a formal \nagreement. That we start on this again at 4 o'clock, and I promise, \nsay, 15 minutes would do me to wrap it up, maybe 15 minutes on your \nside, and we could vote at 4:30.\n  Mr. BOND. If my colleagues will yield, first, let me enter into the \nRecord a unanimous consent to go to the MilCon measure, so we will get \nthat, and we can have that taken care of, and then I will speak with \nthe proponent of the amendment, my ranking member, and I hope we can \nwork out an accommodation acceptable to him.\n\n\n                 Unanimous Consent Agreement--H.R. 2016\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 today \nthe Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar 117, H.R. 2016, the \nmilitary construction appropriations bill. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the committee amendments and the manager's amendment be \nagreed to, no other amendments be in order to the bill, there be 20 \nminutes for debate equally divided in the usual form, with an \nadditional 10 minutes under the control of Senator McCain. I finally \nask unanimous consent that at the expiration or yielding back of time, \nthe bill be read the third time, and the Senate proceed to a vote on \npassage of H.R. 2016.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that immediately following passage, \nthe Senate then insist on its amendment and request a conference with \nthe House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part \nof the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BOND. I further ask unanimous consent that Floyd DesChamps, a \ndetailee from the Department of Energy, with the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee, be given access to the floor during the \nSenate discussions on the VA-HUD-independent agencies appropriations \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 944\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, if the ranking member will accommodate me, I \nwill make just a few remarks in opposition to the amendment and then we\n\n[[Page S7809]]\n\nwill attempt to establish a timeframe for further proceedings on this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, we have had a very eloquent statement by the Senator \nfrom Arkansas about questions that have been raised about the \ninternational space station. Needless to say, this question has been \naddressed time and time again on this floor. There are those scientists \nwho have questions and objections. Nevertheless, the vast body, I \nthink, of scientific knowledge and scientific expertise indicates that \nthe space station is a tremendous opportunity for us to expand our \nknowledge not only about space but to develop new processes, new \npharmaceuticals, medical advancements, and items that can be of \ntremendous benefit for us here on Earth.\n  Yesterday, for example, I note that the distinguished Senator from \nOhio, our only space astronaut-Senator, talked at some length about the \ntremendous number of advances in scientific knowledge that have come \nfrom exploration in space. The bioreactor produces artificial human \ntissue potentially useful in treating colon and prostate cancer, \nproduction of kidney tissue and the cartilage tissue for implants. \nFluid physics, which can be observed in space, help us understand the \nprocesses on Earth, such as how the soil behaves during earthquakes. \nThere is research in microgravity to develop new pharmaceuticals and \nneurological research, important to patients with multiple sclerosis. \nThe list goes on and on, and I will not go into that here because there \nare a number of other Senators who have expertise in this area who wish \nto be heard on the measure.\n  Let me say that the international space station will be a world-class \nscientific laboratory, with the unique feature of a near-zero gravity \nenvironment. While it is impossible for us to know in advance, all of \nthe results of this scientific research, I think the vast body of \nscientific expertise believes that microgravity research will lead to \nnew and pure pharmaceuticals, medical advancements, and the production \nof new materials for use here on Earth.\n  With the imminent demise of Russia's Mir space station, the \ninternational space station will be the only facility where these types \nof research can be permitted.\n  The international space station will also provide operational \nexperience necessary for operating lunar outposts on Mars bases if and \nwhen the Nation should decide to proceed with such bold plans.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, the international space station is a \nhallmark of international cooperation between the United States and \nother countries. Europe, Japan, and Canada have been involved with the \nprogram since its inception, and the addition of Russia in 1993 \nenhanced the international participation. There is no greater symbol of \nthe end of the cold war than the United States and Russia--arch rivals \nin space for decades--working together to build a space station for the \n21st century.\n  Despite the challenges the program has had to overcome in the past \nyear--particularly the schedule delays resulting from Russia's failure \nto complete the service module on time--the space station partnership \nremains intact.\n  Russia has faced great financial troubles and uncertainties, and it \nis impossible to say that all these troubles are in the past. But this \nspring the Russian Government, though strapped financially, fulfilled \nits promise to provide 800 billion rubles, and NASA reports that work \nis progressing on the service module.\n  American taxpayers have invested significantly--$19 billion--in the \nspace station. We are now within a year of the first launch, which will \nprovide the benefits and the scientific advancements into that \nresearch. Certainly, this is no time to give up on an experiment that \noffers such potential.\n  The shuttle-Mir program, the first phase of the international space \nstation, is successfully underway. The experiments have led to \nimprovements in the design of the international space station, and we \nhave trained the crews. We are ready for tremendous scientific leaps, \nand I trust that a significant majority of our colleagues, on a \nbipartisan basis, will agree that the money we have invested has been a \nwise investment, not only for science, technology, and the exploration \nof the universe now, but for the developments in the scientific \nadvances that will come tomorrow for our children and our \ngrandchildren, who are fascinated by the opportunities of space. The \nexploration of this frontier can deliver tremendous benefits. This is \nnot the time to abort the mission and say that we have gone nineteen-\ntwentieths, or 95 percent, of the way toward the discovery of a new \nworld and we are going to turn back now.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will once again \noverwhelmingly support the continuation of the space station.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this is, once again, a bipartisan \nagreement that we should continue to fund the space station Freedom. \nThis dazzling scientific endeavor was created under the Reagan \nadministration, sustained under the Bush administration, and maintained \nunder the Clinton administration.\n  Now, why have three Presidents of the United States all supported \nspace station Freedom? They have done it for several reasons. One, \nbecause it accomplished significant science in space. Second, it is a \nmodel for what the new world order will look like in which no one \nnation dominates space, but each nation is best at what it best can do. \nThe United States of America, Canada, Japan, Europe, and now the \nRussian involvement does show what the space program of the future will \nbe. It will be multilateral, multinational cooperation for multiple \ngains.\n  Mr. President, I would like to speak more on why I support the space \nstation Freedom, but I note that on the floor is the Senator from \nArizona. It had been our agreement to let him speak before the \nconference.\n  I want to say, before we break for the party conferences, that there \nis no break in bipartisan support for the space station. We are going \nto ensure that the space station does produce sound science, have \nmaximum international cooperation and, once again, make both our Nation \nand the world proud of what we do. I will have more to say about the \nspace station and why I am an enthusiastic, unabashed, and unrelenting \nsponsor of this later on this afternoon.\n\n  In the meantime, as a courtesy and collegiality to move our bill, I \nyield the floor now and look forward to resuming my comments on the \nspace station later this afternoon.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Senate is making unprecedented \nprogress in considering the appropriations bills for fiscal year 1998. \nWe have completed action on five spending bills, with the expectation \nthat we will finish at least five more prior to the August recess. I \nmust congratulate Chairman Stevens and Senator Inouye, as well as the \nsubcommittee managers of the bills, on their efficient management of \nthese measures on the floor. On this bill, I want to congratulate my \ncolleagues from Missouri and Maryland, Senators Bond and Mikulski, for \nthe outstanding job they have done on this legislation.\n  I don't intend to unduly delay the Senate in completing consideration \nof the pending appropriations measures. But I want to ensure that, in \nour haste to act on these important spending bills, my colleagues are \nfully aware of the funding recommendations that are contained in this \nbill.\n  I don't enjoy returning to the Senate floor for the sixth time in a \nlittle over a week to talk about the wasteful spending in these bills.\n  Mr. President, this is a very important measure. It provides $40 \nbillion to fund programs for our Nation's veterans, who have served \ntheir country and need and deserve our respect and attention. It \ncontains $25 billion for our Nation's housing needs, including low-\nincome housing programs, housing assistance for native Americans, low-\ncost mortgage assistance, housing for the elderly, and much more. It \nprovides funding for our space program, programs to protect and restore \nthe health of the environment, disaster assistance, and the activities \nof many other agencies. This bill totals over $90 billion.\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\n  Yet, at the same time we are struggling to balance the budget and \nadequately fund necessary Federal programs, I find it somewhat \ndisheartening that the committee spent so much time and effort to \nidentify and protect Members' special interest items.\n  Mr. President, I have here a nine-page list of earmarks in this bill \nand the accompanying report--nine pages of set-asides for specific \ninstitutes, centers, projects, and even museums. These projects have \nnot been considered in the normal process of prioritizing among \ncompeting requirements. They have simply been earmarked to receive \nfunds because a Member of this body wanted to bring it home.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at this time this nine-page document of \nobjectionable provisions in the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Objectionable Provisions in S. 1034, the Fiscal

Foundation:\n       Earmarks and directive language:\n       $40 million to support a competitive, merit-based \n     initiative, which may include one or more university-based \n     research center,

which the Committee directs be used only to construct the \n     radar collocated with the Department of Defense ionospheric \n     research site (i.e., the HAARP project in Alaska)\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, what concerns me most is the growing \npractice of earmarking funds for a myriad of projects in the report \nlanguage but then incorporating that report language by reference in \nthe bill itself. For example, on pages 32 and 33, the bill language \nstates:\n\n       Of the amounts made available under this heading, $40 \n     million for the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) to \n     finance a variety of efforts, including those identified in \n     the Senate committee report, that promote economic \n     revitalization that links people to jobs and supportive \n     services.\n\n  The report identifies 17 separate projects, in specific amounts and \nat specific locations, totaling nearly $30 million. The effect of this \nbill language is to require HUD to spend three-fourths of this economic \ndevelopment money for these particular projects without any assessment \nof the relative needs of the communities which would benefit from these \nprojects compared with many other American communities. This is a very \nbad practice, Mr. President. It is one of the worst that I have seen in \na long time.\n  Another section of the bill incorporates a similar list of earmarks \ninto the bill language. On page 62, the bill reads:\n\n       . . . $82 million for making grants for the construction of \n     wastewater and water treatment facilities and groundwater \n     protection infrastructure in accordance with the terms and \n     conditions specified for such grants in the report \n     accompanying this Act. . . . \n\n  It just so happens that the only terms and conditions contained in \nthe report are earmarks for particular projects for the entire $82 \nmillion set aside in the bill. Again, this is back-door earmarking and \nit's the worst form of pork barrel spending that I have seen in a long \ntime.\n  As I have said, this bill also contains earmarks for museums, \nparticularly, $7.1 million for the Jazz Museum and the Negro Leagues \nBaseball Museum in Kansas City, MO.\n  The bill also earmarks $150 million for water and waterwaste \nfacilities along the United States-Mexico border. While this earmark \ncould conceivably benefit my own State of Arizona, I cannot understand \nwhy we cannot, instead, provide funding based on need and established \ncriteria, rather than setting aside millions of dollars for certain \nStates or areas of the country.\n  The report is replete with earmarks. One of the most interesting \nreads as follows:\n\n       $600,000 for the final year of funding for the solar \n     aquatic wastewater treatment demonstration in Burlington, VT, \n     to be cost-shared by the participants.\n\n  Get this, Mr. President:\n\n       The Committee does not intend to recommend funding for \n     additional solar aquatic wastewater treatment demonstrations \n     in view of EPA's assessment that this technology does not \n     appear to offer any economic advantages over conventional \n     technologies.\n\n  So we are going to spend $600,000 more on a project where, in EPA's \nassessment, the technology doesn't offer any economic advantages over \nconventional technologies. It seems a little bit ridiculous to me.\n  Mr. President, I won't go through the nine-page list I mentioned, but \nthere are some fascinating earmarks in here. I will tell you, it's \nreally interesting. Here is $1 million for renovation of the Paramount \nTheater in Vermont. It urges or encourages the Veterans' Administration \nto consider establishing or expanding community-based outpatient \nclinics in Vermont, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, and southern and \nwestern Maryland. You are going to have to help me out here, Mr. \nPresident. Why not in Maine, California, or Texas? Instead, it is \nencouraging the VA to establish expanding community-based outpatient \nclinics in Vermont, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, southern and western \nMaryland. The only thing I can say is in common there is that they are \nlow-growth States. Why would we not want to establish or expand \noutpatient clinics in high-growth States--Nevada, California, Texas, or \nArizona? I don't know. I don't understand.\n\n  Mr. President, we don't want to do these things. I think, as I have \nsaid on many different occasions, it doesn't help us with the American \npeople, and we waste millions of taxpayer dollars on projects that \nserve our own narrow interests rather than those of the Nation at \nlarge. It makes it harder for us to whittle away at the $5.3 trillion \ndebt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I know the order was for the Senate to \nadjourn at 12:30.

Mr. President, last week, my friend Tim Hutchinson, the \nSenator from Arkansas, took the floor to lend his voice to a growing \nchorus of disapproval over the state of United States-China relations. \nI commend him for his actions. While his efforts to pass a sense of the \nSenate resolution against most favored nation status for China were \nunsuccessful, his actions were the very essence of what it means to be \na leader. He set out to achieve noble aspirations, and then dedicated \nhis energies to achieve those objectives. Leadership is ascertaining \nnoble objectives and working hard, intently and sacrificially. Such \nefforts push us toward our highest and best. The highest and best to \nwhich Senator Hutchinson called us is an end to which we must all \naspire.\n  Teddy Roosevelt said it this way:\n\n       Far better is it to dare mighty things, to win glorious \n     triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank \n     with those poor spirits who neither enjoy much nor suffer \n     much because they live in the gray twilight that knows \n     neither victory nor defeat.\n\n  Twenty-two Members of the Senate had the courage to say that the \ntainted flow of Western currency into China must end, not because the \nexchange of goods between sovereign nations is injurious, but because \nwe have in China today a ruthless regime that does not deserve \nunfettered access to United States markets, a regime whose brutal \nrepression at home betrays its intentions abroad.\n  America is a place that has cared always for what Thomas Paine called \nthe ``rights of man.'' The United States has always been a country that \ngave no quarter to tyranny or tyrants. Teddy Roosevelt put it a bit \ndifferently, cautioning that America must not become ``an assemblage of \nwell-to-do hucksters who care nothing for what happens beyond.''\n  But, Mr. President, does not the vote on the Hutchinson amendment \nsuggest that Teddy Roosevelt's worst fears are being realized? For the \nmessage being sent from China today is as unmistakable as it is \ndisturbing. Beijing believes that life is cheap and cheaper still when \nthat life opposes the authoritarian rule of the Communist Party.\n  The State Department, in its most recent human rights report, states \nthat ``all public dissent against the party and government was \neffectively silenced'' in China. ``No dissidents were known to be \nactive at year's end.'' Beijing has used imprisonment, exile, and \nsummary execution to quiet the voices of those who cry for freedom.\n  China's 1982 Constitution guarantees the freedom of speech, the \npress, and religious belief. And yet, the hollowness of that document \nbecomes more apparent with every passing day. Chinese authorities \nroutinely resort to torture, the denial of due process, forced \nconfessions, prison labor, and extrajudicial killings to crush Chinese \ncitizens who stand up for liberty and defy Beijing.\n  As Nina Shea notes in ``The Lion's Den,'' China has more Christians \nin prison because of religious activities than any other nation. This \nmorning's New York Times detailed a State Department report due to be \nissued today--and I have a copy of it here--which is sharply critical \nof Beijing's efforts to suppress religious worship. The\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\nreport, which is entitled, ``U.S. Policy in Support of Religious \nFreedom,'' says, ``The Government of China has sought to restrict all \nactual religious practice to government-subsidized religious \norganizations and registered places of worship.''\n  The report goes on to detail the story of four underground Roman \nCatholic bishops who have been imprisoned or detained. They are not \nalone. Many other Catholic priests, the Times notes, ``have been \nsearched by government agents and their religious articles have been \nseized.''\n  Consider the case of Bishop Su. Hung from the ceiling by his wrists, \nSu was battered time and again about the head until all but \nunconscious. He was then placed in a cell filled with water where he \nwas left for days unable to sit or to sleep. His high crime? His \ntreason? A fidelity to God and a desire to exercise that devotion.\n  It is true that the official Catholic Church in China is registered \nwith the Government and claims as many as 4 million members. However, \nthe official church does not recognize the authority of the Pope, so \nall Vatican-affiliated Catholics are viewed by Beijing as unregistered. \nMoreover, as the State Department report suggests, ``Communist Party \nofficials state that party membership and religious belief are \nincompatible,'' placing a serious limitation on believers.\n  And who, Mr. President, will denounce the mounting persecutions of \nChristians in China? The administration has not made a sound. Well, I \nwould respectfully remind them that to sin by silence when one should \nprotest makes cowards out of all men.\n\n  America must not trade civil liberty for the false idol of foreign \ncommerce. We must be willing not just to sound historic, but we must \npursue policies which are historically sound. We must be willing to \ncondemn religious persecution both in China and around the world.\n  The disturbing trends revealed in the State Department report due \ntoday are not without precedent. In June 1996, the Far Eastern Economic \nReview reported that ``Chinese police had destroyed at least 15,000 \nunregistered temples, churches and tombs'' in the Zheijang province \nalone in just 5 months. Those church leaders who dared to resist were \ntortured, beaten, and killed.\n  Is it any wonder then that the future of Hong Kong has been the \nsubject of great concern. At the beginning of this month, all eyes were \nturned toward the British colony as it reverted to Chinese control. I \nsincerely hope that our eyes will remain focused there, for constant \nvigilance is the key to exposing and resisting Chinese encroachment on \nfreedom in the former colony.\n  Although China wants Hong Kong to remain a vibrant financial center \nand serve as an example for unification with Taiwan, Beijing has not \nhesitated to undermine Hong Kong's political autonomy in spite of its \npledge in the 1984 joint declaration to honor one country, two systems.\n  China has declared the elected Hong Kong Legislature invalid and has \nappointed a hand-picked provisional legislative body. China's appointed \nchief executive of Hong Kong, Tung Chee-hwa, promises that new \nelections will be held in 1998 but has drawn the electoral districts to \nlimit the influence of Martin Lee's Democratic Party.\n  Mr. Tung has recently unveiled new measures to restrict civil \nliberties in Hong Kong. Public protests will have to receive prior \napproval and could be banned to protect so-called ``national \nsecurity.'' Political organizations will be required to register with \nthe government and prohibited from seeking or receiving funds from \noverseas sources. Under Tung's definition, international organizations \nthat expose China's human rights abuses will also be banned from \nreceiving foreign funds.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's Hong Kong policy has been about \nself-preservation rather than promoting self-government. Political \nactivist Martin Lee got a hero's welcome on Capitol Hill, but the \nadministration met only reluctantly with Lee. Vice President Gore \nconveniently forgot Hong Kong on his recent trip to China, and much to \nthe dismay of Martin Lee and other Hong Kong Democrats, Consul General \nRichard Boucher attended the inaugural ceremony of China's hand-picked \nlegislature--the legislature which replaced the freely elected body \nthat Martin Lee had worked so hard to preserve.\n  Mr. President, the preservation of liberty for the 6.3 million people \nin Hong Kong is about more than the immediate fate of its residents. \nThe battle for civil liberty in Hong Kong could very well be the battle \nfor civil liberty in China. As George Will has written, China has just \nswallowed ``a radioactive isotope'' of Western culture in taking over \nHong Kong. Hong Kong serves as a shining example of democracy and free \nmarket economics, and the effective removal of that model would set \nback the march of freedom in China.\n  In a world that is increasingly open and free, there still exist \ntotalitarian governments which cling to political repression and deny \ntheir people the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and property. \nBeijing claims that the Chinese people are more concerned about social \ncohesion and domestic order than the growth of civil liberty--that \nWestern democracy is a Western phenomenon and not necessarily \napplicable to China, that it is somehow foreign to Far Eastern culture.\n  But what does Beijing think about the growth of democracy in Taiwan, \nJapan, and South Korea? How do China's leaders explain away the deaths \nof perhaps thousands of students who were willing to risk everything \nfor liberty in Tiananmen Square? How does Beijing respond to heroes \nlike Wei Jingsheng and Harry Wu who continue to fight against \noppression in spite of intimidation, imprisonment, and torture? \nTroublingly, Beijing cannot answer these questions. Tragically, these \nare questions that the West is often afraid to ask.\n\n  Mr. President, I look forward to a U.S. foreign policy that calls the \ncommunity of nations to their highest and best. America for her part \nmust be willing to stand for freedom as she has since her first days. \nWhen the Chinese people eventually rid themselves of Beijing's \ntyrannical leadership and embrace democracy, just as South Korea, \nJapan, and Taiwan have done before them, let it be said that America \nstood with them, stood with them and for them in their cause for \nfreedom.\n  Despite the troubling revelations of the State Department report and \nthe defeat of the Hutchinson amendment last week, I believe that we \nmust continue to press on. Teddy Roosevelt was right; it is hard to \nfail but it is worse never to have tried to succeed. The right of man \nto strive, to seek, to find and not to yield is at the core of what \nindividual liberty and dignity means, and it is at the core of the \nvalues we regard highly in America. It is a message of hope and calls \nthis country to its highest and best. It is a message that America must \nproclaim if the coming century is to be defined by the growth of \nliberty and not surrendered to those who would stifle freedom.\n  China has been abusive to its own citizens and signals an ominous \ncloud over the Far East, a cloud whose poison could spread well beyond \nits own borders and taint the opportunity for freedom around the world. \nChina's total disregard for religious liberty, China's contempt for the \nliberty of individuals in the political system, and China's willingness \nto require the registration of religious groups whose members would \nworship God freely without subservience to the government, signals to \nus the need for America to stand up clearly--not as an enemy to the \nChinese but as a friend of those people who seek liberty from tyrants.\n  I believe the Chinese people seek liberty and will respond \nconstructively to freedom just as people around the world have wherever \nthe grace of freedom has been made available to them. The United States \ncan no longer suggest that we might cease to be the city on a hill \nwhose light is a beacon for freedom. We have a responsibility to \nmaintain the commitment to freedom that those who began this Nation \nhad, and I submit that it is time for us to signal our commitment to \nfreedom clearly and unmistakably to those who would enter the community \nof nations. China seeks and wants to enter that community, and the \nUnited States must speak clearly to China about the rights of man we \nhave always defended. I think it is time for the United States to have \nits voice heard and to be a contributor to the cause of liberty and \nfreedom around the globe.\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7812-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I watched the news last night with a great \ndeal of distress. Our Nation is in a situation that is intolerable with \nour long and faithful friend to our North. I don't quite understand the \ncrux of the situation but I will become familiar with it and the \nhistory that has brought us to this inexcusable and terrible \nconfrontation, that now exists on the west coast of British Columbia.\n  I have been occupied with the death of my mother and have been \nsomewhat out of the loop of events and the deterioration of the \nrelationship on our west coast. I knew there were circumstances which \nwas causing friction among the fishing fleets of both the United States \nand Canada. The salmon runs have been of historic proportions in our \nAlaskan waters but as one works to the south toward the coast of Canada \nand the lower west coast of the United States, the runs are not as \ngood.\n  A year ago, when the American-Canadian Inner-Parliamentary Meeting \nwas held on the Alaskan coast while traveling from Prince Rupert, \nBritish Columbia, to Skagway, Alaska, there were discussions of the \nsituation but there was no resolution. Both the Members of the Canadian \nParliament and the Members of the American Congress were reluctant to \ndig deeper into the situation. Now we have a full-fledged crisis on our \nhands and it is separated from this Nation or Canada by an ocean. It is \nhere and it is serious.\n  Canadian subjects held an American flag ship by barricading it. That \nis a vessel that sails a regular schedule from Seattle to the coastal \nports of Canada and Alaska. It was held along with all passengers, \ncargo, and United States mail aboard. I am outraged any action of this \nkind was allowed to exist in this hemisphere. If it were any other \nplace on this planet, this Government and all Americans would have been \noutraged. No other place would this Nation allow this kind of action to \nhappen.\n  I was outraged when I saw the American flag burned by one, I assume, \nbarricading the vessel. I, for one in this body, demand the Government \nof Canada deal with this situation and with those who would have a \ncomplete disrespect for the flag of this Nation. It is the single most \npowerful symbol of the free world. I would hope no citizen in this \ncountry would ever do any repulsive act to the national colors of our \nfriends in Canada. We should not nor shall not retaliate in such \nfashion. We should, however, focus on this situation and get it settled \nas honorable nations do.\n  I cannot believe this administration has not taken action earlier to \ndefuse this confrontation. I live in Montana and the relationship \nbetween Alberta and Montana has been one of great respect and \nfriendship. Yes, that relationship is strained from time to time. But, \nthat is to be expected among neighbors. But, never has our respect for \neach other ever been reduced to the actions now being displayed at Port \nRupert, British Columbia, as we speak.\n  I plead with the President to get personally involved with the \nleaders of Canada and work it out and not let this wound fester and \nbecome uncontrollable. Our long and deep friendship with Canada is at \nstake and it is serious.\n  I plan to appeal to the Foreign Relations Committee of the United \nStates Senate to look into this and would hope there is resolve within \nthis body to deal with it and find a solution acceptable to Canada and \nthe United States.\n  I appeal to both the Foreign Relations Committee and the President. \nPlease do not stand idly by while someone burns my flag and barricades \nmy ship. I do not plan to take this lightly and I also appeal strongly \nto the leaders of Canada to take actions that would defuse the \nconfrontation and deal harshly with those who show no respect for \neither their own country or the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7814-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7814-S7821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, each manager will \nhave control of 10 minutes for debate time followed by a rollcall vote.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Kelly \nHartline, an Appropriations Committee staff member, be granted the \nprivilege of the floor during consideration of this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate the \nmilitary construction appropriation bill and report for fiscal year \n1998. This bill reflects the bipartisan approach that the ranking \nmember, Senator Murray of Washington, and I have tried to maintain \nregarding military construction and this subcommittee. It has been a \npleasure to work with Senator Murray, her staff, and the members of the \nsubcommittee throughout this process. I very much appreciate all of \ntheir support.\n  Mr. President, this bill was reported out of the full Appropriations \nCommittee last Thursday by a unanimous vote of 28 to 0. The bill \nrecommended by the full Committee on Appropriations is for \n$9,182,900,000. This is $799 million over the budget request and almost \nequal to the corresponding House bill. The bill provides $610 million \nless than what was appropriated last year--a reduction of 6 percent in \noverall spending authority for the committee from fiscal year 1997. \nFurther, the bill reflects a reduction of 21 percent since fiscal year \n1996--almost $2 billion less from just 2 years ago.\n  We have sought to recommend a balanced bill to the Senate, and we \nbelieve it addresses key, military construction requirements for \nreadiness, family housing, barracks, quality of life and the Guard and \nReserve components. This bill honors the commitment we have to our \nArmed Forces. It helps ensure that the housing and infrastructure needs \nof the military are given proper recognition. Also, I am pleased to \nreport to the Senate that the bill is within the committee's 602(b) \nbudget allocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  Mr. President, this bill has some points I want to mention. We added \n$152 million to provide better and more modern family housing for our \nservice personnel and their families. On another quality of life \nmeasure, we have added substantially to the budget request for medical \nand hospital facilities, increasing the request by almost 50 percent. \nWe have provided $660 million for barracks construction to provide \nsingle service members a more favorable living environment. The \ncommittee also fully funds the budget request of $104 million for \nfunding 24 class I violation environmental projects.\n\n  We also addressed the shortfalls that continue to plaque our Reserve \ncomponents. The Department continues to walk away from the total force \nconcept. Recognizing this, we have again lent support by adding $395 \nmillion to the Guard and Reserve accounts. In each case, the funds will \nhelp satisfy essential mission, quality of life or readiness \nrequirements.\n  Mr. President, 22 percent of the bill, or $2.1 billion, is for \ndownsizing defense infrastructure, or better known as the Base \nRealignment and Closure Program. This includes funding for the last \nthree rounds of BRAC. Almost a quarter of all military construction \ndollars goes toward the base closure and realignment process.\n  All of the projects that we have recommended are included in either \nthe Senate- or House-passed versions of the defense authorization \nbills. We will work very closely with the Armed Services Committee, as \nwe put together a conference package for military construction.\n  We have tried to accommodate the sizable administration request for \noverseas projects in such places as Korea, Germany, and the Middle \nEast. Mr. President, 24 percent of the administration's budget request \nfor military construction projects is for overseas areas. This seems \nout of proportion when only about 16 percent of our total force is \nactually stationed overseas. We have funded only the essential of those \nprojects.\n  We are also concerned about the recent decision made at Madrid to \nexpand NATO and the additional costs required to implement that \ndecision. With future defense spending constrained, this expansion has \nthe potential to degrade the U.S. military construction and defense \nprogram seriously. I have requested a detailed report that lays out the \nadditional funding requirements associated with the expansion, \nincluding logistical, communications, construction and other needs \nanticipated for the NATO infrastructure account. This will help us \nunderstand the potential costs to the U.S. taxpayer of NATO expansion.\n  There are many other issues that I could speak about at this time. I \nurge the Members of the Senate to support this bill and move it forward \nexpeditiously.\n  I would say, also, we are finding in the BRAC, or base closures, that \nwe are spending dollars that were unexpected just in environmental \ncleanup. The environmental cost of cleanup of these bases so they could \nbe moved into either contract hands or private hands has been very, \nvery high.\n  So I appreciate my ranking member, the work she has done, and now I \nyield to my ranking member, Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am pleased to recommend this bill to \nthe Senate. The recommended amount, $9.18 billion, is within the 602(b) \nallocation for the Military Construction Subcommittee and is frugal, \nsome $600 million, or 6 percent below last year's appropriated level.\n  Nevertheless, we have added nearly $800 million to the amount \nrequested by the administration, primarily to correct serious \nshortfalls in the budget request for National Guard and Reserve forces, \nand for quality-of-life initiatives in housing and medical care for \nU.S. military personnel.\n  In order to keep our Guard and Reserve forces healthy, we have again, \nas in the past, had to add substantial sums, some $392 million, to an \ninadequate request.\n  As for housing, we have added approximately $152 million for family \nhousing, and despite this increase, we are still about $301 million \nbelow last year's level. The added funds, however, are in the new area \nof housing initiatives known as privatization, whereby\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\nthe money acts as seed capital which is multiplied over some three or \nfour times with infusions of private developer funds, so the funds we \nhave added carry an added punch.\n  On another quality-of-life measure, we have added substantially to \nthe request for medical and hospital facilities, increasing the request \nby nearly 50 percent, for a total of $208 million.\n  These initiatives have been put together in a truly bipartisan \nfashion, in close cooperation with the distinguished chairman, Senator \nBurns and his staff. It is a good product, worthy of strong Senate \nsupport. I appreciate the courtesies that have been extended to me by \nthe chairman and his staff, and believe this close working relationship \nhas created a product which is balanced and fair to all Senators.\n  We appropriated money for nearly all the projects authorized by the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, and have attempted to evaluate and \nsatisfy the requests of all members fairly, and fund worthy projects, \nthrough design or minor construction if they have not been authorized. \nWe have made every effort to include report language that members have \nsuggested to us.\n  We fully funded the BRAC request, some 22 percent of the bill, fully \nfunded environmental projects, and we have tried to accommodate the \nsizable construction request for overseas projects, such as barracks in \nEurope and Korea. Overseas construction constitutes 24 percent of the \noverall construction request.\n  The committee is concerned over the amounts that will be needed for \nadditional costs of NATO expansion, based on the decisions at the \nMadrid summit, and for the funds requested for Southwest Asia \npropositioning of equipment in the nation of Qatar. We have asked for a \nreport on NATO expansion costs by mid-October, hopefully in time for \nthe Senate debate on this matter.\n  We have also asked the administration to execute a burdensharing \nagreement with the Government of Qatar, whose population of 550,000 \npeople enjoy a $21,000 per capita income and has, in fact, offered to \nhelp defray our expenses in our prepositioning program.\n  This legislation is extremely important to our military personnel for \nmany reasons. One of the most important for me is the messages we are \nable to send our active duty personnel serving abroad separated from \nfamily. We are providing for families--housing, day care, community \nsupport facilities--providing for families so our active duty personnel \ncan focus on the task at hand when serving a tour on the U.S.S. Lincoln \nor patrolling near the DMZ in Korea.\n  I am particularly pleased the committee was able to fund several \nauthorized projects in Washington State. At Fairchild Air Force Base, \nwe were able to meet the base's priority need for alterations to the \nfire station and provide moneys for an education center and a library. \nThe committee was able to provide moneys for barracks replacement and a \nmedical/dental clinic at Fort Lewis, and important C-17 facilities at \nMcChord Air Force Base. I do appreciate the committee's willingness to \nbe responsive to the needs of Washington State.\n  I, again, thank the chairman for his help in making this a truly \nbipartisan bill, and I commend staff on both sides of the aisle for \ntheir outstanding professional work on this legislation. I join \nChairman Burns in recommending that the Senate adopt this legislation \nwith strong bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 946\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the availability of funds for activities under the \n lease of building No. 1, Lexington, Blue Grass Station, Lexington, KY)\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senators Ford and McConnell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Burns], for Mr. Ford, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     946.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Sec.   . Section 303(e) of the 1997 Emergency Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act for Recovery from Natural Disasters, and \n     for Overseas Peacekeeping Efforts, Including Those in Bosnia \n     (Public Law 105-18; 111 Stat. 168) is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(e) Availability of Funds.--The Secretary may use funds \n     available in the Defense Working Capital Fund for the payment \n     of the costs of utilities, maintenance and repair, and \n     improvements entered into under the lease under this \n     section.''.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, this amendment will clarify the \navailability of what specific funding sources are available for \nactivities under the lease of facilities at Lexington, Blue Grass \nStation, KY. I believe this amendment has been cleared.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, it has.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do not believe I have seen the \namendment. I ask that action on it be suspended until such time as I, \nor my staff, have had a chance to examine the amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Ron \nMoranville, a fellow on my staff, be granted the privilege of the floor \nduring the remainder of debate on H.R. 2016.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, for 3 straight years now, the Clinton \nadministration has inadequately funded the national security interests \nof this Nation. In response, Congress added slightly more than $20 \nbillion to the defense budget for fiscal years 1996 to 1998, arguing \nthat future readiness would be put at risk if we did not increase \nfunding for military modernization.\n  We did add significant funds to the procurement and R accounts to \nensure that our forces would maintain their current technological edge \nover potential adversaries well into the future. At the same time, \nhowever, we managed to set aside more than 10 percent of the total \ndefense budget add-on over these 3 years, about $2.3 billion for \nunrequested low-priority military construction projects.\n  This year, we added only $2.6 billion to the defense budget, much \nless than in each of the previous years, but then the Appropriations \nCommittee earmarked $800 million of that increase for military \nconstruction add-ons. Almost one-third of the total defense budget \nincrease this year is unrequested and unnecessary.\n  This military construction bill before the Senate today contains \nfunding for unrequested low-priority projects totaling more than $799 \nmillion. These projects were added because Members of this body asked \nfor them. The services did not ask for them. The Department of Defense \ndid not ask for them. But Members wanted funding for these projects in \ntheir States, and the Appropriations Committee gave it to them.\n  I note that the bill sets aside almost $400 million of the overall \nincrease for construction projects for the National Guard and Reserves. \nThe bill includes over $111 million for the construction of 13 \nreadiness and Reserve centers for the Guard and Reserve, at a time when \nGuard and Reserve end strength is being cut by over 54,000 personnel.\n  I wonder what decisionmaking process was used to determine that the \npriorities of the Guard and Reserve for military construction so \ngreatly outweigh the priorities of the active duty military. This bill \ngives the Army National Guard a 500-percent increase in project \nfunding, or $189.5 million in unrequested projects. This decision was \nmade by the committee despite the fact that the Army and the Army Guard \nagreed that the Guard's military construction requirements needed about \n$50 million. I wonder what criteria were used to determine that $50 \nmillion was not enough for the Guard and Reserve and how the add-on of \n$189.5 million was determined.\n  I understand that last year the Appropriations Committee directed the \nArmy to budget $75 million from Army Guard military construction in \nfiscal\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\nyear 1998. I also understand that the Army failed to follow the \ncommittee's direction and request only $45 million for the Army Guard \nmilitary construction budget. Does this then justify a 500-percent \nincrease in Army Guard construction funding?\n  In addition to the excessive amount of add-ons in this bill, the \nreport contains earmarks for the following projects: $1.4 million to \nprovide refrigeration equipment and improvements at the Fort \nWainwright, AK, skating facility; $300,000 for the design of a \ncentralized vehicle wash facility at Fort Wainwright, AK; $2 million \nfor the design of the Saddle Road improvement in Hawaii; $550,000 for a \nlibrary and adult education center at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, \nNC; $3.1 million for planning and design of an intelligence center in \nCharlottesville, VA; $470,000 for design of a warfighting center at the \nStennis Space Center in Mississippi.\n  I find it startling that Members are no longer content with \nearmarking actual construction projects. We now have begun the \nunfortunate process of earmarking portions of the planning and design \nmoney which has traditionally been provided in a lump sum to be used at \nthe discretion and prioritization of the services.\n  Where will this earmarking stop? I note, without further comment, the \nfive States receiving the largest share of these construction add-ons: \nMississippi, $58.4 million; Virginia, $48.1 million; Alabama, $37 \nmillion; Kentucky, $33.1 million; and New Mexico, $32.3 million. This \nbill even includes an add-on for Arizona.\n  Finally, I point out that this bill, like many others that have come \nbefore the Senate in the past week, contains restrictive Buy America \nprovisions which limit awards of contracts to U.S. companies only. \nThese two sections, 111 and 112, of the bill are anticompetitive and \nwill ensure that U.S. taxpayers do not get the best price, in many \ninstances, because foreign firms will not be able to compete with U.S. \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate add-ons in the \nmilitary construction bill list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                      SENATE ADD-ONS TO THE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS BILL, 1998                     \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                In millions     \n         State and installation                       Project title              Budget  -----------------------\n                                                                                 request   Change   Appropriated\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama:                                                                                                        \n  Redstone Arsenal......................

Mr. President, in closing, let me say I am sure there are \nmany good projects on this list. Many projects will serve to improve \nthe quality of life of our military personnel and will provide \nfacilities improvements that will enhance mission readiness, but the \nreal reason these projects are funded in this bill is that they provide \neconomic benefit to certain States. Even with the congressionally \nmandated increases in the defense budget, military training exercises \ncontinue to be cut, backlogs in aircraft and ship maintenance are \ngrowing, flying-hours shortfalls still exists, military health care is \nunderfunded by $600 million and 11,787 service members are reportedly \non food stamps and many more are eligible for food stamps, Mr. \nPresident. We simply have higher priorities for defense spending and \npork-barrel construction projects.\n  There are many stories that are illustrative of our need for spending \non priority items, and this kind of earmarking is really harming the \nmen and women in the military. Over the weekend, there was a story in \nthe Washington Post about enlisted sailors who are stationed in San \nDiego who now live in Mexico. They have to drive to Mexico because \nthere is not affordable housing or base housing for them in San Diego, \nyet, we will fund these projects that are on this list. At the same \ntime, there are 11,787 service members who are on food stamps and \nthousands more eligible, and we will instead fund these kinds of \nprojects.\n  Mr. President, it is not an admirable practice that we are seeing \ncontinued and even increase over the years. I intend very strongly to \nurge the President of the United States to exercise the line-item veto \non some of these projects because there is no more compelling reason \nfor the line-item veto than some of the projects that I have talked \nabout today. I will be engaged in urging him to do so.\n  I yield the floor, but before I yield the floor, I would like to take \na look at the amendment and any other amendments that will be proposed \nat this time on the bill. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, in response to Senator McCain, there are \nover 891,000 men and women in uniform who serve in one of the six \nReserve organizations. They represent 38 percent of the total force.\n  For these Reserve forces, the President's budget request contained a \ntotal of $173 million--less than 2 percent of the total military \nconstruction bill allocated to the Reserve components.\n  More specifically, the National Guard military construction program \nsupports over 474,673 soldiers and airmen in communities throughout the \nNation. They constitute approximately 20 percent of our total Armed \nForces and represent all 50 States and 4 territories.\n  The units and the missions of the Reserve components have changed \nsignificantly in the last 30 to 40 years. The mission and the equipment \nis much more complex and requires larger working bays and parking \nareas. The increased lethality and range of modern weapons restrict \nindirect firing ranges and training areas and creates new requirements \nnecessary to ensure safety.\n  The Army Guard alone has more than 23,360 facilities, with a current \nplant replacement value of $17.3 billion. Over 50 percent of these \nfacilities are inadequate by current Army criteria. There is a \nconstruction backlog of $2.3 billion, which as a direct impact on \nmodernization and readiness.\n  The Pentagon requested only $45 million for the Army National Guard \nfor military construction in the fiscal year 1998 budget. There are \n367,000 soldiers in the Army National Guard--$45 million does not go \nvery far in meeting their mission and quality of life requirements.\n  If the Congress did not act to provide additional military \nconstruction funding to the Reserve components each year, these forces \nwould be severely handicapped as far as their ability to achieve full \noperational capability and their objective readiness level. Just \nbecause a project is for the Guard or Reserve does not mean it is not \nmeritorious, it signifies that the Pentagon has decided to let the \nCongress foot the bill for building and maintaining the Reserve \ncomponents' infrastructure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under a previous agreement, the Senator from \nArizona has 2 minutes, 15 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has yielded back his time.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 946\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, the amendment that is now under \nconsideration has been cleared on the Democratic side, and I ask that \nit be accepted at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 946.\n  The amendment (No. 946) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask for third reading of the bill. Have \nthe yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have not been requested on \nfinal passage.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I wonder if the Chairman of the Military Construction \nSubcommittee, Senator Burns, would yield for a question.\n  Mr. BURNS. Certainly.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I appreciate all that the chairman has done to \naccommodate the specific needs of military installations in New York. \nAs you know, New York has been devastated by its losses from the last \ntwo BRAC rounds. However, the one positive effect of this paring down \nis that the remaining bases in New York are among the most efficient \nand effective in the world. That is why these military construction \ndollars are so important to New York State.\n  One military base of particular concern to both Senator Moynihan and \nmyself is Fort Drum in Watertown, NY. Fort Drum is home to the 10th \nMountain Division. The mission of the 10th Mountain Division is to \ndeploy rapidly anywhere in the world and be prepared to fight and win \nupon arrival.\n  The 10th Mountain Division stands ready to depart Fort Drum and \nconduct operations anywhere in the world with minimal notice. The \ncornerstone to Fort Drum's preparedness is its high state of mission \nreadiness. This readiness is sustained through intensive training and \nthe most up-to-date, modern facilities.\n  America continually asks our soldiers around the world to respond and \nthey are always there for us. The 10th Mountain Division is the most \nfrequently deployed division in the Army. It is only fair that Congress \nappropriate the necessary dollars to ensure that our troops remain the \nbest in the world.\n  Fort Drum has requested two very important projects that would \ngreatly enhance readiness on the base and contribute to the 10th \nMountain Division's extremely high response time. The first is an \naerial gunnery range, funded at $17.5 million in the House. The \nproposed range will be an adequately sized and properly configured \naerial gunnery range for Army rotary wing and Air National Guard fixed \nwing joint mission requirements. The facility and range area will \nenable the Air National Guard and Fort Drum range division to employ \noperations under the joint air attack team concept [JAAT] as well as \nconsolidate existing operations to the northeast side of Fort Drum \nproperty for safe operations. Currently, rotary wing and fixed wing \noperations are conducted on separate sites across the Fort Drum \ninstallation.\n  The second project is a military training and education center, \nfunded at $6.9 million, to replace a number of widely scattered \ntemporary 50-year old, inefficient and marginal World War II wood \nfacilities.\n  The center would make a valuable contribution to improving quality of \nlife for soldiers, dependents and civilians at Fort Drum. Without the \ncenter, the condition of aging facilities will become less able to \nsupport the function and eventually continuing education opportunities \nfor the population of Fort Drum will be negatively impacted. Last year, \nthe Senate included this project in its version of the fiscal year 1997 \ndefense authorization bill.\n  I would hope that the House--Senate Conference Committee would \ninclude both of these important projects in the final conference report \nfor fiscal year 1998.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, my friend and colleague, Senator \nD'Amato, has clearly set out the reasons why Fort Drum needs these two \nprojects. They are essential to the training and readiness we and the \nArmy have come to expect from the 10th Mountain Division. It seems \nwhenever there has been a deployment in recent years, the 10th has been \npart of it. I simply add my support and my hope that the gunnery range \nand the training and education center will be included when the Senator \nfrom Montana and his conferees reach an agreement on military \nconstruction projects.\n  Mr. BURNS. I can assure both Senators from New York that both \nprojects will be given every due consideration when the conferees meet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7814-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7821-S7823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               PROTECTING THE FUTURE OF PICATINNY ARSENAL\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nFiscal Year 1998 military construction appropriations bill, and would \nlike to take this opportunity to thank Chairman Burns and Ranking \nMember Murray for all of their leadership and hard work on this \nlegislation. I am especially pleased by two items which were included \nin this bill. First, the $1.3 million which will be spent on the design \nof a new software engineering center at Picatinny Arsenal in my home \nState of New Jersey, and second, language in the bill which urges the \nArmy to place the construction of the center on its priority list for \nfiscal year 1999. I am hopeful that the Army will heed the advice of \nthe Senate, and make this project a priority for next year.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, Picatinny Arsenal has provided our \nmen and women with the high-technology weapons that have helped\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\nachieve our military victories. Most recently, during Desert Storm our \nforces unleashed millions of M-77 submunitions on the Iraqi Army with \ndevastating results. This grenade-like weapon uses a precision guidance \nsystem and a mini-computer to locate its target as it descends on a \nparachute-like device, before it attacks and destroys it. The Iraqis \nwere so terrified of this weapons, that they dubbed it Steel Rain. I am \nproud to say that this weapon was developed by some of this Nation's \nfinest scientists and engineers at Picatinny Arsenal.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, Picatinny Arsenal is home to the \nArmy Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center [ARDEC]. \nVirtually every piece of weaponry and ammunition in the hands of our \nsoldiers is developed at Picatinny. In fact, Picatinny is responsible \nfor 90 percent of the Army's lethality.\n  Currently, the Fire Support Armaments Center [FSAC], which conducts \nthe research, development, and engineering for weapons systems such as \nartillery, mortars, and the technology behind the fire control for the \nentire U.S. Army, has its functions dispersed at several facilities \nthroughout the base. While our Armed Forces in general, and the Army in \nparticular, have been subject to drastic downsizing in the post-cold-\nwar era, the Fire Support Armaments Center workload has increased as \nour modern army relies increasingly on ``smart'' weapon technology. \nHowever, while the Center is responsible for a critical area of \nexpertise in our national security plan, its economic and productive \neffectiveness is severely limited because its operations are dispersed \nthroughout the base. This, combined with the limited space available, \nmakes work on the larger vehicles like tanks and armored personnel \ncarriers impossible in all but the best of weather conditions and makes \ncoordination on the many different components of any given project \nnearly impossible.\n  To remedy this, a new software engineering center has been proposed \nwhich would consolidate many of the Arsenal's operations, thus allowing \nwork on these vehicles to proceed year round and enhancing Picatinny's \ncapability to test and upgrade ``smart'' weapons. The proposed Software \nEngineering Center would also provide the Army with the ability to \nupgrade-technologically existing weapons systems, respond rapidly to \nproblems encountered in the field, and save the Pentagon money. The \nArmy estimates that this consolidation will also save $5 million a \nyear, allowing the project to pay for itself in 3 years. I am pleased \nby the Senate's support of the center, and look forward to working with \nthe subcommittee and the Army to ensure that this state-of-the-art \nfacility becomes a reality.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the pending military construction \nappropriations bill provides $9.183 billion in new budget authority and \n$3.064 in new outlays for military construction and family housing \nprograms for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1998.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the outlays for the 1998 program total \n$9.902 billion.\n  This legislation provides for construction by the Department of \nDefense for U.S. military facilities throughout the world, and it \nprovides for family housing for the active forces of each of the U.S. \nmilitary services. Accordingly, it provides for important readiness and \nquality of life programs for our service men and women.\n  The bill falls within the revised section 602(b) allocation for the \nMilitary Construction Subcommittee. I commend the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman, the Senator from Montana, for bringing this bill \nto the floor within the subcommittee's revised allocation.\n  The bill provides important increases over the President's request \nfor 1998, and I urge the adoption of the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table showing the \nrelationship of the conference report to the subcommittee's section \n602(b) allocation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              H.R. 2016, MILITARY CONSTRUCTION APPROPRIATIONS, 1998                             \n                [Spending Totals--Senate-Reported Bill; fiscal year 1998, in millions of dollars]               \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          Category                             Defense  Nondefense   Crime   Mandatory    Total \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:                                                                                           \n  Budget authority..........................................   9,183    ..........  .......  .........   9,183  \n  Outlays...................................................   9,902    ..........  .......  .........   9,902  \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority..........................................   9,183    ..........  .......  .........   9,183  \n  Outlays...................................................   9,920    ..........  .......  .........   9,920  \nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n  Budget authority..........................................   8,384    ..........  .......  .........   8,384  \n  Outlays...................................................   9,839    ..........  .......  .........   9,839  \nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n  Budget authority..........................................   9,183    ..........  .......  .........   9,183  \n  Outlays...................................................   9,909    ..........  .......  .........   9,909  \n                                                                                                                \n              SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED TO                                                                  \n                                                                                                                \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n  Budget authority..........................................  ........  ..........  .......  .........  ........\n  Outlays...................................................

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the military \nconstruction appropriation bill before us today. Senator Burns and \nSenator Murray are to be congratulated on crafting a measure that \nadequately meets our military needs while at the same time addressing \nthe pressing concerns of our soldiers.\n  Mr. President, at a time when our services are having difficulty \nmeeting their recruiting goals and retention is suffering, it is more \nimportant than ever that the military address quality of life issues. \nUnfortunately, the administration has chosen to ignore the reality and \nnot budget the appropriate resources for this goal.\n  The budget for all military construction contained in the Senate bill \ntotals just over $9 billion, almost $800,000 above what the \nadministration requested. As anyone who has visited some of our \ninstallations can tell you, this money is desperately needed.\n  I salute the work of Senators Burns and Murray as well as their \nstaffs. Their ability to prioritize within the declining budget is \ncrucial to improving the everyday lives of our soldiers and their \nfamilies. Mr. President, if we are going to continue to ask more from \nour military around the world, the very least we can do is to provide \nthem with adequate housing and facilities. In addition, it should be \npointed out that the committee worked with both the House and Senate \nauthorizing committees and did not appropriate funds for any project \nthat was not authorized.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this excellent \nbill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor several New Jersey projects included in the Senate's version of the \nfiscal year 1998 military construction appropriations, as well as \nseveral New Jersey projects included in the House version of this \nlegislation. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I hope all of \nthese projects will be included in the final version of the bill.\n  I appreciate the willingness of the chairman and ranking member to \ninclude $1.3 million in design funding for a new software engineering \nfacility at Picatinny Arsenal. This funding will allow the Picatinny to \nconsolidate the design, development, testing, configuration control, \nfield release and maintenance of weapon systems, simulators, and \ntrainers. It will result in reduced cost for the Army and will improve \nefficiency in the software engineering process.\n  I also appreciate the willingness of the Senate subcommittee to \nprovide funding for two important projects at McGuire Air Force Base. \nThe Senate's bill includes $9.954 million for an air mobility \noperations group warehouse, which will increase the efficiency of the \nbase's mobility operations. Additionally, it includes $35.217 million \nfor an ambulatory health care center replacement. This new facility \nwill house a full-service outpatient operation and provide adequate \nspace for clinics, ambulatory surgery, ancillary services, storage, \noffices, and administration. It will improve the quality of care \nprovided to our military personnel.\n  In addition, the House version of this bill provides $9.03 million \nfor an ammunition supply point at Fort Dix, $8.8 million for a fire \nstation at McGuire Air Force Base, $2.05 million for a fire station at \nFort Monmouth, and $7.3 million to build 35 units of family housing at \nPicatinny Arsenal. These\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\nare meritorious projects that deserve the support of the conferees. I \nhope the conferees to this bill will agree to include these projects to \nimprove the quality of life and to support the missions at New Jersey's \nmilitary installations in the final version of this legislation.\n  These projects are vital to New Jersey's defense infrastructure, and \nto those who work on these bases. I hope the chairman and ranking \nmember will support these important New Jersey projects in the \nconference agreement to the fiscal year 1998 military construction \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the committee \namendments are considered and agreed to en bloc.\n  The committee amendments were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill was read the \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the first phase of the hearings \nof the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee into the abuses of the \nelectoral process through campaign fundraising having just concluded, \nand the second phase about to begin, it is perhaps an appropriate time \nto reflect on those things that we have learned in these first few \nweeks and those questions that remain.\n  It is, I think, important to note that despite some incentive for \npartisanship, a tendency by the media to sometimes reach conclusions \nbefore the facts, and a persistent failure of some witnesses to \ncooperate, the committee has begun its work, I think, in the best \ntraditions of the Senate. Democrats and Republicans are working \ntogether. We do have a common objective, and I think we are doing \nservice to the institution.\n  These things, however, have already been learned. First, it is a \nresult of insufficient management and poor decisionmaking and the \ncontinuing upward spiral of pressure to raise campaign funds, the \nDemocratic National Committee made a series of bad decisions during the \nlast election that clearly resulted in some violations of Federal law \nand were a disservice both to the President and the Democratic Party. \nAmong these were the inadequacy of any process of checking the names or \nbackgrounds of contributors or the sources of their funds. The good \nwork of some members of the Democratic National Committee and its staff \nwas compromised, unfortunately, by the addition of some inexperienced \npeople who were not properly supervised or trained for their \npositions. John Huang was clearly among them, and it is now clear from \ntestimony before the committee that there is a substantial chance that \nthe result was a violation of Federal law.\n\n  Second, it is also becoming clear that the Chinese Government, the \nPeople's Republic of China, as a result or in reaction to the visit of \nPresident Li of Taiwan to the United States, planned and potentially \nembarked upon a plan to influence the 1996 Federal election. It is \nclear from the evidence provided to date that this plan targeted \nneither political party in particular, but probably both in general. It \nseems to have been primarily designed to influence the U.S. Congress. \nIt is unclear to date the extent of those designs on the Presidential \nelection. It is also clear that that plan involved both legal and \npotentially illegal means to accomplish its goal. The extent of its \nsuccess, to what extent it was achieved, is not at this point known. \nThe fact that it existed and there were any intentions implemented is \ndisturbing enough to warrant the committee's investigation.\n  Third, it is established, I believe, at this point, to at least some \ndegree of satisfaction, that the illegal activities that may have been \nembarked upon by John Huang or others to seek and receive foreign \ncontributions or otherwise violate Federal Election Commission \nregulations and the laws of the United States with regard to \nfundraising were not either known or encouraged by senior personnel at \nthe Democratic National Committee. Richard Sullivan, who was the direct \nsuperior of Mr. Huang, denied under oath that there was any plan by the \nDemocratic National Committee to solicit Chinese or other foreign \ncontributions. It is, however, clear Mr. Huang's activities were not \nsufficiently monitored or known as should have been the case in an \norganization of the importance of the Democratic National Committee.\n  Fourth, John Huang's own activities raise substantial suspicion. It \nis not enough for the committee to conclude that it was not properly \nsupervised or to take any comfort in the fact that his superiors or \nother people in either\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\nthe White House or Democratic National Committee did not have knowledge \nof his efforts to raise foreign contributions. Nor is it enough to \nsimply dismiss his activities as a poor judgment to hire him because he \nwas inexperienced or unqualified to be vice chairman of finance of the \nDemocratic National Committee.\n  His activities while at the Commerce Department in operating out of \nthe Stevens Corp., where he both received and made telephone calls, \nreceived and sent faxes and perhaps, most suspiciously, received \npackages, raised continued questions. In the coming weeks, the \ncommittee will want to explore as to the nature of his activities, not \nsimply while at the Democratic National Committee, but in the months \npreceding it while a Federal employee. The committee is also left with \nthe unanswered question as to why he continued to receive briefings by \nthe intelligence community and of what use he made of that information.\n  The committee is also left with questions regarding the alleged \nChinese plan. While it is comforting that there is no evidence to date \nthat policy was impacted, it is also not enough for us to rest in a \ncomfort that it was bipartisan and not apparently solicited by either \npolitical party, based on information known to date. The question \nremains of whether policy was ever changed as a result of these \ncontributions, whether the plan was actually fully implemented, and \nwhether or not it continues. This naturally is a first priority of the \ncommittee and remains of overwhelming importance.\n  And questions, finally, remain with regard to John Huang. Of what use \ndid he make of this information for corporate purposes of the Lippo \nGroup or any other foreign interest? Were these questions both \ncontinuing before the committee and some of these preliminary issues \nanswered?\n  The committee next turns its work to the National Policy Forum, its \nrelationship with the Republican National Committee and its chairman, \nHaley Barbour. The committee in the coming days will receive testimony, \nI believe, that will indicate that Mr. Barbour, while chairman of the \nRepublican National Committee, designed a plan, which was implemented \nwith his participation, to solicit and eventually did receive foreign \ncontributions in excess of $2 million, which helped, through a series \nof transactions, to fund the 1994 Republican campaign to take control \nof the U.S. Congress. Evidence will be presented that this was an \nactive plan, fully implemented.\n  After a week of testimony, therefore, we will know the extent of \ninvolvement of the Democratic and Republican National Committees in \nthese efforts to receive foreign contributions and their impact on the \n1994 and 1996 elections.\n  With those two phases of the committee's work completed, what we will \nnot have done is get any closer to the question of genuine and complete \ncampaign finance reform. Several weeks have now passed since President \nClinton's deadline was passed for the July 4, 1996, consideration of \ncampaign finance reform. No campaign finance reform bill has been \nconsidered or released by any subcommittee of this Senate. No date has \nbeen set for the Senate to even begin discussion of any such genuine \nreform.\n  Indeed, there are some who would argue that the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee deliberations are an excuse to wait until next year to even \nbegin consideration of any campaign finance reform legislation. Using \nthe deadline of the end of 1996 to begin consideration will assure that \nthe 1998 Federal elections are conducted under the same campaign \nfinance laws that bred the very problems now being discussed by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee. And it begs the question that, for all \nthe important things that this Senate can learn from these hearings, \nall the unfortunate revelations the Senate is now experiencing, the \ntragic lessons the American people are now learning about this system, \nwhich Senator does not already know enough that we are raising too much \nmoney, spending too much money, and inviting both these abuses and \nviolations of the law every day that we do not reform this system?\n  I know that there is a perception in our country that this failure to \ninitiate campaign finance reform is a genuinely bipartisan problem. The \nAmerican people can be forgiven for believing this because both parties \nhave abused the system, and our hearings are resulting in learning that \nboth the Democratic and Republican National Committees have not only \nviolated the vested policy but clearly violated the law in this \ndownward spiral of campaign fundraising.\n  It is, however, becoming less and less of a bipartisan issue when it \ncomes to the question of reaching solutions. Last weekend, Jim \nNicholson, the new chairman of the Republican National Committee, \nannounced his opposition to banning soft money, his opposition to any \nlimit on campaign expenditures, his opposition to controlling the costs \nof television. In essence, the Republican chairman of their national \ncommittee announced his opposition to any campaign finance reform.\n  Indeed, that mirrors our experience in the House and in the Senate. \nThe overwhelming majority of the caucus of the Democratic Party in this \nSenate is prepared to vote for campaign finance reform now. It has been \nendorsed by our leadership. President Clinton has indicated that he \nwould sign such legislation. Yet, only three members of the Republican \ncaucus are prepared to even vote for campaign finance reform, and no \ncommittee chairman has been willing to bring it to consideration.\n  Mr. President, as our committee continues its work, we will continue \nto be saddened by revelations that both political parties have not \nchallenged the best within us in raising funds for conducting these \ncampaigns. Our only comfort is that the political leadership of this \ninstitution will at some point see the need to wait no longer and begin \ninitiating real change. There is no room in this debate for anyone to \ntake comfort in their actions to date.\n  Not only have the political committees of both parties not conducted \nthemselves in our best traditions, not only have both possibly violated \nthe laws, but other institutions have equal fault. While the media each \nday reminds us of the problems of campaign financing, the cost of \ntelevision advertising continues to spiral upward. The overwhelming \ncosts of these campaigns is a result of the rising cost of television. \nWhile every night the media rails against the system, complains against \nthe abuses, their lobbyists roam the Halls of Congress fighting efforts \nto control the cost of television advertising.\n  So, in neither party, nor in the private institutions of the media, \nnor in the institutions of the political parties is there any reason \nfor pride. Only this, that there are still people in this institution \nin both parties who continue the investigations, Members of the Senate \nwho are prepared to vote to change the system, people not simply who \nhave not succeeded in the system, but Members who have succeeded, who \nhave raised the funds, conducted successful campaigns, but still \nrecognize that even though individuals can succeed, it does not serve \nthe national interests.\n  Mr. President, the first phase of our investigation by the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee has now concluded. We begin two more \nimportant weeks of our work. I believe we are conducting ourselves, \npursuing our objective as this Senate has commanded us to do. Much has \nbeen learned. There remains much to be done. I hope every Senator will \ncontinue to follow our work, but, mostly, join us in the commitment to \nchange this system, find those who have abused it in the past, ensure \nthat the law is enforced, and then give the American people a political \nsystem financed by means in which they can take real pride.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7823-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7824-S7857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998.\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am very disappointed that we cannot stay \non the bill. We have a number of Senators wishing to present \namendments, so I am going to propose a unanimous-consent request. I \nwould note that the discussions we just heard are most appropriately \nmade in the Governmental Affairs Committee which is doing business at \nthis time, and I am not going to answer some of what I think were \npartisan charges because those would best\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\nbe handled by members of the Governmental Affairs Committee. It is \nappropriate that we do the committee work and then move to the floor \nwhere we can have these full debates. Right now the measure before us \nis the VA-HUD appropriations bill, and there are serious amendments.\n  I now ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Minnesota be \nrecognized to present two amendments; on the disposition of those \namendments, the Senator from Colorado be recognized to offer an \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is the Senator from Colorado going to speak extensively \non this amendment because the Senator from Florida had an amendment. \nYou might recall, I say to the Senator, the Senator from Florida had \nspoken to us this morning.\n  Mr. BOND. Let me withdraw that unanimous-consent request. I ask the \nSenator from Colorado how long he needs on his amendment.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Senator from Missouri for yielding. I suspect \nwe could move on my amendment in 10 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. And the Senator from Minnesota would need?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator from Minnesota I believe will be speaking \nfor 45 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague, I think I can do the first \namendment in about 5 minutes and I think I can do the second in about a \nhalf an hour.\n  Mr. BOND. All right. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMinnesota be recognized for 35 minutes to present two amendments. \nFollowing those amendments, which at this point I do not believe will \nnecessitate a rollcall vote, then I would ask that the Senator from \nColorado be recognized for 10 minutes. I do not believe there will be a \nrollcall vote.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I am not going to ask for a rollcall.\n  Mr. BOND. And following that I would ask that the Senator from \nFlorida be recognized, for what length of time?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would only ask for 2 minutes equally \ndivided. I have a sense of the Senate which I believe has been agreed \nto, and I am not going to ask for a recorded vote on that sense of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, might I amend that unanimous-consent request \nto ask that, if the Senators would not mind, we do the 2 minutes \nequally divided for the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would say, of course not, and \nmoreover I would say to my colleague from Colorado, since I am going to \nbe taking close to 40 or 35 minutes, if he would like to go second \nsince he only has 10 minutes, I will follow my colleagues.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. In other words, the Senator from Minnesota yields to \nthe Senator from Florida and then the Senator from Colorado.\n  I must say we really do thank the Senator from Minnesota for his \ncooperation in advocating veterans and advocating us finishing the \nbill.\n  Does the Senator want to withdraw his unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. BOND. I will withdraw the unanimous consent.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Start over.\n  Mr. BOND. I ask that the Senator from Florida be recognized for----\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Two minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BOND. Two minutes equally divided, followed by the Senator from \nColorado to be recognized for 10 minutes, followed by the Senator from \nMinnesota for 40 minutes.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a fellow in \nour office, Mary O'Brien, be given floor privileges for the pendency of \nthis sense of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 948\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that Congress should \n    consider legislation concerning catastrophic natural disasters)\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer a simple, straightforward sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution regarding natural disasters.\n  The rising cost of natural disasters is a ticking time bomb that we, \nin Congress, are doing little to address. Since 1989 the cost to \ntaxpayers has been nearly $40 billion.\n  Just this past weekend Hurricane Danny hit portions of Alabama, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and my State of Florida. Although Hurricane \nDanny was a relatively small storm, just imagine if Hurricane Danny had \nbeen of the magnitude of a Hurricane Hugo or Andrew. The damages would \nbe exponentially larger.\n  Hurricane Danny serves as a stark reminder of the ticking time bomb. \nWe should keep in mind that we are only very early in what is expected \nto be an extremely active hurricane season. The time to act is sooner \nrather than later.\n  My resolution would state that it is the sense of the Senate that \nCongress consider legislation to deal with the rising cost of natural \ndisaster head on--before another megadisaster occurs.\n  What will it take for Congress to focus on this ticking time bomb? \nAnother Northridge earthquake that comes with a sticker price of $8.6 \nbillion? Another Hurricane Andrew or Hugo to cost the Federal \nGovernment $6.2 and $3 billion, respectively?\n  Helping our Nation better prepare for natural disasters will require \nFederal, State, and local efforts as well as initiatives from the \nprivate sector. My resolution states that Congress should consider \nFederal legislation embracing the following principles:\n  First, people living in areas that are prone to natural disasters \nshould assume a practical level of responsibility by acquiring private \nproperty insurance.\n  The problem is that in some areas, especially in my home State of \nFlorida, it is very difficult for individuals to get adequate private \nproperty insurance. This leads us to the second principle.\n  Second, the insurance industry, in partnership with the Federal \nGovernment, should develop a new mechanism to spread the risk of \nnatural disasters minimizing the cost of these disasters for the \nFederal Government. The goal of spreading the risk is to make private \ninsurance available and affordable for everyone.\n  Third, a partnership should be forged between the private sector and \ngovernments at all levels to encourage better disaster preparedness and \nresponse.\n  No one is expecting to find a magic solution to natural disasters. \nThe National Weather Service cannot play like the FBI's bomb squad and \nsnip a few strategically placed wires to disarm future hurricanes. Nor \ncan the National Science Foundation invent a way to stop the movement \nof tectonic plates and ensure that there will be no more earthquakes. \nBut the Federal Government can at least begin discussing creative ways \nto assist States in preparing for and responding to natural disasters.\n  That is the intent of my resolution--to begin the discussion. We \ncannot continue to fund natural disaster after the fact.\n  We must take steps to make sure that every person in disaster prone \nareas has available, affordable property and casualty insurance.\n  We must work with the private sector to find creative ways of \nshifting the responsibility for the risk of disasters to the private \nsector and reduce the cost to the Federal Government.\n  We must encourage States to better prepare themselves for disasters \nand to have a clear game plan to respond when hit by a natural \ncatastrophe.\n  In the next few days I will circulate a letter that I encourage all \nmy colleagues to join me in signing. The letter will be sent to the \nU.S. Department of the Treasury asking for their assistance and \nguidance in developing such an initiative.\n  Mr. President, our Nation has been beset by an unusual series of \nnatural disasters, some of which have occurred as recently as the past \nfew days in Mississippi, Alabama, and my State of Florida and others \nearlier this year in the upper Midwest. This sense of the Senate asks \nthat the Senate at an appropriate future time consider legislation that \nembodies the following principles: That persons who live in areas of \nrisk of natural disaster should assume a practical level of personal \nresponsibility for the risks through private insurance; second, that \nthe insurance industry in partnership with the Federal Government and \nother private sector entities should establish new\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\nmechanisms for spreading the risks of catastrophes that minimize the \ninvolvement and liability of the Federal Government; and third, a \npartnership should be formed between the private sector and Government \nat all levels to encourage better disaster preparation and respond \nquickly to the fiscal and financial impacts of catastrophic natural \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this sense of the Senate is to \nencourage those entities that have been working over the last 2 years \nto try to embody these principles into legislation that could be \npresented to the Congress, that in light of what has recently occurred \nthey redouble their efforts to present to the Nation an appropriate \npartnership framework that would both mitigate and respond to natural \ndisasters.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk the sense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 948.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 423. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CATASTROPHIC NATURAL \n                   DISASTERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) catastrophic natural disasters are occurring with great \n     frequency, a trend that is likely to continue for several \n     decades according to prominent scientists:\n       (2) estimated damage to homes, buildings, and other \n     structures from catastrophic natural disasters has totaled \n     well over $100,000,000,000 during the last decade, not \n     including the indirect costs of the disasters such as lost \n     productivity and economic decline;\n       (3) the lack of adequate planning for catastrophic natural \n     disasters, coupled with inadequate private insurance, has led \n     to increasing reliance on the Federal Government to provide \n     disaster relief, including the appropriation of \n     $40,000,000,000 in supplemental funding since 1989;\n       (4) in the foreseeable future, a strong likelihood exists \n     that the United States will experience a megacatastrophe, the \n     impact of which would cause widespread economic disruption \n     for homeowners and businesses and enormous cost to the \n     Federal Government; and\n       (5) the Federal Government has failed to anticipate \n     catastrophic natural disasters and take comprehensive action \n     to reduce their impact.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should consider legislation that embodies the \n     following principles:\n       (1) Persons who live in areas at risk of natural disaster \n     should assume a practical level of personal responsibility \n     for the risks through private insurance.\n       (2) The insurance industry, in partnership with the Federal \n     Government and other private sector entities, should \n     establish new mechanisms for the spreading of the risk of \n     catastrophes that minimize the involvement and liability of \n     the Federal Government.\n       (3) A partnership should be formed between the private \n     sector and government at all levels to encourage better \n     disaster preparation and respond quickly to the physical and \n     financial impacts of catastrophic natural disasters.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on amendment No. 948 \noffered by the Senator from Florida?\n  Mr. BOND. No objection.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n948.\n  The amendment (No. 948) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to extend my appreciation to the \nmanagers of the bill and to my colleagues for allowing expedited \nconsideration of this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  We do not have a pending amendment in the Chamber, do we?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, actually, I believe we do, which is the \nBumpers amendment. So I ask unanimous consent that the Bumpers \namendment be laid aside until the conclusion of the debate on the \nWellstone amendments, and at such time as we take up the ongoing debate \non the Bumpers amendment on the space station.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 947\n\n (Purpose: To make an amendment relating to the use of public housing \n          operating funds to provide tenant-based assistance)\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair. I have an amendment at the desk \nnumbered 947. I request that it be reported.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Allard] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 947.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 21, line 16, insert before the period at the end \n     the following: ``: Provided further, That of the total amount \n     made available under this heading, $290,000,000 shall be made \n     available for tenant-based assistance in accordance with \n     section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937''.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, today I file an amendment to provide for more public \nhousing vouchers.\n  The original intent of the Federal housing assistance program was to \nprovide temporary housing to poor individuals and families. Since its \ninception, the Federal housing program has grown to become a $25 \nbillion entity.\n  In my view, the section 8 voucher program is the best means for low-\nincome families to find secure, affordable rental housing. The section \n8 certificate or voucher program first began in 1974 and has grown to \nserve over 1.5 million low-income families today. These families are \nempowered with the choice of where they want to live and are given the \nfreedom to determine what surroundings they desire. Section 8 housing \nis the preferable means of providing affordable housing to low-income \nindividuals. Vouchers enjoy wide support including past Republican and \nDemocrat administrations alike. In fact, the current Secretary of HUD, \nSecretary Andrew Cuomo, supports an expanded voucher program.\n  Vouchers are very popular, which is demonstrated by the 1.5 million \nfamilies who are currently using vouchers or certificates. Vouchers \nempower individuals and promote competition within the public housing \nauthority and within the community, thereby lowering costs and \nimproving conditions for the residents. Vouchers or other alternatives \ncan be less expensive than the current public housing program. They can \nsave the Government money and improve conditions for the tenants.\n  Studies have indicated that project-based housing assistance costs \nmore on average than the voucher housing program for each family that \nis assisted. In fact, the findings of the June 1995 GAO report \nindicated that the cost of housing vouchers is 10 percent less than the \ncost of public housing. This study clearly demonstrated that on a \nnational average, the section 8 tenant-based housing is cheaper than \nthe public-unit housing program. In fact, one can say that the savings \nfrom the movement to vouchers could lead to an annual savings of $640 \nmillion per year and could be applied to over 100,000 low-income \nfamilies for housing assistance.\n  I am a member of the Housing Subcommittee which is currently putting \nthe final touches on authorization language for a new public housing \nbill. I have proposed that this approach be included in that bill. \nUnder my proposal, 10 percent of public housing operating funds that \nare distributed to each public housing authority would be made \navailable for those who want vouchers. Nothing would be required or \nmandated. It is simply a choice given to the resident. In fact, we make \nclear that any unexpended amounts set aside for vouchers would be used \nby the public housing authorities for normal operating funds.\n  Quite frankly, I really do not know how anyone could oppose this \nprovision unless they are just opposed to giving people a choice and an \nopportunity. The language that I have proposed in committee also would \nestablish a preference for crime victims. It states that a voucher \nwould be made available to\n\n[[Page S7827]]\n\nany resident of public housing who is the victim of a crime of violence \nthat has been reported to law enforcement. People should have the \noption of vouchers when their housing is unsafe.\n  My objective here today is to alert the appropriators to my interest \nin this matter and in my strong belief that we should increase the pace \nat which we move ahead with the conversion of housing from the old \ncentral planning and concentrated public housing model to one of choice \nand opportunities through vouchers.\n  My view is that, whenever practical, programs should be properly \nauthorized before funds are appropriated. Therefore, I am not going to \npush forward here today on this issue. I will continue my work on the \nauthorizing committee to get this choice added to the law and my \nefforts will be devoted to getting this done in the next several months \nthrough the public housing reform bill.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I now withdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to-- I ask \nunanimous consent that I may proceed for 2 minutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \nwithdrawing the amendment. He has described some of the very difficult \nchallenges which face both this committee and the housing subcommittee. \nWe have a difficulty of ensuring that those people who are in public \nhousing and do not have an option or some place to go with a section 8 \ncertificate do not have their services cut. So we have people who are \nin significant numbers in public housing. We have to care for them as \nwe look for better ways. We have worked on public housing reform and \nlook forward to working with the Senator from Colorado on these reforms \nand other measures. I thank him for raising the question with us.\n  Mr. ALLARD. If the Senator will yield, I thank the chairman for his \nefforts. I know he has a tough job, and I respect his responsibilities \nin that regard.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nColorado for not pressing for a vote on this amendment, how to use the \ntaxpayer's dollar to really create not only opportunity in public \nhousing but also how we can end the cycle of poverty, the culture of \npoverty, and for public housing to be a way to a better life. I am glad \nthe authorizers are going to consider the bill. I look forward to \nlistening to the recommendations. I know the senior Senator from \nMaryland is the ranking member and we will have many spirited \ndiscussions. So how best to provide for the poor, particularly also the \nworking poor, is, indeed, a great challenge. We do not want to repeat \nmistakes in the future, but we also do not want to create new mistakes \nin the future. So the authorizing bill is a great way to do it.\n  I thank the Senator from Colorado for his spirited advocacy and also \nfor withdrawing the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The amendment (No. 947) was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 949\n\n(Purpose: To state the sense of the Senate regarding the appropriations \n for discretionary activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs in \n                    fiscal years 1999 through 2002)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 949.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 85, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       Sec. 423. it is the sense of the Senate that Congress \n     should appropriate for the Department of Veterans Affairs for \n     discretionary activities in each of fiscal years 1999 through \n     2002 an amount equal to the amount required by the Department \n     in such fiscal year for such activities.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Mikulski.\n  First of all, I rise on the floor of the Senate to commend the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on VA-HUD and Independent Agencies for \nrestoring $273 million in cuts in veterans discretionary programs, and \nto include health care for fiscal year 1998.\n  Above and beyond this, let me also commend the committee for adding \nan additional $92.9 million above the President's budget request. This \nis a victory for veterans and their families, and it is a step in the \nright direction.\n  We have been fighting to restore these cuts for 1998. When we first \nfound out that in the budget resolution there were proposed cuts over \nthe next 5 years, we held a forum out in Minnesota and, really, the \nveterans community was unanimous in denouncing these cuts. We \ncirculated a letter, signed by colleagues, to the appropriations \nsubcommittee. We have some appropriators here who are clearly strong \nadvocates for veterans, and I thank them.\n  We offered an amendment to the DOD authorization to transfer excess \nfunding from the Pentagon to VA health care. We did not win on that \namendment, but I thank the PVA, Paralyzed Veterans of America, the DAV, \nDisabled Veterans of America, and, in addition, I would also like to \nthank the Vietnam Veterans of America for their support.\n  Now, what we have in this appropriations bill is a restoration of the \n$273 million, and adding another $92 million. That is good news for \nveterans and their families. Again, I commend my colleagues, and I \nthank DAV and PVA and Vietnam Vets and the other organizations for \nhelping me and helping other Senators in restoring this funding.\n  However, I remain deeply concerned about cuts in funding for veterans \ndiscretionary programs, health care programs, in the outyears, 1999 \nthrough 2002, which were agreed to in the bipartisan budget deal. So \nwhat this amendment essentially says to veterans is: Don't worry, \nbecause we go on record that your health care will be secure going into \nthe next century.\n  This amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment which says that the \nSenate ensures its promises for veterans. It promises veterans that \nover the next 4 years, 1999 to 2002, the veterans' medical system will \nreceive the resources it requires--I put that in bold letters--to \ndeliver quality health care to our Nation's veterans. As I think about \nthis budget deal, if we do not at least have a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment, then we are talking about, in the outyears, cuts of about $2 \nbillion from the President's request; or, another way of looking at it, \nit would be close to $3 billion from 1997 funding levels.\n  It is wrong. We know it. This amendment I have introduced for myself \nand Senator Mikulski puts the Senate on record as saying these cuts are \nwrong and making it clear we go on record that we will provide the VA \nhealth care system with the resources it needs to provide as good care \nas possible--quality care, we hope and pray--for veterans, going into \nthe 21st century.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment by the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The amendment (No. 949) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 950\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am now about to send to the desk a \nsecond amendment, which really has two provisions. The first is that \nwithin 30 days after enactment of this act, we get a CBO study that \nwould provide to the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the \nSenate Appropriations Committee an estimate of the cost of the \nprovision in this amendment. The second part is that not later than 60 \ndays after enactment of this bill, the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs shall hold one or more hearings to consider legislation that \nwould add the following diseases, which would now be presumptive, from \nthe point of view of coverage: lung cancer, bone cancer,\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\nskin cancer, colon cancer, kidney cancer, posterior subcapsular \ncataracts, nonmalignant thyroid nodular disease, ovarian cancer, \nparathyroid adenoma, tumors of the brain and central nervous system, \nand rectal cancer.\n  I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 950.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       (A) Not later than 60 days after enactment of this act, the \n     Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs shall hold hearings to \n     consider legislation which would add the following diseases \n     at the end of Section 1112(c)(2) of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n       Lung cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer, colon cancer, kidney \n     cancer, posterior subcapsular cataracts, non-malignant \n     thyroid nodular disease, ovarian cancer, parathyroid adenoma, \n     tumors of the brain and central nervous system, and rectal \n     cancer.\n       (B) No later than 30 days after enactment of this act, the \n     Congressional Budget Office shall provide to the Senate \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs and the Senate Appropriations \n     Committee an estimate of the cost of the provision contained \n     in (A).\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment that \nwill aid atomic veterans--veterans who were exposed to ionizing \nradiation while serving on active duty. Atomic veterans who may well be \nAmerica's most neglected veterans. They have been seeking justice for \nas long as 50 years and I am determined to help them, and I think my \ncolleagues are determined to help them.\n  Mr. President, I want to dedicate this amendment to the brave and \npatriotic Minnesotans who served in the U.S. Army's 216th Chemical \nService Company, participating in Operation Tumbler Snapper--a series \nof eight nuclear weapons tests that took place in the Nevada desert in \n1952. In particular, I want to pay tribute to two former members of the \nForgotten 216th, Smoky Parrish and Gene Toronto, patriotic Americans \nwho have been my mentors and have fought hard to fair and just \ntreatment for all atomic veterans.\n  I want to say to them and their families and to other families's of \natomic veterans that I will do all in my power as a U.S. Senator to \nensure the Forgotten 216th and other veterans like them are never \nforgotten again.\n  Before I discuss the substance of my amendment I would like to tell \nmy colleagues more about the Forgotten 216th because their problems \ntypify the problems of atomic veterans nationwide. When they \nparticipated in Operation Tumbler Snapper, they believed their \nGovernment's assurances that it would protect them against any harm, \nbut have since become convinced they were used as guinea pigs without \nany concern for their safety. My colleague from Maryland said to me \nearlier, and I hope it's OK to repeat this, in a sense it was like the \nTuskegee experiment.\n  Immediately after a nuclear bomb blast, many were sent to measure \nfallout at or near ground zero, exposing them to so much radiation that \ntheir Geiger counters went off the scale while they inhaled and \ningested radioactive particles. Members of the 216th were given minimal \nprotection, sometimes even lacking film badges to measure radiation \nexposure and provided with no information on the perils they faced. \nFurthermore, they were sworn to secrecy about their participation in \nnuclear tests, sometimes denied access to their own service medical \nrecords, and provided no medical followup to ensure they'd suffered no \nill effects as a result of their exposure to radiation. This happened \nin our country. Sadly, many members of the 216th have already died, \noften of cancer. Is it any wonder that these men now refer to \nthemselves as the Forgotten 216th?\n  Mr. President, my amendment is intended to address some of the \nrecommendations of the ``Final Report of the President's Advisory \nCommittee on Human Radiation Experiments'' issued in October 1995. I \nhad an opportunity to testify before this committee about the atomic \nvets.\n  The report's recommendations mirrored the concerns atomic veterans \nhave had for many years: the list of presumptive diseases contained in \nlaw is incomplete and inadequate; the standard of proof for those \nwithout presumptive disease is impossible to meet; and these statutes \nare limited and inequitable in their coverage.\n  The VA now maintains two lists of radiogenic diseases, a presumptive \nlist established under Public Law 101-321 as amended by Public Law 102-\n578 and now consisting of 15 radiogenic diseases, and a nonpresmuptive \nlist established under Public Law 98-542 which includes 11 diseases not \non the presumptive list. My amendment would add these 11 diseases to \nthe presumptive list, would result in the elimination of the \nnonpresumptive list, and the creation of a single presumptive list of \nradiogenic diseases. The radiogeneic diseases that would be added to \nthe presumptive list are: lung cancer, bone cancer, skin cancer, colon \ncancer, kidney cancer, posterior subcapsular cataracts, non-malignant \nthyroid nodular disease, ovarian cancer, parathyroid adenoma, tumors of \nthe brain and central nervous system, and rectal cancer. These veterans \nwere exposed to this radiation. They went to ground zero. They were put \nin harm's way by our Government. They were never told that anything \nterrible would happen to them. But so many of them have had cancer, so \nmany of their children and grandchildren have been born with a variety \nof different disorders and problems, the least we can do, the least we \ncan do is make sure that they receive good care and adequate \ncompensation.\n\n  Why the need for these changes? To begin with veterans must jump \nthrough hoops to demonstrate they are eligible for compensation for \nnonpresumptive diseases and, after they have done so the chances that \nthe VA will approve their claims are minuscule.\n  Mr. President, to illustrate what I mean, permit me to cite some VA \nstatistics. As of April 1, 1996, out of the hundreds of thousands of \natomic veterans there have been a total of 18,515 radiation claim \ncases, with service-connection granted in 1,886 cases. According to VA \nstatistics current as of December 1, 1995, only 463 involve the \ngranting of presumptive service-connection. Thus, if we were to exclude \nthe 463 veterans who were granted presumptive service-connection, \natomic veterans had an incredibly low claims approval rate of less than \n8 percent. Moreover, of this low percentage, an indeterminate \npercentage may have had their claims granted for diseases unrelated to \nradiation exposure.\n  Why the abysmally low percentage of claims approvals? One key reason \nis that VA regulations are overly stringent for service-connection for \nnonpresumptive radiogenic diseases. Dose requirements pose a \nparticularly difficult, if not insuperable hurdle. While it is almost \nimpossible to come up with accurate dose reconstructions because \ndecades have elapsed since the nuclear detonations and adequate records \ndon't exist, veterans are frequently denied compensation because their \nradiation exposure levels are allegedly too low. In this connection, \nlet me quote from the findings of the President's Advisory Committee on \nHuman Radiation Experiments: ``The Government did not create or \nmaintain adequate records regarding the exposure of all participants in \n[nuclear weapons tests and] the identify and test locales of all \nparticipants.'' This finding obviously calls into question the \ncapability of the Government to come up with accurate dose \nreconstructions on which approval of claims for VA compensation for \natomic veterans frequently depend. My amendment essentially says two \nthings. First of all, what we are saying now is that we call on CBO to \ndo this study and provide us with an estimate of the costs of this \nprovision, and that is done within 30 days. And then, not later than 60 \ndays after enactment of this act, the Senate Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs is to hold one or more hearings to consider this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, my amendment will ensure that the VA fulfills its \nresponsibility to give atomic veterans the benefit of the doubt in \nconsidering their claims for compensation. This is especially important \nbecause after more than 50 years there is still much about the effects \nof low-level radiation that is the subject of scientific controversy.\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\n  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I've fought hard to \nenable Persian Gulf veterans to receive compensation for diseases that \nmay be linked to their service in the Persian Gulf, at least until \nscientists reach a definitive conclusion about the etiology of their \nillnesses. I've also strongly and consistently supported former \nSecretary Jesse Brown's efforts to ensure that Vietnam veterans are \ncompensated for disabilities linked to their exposure to agent orange, \neven though science is still unable to determine the extent of their \nexposure. There is no question in my mind that both Persian Gulf and \nVietnam veterans deserve such compensation. At the same time, I believe \nthat the U.S. Government must give atomic veterans the same benefit of \nthe doubt. Unfortunately, right now, this is not the case.\n\n  Let me give one example of the discriminatory treatment of atomic \nveterans concerns, and that is the VA's 1993 decision to grant VA \nbenefits based on presumptive service connection to veterans exposed to \nagent orange who have contracted lung cancer, a decision which I fully \nback, but for atomic veterans, the VA still treats lung cancer as a \nnonpresumptive illness.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, we know what happened to them. \nThey went to ground zero. They had no protective gear. They were \nexposed to this radiation. Why in the world has it taken us so long--\nthey are still waiting after 40 and 45 years --to make sure they get \nthe care they deserve and make sure they get the compensation they \ndeserve?\n  Mr. President, we just have to do better. Let me reiterate, I fully \nsupported the decision of the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to \nrecommend to the President that lung cancer be treated presumptively as \na service-connected condition for agent orange. I wish Secretary Jesse \nBrown was still with us. He probably was my best friend in the \nadministration, in Government. He was a strong advocate for veterans. I \nam simply pointing out that we are not giving the atomic veterans the \nsame treatment, and it is patently unfair.\n  Since January 1994, I have had a lot of meetings with members of the \nForgotten 216th. I have met with their families. I met with their \nchildren. I met with their grandchildren. Let me just be very honest \nabout this. Many of them are up there in age now. They are elderly. \nThey may not have that many more years to live. But it is incredible to \nme that we have let this shameful episode in the history of our country \ngo on by never fully acknowledging what we did to them and never \nproviding these veterans and their families with the compassion and \ncare that they deserve.\n  I don't think it is too strong for me to say that our Government lied \nto them. I don't think it is unfair for me to say that for 45 years, or \nthereabouts, we still have not given them a fair shake. Justice delayed \nis justice denied. The atomic veterans are not the strongest veterans \norganization in our country. They don't have that much clout. Many of \nmy friends who were atomic veterans right now have cancer. Many of them \nare not in good health. Many of them have already died.\n  They are not, in short, a strong lobby. But, Mr. President, I am \ntelling you, I had a chance to talk to some of the atomic vets before \ncoming out on the floor of the Senate. I had a chance to talk with my \ncolleague from Maryland, and she really helped me with this amendment. \nShe said to me, ``Senator Wellstone, if you think about it in steps, it \nmakes more sense. First, we get the CBO study, and we make it clear we \nwant that study, we want to know what it costs, so we are not just \nputting veterans in parentheses, out of sight out of mind. And then \nhave some closure and make it clear that within 60 days the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs will hold hearings and consider legislation that \nmoves this forward.''\n  For some colleagues, and in a way for myself because I am always so \nimpatient, who say, ``Well, but it doesn't guarantee the result,'' that \nis true, but these atomic veterans have been so out of sight and so out \nof mind for so long that I really think this would be a really good, \npositive step that the U.S. Senate would be taking.\n  I don't know whether there will be opposition or not to the \namendment. I hope there will be strong support for it. I really think \nthis is the right thing to do. I am convinced that if every single \nSenator on the floor of the Senate, Republican and Democrat alike, had \nfull knowledge of this history and full knowledge of what these \nveterans have gone through and full knowledge of the terrible illnesses \nin their families--it is really awful. This amendment doesn't even \ncover, I say to my colleague from Maryland, some of the pattern of \ndisabilities and illnesses of children and grandchildren, which is \nfrightening to me.\n  I just don't know, I am not prepared to say what has happened \ngenetically within families. I don't know. I am not a doctor, and I am \nsure there is probably disagreement about it. But what there shouldn't \nbe disagreement about is that these veterans deserve better. These \natomic veterans are veterans. These atomic veterans deserve better from \nour Government, they deserve better from our country, and it is time \nthat we take action that would be a first major step toward providing \nthem with the compensation and care which they truly deserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank our distinguished colleague from \nMinnesota for bringing the plight of this group of veterans before us. \nHe has made a very compelling case for the difficulties they have \nfaced.\n  I believe that the approach he has worked out with the ranking member \nis a responsible approach. The version I have before me directs the CBO \nto present the study to the Committee on Veterans Affairs within 30 \ndays and directs the Committee on Veterans Affairs to hold hearings \nwithin 60 days. I think that is an appropriate means of moving forward \non this issue.\n\n  I thank him for bringing it to our attention, and we have no \nobjection to accepting the amendment on this side.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what a moving story, what a moving story \nto hear about the Forgotten 216th. I am sure that this has been a \nconsiderable heartbreak for every member of that unit who went to \nground zero. I am sure they went with good faith in themselves and in \ntheir Government, and yet over the last 45 years, they have endured \nterrible blows from their Government--one, the blow of exposing them to \nintense radiation with no protective gear; the second, that for 45 \nyears, the very validity of their concerns about what happened to them \nand their need for medical treatment were, again, rejected by their \nU.S. Government.\n  I thank the Senator for this type of amendment, because I will tell \nyou today, I didn't want to, because of a budget situation, have to \nvote to reject them one more time. I think just as you have heard now \nfrom the chairman of the committee, we are going to take your \namendment. We like your amendment, and I will tell you why we like your \namendment. One, we are going to get to the facts about what this will \ncost, because too often, as the Senator from Minnesota knows, \ncompelling human need gets all entangled over cost. This way we will \nknow the cost. But then by asking the Veterans Affairs Committee to \nhold hearings within 60 days, it is a bit of a hammer, if you will, to \nensure that there will be, as in our democracy, a public hearing on \nthis.\n  I say to my colleague from Minnesota that it has been my observation \nin 20 years--10 in the House and now over 10 in the Senate--that the \nVA, when it came to compensation for what our veterans were exposed to, \nnever acted on their own. They only acted because Congress pushed for \nthe facts.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for pushing for the facts in terms \nof this situation, the facts on cost, the facts on what happened to \nthem, and the facts on the consequences to these veterans and how we \nneed to address them.\n  I say to my colleagues in the VA, not the committee, but in the \nVeterans' Administration, if you are listening to the debate, don't see \nthis as a problem; see this as an opportunity, because here we can have \none of the most unique longitudinal studies of what happened to men who \nwere fit for duty\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\nwhen they walked at ground zero, and then what were their health \nconsequences to both themselves and to their beloved wives, as well as \nto their children and their grandchildren.\n  What a unique opportunity for both veterans, the Centers for Disease \nControl, and even NIH to welcome these men, to embrace these men as we \ntry to redress the grievance that happened to them, and the lessons \nlearned so that we then know what radiation did to people and offer \ninsights that could help other people who have been exposed to \nradiation. So I thank the Senator for his amendment. I thank the \nSenator for his advocacy in this area. I look forward to accepting the \namendment, and I look forward to hearing the CBO and the VA Committee's \nreport.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank both my colleagues. I think 30 \ndays CBO and in 60 days Veterans' Committee hearings in considering \nlegislation moves us forward in a significant way. I thank both of my \ncolleagues for their support. I thank the Senator from Maryland \nespecially for some of her assistance in working on this amendment. I \nhope both my colleagues will please help us keep this in conference. I \ndon't want this to be one of those things that it happens on the floor \nand then, goodbye, it is gone. I don't want to do that to these \nveterans. I think we will have strong support from both of our \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 950) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota, who \ncompleted his amendments more quickly than we thought. We have \ncolleagues coming to the floor who are sequenced to follow the Senator \nfrom Minnesota. Since Senator Bumpers has not yet reached the floor, I \nask unanimous consent that Senator Mikulski be recognized to offer an \namendment on her behalf and mine and on behalf of the minority leader. \nI think that amendment should take less than 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maryland.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 951\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf \nof myself and Senator Daschle. I send the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself, Mr. \n     Daschle, and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 951.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 16, line 21, strike ``$10,693,000,000'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``$10,653,000,000.''\n       On page 17, line 7, strike ``$1,150,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$1,110,000,000.''\n       On page 33, after line 23, insert the following new \n     heading:\n\n\n             ``EMPOWERMENT ZONES AND ENTERPRISE COMMUNITIES\n\n       ``For grants to Empowerment Zones and Enterprise \n     Communities, to be designated by the Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development, to continue efforts to stimulate economic \n     opportunity in America's distressed communities, $25,000,000, \n     to remain available until expended.''\n       On page 53 line 22, strike ``$400,500,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$420,500,000.''\n       On page 55, line 14, insert after the colon the following: \n     ``: Provided further, That $20,000,000 shall be available for \n     the America Reads Initiative.''\n       On page 67, line 9, strike ``$202,146,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$207,146,000.''\n       On page 67, line 9, insert the following before the period: \n     ``: Provided further, That for purposes of pre-disaster \n     mitigation pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 5131 (b) and (c) and 42 \n     U.S.C. 5196 (e) and (i), $5,000,000 of the funds made \n     available under this heading shall be available until \n     expended for project grants for State and local \n     governments.''\n       On page 72, line 1, strike ``$2,513,200,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``$2,503,200,000.''\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I wish to bring to my colleagues' \nattention that this amendment is Mikulski-Daschle-Bond amendment. It is \nbeing offered in concurrence with the chairman of the committee.\n  What this does is provide funding for empowerment zones, the \n``America Reads'' initiative and FEMA disaster mitigation.\n  I want to note that the money that we provide is indeed a modest \nfund, but it, indeed, enables us to state that these are three \npriorities we wanted to consider in the appropriations, that we would \nhave normally had a larger funding had the budget agreement not given \nus such a skimpy allocation.\n  What does this amendment do?\n  It provides $25 million to HUD for a new round of empowerment zones \nand enterprise communities.\n  It also provides $20 million for the America Reads initiative at the \nCorporation for National Service.\n  And it provides $5 million for FEMA's predisaster mitigation program.\n  Mr. President, while this amendment provides funding for these three \nseparate programs, we must remember that each of these three programs \nhave in common, namely, that they really do directly assist the \nresidents of our Nation with their day-to-day needs.\n  First, Mr. President, this amendment, in providing $25 million for a \nsecond round of empowerment zones and enterprise communities, would \npromote job creation and economic development in economically \ndistressed urban and rural areas.\n  I am sure that we would all agree this is a critical need. \nUnfortunately, probably every Senator here has an area in their State \nthat is economically distressed--urban, rural, or both.\n  The first round of the program covered American communities of which \n72 urban and 23 rural communities were either designated empowerment \nzones or enterprise communities.\n  Mr. President, what this money actually goes for, though, is job \ncreation, economic development, job training, and empowerment of local \nresidents. The empowerment zone is not a quick fix, but it does offer \nopportunity and hope.\n  In the area of America Reads, this amendment also provides $20 \nmillion for the America Reads initiative. This money would support \n1,300 additional Corporation members who would serve as tutor \ncoordinators. These tutor coordinators would provide direct tutoring \nand help mobilize and coordinate thousands of tutors to work with young \nchildren across the country.\n  What is the purpose of the America Reads initiative? It is to help \nwith local school systems to make sure that every child in the United \nStates can read by the time they are in the third grade.\n  It is the administration's policy, and I know supported on a \nbipartisan basis, that we want to see every child in the United States \nof America immunized by the time they are 2, screened and school-ready \nby the time they are 6, can read by the time they are in the third \ngrade, and know how to use and have access to a computer by the time \nthey are 12. That would enable our children to be ready for the 21st \ncentury.\n  But let us be clear. It is not the Federal Government's job to \nsupplant local school systems. What the America Reads initiative does \nis mobilize volunteer efforts, provide the infrastructure to be able to \ngreatly utilize volunteers and, in addition to local school efforts, to \nhelp our kids read. In no way will it supplant local school efforts nor \nlocal school board policies. So it will be one of the better of the \nFederal and local partnerships.\n  Mr. President, also, let us turn to Federal predisaster mitigation. I \nnote that the Presiding Officer is from Pennsylvania. We have sure \nlived through a lot of floods the last 2 years. And it has been \nwonderful when FEMA has been able to respond ``911'' to our States. I \nknow what Missouri endured, what our colleagues in the Dakotas and 12 \nother States did.\n  But, you know, some Federal funds used wisely could actually prevent \ndamage to either personal property or\n\n[[Page S7831]]\n\nsmall business if we did some infrastructure planning. What this \namendment does is provide $5 million for predisaster mitigation \nactivities at FEMA.\n  Last year, we provided $2 million for a pilot program identifying \ncommunities that could benefit from the money and build on it. Mr. \nPresident, this is a modest amount of money, but I believe will help \ntremendously in the future.\n  In California, if we insist that earthquake standards are met, it \nthen saves money when an earthquake hits.\n  In Dade County, the officials there have a mitigation program to \nprotect structures against hurricane force winds.\n  And in my own State of Maryland, we had a unique partnership between \nthe Governor of the State of Maryland and the Corps of Engineers to do \na flood mitigation task force up in western Maryland where Pennsylvania \nand West Virginia coincide, and, in the area of the great floods, \ncollided.\n  So, Mr. President, this modest amount of money would really go a long \nway in helping us assess what we need to do to protect small business \nand personal property. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, \nand I believe a dollar's worth of prevention will ultimately help us \nsave $100 in disaster relief.\n  Mr. President, as I stated, this amendment provides funding for three \nimportant programs:\n  First, the amendment provides $25 million to HUD for a new round of \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities.\n  The amendment also provides $20 million for America Reads Initiative \nactivities at the Corporation for National Service.\n  And the amendment provides $5 million for FEMA's predisaster \nmitigation program.\n  Mr. President, while this amendment provides funding for three \nseparate programs, we must remember what each of these programs have in \ncommon, namely, they all aim to directly assist residents of our great \nNation.\n  First Mr. President, this amendment would provide $25 million for a \nnew round of empowerment zones and enterprise communities administered \nby the Department of Housing and Urban Development.\n  The first round of empowerment zones were awarded in December 1994. \nThe goal is to promote job creation and economic development in \neconomically distressed urban and rural areas.\n  I am sure we would all agree this is a critical need. Unfortunately, \nprobably every Senator in here has an area in their State that is an \neconomically distressed area--urban, rural, or both.\n  The first round of the program covered a wide range of American \ncommunities. Seventy-two urban areas and 33 rural communities were \ndesignated empowerment zones or enterprise communities.\n  There are currently eight urban empowerment zones and three rural \nempowerment zones. There are also 4 enhanced enterprise communities and \n93 enterprise communities.\n  Each empowerment zone received $100 million--Los Angeles received \n$125 million. Cleveland $90 million--each enhanced enterprise community \nreceived $25 million, and the 93 enterprise communities received $3 \nmillion.\n  This money can be used for job creation and economic development \nactivities--such as building renovations and infrastructure \nimprovements. The money can also be used to provide services such as \nchild care, job training and transportation for residents in the zones.\n  In addition to the grant money, in each empowerment zone and \nenterprise community, employers are eligible for wage tax credits worth \n$3,000 for every employee hired who lives in the empowerment zone. The \nprogram is not just about moving employees from one location to \nanother, it is also about providing employers incentives to help \nunemployed and underemployed zone residents.\n  We are talking about a hand up, not a hand out. The tax credit \nprovision is designed to provide an opportunity structure, a chance to \nwork hard and earn a decent living.\n  Empowerment zones and enterprise communities are also eligible for \nvarious other benefits including tax-exempt bond financing and tax \nwriteoffs for depreciating personal property.\n  Mr. President, the empowerment zone program is not a quick fix. Many \nof the communities are ones that have suffered for years from high \nunemployment, high crime, and other problems. The program is a 10-year \neffort that required partnerships between community residents, local \nand State governments, and local businesses.\n  A recent GAO report noted that the zones have made some progress. The \nreport notes that there is still work to be done, but the effort is \nprogressing. The key is that the program is making progress and its \ndeficiencies are ones that can be addressed.\n  In its own assessment of the empowerment zones and enterprise \ncommunities, HUD notified five communities that they were not making \nsufficient progress. These communities risk having future funding \nwithdrawn. The point is that this is not some HUD program run wild. \nThere are standards and expectations that are being measured.\n  Mr. President, the empowerment zone program is a good mix of \nRepublican and Democratic ideas--tax incentives to leverage private \ndollars and community involvement in decisionmaking.\n  Mr. President, this amendment also provides $20 million for the \nAmerica Reads Initiative at the Corporation for National Service. This \nmoney would support approximately 1,300 additional corporation members \nwho would serve as tutor coordinators.\n  These tutor coordinators would provide direct tutoring and help to \nmobilize and coordinate thousands of tutors to work with young children \nacross the country.\n  The America Reads initiative is an administration effort that is \ntruly worthy of bipartisan support. The goal is simple--every child in \nthe Nation should be able to read independently and read well by the \nthird grade. A simple, yet key goal in the effort to ensure that every \nchild is equipped with the basic tools needed to compete in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. President, in 1994, 40 percent of fourth graders failed to attain \nthe basic level of reading on the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress. This is a fact that we can't ignore and must address.\n  Let me be clear, the reading deficiencies of our Nation's children \nwon't be erased with volunteer tutors. There are issues of education \nfunding and the delivery of education that need to be addressed. I am \nunder no illusion that the America Reads initiative is the only answer.\n  But Mr. President, I don't want us to make the perfect enemy of the \ngood. The America Reads initiative is part of the answer. A Cohen, \nKulik and Kulik analysis of 65 published studies showed that quality \ntutoring programs produced positive, though modest effects. Other \nstudies done in Florida and England have found similar results.\n  Mr. President, modest is in the eye of the beholder. If I am rich and \nonly see a modest return on my stock investment, I may be disappointed. \nBut if I am a child who can't read like I should be able to, and \nsomeone helps me improve my reading modestly so that I can understand \nwords on a page, I am probably very happy with my modest gains.\n  Mr. President, there have been many debates about the corporation for \nNational Service. This amendment moves beyond that debate. The program \nwill be funded and will continue to operate. This amendment seeks to \nprovide some additional funding to support corporation activities that \nI am sure we all agree are worthwhile.\n  Finally Mr. President, this amendment also provides $5 million for \npredisaster mitigation activities at FEMA.\n  Mr. President, I don't know if there is a clearer example of ``an \nounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' To put it in \nappropriations terms one might say that ``a dime of prevention is worth \na dollar of cure.''\n  Currently, FEMA provides postdisaster mitigation money to \ncommunities--up to 15 percent of the amount they received for disaster \nrecovery efforts. This money is important and necessary, but its' flaw \nis that it comes after a disaster has struck.\n  Last year, the VA-HUD bill provides FEMA $2 million to begin a pilot \nprogram identifying communities that could benefit from predisaster \nmitigation money. This amendment seeks to\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\nprovide money that would expand on that effort.\n  Unfortunately, every Senators' State has likely placed a ``911'' call \nto FEMA. Many times, there is nothing that we can do to escape nature's \nfury. However, all to often, there are things that we can do to reduce \nthe risk to life and property. From making sure buildings meet proper \nstandards to moving structures out of high-risk areas, there are things \nwe can do.\n  Retrofitting a bridge in California to meet earthquake standards \ncosts about $31 a square foot. Replacing a bridge that didn't meet \nstandards would cost about $135 per square foot.\n  In Dade County, FL, officials have a mitigation program designed to \nprotect structures from hurricane force winds. A cost-benefit analysis \nshowed that for every $1 dollar in mitigation money invested to protect \nan emergency housing center, $5 in future damage relief costs are \nlikely saved.\n  Mr. President, there are other examples I could site. The point is \nthat the predisaster mitigation program is ultimately about saving \nlives, saving communities, and saving taxpayers' money.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this amendment. It is designed to help provide opportunity \nstructures and economic development for our Nation's distressed urban \nand rural communities through the empowerment zone and enterprise \ncommunities program.\n  The amendment also provides support for the critical America Read \ninitiative--designed to help ensure that all of the Nation's children \ncan read properly by the fourth grade.\n  Finally, the amendment provides support to a predisaster mitigation \nprogram designed to save lives, save communities and save taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  Mr. President, I believe this amendment addresses concerns that \ntranscend party lines. It is designed to support programs that directly \nimpact the citizens of our Nation.\n  I want to especially thank Senator Daschle for his support, and \nSenator Bond for his willingness to work with me on this important \neffort. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I hope that we can move expeditiously and adopt this \namendment and make a great step forward in giving empowerment and help \nto our local communities.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to rise in support \nof the amendment and be a cosponsor with the Senator from Maryland and \nthe Senator from South Dakota.\n  As indicated, it has a modest amount of funding, $25 million, for HUD \nempowerment zones, $20 million for America Reads and $5 million for \nFEMA disaster mitigation. The funding is offset with budget authority \nfrom section 8 contract amendments, and the outlays are off set from \nthe NASA mission support account, if anybody cares, but it is offset. \nAnd we particularly thank Senators Mikulski and Daschle for working \ntogether to make this a good bipartisan bill.\n  While the funding for this amendment is modest, I emphasize that it \ncovers a number of important issues, from child literacy to disaster \nmitigation to the economic development of distressed communities \nthrough empowerment zones. While I have some concerns about how \nprograms are set up and authorized, this, I think, is a very \nconstructive way to move the bill forward.\n  Let me address the question of America Reads. We do not yet know the \nfull outlines of the program the President is considering. I hope he \nwill send forth authorizing legislation. That is the best way to do it, \nI think, is to get legislation establishing the parameters of the \nprogram. But let me say how important the objective is. The objective \nis to get people to read to small children, parents to read to their \nchildren. Officials in schools are engaged in teaching reading, but \ncaregivers in day care centers and elsewhere must read to children.\n  As one who has spent a lot of time working on early childhood \ndevelopment--and I have to say that our national award-winning and \nrecognized Missouri Parents as Teachers Program has demonstrated how \neffective this can be--I believe that reading to children from the \nyoungest age gets their interest, their attention, and their enthusiasm \nin the written word, and puts them on to a lifetime of reading, which \nwill open up opportunities, knowledge, information, and great joy for \ntheir entire lifetime.\n  If there is one thing that is the thread that seems to hold together \nall of the successful programs of getting children off to a good start, \nit is reading to them. It is communicating to them from the written \nword and attracting their attention to the written word as a means of \ncommunication.\n  Were we not in the middle of a very, very important process to pass \nthis appropriations measure, I could talk a lot longer about the \nimportance of reading to very young children. Let me just say that \nreading to young children--there is no finer objective. The money we \nhave appropriated here is a symbol of the importance that we place on \nthis activity.\n  The VA-HUD appropriations bill is a very tight allocation. We have \nhad to have difficult funding choices. I hope that we made good \nconsensus choices for what most Members consider the primary needs and \nconcerns facing the VA-HUD are. I hope, however, that this amendment \nwill keep the dialog moving on a path to enactment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I do not see any other Senators wishing to \nspeak on this amendment, certainly not in opposition to it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I'd like to congratulate Senator Mikulski \non her amendment providing $20 million for America Reads under the VA-\nHUD Appropriations Act.\n  There is no more important skill we can give young people in this \ncountry than the ability to read. If a child can read quickly and \naccurately early in her school career, all other challenges will be \nmuch easier for them in school and in life.\n  I have been working for some time to bring literacy issues before the \nSenate, from the amendment Senator Simon and I offered to last year's \nwelfare bill, to my work on the Appropriations Committee, to the \neducational briefings I host for congressional staff.\n  Recently, these briefings have included information from Dr. Reid \nLyon from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. \nWe now know from the research that the process of reading involves \nseveral steps. A student must acquire skills in a logical progression, \nand in a timely manner, in order to be able to read quickly and \neffectively enough to make sense of what she reads. Once this process \nhas occurred, reading becomes a tool for learning. If this process does \nnot occur, the prospect of helping her learn to read becomes much more \ndifficult.\n  This and other evidence from research must inform what we do with \nregard to children's literacy. We must assure that we take advantage of \nthe political will to improve children's literacy, by putting into \nplace a national effort that reflects what we know. It must reflect \nwhat we know about how children learn, how important family literacy is \nto the literacy of the child, and what we know about how volunteer \nefforts work in our communities, among other things.\n  In order to build a successful volunteer effort, which must be part \nof what we do for children's literacy, we need to look at all the \naspects of the effort. In what capacity will volunteers be working with \nstudents? How will the primary reading teacher be involved? What about \nreading specialists? How will research inform what happens in the \nclassroom, or in afterschool or summer programs using volunteers? Where \nwill we find volunteers in communities already taxed for help? How will \nthey be trained in providing literacy assistance, in recruiting \nvolunteers, or in coordinating community programs?\n  By simply including AmeriCorps in our efforts to improve children's \nliteracy, we don't answer all of these questions, but we do answer \nsome. We do call on experience already in our communities--in training, \nrecruiting, and coordinating volunteers, in providing programs that \nhelp people learn to read, and to gain success in other areas of their \nlives. We do call on an incredible resource for improving people's \nengagement in their communities, and for improving their skills.\n\n[[Page S7833]]\n\n  Literacy AmeriCorps has been very successful in my home State of \nWashington, in doing things like setting up talk times for people with \nlimited English proficiency to talk with one another in English, and \npractice what they are learning with other people, on topics that \ninterest them. Community support is there--and that gives us a great \nbase to expand on as we look to improve children's literacy.\n  AmeriCorps has demonstrated success in many areas across the country; \nnow it is time to enlist AmeriCorps in our efforts to help children \nlearn to read. AmeriCorps is a much-needed ally in a complicated, \ndifficult, and crucial endeavor.\n  Again, I want to congratulate Senator Mikulski on her amendment, and \nencourage all of the Members of the Senate to work with us to improve \nchildren's literacy this year.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let us move for its adoption.\n  Mr. BOND. I think we are prepared to move to its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 951) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 944\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I think the time has come for us to move on \nto the Bumpers amendment.\n  I will propose a unanimous-consent request that would set the vote \nfor 5:30. We would ask for Senator Bumpers to be allocated 15 minutes \nin support of his amendment. We would ask for 45 minutes in opposition \nto the amendment. The ranking member and I have had numerous requests, \nand we would try to parcel out that 45 minutes as best we can.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Reserving the right to object, I have just been advised \nthat the full Committee on Appropriations is running late, and Senator \nBumpers is running a bit late. While we are checking when he thinks he \nwill come to the floor, I ask the chairman to withdraw the UC.\n  I have been waiting to speak on the space station. By the time I \nconclude my remarks, we should know when Senator Bumpers will be here. \nThe delay is only because of the full committee markup.\n  Is that OK?\n  Mr. BOND. If the ranking member will yield, I was going to ask if she \nwould speak. I was hoping that we could charge that time off of the \nhour. In other words, if we start now on the debate, the Senator from \nMaryland can speak as long as she wishes until somebody else wants to \ncome.\n  Are we prepared to do a unanimous-consent?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The answer is no, not for the 5:30 vote.\n  Mr. BOND. Well, then, Mr. President, I will withdraw all pending \nunanimous-consent requests and advise my colleague that I will start my \nwatch now, and when we get people here for a unanimous-consent, I will \nsubtract from 1 hour the number of minutes that we have used in \ndiscussion not under the unanimous consent request.\n  I look forward to hearing the comments by my ranking member in \nsupport of the space station.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I think that is a prudent course in which to proceed. The full \ncommittee markup was delayed because the committee was late going into \nsession because of our moving ahead on military construction.\n  I do want to speak about the space station and began my remarks at \nthe conclusion of the Senator from Arkansas's proposal.\n  But, Mr. President, before I give my remarks, what is the pending \nbusiness before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the Bumpers amendment \nNo. 944.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President. We laid it aside. I \ndid not know if we had come back to it.\n  Mr. President, I rise again this year in support of America's space \nprogram and in opposition to the Bumpers amendment, which would strike \nfunding for the space station.\n  I have said this before, and I will say it again: This amendment is a \nchoice between the future and the past. The question is, what kind of \ncountry will the United States of America be in the 21st century? Will \nwe be one that uses technology to help people with their day-to-day \nlives and keep America employed in the field of manufacturing? Then, if \nthe answer to that is yes, we must embrace science, we must embrace \ntechnology, and we must be willing to take bold risks in scientific \nendeavors. That is what the space station is all about.\n\n  We need to ask ourselves, will we use American ingenuity and know-how \nthrough the unique environment of space to tackle our understanding of \ndisease or develop new technologies that can be used here at home.\n  Yesterday, probably one of the most distinguished Americans and one \nof the most distinguished U.S. Senators, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, \nspoke eloquently about America's space program from not only the time \nhe rocketed around the Earth making world history but talking about the \nkind of scientific breakthroughs that are coming out of our space \nprogram. Right this very moment, little Sojourner is moving around \nMars, gathering important information. We have done it in a way that is \nfaster, cheaper and quicker than any other space project that we have \ndone with such a big bang in terms of scientific information. Why are \nwe able now to be able to move with such speed? It is because we have \nmade such significant investments in projects like the space shuttle \nand the space station.\n  Some will argue that science carried out on the space station can \nreally be accomplished more cost-effectively on the planet Earth. This \nsimply is not true. The science proposed for the station cannot be \naccomplished on Earth at any price or at any time. Space station \nscience requires sustained access to something called low levels of \ngravitational force. It is technologically impossible to create a low-\ngravity environment for this type of research without getting out there \nand being in orbit. What are these types of research? One is \nmicrogravity. The benefits of microgravity research may be numerous, \nincluding new and more pure pharmaceuticals, medical advancements, the \nproduction of new materials to use on Earth, new fire-resistant \nmaterials, new fire retardation. Just think, we might come up with a \nwhole new concept for building supplies that can make our homes, \nschools, hospitals and nursing homes safe for fire.\n  Others will say, why not do this science on the shuttle? Why do you \nneed to go in orbit and stay out there in orbit? I want to bring this \npoint to their attention. The shuttle can stay up in orbit, max, about \n2 weeks. We do not limit cancer researchers to 2 weeks in a lab at NIH \nto find a cure for a devastating disease. Why should we limit the life \nsciences to only 2 weeks in space? Much of the proposed research will \ntake months, if not years, to complete.\n  Now, even though the astronauts might come back, the space science \ncan continue to stay up in those racks on the space station. Remember \nwhat the space station is--it is not a station, it is a laboratory. It \nis not a station like a gas station, like a subway station. It is, \nliterally, a laboratory in the sky that will have modules run by \ndifferent countries. Japan, Canada, the European Space Agency, we are \nnow in cooperation with the Russians--they will be planning part of the \nevacuation vehicle, and primarily the control of the station will be in \nthe hands of an American astronaut. It is truly international and it \nwill be truly profound.\n  While working on this issue, we wanted to be sure that we had \nadequate, maximum, robust participation from the NIH with the National \nSpace Agency. We encouraged and then literally brought about a joint \nagreement between the National Institutes of Health and NASA.\n  Just a few years ago, Mr. Dan Goldin, the Administrator at NASA, Dr. \nBernadine Healy, who was appointed by President Bush to be head of NIH \nat the Space Museum, signed a memorandum of understanding making sure \nthat NIH and NASA are collaborating on life science research and also \nthat we get maximum benefits from the space station.\n\n[[Page S7834]]\n\n  One of the arguments that we hear every year is about cost. Sure, the \nspace station does cost money. We have heard that GAO estimated that \nthe station would cost $90 billion. That is what the Senator from \nArkansas had in his info chart this morning. However, I want to say to \nmy colleagues and to those who have been following this all day, that \nnumber is misleading. When calculating the total cost, the GAO included \na large portion of the NASA human space flight budget in its analysis. \nThe fact is that $51 billion of the $94 billion is for shuttle missions \nthat will fly, regardless of whether we have the station or not. Those \nshuttles have missions to do and they are going to go anyway. So that \nfigure is misleading. The real cost of the station, which includes \nfinal development and construction over a 10-year period is about $30 \nbillion. No small change, but it is not $94 billion. The remaining \nbalance of the erroneous $94 billion estimate is life science and \nmicrogravity research. This research will continue, in less effective \nform on the shuttle, with or without the space station.\n\n  Now, what is the cost to America if we do not do the station? We hear \nabout the cost to maintain it, to build it. Well, the United States of \nAmerica has already invested $9 billion in the redesign of the space \nstation. What does that mean? The actual work on the space station \nmeans there are 15,000 highly skilled engineering and production \ncontract jobs directly supporting the space station. There are 35,000 \ncontract workers and 5,000 civil servants who work on the shuttle whose \nmajor customer for the foreseeable future is the space station. And \n2,000 pounds of hardware have already been built for the U.S. portion \nof the station.\n  As mentioned earlier, long-duration microgravity research and cell \nand developmental biology, human physiology, biotech, fluid physics, \ncombustion science, materials science, benchmark physics, as well as an \nunderstanding of Earth-based diseases are the core of what is the \nresearch. Biotech, combustion science, material science, and then, \nindeed, one of the most basic of all sciences, increased knowledge of \nphysics. There will be practical applications of what we do. We cannot \nlist every single one of those right this minute but we do know that we \nwill be well on our way for materials research and life science \nresearch.\n  Mr. President, what else do we lose? U.S. credibility with our \ninternational partners. Russia, Japan, Europe, and Canada have already \ninvested more than half of the $9 billion they have committed to the \nspace station. This is a great symbol of the post-cold war era in which \nformer arch rivals in space are now working together to build a space \nstation for the 21st century.\n  U.S. competitiveness can only be maintained by continuing the long-\nterm, cutting edge, high risk R that is an essential part to the \nspace station development. The momentum gained with the June delivery \nof something called Node 1 to the Kennedy Space Center marking the \nbeginning of a stream of flight elements that will continue for the \nnext 5 years.\n  And finally, we lose all of the hard work that has gone into this \nproject since the 1980's and the opportunity to see it culminate on the \nfirst launch, now less than a year away.\n  Mr. President, we could argue these points all night but I will not \nput my friends through this discussion. The bill is already taking a \nsubstantial amount of debate time. We will soon vote on the Bumpers \namendment, and I am asking every Senator to think long and hard about \nwhat this amendment means. I really urge my colleagues to reject the \nBumpers amendment.\n  At the same time, I want to acknowledge the effort made by the \nSenator from Arkansas. Over the last few years when he has pushed for \neliminating the space station from the budget, it has forced us to do \nseveral things, including taking a good, long hard look at the cost and \nmaking sure we were getting our money's worth, to take a good long hard \nresearch look at the research to make sure we could not do it someplace \nelse faster, quicker and cheaper. The answer, though, is no, we must do \nthis research if we are going to do it at all in space.\n  I believe the Senator from Arkansas has made, indeed, a national \ncontribution by forcing us to relook at the space station and to \njustify why we do need the space station. So we thank him for his \nnational leadership on that.\n  Mr. President, I really do believe that to vote to remove the space \nstation now will really be a terrible blow to America's space station. \nMr. President, I am going to urge the defeat of the Bumpers amendment \nand to once again be able to stay the course, complete the space \nstation and move this country and the space station into the 21st \ncentury.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in order to sequence these amendments, we \nhad advised the Senator from New York that we could accommodate him. I \nbelieve he needs 5 minutes and I need 1 minute, and then we would \nreturn to the Senator from Arkansas for his comments and then proceed \nto a vote after 15 minutes, if we would reserve 30 minutes for this \nside. With that understanding let me try again on a unanimous consent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Bumpers amendment be set \naside, that the Senator from New York be recognized to offer an \namendment for 5 minutes, that I be recognized for 1 minute; that on the \ndisposition of the amendment offered by the Senator from New York, that \nthere be 15 minutes of debate under the control of Senator Bumpers and \n30 minutes of debate under the control of myself or Senator Mikulski, \nand that no amendments be in order to the amendment offered by Senator \nBumpers. I further ask that following the conclusion or yielding back \nof time, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the Bumpers \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 952\n\n    (Purpose: To require reports by the Comptroller General on the \n   allocation of health care resources of the Department of Veterans \n Affairs under the Veterans Integrated Service Network system and the \n             Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation system)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Moynihan, and Mr. Torricelli, proposes an amendment numbered \n     952.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 16, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n       Sec. 108. (a) Not later than 4 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit \n     to Congress a report on the allocation of health care \n     resources by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs under the \n     Veterans Integrated Service Network system and the Veterans \n     Equitable Resource Allocation System. The report shall \n     address the following:\n       (1) The manner in which health care resources (including \n     personnel and funds) are allocated under the Veterans \n     Integrated Service Network system and the Veterans Equitable \n     Resource Allocation system.\n       (2) Whether or not the allocation of health care resources \n     under the systems takes into account the disproportionate \n     number of veterans with special needs who reside in the \n     northeastern United States.\n       (3) The effect of the allocation of health care resources \n     under the systems on the quality of health care services \n     provided by the Secretary to veterans who reside in the \n     northeastern United States.\n       (4) The effect of the allocation of health care resources \n     under the systems on the access to health care services \n     provided by the Secretary to veterans who reside in the \n     northeastern United States.\n       (b) Not later than 4 months after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Comptroller General shall also submit to \n     Congress a report on the effect of the reform of the \n     eligibility of veterans for health care services under title \n     I of Public Law 104-262 (110 Stat. 3178), and the amendments \n     made by that title, on the quality of and access to health \n     care provided by the Secretary to veterans who reside in the \n     northeastern United States.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. First, I thank Chairman Bond and the ranking minority \nmember, Senator Mikulski, for their tremendous leadership in developing \nthis appropriations bill. I fully recognize the fiscal restraints under \nwhich the subcommittee must work to achieve our budgetary goals, and I \ncommend them for effectively weighing\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\nour national priorities with those constraints.\n  I file this amendment on behalf of my colleagues, Senator Moynihan, \nSenator Lautenberg, and Senator Torricelli, because we have in the New \nYork-New Jersey region a very difficult pressing problem.\n  I rise today on behalf of New York's 1.7 million veterans, in \nparticular, to address the expected loss of $180 million in veterans' \nhealth care funding over the next 3 years. What this amendment does is \nseek to ensure that the funding reallocation for the Veterans Equitable \nResource Allocation System, known as VERA, is distributed in a fair and \nreasonable manner. I want to respond to specific concerns with the data \nused by the VA to determine the allocation of health care resources to \nour Nation's veterans.\n  This amendment would require the General Accounting Office to conduct \na 4-month study, examining the factors relied upon by VERA and the \nVeterans Integrated Service Network to distribute health care funds.\n  The study will focus on the following characteristics which are \nsignificant to New York, New Jersey, and to our veterans in the \nNortheast: First, the high number of special needs veterans residing in \nthe Northeast States; second, the impact of eligibility reform on \nveterans; and third, the quality and accessibility of health care in \nthe northeast region.\n  In addition, the amendment would direct the Veterans Administration \nto fund all VISN's at their fiscal year 1996 level until the GAO study \nis received by the VA-HUD appropriations subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, it is absolutely crucial for our veterans in New York \nthat the factors I have just listed be considered by the VA as the VERA \nsystem continues to be implemented.\n  It is imperative that the results of any GAO assessment of this VERA \nsystem being incorporated as soon as it is practicable because, without \nsuch consideration, the New York VA medical system could continue to \nsuffer grievously. The effects of such a substantial funding cut--$180 \nmillion over 3 years--are something that we are very concerned about. \nFor instance, a loss of VA services seems likely to have resulted in \nreduced levels of care. Two of New York's VA facilities, Montrose and \nCastlepoint, as well as others throughout the region, have suffered \nrepeatedly. There are examples of poor care due to their ongoing merger \nunder this system. Montrose and Castlepoint, two of the hospitals \nlocated in the Hudson Valley, have experienced skyrocketing mortality \nrates in both institutions. In addition, extremely poor health care and \nneglectful sanitary conditions have also been reported at both \nfacilities, including: misdiagnosed infections and heart attacks; moldy \nsuction tubes; patients lying for hours at a time in their own waste; \nand, in one report, a man dying for lack of a doctor as physicians \nconduct a meeting without their beepers.\n  Question: Is this as a result of a lack of proper care? We have to \nfind out the truth and be sure that the massive restructuring and \nrelocation of resources is done fairly but safely.\n  Mr. President, we are extremely concerned with concerned the effects \nof the VERA system on veterans health care in our Northeastern States. \nThat is why I offer this amendment.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my friend and colleague from New \nYork as a cosponsor of this amendment out of deep concern about the \neffects of the VERA initiative. Not only were the two biggest cuts in \nthe Nation taken from the two VA service networks in New York, but New \nYork was selected to go first, to be the guinea pig for the new \nprogram. The results are alarming. Since the merger of the hospitals at \nCastle Point and Montrose in the Hudson Valley, 200 jobs have been \neliminated and the mortality rate is up 80 percent. The acting director \nof the hospitals said this increase is not significant, that there are \nalways ups and downs in the mortality rate. That may be, but when there \nis so dramatic an increase during so dramatic a staff cut, we have to \nstop what is going on and take a careful look. This is not an isolated \nexample. I have similar reports from Canandaigua and other VA \nfacilities around the State.\n  One of the Veterans Health Administration's guiding principles with \nVERA is that ``the decrease in overall costs shall not compromise the \ncare given to its veteran population.'' In New York we have empirical \nevidence that this principle has been trampled underfoot. I join my \ncolleagues in asking that the General Accounting Office begin an \ninvestigation immediately into the quality of care being given to \nveterans under the constraints of the VERA formula, with particular \nattention being given to the two New York service networks. I hope the \nSenators from Missouri and Maryland will support this request.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support this amendment and am \npleased to be an original cosponsor of this effort to require the \nGeneral Accounting Office [GAO] to report to Congress on the effects of \nthe VA's veterans equitable resource allocation [VERA] system. I \nsupport the effort to fund all veterans health care networks at least \nat the fiscal year 1996 level until this report is complete.\n  As a member of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I voted \nagainst the implementation of VERA because I believe it would unfairly \nshift veterans health care resources away from New Jersey at a time \nwhen our aging veterans population has an increasing need for VA health \ncare services. New Jersey's veterans fought hard for our country and \nthey deserve direct access to quality medical care. I share the concern \nof many of my Northeastern colleagues that the VERA system may \ndisproportionally affect our veterans access to quality health care \nservices.\n  This amendment makes sense. It requires the GAO to report to Congress \non the effects of VERA. It allows for a pause in the shifting of \nresources, which began in April, until Congress is certain that VERA \nwill not hurt veterans in the Northeast. If the study shows that VERA \nwill disrupt health care services to veterans in New Jersey and other \nNortheastern States, Congress will have the information necessary to \nensure that these services are not compromised. Until Congress has this \ninformation, services should be provided at the pre-VERA levels. We \nshould pause and assess the impact before moving forward with VERA. I \nhope the chairman and ranking member will include this provision, or \none similar to it, in the final version of this bill.\n\n\n             veterans equitable resource allocation program\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \namendment offered by Senator D'Amato, which would protect funding \nlevels for veterans' health care in New York and New Jersey. I \nunderstand that the amendment has been withdrawn, however, I appreciate \nthe assurances given by Senators Bond and Mikulski that the \nsubcommittee will give this request the serious consideration it \ndeserves when this issue is raised in conference.\n  I, and my colleagues from New Jersey and New York, are very concerned \nabout a Department of Veterans' Affairs [VA] initiative which would \nchange the way the agency distributes health care funds to veterans' \nhospitals. During the next 3 years, the Veterans Equitable Resource \nAllocation [VERA] Program is projected to divert as much as $148 \nmillion away from our region and send it to Sun Belt States in the \nSouth and West, whose veteran populations are increasing.\n  I have heard from many of the 760,000 veterans in New Jersey, all of \nwhom have legitimate fears that this funding shift will reduce the \nquality and availability of veterans' services in our State. Many of \nthese individuals, who have courageously served our Nation overseas in \ncombat, now fear becoming victims of the VA's restructuring and broken \npromises.\n  The impact of this proposal would be devastating in countless \ncommunities across New Jersey. I believe that limiting access to the VA \nhealth care system may jeopardize the well-being and the lives of many \nveterans. This must not be allowed to happen.\n  The House of Representatives has taken a strong stand against the \nVERA plan by including a provision in their VA spending bill which \nwould delay the proposed funding shift for 4 months, while the General \nAccounting Office [GAO] examines the impact of this action on the \nquality of care for veterans in the Northeast. Until the GAO study is \ncompleted, the VA would fund our\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\nregion's health services at 1996 levels, which are $12 million higher \nthan the 1997 levels.\n  I strongly support this course of action, and encourage my colleagues \non the subcommittee to adopt this proposal. We simply need to ensure \nthat while the VA is providing much needed resources to certain \nfacilities, it is not doing so at the expense of veterans in other \nregions. There is no harm in the GAO doing a 4 month study on whether \nthe VA's new funding scheme is equitable. I assure New Jersey's \nveterans that I will continue to monitor the progress of this provision \nas it is debated in the conference committee, and will work to ensure \nthat our veterans receive the health care and services that they \ndeserve.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senators Bond and Mikulski for their \nconsideration of this request and look forward to working with them on \nthis and other issues of importance to the veterans' community.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, both Senators from New York have raised some \nimportant concerns regarding veterans health care in their State. \nClearly, the new resource allocation system has forced some tough \ndecisions in some networks. I believe this system is a vast improvement \nover previous allocation methodologies, and there are some encouraging \nsigns that more veterans are being served in an appropriate manner. It \nmay require some fine-tuning. That is why this committee has asked the \nGeneral Accounting Office to undertake a review of the new allocation \nsystem, as I think the Senators from New York want, including what \naspects of VERA may need improvement to accomplish equity and \nefficiency goals while maintaining quality.\n  The GAO report is due to be completed, I tell the Senator from New \nYork, by September 30. As of today, they seem to be on track toward \nthat deadline. We will work to ensure that they meet it. I think the \nVeterans Administration should take GAO's analysis and recommendations \ninto consideration in making its allocations in fiscal year 1998.\n  In addition, a subsequent GAO report has been requested, which would \nlook at quality of care in specific networks, including New York. Upon \ncompletion of this review, VA should incorporate any recommendations \ninto the allocation methodology.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Bond for his \nresponse. I thank him on behalf of the veterans of New York, New Jersey \nand, indeed, the whole Northeast region. I think we are appreciative of \nhis efforts, and he recognizes the importance of these concerns.\n  In particular, I am appreciative of the Senator's willingness to join \nme in ensuring that the GAO conducts a study which will specifically \nfocus on the impact to the Northeast region.\n  I understand that the Senator will join me in urging the Veterans' \nAdministration to adopt GAO recommendations into its VERA system \nimmediately. And because of the Senator's willingness to ensure that \nthe New York and New Jersey VA health care needs are recognized and \nthat the reallocation system will be fair and equitable, on behalf of \nmyself and my colleagues, I will withdraw this amendment at this time. \nI thank the Senator, and I look forward to continuing to work with him \non our veterans needs.\n  So, Mr. President, I withdraw the amendment, and I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Bond. I look forward to working with him, and I \nthank him for his responsiveness to this need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 952) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York. I assure \nhim that we will work with him. We are now on the time allotted----\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, if I might ask my colleague to indulge me \nfor one more moment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lautenberg's name be added also \nas an original cosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 944\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are now on the time allotted for debate \non the Bumpers amendment on the space station. We have invited those \nMembers who wish to speak in opposition to come forward.\n  I see the Senator from Arkansas on the floor. I ask if he wishes to \nutilize some of his time.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this morning, in my comments I quoted \nProf. Elliott Levinthal, Professor Emeritus of the Stanford School of \nEngineering. This afternoon he faxed me some material which I would \nlike to share with you. ``NASA's present strategic plan is based on the \nfuture human operation of Mars and its eventual colonization, with \nprojected costs of at least many tens of billions, or perhaps more \nrealistically, hundreds of billions.'' I want to thank Professor \nLevinthal for sending that to me because I could not agree with him \nmore.\n\n  As I said this morning, Carl Sagan corrected me the year before last \nwhen I said he was opposed to the space station. I stood corrected. \nWhat he said was that the space station had some merit as a weigh \nstation to go to Mars, but to justify the space station on the grounds \nof medical experimentation was shaky indeed. Now, I have the utmost \nrespect for Carl Sagan. He was a much revered person around here. But I \ndisagree with him about going to Mars.\n  It is not necessary to have a manned mission to Mars in order to \nexplore Mars. We have already discovered that. I complimented NASA this \nmorning on sending the Mars Pathfinder rover to Mars, which is doing a \ntremendous amount of research that may or may not be beneficial to us. \nSome of we laymen who are not astronomers have a very difficult time \nunderstanding some of this. But in any event, I don't believe we ought \nto spend the hundreds of billions that it will take to get to Mars with \na manned exploration, and I don't think the space station ought to be \nlaunched with any--what shall I say--problematical assertions that it \nwill cure cancer, or arthritis, or heart disease, or AIDS, or anything \nelse. Almost every thoughtful person in this country who is in the \nmedical or physics field thinks it is an absurdity to justify this on \nthe basis of medical research.\n  Professor Levinthal goes on to say: ``Leaving aside colonization''--\nthat is, of Mars--``do not be deluded by the thought that the space \nstation is a useful step for the human scientific exploration of Mars. \nIt is a poor investment. Exploration of Mars is a worthwhile and \nexciting goal, but it can be achieved most cost effectively with \nautomated space craft.''\n  He goes on to say: ``I have been involved in consideration of the \npurpose of human missions since the start of the shuttle program. \nCommittee after committee sought to find scientific, technical, \nmilitary, educational, and industrial goals that could be cost-\njustified. None could be found . . .''\n  I repeat, in all of the feverish search for a justification for the \nspace station, whether scientific, technical, military, educational, or \nindustrial, none of them could be justified by the tremendous cost, \nwhich I said this morning will almost certainly exceed $100 billion.\n  Dr. Levinthal goes on to say: ``The pressures the space station are \nputting on Russian investment is decimating Russian support of \nscience.''\n  Now, Mr. President, let me review this chart one more time about the \ncost of the space station. Do not be deceived. Do not be deluded by the \nway NASA chops its figures up. They chop it up into development costs; \nthey chop it up into launch costs; they chop it up into operations \ncosts. Don't worry about that. Just look at this figure right here--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 5 minutes of the Senator have expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 additional minutes.\n  This figure counts. It is $94 billion and soaring. We have finally \nreached the point where the General Accounting Office, this morning, \nsays that cost overruns have begun and show no sign of slackening.\n  What does it take in this body to get somebody's attention? This is \nnot our money. I hear all these lamentations on the floor of the Senate \nabout the poor taxpayer out there and trying to send his children to \nschool and trying to make car payments and make his\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\nhouse payment and how we are going to provide this magnificent $135 \nbillion tax cut for the poor, suffering taxpayer, while, at the same \ntime, adding $94 billion to his tax bill to build a space station from \nwhich we will get no benefit.\n  If that were just Dale Bumpers talking, you need pay no attention. \nBut it is every physical society of every nation who has a dime in it--\nthe Japanese Physical Society, the Canadian Physical Society, the \nEuropean Physical Society, and the American Physical Society. That is \nvirtually 99 percent of all the physicists in the world who oppose this \nthing and say we ought to be spending the money on legitimate medical \nresearch. You are not going to get a cure for warts out of the space \nstation.\n  Every year the National Institutes of Health send billions out in \nresearch grants.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the Bumpers \namendment. As previous chairman and present member of the Subcommittee \non Science, Technology and Space that provides the authorization for \nNASA, I would like to state my support for the space station program \nand the Senate appropriations bill, S. 1034. The Bumpers amendment is \nnot new. This is an annual event here in the Senate like the first day \nof summer in Montana. We always know it is coming but it just never \nhappens.\n  Let me start by saying that I support the missions performed by NASA. \nJust like the pioneers that came to Montana and settled the West, \nexploration in unchartered territories of space is a way to achieve our \ndreams of new beginnings, and visions of a better life. This is clearly \nillustrated by the excitement generated around the world by the Mars \nPathfinder and its Sojourner rover. Every day Americans wake up to \nlearn more information about the Mars' rocks named Scooby-Doo, Yogi, \nand Barnacle Bill. Record numbers of hits on the NASA website have been \nregistered. Why? Because the Mars Pathfinder opens the door to our \nimagination and a new period of exploration.\n  This is not the only accomplishment by NASA within the past year. A \nrock has been found in Antarctica which excited the world with the \npossibility of life on the planet of Mars. The Galileo spacecraft has \nbeamed back the intriguing photos of existence of seas on Jupiter's \nmoon, Europa, again raising speculations of life-related chemicals. \nTechnology is developing, like the X-33 prototype for a new generation \nof reusable launch vehicles, which will increase reliability and lower \nthe costs of putting payloads in space. These endeavors inspire and \nexpand the horizons of the pioneer spirit of all Americans and the \nspace station is part of that endeavor.\n  NASA was created by the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958 to \nundertake civilian research, development, and flight activities in \naeronautics and space. Since its creation, NASA has undertaken a wide \nvariety of successful programs and projects. The idea of a space \nstation is not new. In the 1970's, Skylab provided a station to carry \nout experiments in astronomy, space physics, materials processing, and \nbiomedical research.\n  After its success, NASA began its plans to develop a permanent \norbiting laboratory for conducting life science and microgravity \nresearch and to conduct human exploration of space.\n  Since its original authorization in 1984, the program continues to \nevolve to achieve its admirable goals. Today, it is a partnership \nbetween Canada, Japan, 10 European nations, as well as Russia.\n  I cannot stand here before you today and say that the space station \nis not without problems. We are all aware of these problems and I have \npersonally addressed them over the past several years during oversight \nhearings. We are aware of the risks and problems resulting from the \nRussian participation, the increased costs, and the technical \nchallenges in the space station design. And we will continue to have \nhearings to address these issues and hold NASA accountable.\n  NASA is also aware of these problems and are actively seeking \nsolutions. Mr. Goldin and NASA have been successful in streamlining and \nrestructuring NASA's operations and facilities without compromising \nsafety, productivity, or the goals and missions of the space program. \nMr. Goldin and NASA have been successful in reducing costs, increasing \nefficiency, and living up to his motto of a faster, better, cheaper \nagency. Today, NASA is doing more for less.\n  So today, Mr. President, we again hear the arguments for the \nelimination of the space station. These are arguments to eliminate our \ndreams. Let's retire these arguments once and for all and begin working \ntogether to overcome these difficulties to ensure our future presence \nin space.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank my friend from Missouri. Mr. President, \nthis is an annual thing. It kind of comes like Christmas and every \nother holiday that comes around. We hear from those folks who really \nthink probably this is a great waste of money. We have all stood and \nmarveled at the expedition to Mars. It came in under budget and was \ndone in less time. But that is 300 million miles from where we stand \ntoday. When America does not dream, or fails to reach out, then we \nbecome a stagnant people.\n  Right now, as we speak, there is a reenactment of the Mormon Trail \nthat was blazed from Omaha, NE, to the great Salt Lake Valley. Using \nthe same mentality, we would still be driving the same vehicles now \nthat carried those folks westbound across Nebraska and Wyoming and into \nUtah.\n  Let me start off by saying that I support the missions performed by \nNASA. I am from Montana, so I don't have a big stake in what NASA does, \nfrom the standpoint of my home State of Montana. But I will tell you \nthat when we reach out and explore the unknown--where we are going now \nis a little more than just a wagon train from Omaha to Salt Lake City. \nWe have seen it clearly illustrated this week and the excitement \ngenerated around the world by the Mars Pathfinder and its Sojourner \nrecovery. Every day Americans wake up to learn more information about \nthe Mars rocks named ``Scooby-Doo'' and ``Yogi'' and ``Barnacle Bill.''\n  More than anything else, when we talk about NASA, there is another \nlittle program that catches the eye and support of the American people \ncalled Mission Planet Earth. With our new technologies in sensoring, we \nknow more about this piece of mud that we are whipping through space on \ncalled Earth. We have done it because somebody dared to dream and \nsomebody dared to do it.\n  I do not think the American people, this society should back off from \nthe challenges of exploring space. And, yes, the space station is a \npart of that.\n  Now, I chaired the authorizing committee on science, technology and \nspace--NASA. We changed this a little bit differently. We went out to \nseek partnerships, and we got some commitments, but maybe it is kind of \nlike the chicken and the egg. Maybe we are also put to the test. Can we \ndo it? Can we captain it? I think we can. It is American know-how, it \nis American technology that has put us where we are. And we do not know \nwhat the benefits are. I would guess there are probably a lot of \ndigital wristwatches around here on a lot of people's arms that were \nthe result of the space program--new composites. We know more about \nEarth. We know a lot more about everything that is not written up in \nnewspapers every day because newspapers would rather print those \nnegative kinds of things, I guess.\n  We changed the way we were going to complete the challenge of a space \nstation because we have a lot of things to learn before we go the extra \nstep--not back to the Moon but before we go into deeper space, and so \nthat is why we have a little rover up there on Mars telling us a lot \nabout that planet, the red planet.\n  We changed our tactics because we had one primary contractor, and now \nwe have the hardware that is ready to go to start building this so that \nwe may take the next step into space.\n  So I tell my colleagues on this floor that we have changed the whole \nmission of NASA, and, yes, we have brought the costs down at NASA \nalmost a third just in the time that I have been in this Senate, so we \nare getting there quicker, under budget and\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\nusing less money and collecting more knowledge and technology as we \nmove along.\n  Dan Goldin, who is the Administrator of NASA, has done a wonderful \njob in repairing----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. A bureaucracy that was almost without a mission. Now we \nhave a mission. I strongly oppose the Bumpers amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I know we have had a somewhat confused \nschedule and there are a number of Senators who have sought recognition \nand would like to speak on this. I hope that their schedules will \npermit them to be here. In the meantime, I thought it would be helpful \nsince we have heard various scientists quoted to give just an idea of a \nfew of the benefits of space research.\n  First, in biotechnology, microgravity allows researchers to produce \nsuperior protein crystals for drug development and to grow three-\ndimensional tissues including cancer tumors for research and cartilage \nfor possible transplant, and as a result people like Nobel laureate \nHerbert Hauptman addressed the biomedical research caucus of Congress \non the value of orbital research for biomedicine and said, ``I strongly \nsupport space research and the development of the space station.''\n  Dr. T. L. Nagabhushan, Ph.D., vice president of biotechnology and \ndevelopment for Schering-Plough Research Institute, said\n\n       I view the space shuttle program as a stepping stone to the \n     ultimate program that will guarantee prolonged efforts in \n     microgravity. Ultimately, our hope is to be able to \n     crystallize proteins in microgravity, conduct all x ray data \n     collection experiments in space and transmit the data to \n     Earth for processing. This can only be done in a space \n     station.\n\n  Dr. Jeanne L. Becker, assistant professor, department of obstetrics \nand gynecology at the University of South Florida, said\n\n       The application of microgravity technology toward the \n     development of tissue models has far-reaching potential for \n     advancing cancer research. Like many of the new and \n     innovative technologies, including gene therapy and \n     immune-based treatment, space-based research must be \n     continued and expanded in order to apply the benefits of \n     this technology to the rapidly advancing area of health \n     sciences.\n\n  Dr. Milburn Jessup, Deaconess Hospital, Harvard Medical School, said\n\n       The space program offers a chance to improve our models of \n     cancer and to develop new drugs and treatment as well as to \n     gain knowledge about how cancer spreads. The space program \n     has provided a breakthrough in tools for cancer research. We \n     feel this is the tip of the iceberg of scientific discovery \n     for us and the beginning of a new era in the care of the \n     cancer patient.\n\n  Mr. President, I could go on and on. We have stacks and stacks of \ntestimony from scientists, scientific organizations, physicians, \nmedical researchers, health care researchers, people who do research in \nmany areas of microgravity and physics and other related areas of \nscience. We could bring all of those statements in.\n  I cite these just as a few specific examples of why the scientific \ncommunity, and the vast majority of the scientific community, believes \nthat the space station and space research is vitally important.\n  I conclude by referring to biomedical research, saying space research \nprovides unique insights into how the heart and lungs function; the \ngrowth and maintenance of muscle and bone; perception cognition, and \nbalance, and the regulation of the body's many systems in the field of \nregulatory physiology.\n  That is why the American Medical Association has adopted a resolution \nin support of the international space station.\n\n       The AMA supports the continuation of NASA and other \n     programs for conducting medical research and other research \n     with potential health care benefits on manned space flights, \n     including the continued development and subsequent operation \n     of the international space station.\n\n  I thought I would conclude my remarks, Madam President, with a quote \nfrom Dr. Michael DeBakey, chancellor and chairman of the department of \nsurgery, Baylor College of Medicine, who said,\n\n       The space station is not a luxury any more than a medical \n     research center at Baylor College of Medicine is a luxury.\n\n  He said also,\n\n       Present technology on the shuttle allows for stays in space \n     of only about 2 weeks. We do not limit medical researchers to \n     only a few hours in the laboratory and expect cures for \n     cancer. We need much longer missions in space, in months to \n     years, to obtain research results that may lead to the \n     development of new knowledge and breakthroughs.\n\n  Mr. President, these are just a few of the comments that the \nscientific community has made in support of the space station.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, how much time is remaining for each \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe). The Senator from Arkansas has 8 \nminutes and the Senator from Missouri has 25 minutes.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator from Missouri entertain the idea of \npossibly yielding back some time and I will, too, and maybe we can \nexpedite this? Does the Senator have any other opponents?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we have had a number of Senators who were \nmost anxious to speak on this. We could not get them in time. I know \nthat Senator Hutchison, Senator Gramm, Senator Sessions, Senator Dodd, \nand Senator Glenn had all expressed an interest. We have tried to send \nout appeals to them. We hope that, if they are anxious to speak, they \nwill be here before 5:30. But I say at 5:30 I will be prepared to yield \nback any time remaining on our side if the Senators have been unable to \nchange their schedules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to advise the Senator from \nMissouri that Senator Glenn, because of other responsibilities, will \nnot be speaking. His statement yesterday was so eloquent he would like \nit to stand there as a rebuttal to the amendment of the Senator from \nArkansas. We are checking now to see if the Senator from Connecticut \nwishes to speak and will so advise the chairman.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  At this stage of the debate on these things it is always largely \nrepetitious but some things are worth repeating. It does not change any \nvotes sometimes, but it is therapeutic to me to say things more than \nonce and then people who ignore it in my opinion do so at their own \nrisk. But as I said this morning, it is a tragedy that the space \nstation is what we call a freebie. You can go ahead and vote for this \n$100 billion boondoggle which will never provide any cures for any \ndisease, will probably never even be used as a way station to Mars, \nthat is opposed by every physicist in the world and not because it is \ntotally worthless but because the money could be so much more \neffectively spent on other things.\n  I pointed out this morning, and it is worth pointing out again, the \ncost of one launch of the space shuttle could pay to allow the National \nInstitutes of Health to approve one out of every three applications for \nmedical research instead of one out of four, just one launch, and there \nare 83 such launches to support the space station program. And every \none of them is calculated to occur within a 5-minute window without a \nhitch.\n  It is going to cost $94 billion in today's dollars and you assume \nthat every one of those 83 to 90 launches is going to be split perfect. \nYou think about it. Think about the enormity of such a promise.\n  Dan Goldin testified before the Subcommittee of Commerce on Science \nand Technology:\n\n       It is certain that the program does not have adequate \n     reserves built into the total development estimate to address \n     Russian contingencies, which I will address later. There is \n     also the issue of the impact the Russian delay has had in \n     pushing completion of the assembly sequence beyond 2002.\n\n  You bet, October 2003 to be precise, a $2 billion cost overrun \nbecause Russia cannot come up with the money to build a service module.\n  And he goes on to say,\n\n       Clearly, the drawn out timeframe for development/assembly \n     will increase program\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\n     costs. The exact extent of this cost is being worked.\n\n  Here is how they have worked it. Here is the way NASA has worked it. \nHere are the promises that have been made.\n  Here is what NASA said on February 17, 1994:\n\n       Russian participation reduces cost by $2 billion and allows \n     science utilization significantly earlier than with the alpha \n     station.\n\n  Broken promise.\n  Another promise. NASA said the first element launch would be launched \nin November 1997 instead of September, 1998.\n  The reality. The first element launch is now scheduled for June, \n1998. Broken promise No. 2.\n  The space station laboratory will be available in February 1998. \nReality: May, 1999. Broken promise No. 3.\n  Promise. The space station will be completed in June, 2002. Reality: \nNow October, 2003. Broken promise No. 4.\n  Russia's participation will save the United States taxpayers $2 \nbillion. Now we are going to have to come up with $2 billion. Broken \npromise No. 5.\n  Promise: Extravehicular activity, space walking, will be, in 1993, \n350 hours they said; in 1994 it had gone up to 434 hours; in 1996 it \nwent up to 1,104 hours; in 1997, 1,519 hours--a 500 percent increase. \nBroken promise No. 6.\n  Those are the promises we have gotten from NASA, and the cost is just \nnow beginning to soar. They have just taken $400 million out of the \nscience program. There won't be any money left to do a scientific \nexperiment. They took $400 million out of science to make up some of \nthe shortfalls.\n  They took $200 million out of the shuttle program and put it into the \nspace program. The cost overruns are soaring, and GAO said this \nmorning, in a report released this morning: No letup in sight.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I am pleased to yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of this important subcommittee, because they have seen, early \non, the importance and the benefits, for our present society and our \nfuture children and grandchildren, of space research continuing to move \nforward to find how we can live better through experimentation in \nspace. That is going to help all of us now and in the future. They have \nseen this and I am so pleased that the Senate has continued to ratify \nits faith in space.\n  I cannot imagine that anyone in the past few weeks who has seen the \nPathfinder exploring Mars, the pictures that are being taken by \nPathfinder on Mars that show it to look about like Arizona--I cannot \nimagine that anyone would not be so excited about what we are going to \nbe able to learn from this kind of continued exploration. So I think \nnow, of all times, people who are big thinkers, who have a vision for \nour country, would not want to stop our efforts to explore in space.\n  We have talked about the importance of the health benefits that we \nhave in the microgravity conditions in the space station before. \nSenator Mikulski and I have worked on osteoporosis and breast cancer, \ntrying to increase the funding. You cannot, no matter what you do, no \nmatter how much technology you have--you cannot reproduce the gravity \nconditions that are in space, on Earth. You cannot do it. Yet we know \nthat those microgravity conditions will allow us to watch the \ndevelopment of breast cancer cells and of osteoporosis in this \nweightlessness and perhaps find the cure for breast cancer. We can \nlearn how to combat osteoporosis in the older, especially women, but \nalso men. In fact, NASA research already has led to these developments \nin health.\n  The cool suit for Apollo missions now helps improve the quality of \nlife of patients with multiple sclerosis. NASA technology has produced \na pacemaker that can be programmed from outside the body. NASA has \ndeveloped instruments to measure bone loss and bone density without \npenetrating the skin. NASA research has led to an implant for diabetes \nthat is only 3 inches across. It provides more precise control of blood \nsugar levels and frees diabetics from the burden of daily insulin \ninjections.\n  I was reading about Professor James Langer's discoveries. He is from \nthe University of California at Santa Barbara. He wrote in Physics \nToday that, ``Metallurgists have long sought to predict and control \nalloy microstructures.'' This may seem a little off the wall, but in \nfact it is very important when they are trying to find the very best \nsubstance with which to make products. He found that this is best done \nin the microgravity conditions because gravity affects the way things \ncan solidify.\n  So you take all these scientific things and boil them down to: How \ndoes it make my life better? In fact, it does make our life better. It \ndoes make our health better. It does give patients who have multiple \nsclerosis or osteoporosis a better chance to have a good quality of \nlife. I reject the idea that we would walk away from the possibilities \nfor the future for better health and better quality of life, but also \nthe products that will be formed from the scientific developments that \nwe make with the space station. Once we have the research, then we take \nthat technology and we make the products. And that is what has kept our \neconomy burgeoning and growing and able to accept the new, young people \nwho come into it after they graduate from high school and college; \naccept the new people who come to our country, looking for the American \ndream.\n  Part of the American dream is the commitment to research. It is the \ncommitment to the future. An important part of that is space and the \nspace station. That is why it is so important that we keep this \ncommitment to space research, to NASA, to the space station. And the \nSenate has done that. In the 4 years that I have been in the U.S. \nSenate, I have been very proud of the big thinkers and their ability to \nsee the difference between shutting off our future and our \npossibilities and saying we can save a small amount here, not thinking \nthat for every $1 we invest we get a $2 return in our productivity and \nin our gross national product.\n\n  I respect the Senator from Arkansas. I know he believes sincerely \nthat this is a waste of taxpayer dollars. I wish, before he leaves the \nSenate, that he would come around to seeing the benefits of space \nresearch so maybe in his last year here he would say: You know what? I \nthink there is a future, it is worth keeping, that it will make life \nbetter for our children, that it will provide scientific jobs for our \nchildren, that it will keep the technology and the research and the \ninnovations in America, along with our international partners. Because \nthis is not just people who write in Physics Today. This is quality of \nlife for elderly people who have osteoporosis. This is for the \nprevention of breast cancer. This is for the scientific base that has \nmade America what it is today.\n  To walk away from that would be un-American and it would be \nunthinkable. So I hope our colleagues will give us the resounding vote \nthat we have had in the past. I hope they will resolutely stand for the \nfuture, for our children and our grandchildren, and for a great America \nfor years to come.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nTexas. She has long been, not only an advocate, but very knowledgeable \nand a strong supporter of the space station. She has given us many good \nreasons why we should support the space station.\n  I am pleased, now, to yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, we are all going to miss the Senator \nfrom Arkansas. He is a good friend, and I use that in the honest term, \nrather than the kind of puffery that often goes on around here. He \ntakes the floor twice a year to espouse things with which I disagree. \nFirst, he wants to do things to the mining law that I don't want to do. \nAnd then he wants to kill the space station in a way that I don't want \nit killed. So I vote against him on both of these occasions, but I look \nforward to these because he keeps us honest with his concerns. He has \nnot yet convinced me to back away from my commitment to the space \nstation, but I pay tribute to his tenacity and to his integrity.\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\n  I have answered at some length in previous debates. I will not take \nthe time to do that now. I simply repeat, again, my commitment to the \nidea of venturing into the unknown even when it seems expensive and \nsometimes foolish, because we are never quite sure what we are going to \nfind. But, almost always, it comes back to benefit us.\n  As I stand here I am reminded of the quote, I can't give it to you \nexactly, of the historian who said: History is a chancy thing. America \nwas discovered by someone who was heading for somewhere else, thought \nhe had arrived someplace other than he had, and was named after a man \nwho never came here.\n  History is like that, chancy. We are never quite sure what is going \nto happen to us, but great things happen to us when we explore. We are \nlaunched on this exploration now. We are far enough along that it makes \nsense for us to continue. Who knows what we will find? I will not \npretend to know that we will find the cure for cancer or anything else \nwhen we get out there. We will surprise ourselves. It will be chancy. \nBut that has been our history; that has been our destiny. I, for one, \nwant to continue it in this program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nUtah. To the notes he added from history, we might add that he, \nChristopher Columbus, was a very modern traveler. He did it all with \nborrowed money. I think that is one element that should be added.\n  We are awaiting the arrival of Senator Gramm of Texas, who is, I \nthink, going to be the last speaker on this side. For the information \nof my colleagues, how many minutes are remaining for debate on this \nmeasure?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 12 minutes and 12 seconds, and \nthe Senator from Arkansas has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I expect perhaps within 10 minutes we would be ready, or as \nsoon as Senator Gramm has had the opportunity to speak, we would be \nready to yield back the remainder of our time.\n  I so inform the Senate.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, if I might before the Senator from \nTexas comes up, I have another historical allusion I would like to \nshare.\n  Mr. BOND. I am delighted to yield 3 minutes for historical allusions \nfrom the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Senator from Missouri.\n  It has been pointed out to me in the study of history that the nation \nthat was the most powerful, the most progressive, that had, in modern \nterms, superpower status some centuries ago, was the nation of China. \nOne of the things the Chinese did was send their explorers around the \nworld. There were Chinese ships that were exploring as far away as the \ncoast of Africa, I am told.\n  Then the Chinese Government decided that that was too expensive, that \nit was too chancy, that there would be no guarantee that they would \nlearn anything or find anything or profit in any way and, as a cost-\ncutting measure, the Chinese cut back on their exploration and \nvirtually left the field open to the Europeans. There was very little \ncontact, of course, between the Europeans and the Chinese in that \nperiod, but the field was left open in a way that we can look back on \nin history and say: What might have happened if the Chinese had \nmaintained their exploring activities and maintained their willingness \nto go into the future? What might have happened, had they not taken \nthose cost-cutting measures? The history of the world would be very, \nvery different.\n  It was the Europeans who went out on their exploration after the \nChinese cut back. I don't want to see the Americans cut back on their \nadventure and their exploration, and then have someone else step into \nthe breach. Because I am convinced that if we cut back on our \nexploration of space, someone else will step up to it. Who knows what \nthe implications could be, hundreds of years from now?\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank our distinguished chairman for \nyielding. I thank him for the leadership in this very difficult job. \nHaving served on this subcommittee, I know how difficult it is, how \nmany important issues are under his jurisdiction, and how difficult \npolitically they are. So I want to begin by saying thank you to Senator \nBond for the great job he has done.\n  Senator Bumpers, every year, proposes that we kill the space station \nand every year we have a protracted debate on it. I think, now, Members \nunderstand the issue enough that the lines are pretty well drawn.\n  So, today, I am not going to go into a lengthy speech. I know Senator \nBumpers and I know the quality of his work, so I know he has made the \nbest case he can make for his position.\n  I would just like to remind my colleagues that in 1965, we were \ninvesting 5.7 cents out of every dollar spent by the Federal Government \nin science and technology in the future. We were investing 5.7 cents \nout of every dollar we spent in Washington by investing in the next \ngeneration, in investing in the science and the technology to build the \nscientific base of the country to give us the ability to construct new \ntools that were more effective and sharper than tools used by people in \nother parts of the world. We were able to develop new technology and \nnew products that have made us the envy of the world and have allowed \nus to maintain the highest living standards on Earth.\n  Whereas we were investing 5.7 cents out of every dollar in the \nFederal budget in nondefense R in 1965, we are now investing roughly \n1.9 cents out of every dollar spent by the Federal Government in \nscience and technology in the future. We have dramatically reduced the \ninvestment we are making in the future, and, basically, what we have \ndone is succumbed to the siren song of investing more and more money in \nthe next election, in programs that have a big political constituency, \nin programs that yield a return before the voter goes to vote in even \nnumbered years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November, \nand we have systematically, since 1965, reduced the investment that we \nare making in the future, investment that we are making in the next \ngeneration.\n  This ultimately comes down to a debate between investing in the next \nelection and investing in the next generation. While I believe we have \nto run the space program efficiently, we have had dramatic reductions \nin its growth. I think when science investment is down to 1.9 percent \nof the nondefense R Federal budget, down from 5.7 percent in 1965, \nthat we need to be alarmed about it.\n  I have introduced legislation to set up a program within our existing \nbudget to double expenditures on science and technology, to set out a \n10-year goal of doubling the budget of the National Institutes of \nHealth, doubling the budget for science and technology, because I \nbelieve that it is critical to the country's future.\n  Let me also say that I take a back seat to no one in controlling \nspending, but this is about priorities. What programs do we spend the \nmoney we spend on? I say invest it in the next generation, not in the \nnext election, and defeat the Bumpers amendment as we have done in the \npast. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Who yields \ntime?\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, we are about to yield back time. I turn to \nthe distinguished sponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 3 minutes, and \nthe Senator from Missouri has 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I will be happy to accommodate the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Madam President, I will use my 3 minutes, and we will \nget this show on the road.\n  Let me just say, in the 6 years I have stood at this position saying \nwe ought to cancel the space station, for all the reasons I enumerated \nall day long, one of the opponents' arguments consistently has been \nthat we are going to cure breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical \ncancer, warts, ingrown toenails, psoriasis, you name it. It reminds me \nof that old Huey Long story about the medicine doctor coming\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nthrough Louisiana. He was selling Low Poplarhirum and High Poplarlorum.\n  ``What's the difference?'' someone asked him.\n  He said,''Well, the High Poplarlorum will cure anything from the \nwaist up, and Low Poplarhirum will cure anything from the waist down.''\n  They said, ``Where do you get it?''\n  He said, ``We get it from the Poplar tree.''\n  ``How do you get a medicine out of one tree that cures everything \nfrom the waist up and the waist down?''\n  He says, ``Well, we take sap from the bottom half of the tree, that \nis Low Poplarhirum, and we take sap from the top of the tree, and that \nis High Poplarlorum, and that's the way it works.''\n  Low Poplarhirum and High Poplarlorum reminds me of the debate going \non about the space station today. It is going to cure everything under \nthe shining Sun and it isn't going to cure anything. I will eat my \nhat--and I wish I was going to be in the Senate to do it--if it ever \ncures anything. That claim is not anything in the world but a hoax \ndesigned to perpetuate a $100 billion expenditure that if it were put \ninto real research to cure breast cancer, to cure cervical cancer, to \ncure prostate cancer, it might get you something. It is going to get \nyou nothing by putting $100 million into the space station.\n  Read the GAO report I received this morning. I am not talking about \nthe grandiose promise Ronald Reagan made in 1984 about how we are going \nto do it all for $8 billion. We have already thrown $11 billion away on \nthe first space station before we abandoned it, and now we are headed \nfor another $80 billion, $85 billion, and we are not going to cure \nanything. This project has no purpose in the world but to keep people \nworking, to keep the aerospace and defense contractors all over the \ncountry working, and to explore what?\n  The Russians have been up there 20 years. I, again, invite anybody in \nthis body to tell me what the Russians have cured, what they have \ndeveloped in 20 years of having space stations. They have had seven \nspace stations; there is nothing new about that. A space station is a \nmechanical thing; it is not scientific. The Russians have been up there \n20 years. I challenge anybody to tell me one single thing from a \nmedical standpoint that they have gotten out of it. I can tell you the \nanswer is nothing.\n  We are going to continue pouring money down this just like we did the \nClinch River breeder reactor, just like we did the super collider, \nuntil we finally woke up. The GAO issued a wake-up call this morning. \nFor God's sakes, I say to Senators, why don't you listen to it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I am sorry to hear the time has expired, \nbecause I was really getting into listening to my colleague from \nArkansas. He makes me feel like I used to feel when the summer carnival \ncame to town and I went in and I listened to people who were smooth \ntalkers from Arkansas and elsewhere. I wound up giving them the 20, 30 \ncents I had saved all summer long. They are very, very compelling.\n  In this instance, it is not my position, it is the position of the \ndistinguished scientists, such as the ones whose comments and quotes I \nhave read into the Record that outline specifically what the benefits \nof the space station and space exploration have been and will be.\n  While we respect the very powerful arguments made by the Senator from \nArkansas, I now move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nlay on the table the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas. The yeas \nand nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 69, nays 31, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 193 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--69\n\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n\n                                NAYS--31\n\n     Abraham\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kohl\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lugar\n     Moynihan\n     Reed\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 944) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BYRD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. With the concurrence of the majority leader and the \nminority leader, I think we are prepared to have one more vote on an \namendment to be offered by Senator Bumpers. I believe other amendments \npending can be resolved without a vote, so we hope to be able to have \nthe vote on the amendment and start the vote for final passage prior to \n7 o'clock.\n  I ask unanimous consent the debate on an amendment to be offered by \nthe Senator from Arkansas be 20 minutes, equally divided in the usual \nform.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 953\n\n            (Purpose: To cap the cost of the Space Station)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and I ask \nunanimous consent that no second-degree amendments be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 953.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new sections.\n\n     SEC. XXX.

FUNDING CAPS.\n\n       (a) The President's cumulative budget submissions for Space \n     Station capital development and operations for the fiscal \n     year 1994 through the fiscal year during which the Space \n     Station achieves full operational capability may not exceed \n     $17,400,000,000, exclusive of launch costs.\n       (b) After achieving full operational capability and \n     continuing through its decommissioning, the President's \n     annual budget submission to Congress for the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration shall contain an amount \n     for the operation of, and any enhancement to, the Space \n     Station which shall in no case exceed $1,300,000,000 for that \n     fiscal year, exclusive of launch costs.\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\n       (c) Definitions.--For purposes of this section\n       (1) the capital development program of the Space Station \n     includes, but is not limited to, the research and development \n     activities associated with the space and ground systems and \n     collateral equipment of the Space Station, and all direct \n     expenses for space flight, control, data communications, \n     assembly and operations planning, construction of facilities, \n     training, development of science equipment and payloads, and \n     research and program management activities associated with \n     the construction and operations of the Space Station and its \n     supporting elements and services until the facility is \n     equipped and powered as planned, and declared fully \n     operational.\n       (2) operation of the Space Station includes, but is not \n     limited to, all direct research and development; space \n     flight, control and data communications; construction of \n     facilities; training; development of science equipment and \n     payloads; scientific experiments; and research and program \n     management activities associated with the operations of the \n     Space Station; and the U.S.-Russia cooperative MIR program.\n       (3) enhancement of the Space Station includes all direct \n     research and development; space flight, control and data \n     communications; construction of facilities; and research and \n     program management activities associated with the acquisition \n     of additional Space Station elements and ground support \n     facilities.\n       (4) direct expenses include, but are not limited to, the \n     marginal costs of transportation and tracking and data \n     services, launch facilities, payload processing facilities, \n     simulator facilities, and all other enabling facilities \n     including their collateral equipment, and all laboratory and \n     technical services provided by NASA Centers to support space \n     station development and scientific research.\n       (5) full operation capability means the facility is fully \n     assembled on-orbit with the power, configuration and \n     capabilities described in the system design review of March \n     24, 1994.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I will make this brief. I know everyone \nwants to get out of here, and I want to accommodate the membership.\n  Last week, the Armed Services Committee accepted an amendment that \ncapped the costs on the F-22 fighter plane. They, I think, correctly \ndecided that the costs of the F-22 could very well go way beyond \nanything intended by the Congress. So, Mr. President, they accepted a \ncap on the F-22 fighter plane.\n  All I am trying to do on this is do the same thing on the space \nstation. I am using NASA's figures. These are not my figures. These are \nthe figures that NASA says they can build the space station for and \noperate it. The amendment, as I say, is right where they say it is, but \nhere is the reason I am doing this. The General Accounting Office says \nthat since last year, the risk to the space station's costs in schedule \nhave, in fact, increased. GAO goes on to say the station's financial \nreserves have also deteriorated significantly.\n  Now, I think the people in this body who strongly favor the space \nstation in good conscience and as a duty to their constituents and \ntheir own conscience ought to support saying at some point there ought \nto be some kind of a limit on how much we are willing to spend. I am \nusing the figures that NASA has themselves put out: $17.4 billion to \nbuild it, $1.3 billion a year to operate it. The cap does not extend to \na launch cost, only to the building and deployment and to the operating \nof it.\n  That seems like a simple, straightforward amendment to me, Mr. \nPresident.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  I just appreciate the effort the Senator from Arkansas is making to \nensure that the spending on this widely supported and strongly endorsed \nprogram is kept under control, but the space station is already \noperating under administrative caps. I understand the authorizing \ncommittee is examining the potential for legislated caps. I think this \nis an issue appropriately to be referred to the authorizers. It \ndeserves careful consideration, not brought forward here in the last \nmoment on an appropriations bill debate.\n  I just say, Mr. President, space station is a research and \ndevelopment project. It has a lot of uncertainties but tremendous \npromise. It is rocket science. We are dealing with rocket science. We \nshould not lock NASA in stone with caps that are pulled out of thin air \nhere at the last minute in the appropriations process.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the Bumpers amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I, too, rise in opposition to the \nBumpers amendment. Though well-intentioned, it is not necessary and \ncould inadvertently, by placing a cap, lead to real concern in the area \nof safety.\n  First, we do not want to tie the hands of the NASA administrator. \nSecond, since fiscal year 1994, the station has been subject to funding \nlimitations, a $2.1 billion annual funding and a $17.4 billion overall \nfunding through the completion of the assembly. Yes, these limitations \nare not legislatively mandated; they have been administratively carried \nout.\n  There are many references to these specific limitations to the space \nstation budget and congressional proceedings. For example, the $17.4 \nbillion total cap through the completion of the assembly. Recent \nreports indicate that NASA is expected to build the station within \nthese limits. We should not legislate a cap. In good faith, NASA \ncontinues to meet these goals. Any additional money sought is for \nunforeseen problems either associated with the Russian service module \nor where we might now identify a certain series of safety concerns. We \nare learning lessons from Mir.\n  I don't want to tie the hands of NASA or threaten the lives of \nastronauts. I really encourage our colleagues to vote no on Bumpers and \nawait the wise counsel of the authorizing committee on this issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I hardly know what else to say about this. The figures I \nam using are the figures that NASA says they can build and operate it \nfor. Now, it is obvious from the GAO report that came out this morning \nthat these costs are beginning to get out of control. There is a \nshifting from one account to another. There is even shifting from \nnonspace station programs to space station programs.\n  All I am trying to do is to say, let's get it under control. There is \nnot anything, frankly, written in stone about a cost cap amendment. \nNext year, if NASA comes in and says we are down $1 billion, we will \ncertainly give it to them, if I am any judge of what is going to happen \naround here in the future with the space station.\n  But here is what the GAO report said this morning, Mr. President:\n\n       NASA's actions to reinforce its financial reserves and keep \n     the program within its funding limitations has in some cases \n     involved redefining a portion of the program subject to the \n     limitations. Such actions make the value of the current \n     limitations as a funding control mechanism questionable. \n     Therefore, we proposed that the NASA administrator, with the \n     concurrence of the Office of Management and Budget, direct \n     the space station to discontinue the use of the current \n     funding limitations.\n\n  And they go ahead to say at the end of the review:\n\n       Assuming that Congress decides to continue the space \n     station program and wants to replace the current funding \n     limitations, it should consider, after consultation with \n     NASA, reestablishment in light of the current circumstances.\n\n  Now, the truth of the matter is, this program is heading headlong out \nof control. There are very few people in this body that do not know \nthat, that do not understand that, and I am offering this amendment \nsimply because I am saying, if you are going to build a space station, \nfor Pete's sake let's put some kind of a limitation on it.\n\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, who chairs the \nCommerce Committee, tells me that he is working with NASA and he wants \nto work with me on putting a cap on this. One of the problems I have \nand worry about is, are we simply going to put some language in--and I \nthink Senator McCain shares my concern about the cost of this program. \nI certainly would welcome the opportunity to work with him, but I don't \nwant a cap, and I know Senator McCain doesn't want a cap that has all \nkinds of escape mechanisms in it so the costs can continue to skyrocket \nand we can continue building this big boondoggle. My whole purpose is \nto say to my colleagues who believe in the space station--which I do \nnot--that I know they share my concern about these costs that GAO says \nare sliding out of control.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 953) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it is with deep gratitude that I express my \nappreciation to the Senator from Arkansas. I believe he has another \namendment\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\nand I now feel a wonderful sense that we will be willing to accept it \nif he wishes to proceed with that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. If the Senator from Arkansas would just allow a kudos \ncomment. I thank the Senator for withdrawing his amendment, though I \nknow that he is in no way retreating from his position. We acknowledge \nthat position and we look forward to hearing both from him and the \ndistinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee on his advice in this \nmatter. Thanks again.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to oppose the Bumper amendment to \nplace a cap on the space station. I oppose the idea of a price cap at \nthis time given the recent changes to the space station program \nsurrounding the prime contractor's performance and the instability of \nRussian participation.\n  I have asked the General Accounting Office [GAO] to update their \nprevious life-cycle cost estimate on the space station. Once this cost \nestimate is completed, I intend to introduce a price cap on the \nstation. It is my hope that a price cap at that time will reflect a \nmore accurate assessment of the space station total life-cycle costs.\n  I am pleased that my colleague from Arkansas has withdrawn his \namendment.\n  I look forward to investigating these issues further after the GAO \nstudy I requested is completed and after the Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee holds hearings and further consultation with \ninterested parties including NASA.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 954\n\n (Purpose: To earmark funds for a National Research Council report on \n                       the Space Station program)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 954.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following new \n     section:\n       Sec.   . Of the funds provided to the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration in this bill, the Administrator \n     shall by November 1, 1998, make available no less than \n     $400,000 for a study by the National Research Council, with \n     an interim report to be completed by June 1, 1998, that \n     evaluates, in terms of the potential impact on the Space \n     Station's assembly schedule, budget, and capabilities, the \n     engineering challenges posed by extravehicular activity (EVA) \n     requirements, U.S. and non-U.S. space launch requirements, \n     the potential need to upgrade or replace equipment and \n     components after assembly complete, and the requirement to \n     decommission and disassemble the facility.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, this simply requires NASA to spend up to \n$400,000 of its unobligated funds for the National Research Council to \ndo a study between now and the summer of 1998 on any engineering \nproblems that may seem insurmountable in building and deploying the \nspace station.\n  I think both floor managers have looked this over and have agreed to \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 954) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, have the floor managers had an \nopportunity to look over the visa waiver for Veterans' Administration \ndoctors?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we have had conversation with the \nauthorizing committees and, from our standpoint, I have found no \nobjection from the committees of jurisdiction. This one is well outside \nthe scope of our normal activities. So I am awaiting any expression of \nconcern. We have not had any concern from the committees who have \njurisdiction over immigration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know that the VA often has very \nspecial circumstances where doctors, perhaps from other countries, or \ngraduates from international medical schools, are present in our VA \nhospitals to help with either special assignments or special chores.\n  From what I can understand, there was an error in last year's \nimmigration bill that really shackled VA from the flexibility it had in \nthis area. From what I understand, the Bumpers amendment is a benign \namendment. It does not create a new classification. It does not create \na new entitlement to either come to this country or stay in this \ncountry. It just reaffirms kind of what was once a usual and customary \npractice by the VA. So I don't anticipate an objection.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just thank the Senator from \nMaryland and the Senator from Missouri. Let me add this caveat which \nmight help them sleep better. A veterans' hospital in Little Rock told \nme they have five doctors they are going to lose. I am really offering \nthis on their behalf. This is sort of a critical situation where these \ndoctors are going to be forced to leave and go home.\n  All this amendment says is that, in the future, the VA--not the \ndoctor--could request a waiver of the visa requirement that they return \nhome for 2 years before they can come back. That seems like a fairly \nlaudable thing when you consider the medical shortages most VA \nhospitals experience. If you find when you get to the conference \ncommittee somebody objects because it may be a turf fight of some kind, \nI will understand that. I hope that doesn't happen. But I appreciate \nthe accommodation you have given.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 955\n\n (Purpose: To restore the authority of the Veterans' Administration to \nrequest waivers of the home residency requirement for doctors employed \n                     at VA hospitals on J-1 visas)\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Bumpers] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 955.\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place, add the following new section: \n     Sec.   . Section 214(l)(1)(D) of the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1184(l)(1)(D)) (as added by section \n     220 of the Immigration and Nationality Technical Corrections \n     Act of 1994 and redesignated as subsection (l) by section \n     671(a)(3)(A) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \n     Responsibility Act of 1996) is amended by inserting before \n     the period at the end the following: '', except that, in the \n     case of a request by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the \n     alien shall not be required to practice medicine in a \n     geographic area designated by the Secretary.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 955) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BOND. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6:40 p.m. \nthe Senate proceed to H.R. 2158, the House companion bill, all after \nthe enacting clause be stricken, the text of S. 1034 be inserted, H.R. \n2158 be read for the third time, and a vote occur on passage, all \nwithout further action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment \nthat calls for a halt to all locality pay increases for all employees \nof the Department of Veterans Affairs that have been transferred due to \ntheir perpetration of sexual harassment. Let me explain why this \namendment is necessary.\n  Over a year ago to date, the Veterans Department undertook an \ninvestigation into the allegations of sexual harassment, misconduct, \nand unprofessional behavior on the part of Jerome Calhoun, who was \nDirector of the VA Medical Center in Fayetteville, NC.\n  In September 1996, the Office of the Inspector General of the \nVeterans Department issued a report confirming the allegations of \nsexual harassment, as well as a pattern of inappropriate and abusive \nbehavior toward Department employees.\n  In most organizations today this kind of behavior would not be \ntolerated. Jerome Calhoun would have been fired. Unfortunately, this is \nnot the way things work at the Veterans Department. At the Veterans \nDepartment this kind of deplorable behavior gets you a comfortable \nsettlement.\n  Here are the facts: For his intolerable behavior, Mr. Calhoun was \ngiven a pay raise, bringing his already generous salary to $106,000. He \nwas transferred to sunny Bay Pines, FL, a locale of his own choosing, \nand he was given the position of special assistant which is standard \nGovernment lingo for having no specific responsibilities. Quite \nfrankly, I look at this settlement and I ask myself, where is the \npunishment? In the private sector this would be considered a promotion.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the 200,000 employees of the Veterans \nDepartment, I ask this body to do what Department officials have \nneglected. Jerome Calhoun must not be allowed make such an incredible \nmockery of the system.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 958\n\n       On page 51 after line 11, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 216. INDIAN HOUSING REFORM.\n\n       Upon a finding by the Secretary that any person has \n     substantially, significantly, or materially violated the \n     requirements of any activity under the Native American \n     Housing Block Grants Program under title I of the Native \n     American Self-Determination Act of 1996 or any associated \n     activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Housing \n     and Urban Development, the Secretary shall bar that person \n     from any such participation in programs under that title \n     thereafter and shall require reimbursement for any losses or \n     costs associated with these violations.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment today to \ncorrect an egregious problem at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and on tribal lands across the Nation that came to light \nlast December. As many of my colleagues know, the Seattle Times broke \nan unbelievable story of greed, deception, and mismanagement in the \ntribal housing program shortly before the 105th Congress convened.\n  The Seattle Times reported that funding intended to build housing for \nlow-income native Americans on the Tulalip Reservation in my State, \nwent instead to construct a 5,300 square foot $400,000 home. The \nrecipients of this taxpayer-funded home were not low-income, but \ninstead earned a combined yearly income of $92,319 as executive \ndirector of the tribe's housing authority and contracting officer for \nthe authority. I am confident my colleagues will agree that this abuse \nof HUD funding is outrageous and should be punished severely.\n  Unfortunately, the Tulalip house was not the only problem Seattle \nTimes reporters found in their 6-month investigation of tribal housing \nprograms. Instead, they turned up numerous and repeated examples of \ncheating, abuse, and mismanagement in native American housing programs \nacross the United States.\n  In Red Rock, OK, Troy Warrior and his family of the Otoe-Missouria \nIndian tribe were excited at the prospect of moving into a new home. \nThey would finally be able to afford their own home with help from HUD \nfinancing. Only a few days before the family was scheduled to move into \nthe modest home, they were told that leaders of the tribal housing \nauthority would get the house instead. Twenty other low-income families \nin the tribe faced the same dilemma. The tribal housing leaders \neliminated the requirement that recipients of the homes pay for them, \nin effect giving themselves free houses at the expense of American \ntaxpayers while those truly in need of the housing were left to fend \nfor themselves.\n  Jimmy Viarrial, chairman of the Pojoaque Tribe housing authority in \nSanta Fe, NM, makes over $40,000 a year, twice the State average. But \nwhen HUD gave the housing authority $1 million for home repairs, it \nspent the first $45,000 on Viarrial's own five-bedroom home. Most of \nthe rest went to remodel the homes of friends and relatives of Viarrial \nand the housing authority director.\n  Mr. President, these are just a few of the many abuses found by \nSeattle Times reporters last year, and I can say with confidence that \nthere are most likely many more such abuses that have not been \ndiscovered. The American taxpayers deserve better than this. When we in \nthe U.S. Senate tell them that their money is going to worthwhile \nprograms to provide housing for the poorest native Americans, it is our \nduty to ensure that it is.\n  As many of you know, two officials at the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development were removed from their positions in the Office of \nNative American Programs as a result of this scandal. Furthermore, the \nHUD inspector general has issued a report confirming that the Seattle \nTimes allegations are in fact true and recommending that the Native \nAmerican Housing and Self-Determination Act of 1996 be amended to \nensure better oversight of Indian housing authorities at HUD. These are \npositive developments that should be applauded. But no actions have \nbeen taken against the tribes responsible for the abuse of taxpayer \nmoney.\n  That is why I am offering an amendment today intended to send notice \nthat the misuse and misallocation of taxpayer dollars will no longer be \ntolerated. It will be punished and punished severely. Anyone involved \nwill be permanently barred from participating in the program, and must \nreimburse that program. I would have preferred to go further, but this \namendment is the strongest that can be accepted and passed. It is a \nsimple amendment that should have been law a long time ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in my effort to inject fairness and \naccountability into a program rife with abuse and mismanagement. It is \nthe least we can do for the millions of American taxpayers who expect \ntheir hard-earned money to be used wisely.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 959\n\n    (Purpose: To make available $1,000,000 for the Neutral Buoyancy \n                       Simulator program of NASA)\n\n       On page 70, line 18, strike out ``1999.'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``1999: Provided, That of the amount \n     appropriated or otherwise made\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\n     available by this heading, $1,000,000 may be available for \n     the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator program.''.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 960\n\n       On page 16, line 21, strike $10,693,000,000'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``10,159,000''.\n       On page 16, line 23, strike ``$9,200,000'' and insert \n     ``8,666,000''.\n       On page 23, line 6, insert ``and contract expertise'' after \n     ``technical assistance''.\n       On page 23, line 24, strike ``and 1995'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``1995, and 1997''.\n       On page 27, line 17, insert ``for'' after ``charge''.\n       On page 27, line 22, insert ``or moderate income family'' \n     after ``family''.\n       On page 27, line 24, strike ``payment'' and insert \n     ```prepayment''.\n       On page 28, line 1, insert ``of'' after the first ``the''.\n       On page 28, line 8, insert ``if'' after ``and''.\n       On page 28, line 13, insert ``from'' after ``move''.\n       On page 28, line 14, strike ``of'' and insert ``or''.\n       On page 28, line 22, strike ``223'' and insert ``220''.\n       On page 35, line 10, insert before the period, the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That any unobligated \n     balances available or recaptures in, or which become \n     available in the Emergency Shelter Grants Program account, \n     Supportive Housing Program account, Supplemental Assistance \n     for Facilities to Assist the Homeless account, Shelter Plus \n     Care account, Innovative Homeless Initiatives Demonstration \n     Program account and Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation (SRO) \n     account, shall be transferred to and merged with the amounts \n     in this account and shall be used for purposes under this \n     account''.\n       On page 45, after line 18, insert the following:\n       ``(d) Public and Assisted Housing Rents, Income Adjustments \n     and Preferences.\n       ``(1) Section 402(a) of The Balanced Budget Downpayment \n     Act, I is amended by striking ``fiscal year 1997'' and insert \n     in lieu thereof ``fiscal year 1998.\n       ``(2) Section 402(f) of The Balanced Budget Downpayment \n     Act, I is amended by striking ``fiscal years 1996 and 1997'' \n     and inserting in lieu thereof ``fiscal years 1997 and 1998''.\n       On page 47, beginning on line 24, strike out ``Account \n     Transition'' and all that follows through line 7 on page 48, \n     and redesignate the sections accordingly.\n       On page 51, line 11, insert before the period ``or \n     demolition''.\n\n\n                         ``Home Program Formula\n\n       ``Sec. 217.

Mr. President, I think this should take care of the \namendments for tonight. In the managers' amendment, the first item is a \ntechnical correction to EPA language related to cross-collateralization \nof State revolving funds. The language has been requested by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee.\n  The second item, requested by Senators Mack and Graham, is to enable \nthe State of Florida to use funds obligated and available to the State \nof Florida under title II of the Clean Water Act to make a grant to \nMonroe County, FL. This is budget neutral, and similar to other \namendments on VA-HUD bills.\n  Third, this would ensure that the Council on Environmental Quality \nuse only those resources provided to its direct appropriations to \nsupport its activity.\n  The fourth item deletes the prohibition on FEMA disaster relief \nexpenditures relative to beaches. It is expected that the authorizing \ncommittee will be addressing this shortly.\n  There is another amendment, a very important amendment, on page 16, \nwhich readjusts the section 8 contract renewal account from $9.2 \nbillion to $8.666 billion, as provided by the Budget Committee, to put \nthe bill in compliance with the budget resolution and the 602(b) \nallocation.\n  The sixth amendment limits locality pay increases for VA employees \nfound guilty of sexual harassment.\n  The seventh amendment makes $1 million available in transition funds \nfor the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator Program.\n  The eighth amendment authorizes HUD to bar persons violating the \nIndian block grant housing program from participating in the program in \nthe future.\n  The other eight amendments are truly technical amendments. The HOPE \nSix account, the preservation account, McKinney homeless account, PHA \naccount, account structure, demolition grants as part of HUD \nmultifamily disposition authority, and grandfathering all existing home \njurisdictions for home funding allocations.\n  Mr. President, I ask my ranking member if there are any further items \nthat she has.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, this side of the aisle has no additional \namendments to add to the managers' amendment.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I gather we are ready to move to adoption of \nthe amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendments, \nen bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 956 through 960) were agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                                  FEMA\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the Senator from Missouri yield for a question?\n  Mr. BOND. I would be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Would the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nVeterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development and Independent \nAgencies agree that the Federal Emergency Management Agency should act \nin a swift manner to settle its account with the Rockingham County jail \nin Brentwood, NH? As the Senator from Missouri may know, the county \njail sustained flooding of more than 3 feet of water during a storm \nthis past October. The county has been looking to FEMA for \nreimbursement of 75 percent of the damage it usually covers when there \nis a disaster.\n  Mr. BOND. Has FEMA settled any of this?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, the county has received roughly $150,000 from FEMA, \nbut there is still about $178,000 outstanding. Most of the money paid \nto Rockingham County came only after a meeting this past March 3, which \nI hosted in my office with officials from FEMA and Rockingham County \nCommissioner Tom Battles. At that meeting, we were encouraged by FEMA \nthat the outstanding balance would be settled within the next few \nmonths after some more flood mapping was conducted. With adequate time \nhaving passed and a new fiscal year on the way, it is only fair to \nRockingham County and the State of New Hampshire that this issue be \nsettled as budgets have to be structured.\n  Mr. Bond. I would say that I do agree that FEMA should work very \nquickly on this.\n\n\n                      particulate matter research\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, the VA-HUD-Independent Agencies \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1998 that we are considering today \nallocates $35 million in the administration's budget request for \nresearch on the public health effects of airborne particulate matter. I \nhave an amendment that simply states that these studies employ some \nbasic sound scientific methods. This is an extremely important \nprovision, but I would withdraw my amendment, if we could engage in a \ncolloquy to assure that the issue will be addressed in conference.\n  This language will be an important part of assuring that we protect \npublic health. Last week, the EPA finalized its rule on particulate \nmatter. Many have questioned the science behind this rule and a great \ndeal of uncertainty exists over the effect of particulate matter on \npublic health. As we reach this juncture, we must remember the reason \nfor this standard: to enhance public health. The only way we can be \nsure that the standard will, in fact, provide the desired benefits is \nthrough sound science. Lacking sound science, we may end up with \nstandards that don't provide any benefit, but cost the public dearly. \nWhile we often hear about costs on industry, we must remember that \nthose costs are passed down to individuals in the form of higher prices \nand higher State and local taxes. When individuals truly gain \nsignificant benefits from a standard, they are indeed better off. \nHowever, if we raise their costs for nothing or little in return, we \nsimply make them poorer and less able to pay for basic necessities, \nsuch as health care. Last week you may recall, one District of Columbia \nwoman died\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\nin her apartment because of the heat and the fact that she could not \nafford air conditioning. Such stories remind us that poverty represents \none of the greatest risk to public health. Hence, we should make sure \nthat new regulations do not simply make people poorer. If we don't \npursue sound science, we may impose regulations that actually decrease \npublic health. By demanding that particulate matter research relies on \nthe best available scientific methods, we can gain better knowledge \nover the impacts of the regulations and reform them to assure that we \nare actually enhancing overall public health.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague from Kansas for his comments. In a \nmemorandum from the President to the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency that accompanied this rule, the President committed \nthat no new controls on businesses would be imposed until the science \nbehind this rulemaking is reviewed 5 years from now. The results of \nthis research will help in that decision. This is why the bill almost \ndoubles funding for particulate matter research over last year's level.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator from Missouri for recognizing the \nimportance of these studies and my recommendation. Given the \nsignificance of this research and overall limitations on funding, I \nthink it is important that we are assured that the research will \ninclude those studies that will help us determine whether a cause-\neffect relationship exists between exposure to particulate matter and \nadverse health impacts. These include: First, controlled inhalation \nstudies that will allow us to determine the effects of exposure to \nparticulate matter at different concentration levels and the mechanism \nby which particulate matter could affect health; second, prospective \nepidemiology studies based on individual exposure measurements that \nwill allow us to better examine the role of possible alternative causes \nof the measured increase in risk; and third, the relationship of \noutdoor, indoor, and personal exposures to particulate matter. Without \nthese types of studies, we may not be any further along in resolving \nthe scientific uncertainties associated with this rulemaking. I further \nbelieve that the results of this research should be made available for \nindependent scientific review.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. If my colleagues would yield for a moment, I would like \nto endorse the well-reasoned recommendations made by the Senator for \nKansas. The recently issued particulate matter rule is troubling given \nthe scientific uncertainties and the significant costs that will be \nimposed on the government, citizens, and businesses in Alabama--and in \nthe rest of the Nation--that are already struggling to meet the air \nquality standards required by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The \ncost of implementing the new particulate matter standards is \nstaggering, especially considering the questions that remain about the \nactual public health benefit. Further scientific examination of the \nmatter is necessary prior to placing additional economic burdens on the \nAmerican public. Premature implementation of the standards could be far \nmore damaging to the Nation and I strongly recommend taking the time to \nfully review the scientific basis of the rulemaking.\n  Mr. BOND. My colleagues from Kansas and Alabama are correct. these \nstudies are critical to determining whether the EPA's rulemaking is \nappropriate. I concur with the Senators in the importance of this \nresearch and ensuring that the particular research projects funded \naddress the most critical questions associated with particulate matter \nexposure.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I also believe it is important that the research \nprogram include funding for the reanalysis of the American Cancer \nSociety study on particulate matter that was used as the basis for \nEPA's risk estimate. My understanding is that the Health Effects \nInstitute, an independent research organization that is already \nreviewing some of the epidemiology data, is willing to undertake this \nreanalysis and has received permission from the American Cancer \nSociety, but currently lacks adequate funding to do a complete \nreanalysis.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleagues for their recommendations. This will \nbe an important issue to address when we go to conference with the \nHouse.\n\n\n                        Lyons VA Medical Center\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for \na provision in the House version of the fiscal year 1998 VA-HUD \nappropriations bill to provide $21.1 million in funding for the \nconstruction of an ambulatory care addition at the Lyons, NJ, VA \nMedical Center. This facility is sorely needed by the veterans in New \nJersey, and I hope the Senate will recede to the House on this issue \nduring the conference.\n  The Lyons VA Medical Center serves nearly 75 percent of New Jersey's \nveterans, and this funding will provide vital medical care for veterans \nwho receive care on an outpatient basis. It will provide for necessary \nconstruction and renovations to enhance Lyons' clinics, diagnostic and \ntreatment services, emergency department, and support functions. The \nfunding will make a significant contribution to improving the access to \nquality medical care by New Jersey's veterans.\n  At a time when New Jersey's aging veteran population has an \nincreasing need for VA health care services, we have an obligation to \nensure that their health care needs are met. As a member of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I urge my colleagues on the committee to \ninclude this funding in the conference agreement.\n  Mr. BOND. As the Senator from New Jersey is aware, the outcome of the \nconference cannot be forecast. However, I will give strong \nconsideration to the funding for the Lyons VA Medical Center ambulatory \ncare addition in conference.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I, too, appreciate the Senator's support for the \nambulatory care addition at the Lyons VA Medical Center, and I will \njoin Senator Bond in doing all I can to support this funding during the \nconference.\n\n\n                        plant genome initiative\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I bring to the attention of my colleagues a \nprovision in this measure which directs $40 million to begin the new \nplant genome initiative to help keep U.S. agriculture on top in the \n21st century. The United States currently has a robust Federal \ninvestment in biotechnology in the human health field. While this \nremains a national priority, I think it is critical that we begin \nbuilding on the common foundation in basic science to bring the power \nof biotechnology to bear in agriculture. We cannot sit idly and expect \nto remain the world's leader in agriculture production. U.S. \nagriculture currently exports a record $60 billion in agricultural \nproducts with a net trade surplus of $30 billion. This is about the \nlong-term sustainability and competitiveness of U.S. agriculture which \nmeans that it is about meeting the world's growing nutritional needs, \nprotecting U.S. jobs, and preserving the environment.\n  The future of corn and other plant species is written in the genetic \ncode and genome mapping will give us the precise locations of genes \nthat control important traits that can be manipulated to make corn and \nother vital commodities more drought tolerant; freeze tolerant; \ntolerant to certain chemicals, weeds, or bugs; disease resistant; less \ntoxic and more digestible which is critical because it could lower \nphosphorous and nitrogen levels in animal waste.\n  This action incorporates the initial recommendations of the \ninteragency working group on plant genomes [IWG] which was formed \nrecently at my request to develop a scientific and administrative \nconsensus on how best to accomplish this ambitious new effort to \naddress the needs of 21st Century. The world population wants more \nfood, less expensive food, more nutritious food, and they want it \nproduced on less land in a more environment-friendly way. In this half \ncentury, we have seen U.S. agriculture double production by utilizing \nnew technologies. Biotechnology will be the key in the next century to \nmeet the needs of a world population which is expected to double in the \nnext 30 years while protecting the world's natural resources.\n  According to scientists, today, biotechnology makes it possible to \nenter the genetic world of plants to gain a greater degree of control \nover the selection of genes than was possible with traditional \nbreeding. It is now possible to locate the genes for certain traits, \ncut them from one organism, and paste them into another, even if the \ntarget organism is of another species. In order\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\nto accomplish a genetic transfer between organisms using biotechnology, \nscientists have to be able to find the location of the genes that \ncontrol a given characteristic, such as size, color, or resistance to \ndisease. This new initiative seeks to provide a map of these locations \nso that scientists and producers can capitalize on this vast potential \nto benefit humankind and the environment.\n  The original idea was introduced to me by the Missouri Corngrowers \nAssociation who presented a comprehensive business plan to map the corn \ngenome devised by the National Corngrowers Association working in \nconjunction with private and public scientific experts. With this \nadditional money provided in this legislation the initiative can be \nexpanded beyond corn to include other economically significant crops \nsuch as rice, soybeans, and wheat. After consulting with a number of \nscientists in Missouri and elsewhere, I have concluded that this is the \nkind of research that will unlock the information which holds the \npromise of addressing dramatically the challenges facing the world in \nthe coming century. My hat is off to those who argued convincingly that \nthis blockbuster initiative is vital to address the economic, \nnutritional, and environmental needs of the next century and worthy of \nblockbuster support from the Federal Government. I also applaud the \nadministration's IWG for their strong support in beginning to formate \nthe most scientifically and administratively feasible way to proceed so \nthat we can maximize the return on the taxpayers' investment.\n  The IWG on plant genomes which was empaneled at my request to make \nrecommendations on the plant genome initiative, consists of \nrepresentatives from the Department of Agriculture, National Science \nFoundation, National Institutes of Health, Department of Energy, Office \nof Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Management and \nBudget. In its recently-released report, while funding sources were not \nidentified, the value of this initiative was validated and \nrecommendations were advanced to provide for international cooperation, \nprivate-public partnerships, and open public access to all the \ninformation discovered. The money awarded under this act will be done \nso by the National Science Foundation on a competitive basis with peer \nreview.\n  Finally, I note that it is imperative that work continue to be done \nto integrate this initiative into the inter-agency effort that the IWG \nrecommends. This means that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will \nhave to work with us on coordinating their efforts with NSF and other \nagencies and they will have to provide recommendations on additional \nsources of funds for the effort within their budget.\n\n\n                         plant genome research\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Missouri, \nthe chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, for his \nforesight in providing funding through the National Science Foundation \nfor plant genome research. This is a critical program for American \nagriculture involving a meaningful amount of money--$40 million--to \nadvance work on plant genome projects for farm crops that contribute \nsignificantly to our economy. It has been my pleasure to work with \nSenator Bond for some time on the plant genome mapping effort.\n  Iowa is a national leader in the production of corn and soybeans. \nThese two crops are mainstays of the Iowa economy. In order to remain \ncompetitive in the world market, we need to understand in increasing \ndetail what the genetic mechanisms of these crops are and how they \nwork. Researchers in many fields can use the results of the genome \nmapping effort to enhance these crops. The genome mapping research \nresults will help us to understand new and better ways to increase crop \nyields, discover new uses and products, better the health of the plant \nby reducing risks to disease and pests, and to help protect the \nenvironment. This bodes well for the corn grower and soybean producer \nby increasing the value of the crop and, thus, increasing farm income.\n  I will continue to work with Senator Bond to see that this effort \nreceives proper funding both through the NSF and the Department of \nAgriculture. An interagency effort, along with a strong, effective, \nmeaningful public/private partnership is key to the ultimate success of \nthe plant genome mapping project. We must also be aware of \ninternational genome mapping efforts. Where possible it is necessary to \ncooperate with those efforts.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today to support the National \nScience Foundation plant genome initiative that is funded in the VA/\nHUD, Independent Agencies appropriations bill. I want to commend \nSenator Bond, chairman of the appropriations subcommittee, for his \nleadership in developing this initiative. This project will be funded \nwith new money and will not affect current NSF programs.\n  The plant genome initiative, as included in the bill, is an expansion \nof the current, NSF Arabidopsis genome project to map and sequence the \nArabidopsis genome. The plant genome initiative will advance the \ncurrent Arabidopsis project and will move us beyond the current \nprograms to more economically significant crops, such as corn, \nsoybeans, wheat, and rice.\n  To compete in the global market, U.S. agriculture must continually \nstrive to efficiently and economically improve production \ncapabilities--such as combating serious threats from disease, pests, \nand climate changes--without harming the environment. The plant genome \ninitiative will provide us the information necessary to significantly \nimprove the environment and reduce crop and livestock production costs \nat the same time. It is a win-win project for producers, for consumers, \nand for the environment.\n  This project will give us the basic, fundamental knowledge necessary \nto ensure that our consumers continue to receive an abundant supply of \nhigh quality, wholesome food at reasonable prices. To meet the growing \ndemand for U.S. agricultural products, we will need to increase \nproduction approximately three-fold in the next 50 years. The plant \ngenome initiative will set us on the right path toward meeting that \ngoal without harming the environment.\n  The plant genome initiative will have other far-reaching benefits, as \nwell. It may lead to significant reductions in crop losses while also \nreducing our reliance on pesticides. It will allow us to improve animal \nnutrition to increase meat productivity. It will, also, allow us to \nmeet consumer demands for higher quality food at reasonable prices. \nThese are just a few of the benefits that are possible with the plant \ngenome initiative.\n  I, again, want to commend Senator Bond for his foresight in providing \nfunding for the building of a foundation that will allow us to meet the \nchallenges of the 21st Century. Mr. President, this initiative is \ncritically important to U.S. consumers and to U.S. agriculture. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the NSF plant genome initiative as included in \nthe VA/HUD appropriations bill.\n\n\n                             MARK-TO-MARKET\n\n  Mr. MACK. I would like to commend Senator Bond for addressing the \nsection 8 contract expiration issue by including S. 513, the \nMultifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 in \nthe VA/HUD appropriations bill. This legislation, which is cosponsored \nby my colleague from Missouri and Senators D'Amato, Bennett, Domenici, \nFaircloth, Grams, and Chafee, is a national priority for reforming the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development's HUD multifamily housing \nprograms and reducing the escalating costs of project-based section 8 \nrenewals. According to preliminary estimates by the Congressional \nBudget Office, this legislation will save the American taxpayer about \n$4.6 billion in section 8 funds over the next 10 years. This \nlegislation not only saves scarce Federal resources, it also protects \nthe Federal investment in affordable housing by screening out \ndistressed properties and noncompliant owners from the Federal programs \nand addresses HUD's management problems with this portfolio by \nutilizing capable public and private third parties.\n  It is critical to enact this legislation into law this year. The \nBanking Committee unanimously approved S. 513 as part of its budget \nreconciliation package this June. Unfortunately, the Senate and House \nsubconferees were unable to come to an agreement on this legislation \nand subsequently, it was dropped out of the reconciliation package. \nAccordingly, I will continue to\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\npush this legislation and strongly support Senator Bond's effort in \npassing S. 513 as part of the appropriations bill.\n  When Secretary Cuomo testified before the Banking Committee on S. \n513, he raised several concerns about the restructuring process \noutlined in the bill. But he also indicated his willingness to address \nthose concerns through negotiations with the Senate. I want to point \nout that significant progress has been made to address the \nadministration's concerns with the bill. Two major areas where \nagreement was reached relate to the use of third parties or \nparticipating administrative entities [PAE] and the use of tenant-based \nassistance. On the use of PAE's, HUD has agreed to maintain the \nSenate's priority for State and local housing finance agencies to serve \nas restructuring entities. However, the Senate has agreed to provide \nadditional flexibility to the Secretary in selecting qualified PAE's \nwhile protecting the public purpose. Also, the Senate and \nadministration have agreed to provide discretion to PAE's in \ndetermining whether tenant-based or project-based assistance will be \nprovided for qualified properties after restructuring.\n  I would like to ask Senator Bond for his assurance that, as this \nprocess moves forward, he will endeavor to assure that the agreements \nmade with the administration are incorporated into the bill.\n  Mr. BOND. I congratulate Senator Mack for his work in developing a \nworkable solution to the section 8 contract renewal problem, and also \nSecretary Cuomo for his willingness to work with the Senate. Needless \nto say, it is my hope that this issue still can be resolved in budget \nreconciliation or through the regular authorization process. However, \nif it becomes necessary, we will pursue this issue through the \nappropriations process. I look forward to working with the Banking \nCommittee as we move forward and I will endeavor to include any changes \nthat are based on agreements between your committee and HUD. It is \nlikely that those agreements would be incorporated during the \nconference with the House.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee during the last Congress and as \na cosponsor of the bill, I appreciate the work that the authorizing \ncommittee has done on this legislation. Multifamily portfolio \nrestructuring is an urgent priority. I look forward to continuing our \nwork together in resolving the contract renewal crisis.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank the Senator very much for his work and dedication \nto this issue. I look forward to our continued cooperative effort in \nresolving this critical issue.\n  Ms. SNOW. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to address my \ncolleagues on a matter of critical importance to veterans in the \nNortheast. First, I would like to express my appreciation to the \nAppropriations Committee and the VA-HUD Subcommittee for their hard \nwork on this bill.\n  This package contains over $40 billion for the VA, including an \nincrease in funding for VA medical care and research. The committee's \nrecommendation for the VA represents an increase of almost $93 million \nabove the President's budget request. The committee rejected the budget \nagreement recommendation to reduce VA discretionary funding by $273 \nmillion below the President's fiscal year 1998 request, arguing that \nsuch a reduction would result in fewer eligible veterans receiving \ncomprehensive medical care, reductions to basic maintenance and repair \nof medical facilities, and additional delays in the processing of \nbenefits claims. The committee stated that the outcome of such budget \nreductions would be completely unacceptable. I strongly agree with this \nsentiment, and I would like to congratulate my colleagues on their \nefforts.\n  In this spirit, I would also like to comment on changes in the VA \nhealth care system affecting a number of veterans health care \nfacilities in the Northeast and elsewhere.\n  Under the new regional allocation formula being implemented by the \nVA, the New England network could be cut by as much as 6.36 percent \nfrom its fiscal year 1996 funding level. I realize that the New England \nregion cut may actually be lower than the 6.36 percent over 3 years \noriginally projected, and the numbers will be reevaluated every year. \nHowever, under the new allocation plan, many States will lose funding \nwhile others will receive considerable increases.\n  The VA says there will be no reduction in services to veterans in \nfacilities experiencing cuts and that cost-savings achieved through \nconsolidation of operations and greater efficiencies in the system will \nmake up for the shortfalls. However, it is not clear whether this will, \nin fact, be the case. I appreciate the fact that the committee is \nwaiting for the results of a General Accounting Office study, due in \nSeptember, on the allocation formula. I think it is very important that \nwe ensure that funding under this new system is fair and equitable.\n\n  Maine has a very large veterans population--152,000--dispersed \nthroughout the State. Togus is the only veterans community hospital in \nmy State to serve this population. Currently, Togus provides services \nalmost exclusively to mandatory--category A--veterans. In fact, less \nthan 1 percent of Togus' services go to nonmandatory veterans. Togus \ncannot be viewed as overfunded compared to other VA medical facilities. \nAnd yet, this facility, which has already made great strides in \nincreasing efficiency and rooting out waste, may experience a reduction \nin funding under the new allocation formula.\n  I believe there is a limit to the kind of restructuring that some of \nthese facilities can be expected to absorb without undermining the \nquality of care and the availability of basic services. Moreover, I am \nconcerned that a redistribution of funds away from New England presents \na potential danger that the programs under the draft strategic plan \ncould be underfunded.\n  I would remind my colleagues once again that the Senate \nAppropriations Committee rejected the budget agreement recommendation \nto reduce VA discretionary funding by $273 million below the \nPresident's fiscal year 1998 request because such a reduction would \nresult in fewer eligible veterans receiving comprehensive medical care\n  I strongly believe that each veteran must be treated with the dignity \nand respect he or she deserves by virtue of having worn our Nation's \nuniform, and we have a commitment to ensure that all veterans receive \nthe benefits they deserve.\n  A fair allocation of VA resources must take into account the regional \nimpact of all of the regional networks. As such, I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues in the Senate and in the House to ensure \nthat the bill we send to the President provides a fair and equitable \nallocation of funding for VA hospitals.\n\n\n             COMMUNITY OUTREACH PARTNERSHIP CENTERS PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today in support of my friend, \nSenator Kit Bond and his efforts to include funding for important \ncommunity development programs within the VA-HUD Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 1998. In particular, I would like to highlight the \nprovision of $12 million for the Community Outreach Partnerships \nCenters [COPC] program. I commend the subcommittee for its diligence in \nfunding this program at this level.\n  The COPC program provides assistance to public or private nonprofit \ninstitutions of higher education for a wide range of community outreach \nactivities. These colleges and universities may utilize COPC funds to \naddress a variety of local needs, including housing, economic \ndevelopment, neighborhood revitalization, job training, and crime \nprevention. The program thus utilizes and leverages the enormous \nresources of our institutions of higher learning to establish \npartnerships with local neighborhoods and communities to solve their \ncommon problems.\n  Mr. President, I would like to applaud the outstanding community \noutreach efforts of Long Island University [LIU] located in my home \nState of New York and bring these efforts to the attention of the \nSubcommittee on VA-HUD Appropriations. Long Island University, founded \nin 1886, has a current enrollment of 24,000 students and conducts a \nvariety of community oriented programs at each of its six New York \ncampuses.\n  LIU's various community outreach programs at its Brooklyn campus are \nparticularly successful and well suited to the COPC program. For \ninstance, the university operates a number of educational programs for \nsenior citizens and New York City school students, including \nunderprivileged and\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\nminority students. In addition, the university operates a small \nbusiness development institute, a speech and pathology clinic which \nserves needy persons with disabilities free of charge, and a \ncollaborative career development and cooperative education initiative.\n  Mr. President, Long Island University has an outstanding track record \nof community involvement. It has formed successful partnerships with \nstate and local governments, including the New York City Board of \nEducation, as well as community and business groups. It has \nsuccessfully leveraged additional funding from a wide variety of \nsources. I believe that its activities are a successful example of \npositive and constructive change within the community.\n  I thank Senator Bond for his efforts and I commend the community \noutreach activities of Long Island University as a model for funding \nunder the COPC program.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend Senator D'Amato's \nkind words in support of the VA-HUD appropriations bill. The \nsubcommittee is aware of the extensive community oriented programs of \nLong Island university. The University is to be commended to HUD as a \nmodel for successful involvement within the surrounding community and \nis worthy of consideration for funding under the Community Outreach \nPartnerships Center Program.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased that once again the Senate \nhas chosen to continue our Nation's commitment to the future through \nthe exploration and study of space. Especially as we stand here today \nknowing that the Sojourner Rover continues its unprecedented \nexploration of the surface of Mars. NASA is now turning its attention \nto the many new missions scheduled for future, including the \nconstruction of the international space station. Mr. President, we must \ncontinue to invest in this pursuit of knowledge.\n  No one can predict the outcome of our investment in the space \nprogram, but one thing is certain, and that is generations to come will \nbenefit from the knowledge and experience gained from the investment we \nhave made, and continued exploration of space will present many more \nopportunities to learn.\n  First, the space program will provide significant contributions not \nonly to Americans, but people all around the world. We have already \nseen results of space-related research in life science. Recently I \nlearned of a NASA technology which is now being used to help diagnose \nvision problems in our children. This coming school year, the State of \nFlorida will be using this technology to screen all students in \nkindergarten. By discovering vision problems at such an early age, we \nwill prevent many of these children from falling behind because of \nundetected impairments. This type of commercial application of NASA \nborn technology is virtually limitless.\n  Second, our Nation's leadership role in high technology research and \ndevelopment must be maintained and enhanced. The aerospace industry is \na significant area of America's international competitiveness.\n  Third, projects such as the international space station help to \ncontinue and expand cooperation among the world's nations. Our \ncollaborative efforts with the Europeans, Japanese, and Russians only \nserve to strengthen our relations in a global community. Our space \nprogram enables us to exchange exciting ideas with the world, and \naccelerate the pace of our own technology and space exploration.\n  Mr. President I believe that these are very compelling reasons for \ncontinued support of our space program. NASA deserves our support. \nCongress and the administration should provide the appropriate \nresources needed for NASA to successfully manage and enhance our space \nprogram. We must invest in our future, and invest in ourselves.\n\n\n       pilot program for affordable drugs for the terminally ill\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to address a critical need in our \nsociety, the need for affordable health care for the terminally ill. \nToday, in the fiscal year 1998 Treasury and general government \nappropriations bill, a bill which I otherwise supported, I believe we \ndid a disservice to those suffering from the HIV virus, cancer, and \nother terminal diseases. We failed to authorize a pilot program which \nmight have severely reduced the cost of essential, and at this time \nvery expensive, drugs which significantly prolong patients' lives and \nenhance their quality of life.\n  The Treasury and general government appropriations bill includes a \nrepeal of section 1555 of the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of \n1994. This so-called cooperative purchasing provision would have \nallowed local governments to purchase items from the schedule of prices \nestablished by the Government Services Administration [GSA] for the \nFederal Government. On the face of it, this provision had some appeal, \nas a measure that might save money for local governments. However, many \nargued that section 1555 would bankrupt small businesses, increase all \nprices in the long term, and undermine the reliability and safety \nprovided by a local manufacturing and distribution network. The concern \nabout section 1555 was widespread and profound and, therefore, I \nsupported a repeal of the provision. However, I favored one exception, \nwhich would address a critical need and give us a chance to observe the \neffects of section 1555. I favored the authorization of a carefully \ndefined pilot program in cooperative purchasing of drugs for terminally \nill patients.\n  Public hospitals in cities and counties throughout the United States \nare desperate to reduce the cost of health care for the terminally ill. \nLast year, the Nation's largest city, county, and State hospitals lost \nan average of $86 million per year by providing care to uninsured an \nunderinsured patients. To avoid closure or bankruptcy, many of these \ninstitutions have to limit their more expensive services, such as the \nnew generation of life-prolonging AIDS drugs. At the same time, many \nAIDS patients are deprived of adequate care because they cannot afford \n$15,000 per year for AIDS drug therapy. State and local programs must \npurchase these drugs for them.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services has agreed to coordinate \na pilot program which would enable State and local governments to \nbenefit from Federal Government rates when they purchase drugs for \nlife-threatening conditions. Recent studies suggest that this could \nsave public hospitals more than 25 percent of their current \nexpenditures on these essential drugs. These savings would, in turn, \nmake it possible for hospitals to help more Americans battling against \nterminal illness.\n  I think we all agree that the terminally ill and those who serve them \ndeserve our support in making their medical care more affordable and \navailable. At the same time, I am acutely aware of the concern of \nveterans' groups and others that this kind of program could eventually \nresult in higher health care costs for all. Therefore, this pilot \nprogram would be narrowly focused and of finite length. I encourage \nconcerned groups to contribute suggestions as we define those program \nconstraints. Furthermore, I acknowledge that this pilot program may \nfail. If so, we will have learned from our error. If the program works, \nhowever, if it truly brings down the costs of life-prolonging and \npotentially life-saving drugs, could we live with ourselves if we \nrefused to give it a chance?\n\n\n                     DRUG ELIMINATION GRANT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to state my strong support \nfor the VA-HUD Subcommittee's efforts to support funding in this \nlegislation to combat the twin scourges of drugs and crime in low-\nincome housing throughout the Nation. I am greatly encouraged by the \nsubcommittee's action in maintaining $290 million in funding for the \nDrug Elimination Grant Program.\n  Under this important program, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment [HUD] makes funds available to local housing authorities \nfor the purpose of combating and preventing crime, including drug-\nrelated crime. Housing authorities have great flexibility in \ndetermining how best to use these funds to address local needs. Many \nauthorities have used drug elimination funding to create and expand \ncommunity policing efforts, to make capital improvements to improve \nsecurity, to fund drug awareness, prevention, and treatment programs \nand to organize tenant patrols and neighborhood watch programs.\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\n  I am also fully aware of the subcommittee's inclusion of $30 million \nfor the New Approach antidrug program and I strongly support this \nprovision. This funding will be available to help combat drugs and \ncrime in non-federally assisted low-income housing which is too often \noverlooked in the traditional public housing programs.\n  However, I would like to state my concern with one aspect of the \nstructure of the account which provides funding for the Drug \nElimination Program. This troubling aspect is the expansion of a set-\naside for the Operation Safe Home initiative, administered by the HUD \nOffice of Inspector General, within that account. Let me be clear, I do \nnot question the effectiveness or usefulness of the Operation Safe Home \ninitiative. This initiative has had gratifying success in confiscating \nguns and drugs from public housing.\n  However, I am concerned with the source of funding for this \ninitiative. By reducing the amount of funding available for drug \nelimination grants, we are effectively cutting into local efforts to \ncombat crime and drugs. As chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, \nthe committee with authorizing jurisdiction over the multitude of HUD \nprograms, I was pleased to cosponsor S. 462, the Public Housing Reform \nand Responsibility Act of 1997. This legislation, which was passed out \nof the Banking Committee on May 8, 1997 by a unanimous 18-0 vote, \ncontains an important provision which would allow funding for the \nOperation Safe Home initiative to be provided from the HUD \nheadquarters' reserve fund. I am convinced that this is a far more \nappropriate funding vehicle for this initiative.\n  Like many other important HUD programs, such as public housing \noperating assistance and housing for the elderly and disabled, the \nadministration requested a cut in the Drug Elimination Grant Program. \nThis proposed $20 million cut would occur as a result of a set-aside \nwithin the program to fund the HUD inspector general's Operation Safe \nHome initiative.\n  Mr. President, I am grateful that the VA-HUD Subcommittee did not \nfollow the approach adopted in the House, and instead reduced the \nadministration's recommended cut of $20 million to a $15 million cut. \nHowever, I believe that even this reduced cut in antidrug funding is \ntoo much and the full amount should be restored to the program.\n  I express my wish to continue to work with the VA-HUD Subcommittee as \nwe move toward conference with the House of Representatives on this \nimportant legislation. I am confident that attempts to increase this \nset-aside at conference will be unsuccessful and I am hopeful that \ntogether the Banking and Appropriations Committees can agree upon a \nmore appropriate source of funding for the Operation Safe Home \ninitiative.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me once again thank my good friend \nSenator Bond for his leadership and diligence in crafting a VA-HUD \nappropriations bill which makes tough choices with the limited amount \nof funds available. I look forward to working together as the process \ncontinues.\n\n\n                           SELF-HELP HOUSING\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation \nto Senator Kit Bond for his efforts to provide funding within the VA-\nHUD Appropriations bill to expand homeownership activities through the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development [HUD]. In this regard, I \nnote with particular appreciation the provision of $30 million in \nfunding for the Capacity Building for Community Development and \nAffordable Housing program.\n  This program was expanded and reauthorized by the Housing Opportunity \nProgram Extension Act [HOPE Act], which I was pleased to sponsor. It \nprovides an unparalleled opportunity to support local housing and \nhomeownership initiatives. Specifically, the HOPE Act provided for the \nsupport of housing organizations which utilize a self-help approach to \nhomeownership opportunities.\n  Mr. President, I would like to commend and bring to the attention of \nthe VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee the outstanding efforts of one \nparticular self-help housing provider located in my home state of New \nYork. The Riverhead Revitalization and Preservation Corp. [Riverhead \nCorp.], under the guidance and leadership of Ms. Patricia Stark, \nutilizes donated labor from volunteers and potential homeowners to \ndevelop and rehabilitate homes on Long Island, NY.\n  The Riverhead Corp. is helping to reverse the decline of \nneighborhoods by renovating blighted homes and providing a stake in the \ncommunity for first-time homeowners. In addition, the Riverhead Corp. \nemploys a revolving loan-fund strategy which reinvests proceeds from \nhome sales in the further development of housing opportunities. Thus, \nthe Riverhead Corp. helps to stimulate community revitalization, \npromotes job and business creation, and provides housing for deserving \nlow- and moderate-income working families.\n  I commend the efforts of the Riverhead Corp. to the Subcommittee and \nto HUD as a model of success which would be worthy of support under the \nself-help homeownership auspices of the Capacity Building program \nfunded by this legislation. Once again, I would like to thank Senator \nKit Bond for his efforts to support increased homeownership throughout \nthe Nation.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank Senator Alfonse D'Amato for his support of this VA-\nHUD Appropriations legislation and for our joint efforts to bring the \nbenefits of homeownership to as many American families as possible. The \nsubcommittee recognizes the local efforts of the Riverhead Corp. \nRevitalization and Preservation to increase access to homeownership on \nLong Island, where I know housing and development costs can often be \nprohibitive. I urge the Department of Housing and Urban Development to \nseriously consider any application for assistance on the part of the \nRiverhead Corp. under the Capacity Building program initiative. I too \ncommend the Riverhead Corp. for its successful and innovative efforts \nto improve communities and enhance home-ownership opportunities.\n\n\n                           veterans programs\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans Affairs, I am pleased to express my support for \nS. 1034, the fiscal year 1998 Departments of Veterans Affairs and \nHousing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies appropriation \nbill, and most particularly for title I, the part of the bill dealing \nwith VA.\n  I realize that this has again been a very difficult year for funding \nissues, with a reduced 602(b) allocation, agency spending being cut by \nreconciliation measures, and increased competition for what limited \nfunding remained available. The Chair of the VA-HUD Subcommittee, \nSenator Bond, the ranking member, Senator Mikulski, and the other \nmembers of the subcommittee deserve credit for their remarkable efforts \nwith regard to veterans' needs, as evident in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I remind my colleagues that the budget resolution \nincluded proposed reductions in VA spending below the current fiscal \nyear 1997 level, and below what is generally considered the current \nservices level. At the time that the Senate passed the balanced budget \nresolution, I took strong exception to the proposal funding for \nveterans. In my view, the budget resolution asked veterans to carry a \ndisproportionate share of the burden to balance the Federal budget. \nRealizing, too, that slashing discretionary spending--especially for \nhealth care--was inappropriate, the Committee on Appropriations \n[Committee] saw fit to alter the spending priorities for veterans. \nInstead, the committee was able to increase funding for VA medical \ncare, research, and the State Veterans Home Program. This is a \ntremendous achievement. While I would always want to increase support \nfor veterans programs further, I am enormously pleased with the result \nof their efforts, and would like to highlight several accomplishments \nin particular.\n  For health care, the committee recommended $17.02 billion for VA \nmedical care, an increase of $68 million over the President's request. \nThe committee also recognized that VA is to retain, under new \nauthorizing legislation which is part of the budget agreement, the so-\ncalled medical care cost recovery [MCCR] collections estimated to reach \n$604 million in fiscal year 1998. Because collections of these third-\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nparty receipts has grown from $267 million in fiscal year 1991 to over \n$557 million in fiscal year 1996, I am encouraged by VA's ability to \ngenerate nonappropriated revenue. I note with caution however, that \nVA's outpatient billing remains problematic. Along with my colleague, \nSenator Mikulski, I intend to be attentive to VA's collection \nactivities.\n  When combined, the committee's recommendation and the authorization \nfor the retention of insurance moneys bring total discretionary \nresources for medical care to $17.6 billion. As we proceed with Senate \napproval of the VA appropriations bill, it is important to note that \nthis amount constitutes an increase of $617 million over current \nspending.\n  I am also particular gratified by the committee's report language on \nthe need for a community-based outpatient clinic [CBOC] in Charleston, \nthe capital of my home State of West Virginia. Indeed, the committee \nnoted that a Charleston CBOC would improve service to more than 27,000 \nveterans in Kanawha and surrounding counties, including Boone, Putnam, \nLincoln, and Logan. Thousands of these veterans reside in rural areas, \nmany miles from the nearest VA medical center. Many of them live in \nareas with no public transportation, where just a trip to the doctor \ncan take several hours of driving time on winding, mountainous roads. A \nVA outpatient clinic in this part of West Virginia is long overdue.\n  Throughout my tenure on the Committee on Veteran's Affairs, I have \nwitnessed the direct benefits of a strong research program, such as \nhigher quality clinicians and discoveries in prosthetics, cancer, AIDS, \nand aging. These discoveries directly affect the everyday activities of \nveterans. After several years of flat funding, I believe that the time \nhas come to increase the VA research appropriation. The Appropriations \nCommittee agreed and included an increase in the VA medical and \nprosthetic research account. Although the increase--$5 million--is \nmodest, it sends an important signal to the VA research community that \nwe value their work and the direct impact it has on our veterans.\n  The increase in research funding will help support important work on \nthe health problems of atomic veterans, Vietnam-era veterans, and gulf \nwar veterans. Over the years, we have witnessed the emergence of \nspecial health problems associated with each war. In response, VA \nresearchers have made important gains in the understanding of each of \nthese populations and their clinical needs. Their challenges continue, \nand we must make sure that their research efforts are well supported.\n  I also express my strong support for the committee's action to fully \nfund the Court of Veterans Appeal's Pro Bono Representation Program. \nThis program is of utmost importance to our Nation's veterans. At a \ntime when the court is experiencing a dramatic increase in the number \nof appeals filed, it would be devastating to cut the funding of a \nprogram that matches up pro bono attorneys with indigent veterans. It \nis a small program, but it's impact is great. In fact, the Pro Bono \nProgram will be assigning its one thousandth case to a pro bono \nattorney on July 24, 1997.\n  Mr. President, although I am pleased with the overall outcome of this \nbill, I have concerns about the effect of the bill's appropriation for \nVA's general operating expenses account. The bill provides for $786 \nmillion, which is $41 million below the current budget and $60 million \nbelow the budget request. This is a significant cut for VA to absorb, \nespecially at a time when it is still taking VA an average of 135 days \nto process an original compensation claim. However, as we strive toward \ndeficit reduction, Congress cannot continue to throw money at problems \nin the absence of effective leadership at agencies to bring about the \nchange that is needed. Sadly, that absence has been profound at the \nVeterans Benefit Administration in recent years. It is time for VA to \nmanage the benefits process, not just administer it. It is past time \nfor VA to change, in major ways, beginning with the implementation of \nmany of the recommendations contained in the recent reports of the \nVeterans' Claims Adjudication Commission and the National Academy of \nPublic Administration.\n  Mr. President, there is no doubt that this is a very exciting time. \nVA has the potential for meaningful change. Whether it is in the area \nof a medical care or benefits administration, I believe that, on \nbalance, the Committee on Appropriations has given VA the resources it \nneeds to move forward with much needed reforms. I applaud the \nleadership of all the members of the Appropriations Committee, and \nespecially those members on the VA-HUD Subcommittee.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I express my deepest gratitude to my \nesteemed colleague, Senator Mikulski, the ranking Democrat on the \nSenate VA-HUD Subcommittee, for her continued efforts with respect to \nveterans' programs. This year, as she does every year, Senator Mikulski \nhas shown her unwavering support for veterans. I am pleased to call her \nmy colleague and friend.\n\n\n                                  csoc\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like to engage the Senator from Maryland in a \ncolloquy regarding the intent of report language included on her behalf \nin the Senate Report accompanying S. 1034, the fiscal year 1998 VA-HUD \nand Independent Agencies appropriations bill concerning NASA's \nConsolidated Space Operations Contract.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would be pleased to engage in a colloquy concerning \nCSOC.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Would the Senator agree that it is not the intent of \nher report language to expand the CSOC procurement to include elements \nof the Space Flight Operations Contract not presently envisioned to be \npart of the SCOC contract, as stipulated in the pending request for \nproposals.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator is correct. The intent of the report \nlanguage is simply to ensure that NASA include all appropriate common \nsupport functions at all NASA centers under CSOC, as defined in the \nrequest for proposals.\n\n\n                 don't underfund critical toxic cleanup\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies \nappropriations bill presents an all too common dilemma--inadequate \nfunds and very deserving programs--and the choices we must make are \nvery difficult indeed.\n  I appreciate the difficult job the chairman and ranking member had in \ndealing with an insufficient Section 602(b) allocation.\n  However, as a strong advocate for our environment, and as ranking on \nthe Budget Committee, I am very disappointed at the level of funding \nfor the Environmental Protection Agency's operating budget. The mark \nfor EPA's operation is $200 million below the President's request and \nthe budget agreement.\n  I am specifically concerned that we are continuing to add duties to \nEPA without the accompanying resources. This budget does not provide \nthe funding needed to meet Congress's demands that EPA carry out more \ncost-benefit analysis in its regulations, for additional outreach to \nsmall businesses, and for fuller consideration of stakeholders in the \nregulatory process.\n  Nor does it provide adequate funding to combat global warming. \nIndeed, at a recent Environment and Public Works Committee hearing the \nonly issue on which all the witnesses agreed was the need for more \nfunding for critical climate change research.\n  I am also disappointed that the mark does not include any funding \nincrease for superfund. I understand the chairman believes that \nsuperfund must be reauthorized before that money is appropriated. I \ndisagree with that assessment. However, I am working closely with \nSenators Smith, Baucus, and Chafee and I expect we soon will have a \nbipartisan bill.\n  If that bill comes after this appropriations cycle, I will urge my \ncolleagues to support a supplemental that funds hazardous waste clean \nup to the level in the budget agreement. The millions of people living \nnear superfund sites deserve our efforts to fully fund this program.\n  I am also disappointed that the chairman's mark zeros-out Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions, or CDFI. One hundred twenty-five \nmillion dollars was included in the budget agreement. I understand the \nHouse included full funding for this important program and I look \nforward for a better outcome during the conference.\n\n[[Page S7852]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased the Appropriations Committee, the \nmembers unanimously agreed to my amendment to transfer money for \ninvestigations of chemical accidents from EPA and OSHA to the Chemical \nSafety Board.\n  An independent Chemical Safety Board, with its expertise and \nobjectivity, is the proper body to investigate and identify steps \nneeded to prevent future accidents. In 1990, Congress established the \nindependent Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board to do just \nthat. The board was modeled on the respected and influential National \nTransportation Safety Board. As part of its reinventing government \nprogram, the administration cut funding for the chemical board and \ntried to transfer its authority to EPA and OSHA. Subsequent events, \nincluding an investigation in New Jersey, show that this reorganization \nwas ill-advised.\n  By reviving the board, Congress is reasserting its authority and \nprotecting the workers and communities around chemical industrial \nsites.\n  I want to thank those who helped revive this board. First, I want to \nacknowledge the help of Senator Bond and Mikulski. I also want to thank \nthe public interest groups, the oil, chemical, and atomic workers, and \nthe companies that have publicly recognized the advantage of having \nthis board. I want to single out for acknowledgment Marathon Oil \nand the Rohm & Haas Corp. in that regard.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that a letter signed by 19 public interest \ngroups in support of the Lautenberg amendment to fund the Chemical \nSafety Board be printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. Lautenberg. Finally, I want to thank the Chairman of the \nCommittee for including report language assuring the citizens of Toms \nRiver, N.J. that the study of the cancer cluster will be completely \ncarried out. The language in the report underscores the Federal \ncommitment to pursuing the cause of the cancer cluster and making sure \nthis research is completed.\n  Mr. President, as I close my statement, I want to once again \nacknowledge Senator Bond and Mikulski for the difficult job they did in \nface of inadequate resources.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                    July 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Ted Stevens,\n     Committee on Appropriations,\n     Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Stevens: As members of social justice, \n     environmental, religious, and labor organizations we are \n     writing to express our full support for a $6 million \n     appropriation to fund the Chemical Safety and Hazard \n     Investigation Board. We request your support and that of \n     others on your committee in passing the Lautenberg amendment \n     which would provide this funding.\n       Modelled after the respected and influential National \n     Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), the Chemical Safety and \n     Hazard Investigation Board (CSHIB) was established by the \n     1990 Clean Air Act to independently investigate the root \n     causes of chemical accidents and offer recommendations on \n     ways to prevent accidents in the future. However, seven years \n     after its authorization and several years after the \n     confirmation of three of its members, the board is still \n     without funding.\n       In 1994, the Administration decided that the Board was \n     redundant in light of efforts to reinvent government. Thus, \n     the Board's duties were subsequently passed to two regulatory \n     agencies, EPA and OSHA. To date these two agencies have done \n     an abominable job in investigating chemical accidents. For \n     example, 27 months following a major accident at Napp \n     Technologies in Lodi, N.J., which claimed the lives of five \n     workers, an accident investigation report has yet to be \n     released. This is not the fault of the dedicated compliance \n     personnel in the field. OSHA and EPA are primarily concerned \n     with determining violations of specific standards, not with \n     the kind of comprehensive investigations needed to determine \n     the root causes of major chemical accidents. Further, \n     questions have been raised about the legal jurisdiction of \n     those agencies. For example, following an accident at a Tosco \n     oil refinery in Martinez, Calif., EPA was barred from \n     entering the facility to investigate the accident because the \n     agency could not provide proof of their authority to enter. \n     Finally, jurisdictional problems have plagued the attempt to \n     delegate authority to investigate the causes of chemical \n     accidents within two separate agencies\n       The Chemical Safety Board, on the other hand, is an \n     independent, non-regulatory body, and the Board's findings, \n     conclusions, and recommendations cannot be admitted as \n     evidence or used in litigation. In both this case and the \n     case of transport accidents, Congress wisely chose to \n     separate the regulatory agencies from those charged with \n     investigations. Thus, the Board can investigate the root \n     causes of industrial accidents, conduct research, oversee the \n     performance of chemical safety standards, and recommend \n     improvements in chemical manufacturing, processing, transport \n     and storage free from political and industrial interference. \n     Federal agencies, such as EPA and OSHA, are required to \n     respond to, but are not bound to adopt, the high-profile \n     recommendations issued by the Board. As is the case with \n     recommendations made by the highly regarded NTSB, we would \n     hope that those made by the Chemical Safety Board would be \n     quickly and efficiently adhered to by industry.\n       Chemical accidents continue to occur on average 21 times a \n     day in the United States, costing human lives, causing untold \n     damage to property and the environment, and increasing health \n     care and environmental clean-up costs. Recent chemical \n     disasters clearly illustrate the need for this independent \n     board and its work to refine, coordinate, direct, and \n     improve federal chemical safety activities. Proper \n     oversight could have prevented many of these tragedies, \n     such as an accident last month at a fertilizer factor in \n     Helena, Ark., which claimed the lives of several \n     firefighters. This accident parallels a similar accident \n     three years ago at another fertilizer factory near Sioux \n     City, Iowa, which claimed the lives of three individuals.\n       We strongly support an appropriation of $6 million to fund \n     and finally make operational the Chemical Safety and Hazard \n     Investigation Board for the health and safety of our workers, \n     communities, and environment.

Mr. President, I would like to commend Senator Bond and \nRanking Minority Member Mikulski for their steadfast recognition of the \nneed to preserve our Nation's dwindling supply of affordable rental \nhousing units. The Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident \nHomeownership Act of 1990 [LIHPRHA] is an important tool for \nmaintaining this scarce resource. I appreciate your bill's\n\n[[Page S7853]]\n\nprovision of a structure for continuing a modified capital grant-\ncapital loan program for housing preservation activities under the \nexisting LIHPRHA program.\n  As you are aware, there are almost 30,000 low-income rental units in \n37 States that have been approved by HUD and are awaiting funding \nthrough this program. This represents a critical need for preservation \nof the existing stock, particularly in tight rental markets. In low \nvacancy rate areas, tenant-based rental assistance is often ineffective \nin meeting the housing needs of deserving low-income Americans. In New \nYork City, for example, housing development and land acquisition costs \nare high and production of new affordable housing is very limited. \nTherefore, retaining the current housing stock is a cost-efficient and \ndesirable means of meeting shelter needs.\n  Mr. BOND. Thank you for your remarks. It is my full intention to work \nwith you to improve the LIHPRHA program. It is this subcommittee's \ndesire to ensure that a cost-effective approach to preserving our much \nneeded housing is adequately funded. I am especially concerned about \nthe detrimental effects of the loss of stock on areas of the country \nwith low vacancy rates.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank you for your consideration and your continued \ncommitment. I appreciate your willingness to continue this dialog and \nlook forward to working with you throughout conference committee action \nto resolve this significant housing crisis in a fair and equitable \nmanner.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nseveral other projects that currently are funded in the House version. \nI am hopeful these will get full consideration by the conference \ncommittee, and be included in the final bill.\n   Mr. President, I believe that it is our responsibility to ensure \nthat Federal research and its subsequent data is shared, whenever \npossible, with the taxpayers who fund these research programs. To this \nend, I would like to state my support for the $5.8 million provided in \nthe House bill to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's \n[NASA] Commercial Technology Program. These funds would be used to \nsupport existing successful program goals, as well as new initiatives \nto link businesses from distressed communities to NASA commercial \ntechnologies.\n  It is critical to the competitiveness of our economy that we promote \nthe shared use of research material between Federal agencies such as \nNASA and the private sector. Support for this program is an important \nstep in that direction. The program will allow highly successful \noutreach efforts such as the NASA Lewis Business and Industry Summit to \nbe carried forward and will help to ensure NASA Lewis' long-term \nviability as an economic force in northeastern Ohio.\n   Mr. President, I also believe it is our responsibility to use the \nsuccess of Federal investments in technology to improve, whenever \nfeasible, our education system. Therefore I hope the conferees will \nagree with the House Appropriation Committee's decision to increase \nNASA's Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Aerospace Academy [SEMAA] \nand Mobile Aeronautics Education Laboratory [MAEL] programs $3.3 \nmillion. This increase would enable the NASA Lewis Research Center and \nCuyahoga Community College to expand their already successful programs \nto the Cuyahoga Community College's western campus. In addition, the \nworkstations included in the Mobile Aeronautics Education Laboratory \ncan be replicated in Cleveland area schools.\n   Mr. President, as we are all too well aware, flooding disasters \ntragically struck the Midwest this past spring. While there is little \nwe can do to prevent natural disasters, we must take every step \npossible to respond to these disasters in order to minimize potential \nloss of life and property. I sincerely hope the conferees will agree \nwith the House Appropriations Committee's decision to provide $5 \nmillion to support the replacement and upgrading of outdated Federal \nEmergency Management Agency [FEMA] emergency response equipment. \nUpgraded, functional equipment is critical to protecting our citizens \nfrom unfortunate natural disasters and I strongly believe safety issues \nsuch as the support of this equipment should be a priority in our \nbudget discussions. I specifically believe the mobile emergency \nresponse support and mobile air transportable telecommunications \ndeserve particular attention.\n   Mr. President, I note the presence on the floor of my good friend \nfrom Missouri, Senator Bond, chairman of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on VA-HUD. I would hope that he, and the Senator from \nMaryland, Senator Mikulski, will give serious consideration to the \nprograms I described.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator from Ohio for his statement. I have \nlistened very carefully to his remarks and I recognize his concern for \nthe two programs he mentioned. As the Senator is aware, the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee had to respond to a vast number of requests \nwith a limited pool of resources to do it. The Senator from Ohio has \nraised very compelling arguments and I will carefully consider his \nrequest during the conference committee deliberations.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my distinguished friend, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               YOUTHBUILD\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to commend my friend, \nSenator Kit Bond for his efforts as chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee \nto include $35 million in funding for the Youthbuild program. This \ninnovative and successful program allows disadvantaged and at-risk \nyouth to acquire educational and job skills and develop leadership \nabilities within their communities. In the process, the program helps \nto develop and rehabilitate physically distressed housing in order to \nprovide decent, safe and affordable housing opportunities to low and \nmoderate-income families.\n  I also note that the subcommittee has instructed HUD to provide a \npriority in funding for program applicants that demonstrate an ability \nto leverage private and nonprofit funding. In this era of limited \nFederal funding, it is essential that our program dollars are stretched \nto the maximum extent possible. I fully support this important \nprovision and believe it will result in a greater benefit for each \nFederal dollar provided and a greater amount of local community \ncoordination and decisionmaking.\n  I would like to bring one particular organization to the attention of \nthe chairman and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski. The Bedford-\nStuyvesant Restoration Corp. [Restoration] located in central Brooklyn \nhas a 30-year legacy of economic development, job creation, and \ncommunity building. Restoration currently operates an education and job \ntraining initiative, known as Career Path, which assists economically \ndisadvantaged young adults, ages 16-24, to become productive members of \nthe community by providing education and developing employment, \ncitizenship, and leadership skills.\n  I note that the Restoration Corp. has an outstanding record of \nsuccessfully leveraging local, State, and private funding through \nprivate charities, foundation support, corporate sponsorship, and a \nvariety of private fundraising efforts. One such effort recently \nresulted in Restoration receiving a 5 year $1.75 million grant from \nCablevision, Inc. I believe Restoration's Career Path initiative \nrepresents a successful model which leverages private funding, invests \nin our youth and helps to revitalize the stock of affordable housing.\n  By helping to fund Restoration's Career Path initiative, HUD can help \nto restore economic viability to the neighborhoods of central Brooklyn \nand assist at-risk young adults to become active and productive members \nof the community. Once again, I would express my appreciation and \nsupport for Senator Bond's continuing efforts to support successful \nhousing and economic development initiatives.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend Senator Alfonse D'Amato \nfor his support of our efforts to fund and improve the operation of \nexisting HUD programs. The subcommittee is fully aware of the Bedford-\nStuyvesant Restoration Corp. and its 30-year legacy of economic and \ncultural development in New York. I am confident that the Career Path \ninitiative will receive a full and fair consideration from HUD in any \nfuture competition under the Youthbuild program.\n\n\n                    economic development initiative\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I see my friend from Missouri, the \nchairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, on the floor and \nwould like\n\n[[Page S7854]]\n\nto call to his attention an important project in Ohio that I believe is \ndeserving of funding under the Community Development Block Grant [CDBG] \nProgram. Specifically, I am interested in the economic development \ninitiative funding for various community development projects. A number \nwere listed by the committee in its report on the bill. I am very \ninterested in a community-wide effort in Lorain, OH, to convert a soon-\nto-be-closed hospital into a community resource center. This is an area \nthat is economically depressed, and in addition to the economic losses \nassociated with the closure of the hospital, the community recently \ndiscovered that the local Ford production plant will soon be closing \nits doors. Would the Senator from Missouri agree that an initiative \nwhich attempted to convert the hospital space into a community resource \nand training center be a worthy candidate for funding under the \ncommittee's EDI provision?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Ohio raising \nthis issue. I agree with him that the project he has described in \nLorain would appear to be well-suited for the EDI program.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee \nfor his comments. Were it not for the fact that the hospital is \nscheduled to close at the end of the year, I would be content to seek \nfunding for this project through traditional funding channels. However, \nthe hospital is set to close in just a few months. Therefore, I have \nlittle choice but to request that the chairman of the subcommittee take \na very close look at this project as he proceeds to conference with the \nHouse on the final version of this appropriations bill. Specifically, \nwhat I am seeking is consideration for support of funds to allow for \nrenovation and conversion of this space. What I am trying to avoid is \nseeing this hospital close and having this wonderful facility stand \nempty. Should this happen, I am concerned that it stands vulnerable to \ndeterioration, and even vandalism, to a point that the only option left \nfor the community is to tear down the structure.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Ohio's \nconcerns, and commend him for his efforts to seek a positive solution. \nAs I am sure he well knows, this has been a difficult year for \ncommunity development projects, such as the one he has discussed. All \nthe same, I am impressed by the overall project, ranging from job \ntraining to child care to community service activities. I will give the \nSenator's request all due consideration as we go to conference on this \nbill. Is that satisfactory to the Senator?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, that is satisfactory and I thank the \ndistinguished chairman for his willingness to work with me and the \nmembers of the Ohio congressional delegation, as well as the community \nof Lorain to turn the closure of the hospital into a new, positive \nbeginning for the people of Lorain.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Subcommittee on VA, HUD, and \nIndependent Agencies has included funding for economic development \ninitiatives in S. 1034. I am pleased that the committee report mentions \na worthy project at the University of San Francisco that will provide \nimportant economic development in international business opportunities \nfor this campus.\n  In the weeks ahead, I will be working with my colleagues in the \nSenate and House, as well as with Secretary Cuomo and his staff at HUD, \nto secure funds for the Center for International Business Education at \nthe University of San Francisco, a model program for training and \ninternational commerce, environmental management and business ethics. \nThe EDI funds would play an important role in promoting economic \nvitality in northern California. The center will provide jobs at home \nand abroad, while enhancing America's international economic \ncompetitiveness. EDI funding will assist in renovation of critical \nfacilities and completion of a distance learning facility, while adding \nnew programs for an important program initiative.\n  I thank Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski for recognizing this \nworthy project.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 930\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, last Thursday Senator Hatch and myself, \nalong with Senators Leahy and Durbin, offered an amendment to the \nTreasury-Postal appropriations bill that would delink Federal judicial \npay raises from those of the Congress and senior level executive branch \nofficials. Our amendment, which was accepted without objection, will \nallow judges' salaries to be adjusted automatically on an annual basis. \nI am pleased that it is part of the measure that will pass the Senate \ntoday.\n  For too many years, Congress has refused to take the political heat \nfor accepting pay raises, and held judicial salaries hostage in the \nprocess. This congressional scheme of hiding behind judicial robes has \ncreated a tremendous financial gulf between Federal judges and the \nlawyers who come before them. The likelihood that this salary gap will \nonly get worse is driving some of our best jurists from the Federal \nbench and making it increasingly difficult to attract top-quality \nreplacements. Such a talent drain threatens the quality of American \njustice at a time when our already overburdened courts need our best \nand most experienced legal minds.\n  The numbers offer their own warning. Between 1960 and 1970, only \nthree Federal judges resigned. But since 1980 more than 50 judges have \nleft the bench early, many citing inadequate compensation as the \nreason. Indeed, a study several years ago by the American Bar \nAssociation estimated that more than one-fourth of the Nation's Federal \njudges may quit their jobs.\n  While this exodus grows, it is becoming increasingly difficult to \nattract the best and the brightest to Federal judicial service. \nJudicial candidates can clearly see the ink fading on their checkbooks. \nMany say they want to serve the public, but they just can't afford it.\n  The solution to this problem is simple, and by delinking judicial pay \nraises, the Senate today takes an important step toward ensuring that \nthis situation will not be repeated. I am hopeful and optimistic that \nwe can retain this provision when we conference the measure with the \nHouse.\n  Mr. President, we in Congress have taken the opportunity to show our \ncommitment to fairness. We have recognized the mistake Congress made 20 \nyears ago when it tied its own salary increases to those of Federal \njudges. This backdoor way of securing congressional pay raises hasn't \nworked. But by this amendment we have freed the hostages, the Nation's \nFederal judges, and helped to ensure the continued high quality of \nAmerica's judicial system.\n\n\n           COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS FUND\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern that \nfunding for the Community Development Financial Institutions [CDFI] \nFund has not been included in the VA/HUD appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1998.\n  The CDFI Fund is an economic development initiative that was adopted \nwith overwhelming bipartisan support several years ago. The program is \nan important investment tool for economically distressed communities. \nOverall, Senator Bond and Senator Mikulski have done an excellent job \nof producing a bill which makes the most of the limited funding \navailable. However, by not funding CDFI, I believe the committee has \nmissed the opportunity to make a substantial and cost-effective \ninvestment in our distressed communities.\n  CDFI leverages private investment to stretch every Federal dollar. \nThe VA/HUD appropriations bill reported by the House Appropriations \nCommittee includes the $125 million requested by the President for this \nvaluable program. Senator Mikulski has discussed her intention to \nrevisit the issue of CDFI funding in conference. I too believe the CDFI \nProgram deserves the opportunity to demonstrate its effectiveness in \nbringing economic development resources to distressed communities. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond during \nconference to restore funding for this program.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 1034, the \nDepartments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development and \nindependent agencies appropriations bill for 1998.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $91.5 billion and new \noutlays of $52.6 billion to finance the programs of the Departments of \nVeterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies.\n\n[[Page S7855]]\n\n  I congratulate the chairman and ranking member for producing a bill \nthat, with adoption of the manager's amendment, is within the \nsubcommittee's revised 602(b) allocation. This is one of the most \ndifficult bills to manage with its varied programs and challenging \nallocation, but I think the bill meets most of the demands made of it \nwhile staying under budget and is a strong candidate for enactment, so \nI commend my friend the chairman for his efforts and leadership.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority [BA] and other \nadjustments are taken into account, the bill totals $90.7 billion in BA \nand $99.8 billion in outlays. The total bill is at the Senate \nsubcommittee's 602(b) nondefense allocation for budget authority and \noutlays. The subcommittee is also under its defense allocation by $1 \nmillion in BA.\n  I ask members of the Senate to refrain from offering amendments which \nwould cause the subcommittee to exceed its budget allocation and urge \nthe speedy adoption of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee scoring of the bill be inserted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n S. 1034, VA-HUD APPROPRIATIONS, 1998--SPENDING COMPARISONS, SENATE-REPORTED BILL [Fiscal year 1998, In millions\n                                                   of dollars]                                                  \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Defense       Nondefense         Crime         Mandatory         Total    \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:                                                                                           \n    Budget authority............             128          69,263  ..............          21,332          90,723\n    Outlays.....................             128          79,561  ..............          20,061          99,750\nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority............             129          60,065  ..............          21,332          81,526\n    Outlays.....................             128          76,154  ..............          20,061          96,343\nPresident's request:                                                                                            \n    Budget authority............             129          76,965  ..............          21,332          98,426\n    Outlays.....................             128          80,313  ..............          20,061         100,502\nHouse-passed bill:                                                                                              \n    Budget authority............             128          69,823  ..............          21,332          91,283\n    Outlays.....................             128          80,403  ..............          20,061         100,592\n                                                                                                                \n  SENATE-REPORTED BILL COMPARED                                                                                 \n               TO:                                                                                              \nSenate 602(b) allocation:                                                                                       \n    Budget authority............

Mr. President, I rise to support the VA-HUD \nappropriations bill. Chairman Bond, a former colleague of mine on the \nBanking Committee, and Senator Mikulski, the ranking member and my good \nfriend from Maryland, both have a deep understanding of the importance \nof housing programs that are so crucial to creating safe, decent, and \naffordable housing for the American people. I want to thank them for \ntheir hard work.\n  The committee did a good job of juggling many competing needs and \ninterests that go far beyond housing programs. I want to recognize \ntheir good work in both appropriating enough funds to renew expiring \nsection 8 contracts and in adopting the mark-to-market legislation \npassed as part of the reconciliation bill but unfortunately dropped in \nconference. This legislation, sponsored by Senators Mack, D'Amato, \nBond, and others addresses what Secretary Cuomo calls the biggest \ncrisis facing HUD in a way that saves money and ensures the long-term \npreservation of the section 8 housing stock.\n  We have worked very hard on a bipartisan basis in a short period of \ntime to iron out differences with HUD on the section 8 legislation. It \nis my hope that, as the appropriations bill moves forward, the \ncommittee will adopt the agreements we reached with HUD which will make \nthe program easier to implement and generally more efficient. Solving \nthis problem will rank as one of our best accomplishments for this \nCongress and I again want to thank the chairman and ranking member for \ntheir interest and dedication in putting the section 8 housing program \non a sound financial and management footing.\n  Unfortunately, while these efforts on the section 8 portfolio should \nbear real fruit, the committee has been forced to try to squeeze too \nmany high-priority programs into too small a box. There is simply not \nenough money in this bill to address the overall housing needs we face \nin this country.\n  For example, consider the public housing funding. While public \nhousing has become a much-maligned program, this view is unwarranted. \nThe vast majority of public housing is in good shape. Fewer than 100 of \nmore than 3,300 public housing authorities [PHA's] are troubled. Public \nhousing serves hundreds of thousands of elderly households and nearly \n1\\1/2\\ million children. In many neighborhoods, public housing is \nindistinguishable from the privately owned housing that may be next \ndoor.\n  As in everything, problems do exist. There are bad housing projects \nand bad housing authorities. However, the Banking Committee is working \non legislation that will require the Secretary to react quickly to put \nthe bad PHA's in receivership and to demolish bad projects. We are also \nreforming the program to create more mixed-income communities and help \nmake it possible for additional working families to get access to \npublic and assisted housing. In fact, public housing represents about \none-third of the housing stock affordable to minimum wage workers in \nths country. It is for this reason, among others, that Secretary Cuomo \ncalled public housing a precious resource.\n  While these reforms will contribute greatly to the overall health of \nthe public housing program, in order to succeed, public housing needs \nmore funding. The bill before us provides $2.9 billion for public \nhousing operating subsidies, the same as this year. Operating subsidies \nare needed to cover the shortfall between what public housing \nauthorities can collect in rent and what it costs to run the projects. \nI am pleased that the committee preserved this funding at current \nlevels.\n  Even with the committee's best efforts, however, the $2.9 billion \ncovers only about 85 percent of what the PHA's need to pay for their \nday-to-day operations. We have put public housing authorities in a \nbind. They are asked to serve the poor, but not given the funding \nnecessary to ensure that they can house the poor adequately. To close \nthe gap, PHAs are forced to put off routine maintenance and small \ncapital projects. In effect, the housing stock faces slow deterioration \njust so the housing authorities can pay the heating bill.\n  The capital account in this bill also stays steady at $2.5 billion. \nThese are much-needed funds, and again, I welcome the committee's \neffort to protect this crucial spending. But the fact is, the National \nCommission on Severely Distressed Public Housing said that PHA's need \n$4.5 billion per year for 10 years to take care of backlogged capital \nneeds, in addition to keeping up with routine maintenance, which, by \nitself, costs $1.7 billion annually.\n  This combination of low operating subsidies and inadequate capital \nfunding means that we are slowly bleeding our public housing stock to \ndeath. All the hard work and good intentions of the committee cannot \nmake up for the fact that the chairman and ranking\n\n[[Page S7856]]\n\nmember were simply not given the allocation necessary to fund these \ncrucial housing programs at necessary levels.\n  Similarly, homeless funding remains level in this bill, although \nhomelessness, despite good progress, continues to be a serious problem. \nWhile economic growth is strong, it has not reached down to the people \nwho live on the bottom rung of society's ladder. In fact, the \nConference of Mayors estimates that homelessness increased by 5 percent \nlast year. Moreover, as we try to make public and assisted housing more \navailable to the working poor, a worthy goal that I support, we reduce \nthe number of assisted housing units available to the very worst off in \nour country. In the end, this will mean more homelessness. In my view, \nCongress ought to recognize that truth and expand the homeless program.\n  One casualty of the fiscal constraints that the committee labored \nwithin is the Low Income Housing Preservation and Homeownership Act \n[LIHPRH], better known as the Preservation Program. This program has \npreserved over 80,000 units of affordable housing permanently. Another \n30,000 units await funding. I urge the committee to work in conference \nto find some funding for this critical program. I know of the \nchairman's interest in accomplishing this goal, along with appropriate \nreforms to the program.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for all their hard work. I \nsupport this bill and urge my colleagues to do so, as well. I will \ncontinue to work for additional funding for housing programs, and look \nforward to the day when we are able to adequately address the many \nexisting demands.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I wish to commend the managers of the Fiscal \nYear 1998 VA-HUD and Independent Agencies Appropriation Bill, Chairman \nBond and Senator Mikulski, for their hard work in fashioning this \nmeasure, and for bringing it to the Floor in a timely manner. The bill \nappropriates $90,901,535,000 for programs in Fiscal Year 1998, is \nwithin its 602(b) allocations, and is below the amount requested by the \nadministration by about $70,903,000.\n   Mr. President, I specifically commend the chairman and ranking \nmember for taking an extremely tight 602(b) allocation and spreading it \nacross the twenty-one agencies. There were also additional constraints \nposed by the budget agreement resolved to accomplish a unified Federal \nbudget in fiscal year 2002.\n  This bill funds a diversity of agencies and programs. It is a \nchallenge every year to develop a passable bill that addresses a \nvariety of concerns from all Members of the Senate, the Federal \nagencies, and the American people.\n   Mr. President, this bill matches the President's request for \nVeterans Affairs, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, and the National Science \nFoundation. The managers also protected several key programs in the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, namely CDBG, HOME, and the \nMcKinney Homeless programs. In addition, many cuts made in the proposed \nbudget were restored. The highest priority was to adequately fund \nVeteran's medical programs, despite the proposed cut in the budget \nagreement. This bill matches the President's request for Veterans \nMedical Care, and restores the $27 million cut in Veterans Medical \nResearch.\n   Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman and ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, as well as their dedicated, hardworking staff: Andy \nGivens and Liz Blevins for the minority and John Kamarck, Carrie \nApostolou, and Lashawnda Leftwich for the majority.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, in a few minutes we will vote on the VA-\nHUD appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. I want to take this \nopportunity to thank the chairman, Senator Bond, and his staff for \nworking with those of us on this side of the aisle in such a collegial \nway. I think the fact that we were able to finish this bill tonight \nsays a lot about the bipartisan cooperation that we have received, or \nhas occurred between both Senator Bond, myself, and the other Members \nof the U.S. Senate.\n  Today, I note that we had robust discussions on important policy \nmatters. But if one would note, the whole tone was one of civility, \nconsideration, and collegiality. I am very proud of the way this bill \nhas moved.\n  I am also very proud of the substance in this bill. We have met \ncompelling human need with veterans and the poor. We have stood sentry \nover the important issues related to the environment, protected \nconsumers, and ensured that Arlington Cemetery would be as fit for duty \nas the brave people were who lie therein. And we have, at the same \ntime, had a very serious issue addressed in the area of science and \ntechnology funding.\n  So veterans' health research that will be looking at issues related \nto both women's health and prostate cancer, to our important space \nprogram that shows it is the best in the world, to the National Science \nFoundation which is looking at how we can ensure that brilliant young \ninvestigators are going to be able to have the new ideas for the 21st \ncentury that are going to lead to new products says a lot about what \nthis bill does.\n  I enjoy very much serving as the ranking member and my job is made \neasier, more delightful, and gives me pride because of the cooperation \nof the majority, both its chairman and staff.\n  I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my own staff \nbecause it takes a lot of reviewing of a lot of line items when you \nhave seven Cabinet-level agencies and 25 other independent agencies. I \nwould like to thank Andy Givens, my chief clerk; David Bowers for his \nhard work, and our excellent detailee, Stacy Closson.\n  So as we move on to the rollcall vote, I again look forward to \nworking with my very able chair in the conference and bringing a great \nconference report back to the Senate where we can continue the pride we \nfeel as we vote on this bill tonight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, let me very briefly express my sincere \nappreciation to my ranking member for her great cooperation. The \nexpeditious way in which this measure was handled is something that is \nrather unusual for the VA-HUD bill. When she indicated she thought we \ncould wrap this up today, I said I am a skeptic; I am from Missouri; I \nhave to be shown. And thanks to the cooperation of all Senators we have \nbeen able to do it.\n  I really appreciate the cooperation of Senators on both sides. \nSenator Mikulski has been very effective. I would like to add my thanks \nto Andy Givens, to Stacy Closson and David Bowers, and particular \nthanks to my staff. This is the first time that Jon Kamarck has gone \nthrough this as the chief clerk. It is quite an experience. We \nappreciate the work he has done. We are delighted to have the steady \nhand of Carrie Apostolou guiding us on EPA, veterans, FEMA matters with \ngreat skill, and Sarah Horrigan has been a great addition on the NASA \nand science accounts, and I very much appreciate all of that \nassistance.\n  Mr. President, since I think many Members are anxious to get started \non the vote, and I do not expect anyone will be disadvantaged, I will \nnow ask unanimous consent that we begin the vote and I ask for the yeas \nand nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the House bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows.\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2158) making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban \n     Development and for sundry independent agencies, commissions, \n     corporations, and offices for the fiscal year ending \n     September 30, 1998, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause is stricken, the text of S. 1034 is inserted, and the \nbill is deemed read a third time.\n  The yeas and nays are requested. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The question is, Shall the bill \npass? The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n\n[[Page S7857]]\n\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 99, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 194 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--99\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kempthorne\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nickles\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sarbanes\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Torricelli\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Kyl\n       \n  The bill (H.R. 2158), as amended, was passed.\n  [The text of H.R. 2158 will be printed in a future edition of the \nRecord.]\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment and request a conference with the House, and \nthe Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, \nand S. 1034 be placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the Chair appointed Mr. Bond, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Stevens, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Craig, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Harkin, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. \nByrd conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have already expressed appreciation to my \nstaff, and particularly my ranking member. I want to make a special \nmention of my chief of staff, Julie Dammann, whose second child was due \ntoday and she stayed with us throughout the whole proceedings and \nwanted to see the VA-HUD bill delivered first. She has been an \ninvaluable help in all legislative activities and helped us shepherd \nthis through. So, a very special thank you, and best wishes to Julie, \nto Rolf and their other daughter, Monica. Again, I express my \nappreciation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would also echo the comments to Julie and her \nhusband. I hope that she can go home, rest easy, put her feet up and we \nare looking forward to being the proud Godparents of Bond-Mikulski. \nMaybe we will name something after her in conference.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I don't know whether \nMikulski-Dammann would be a good name for her, maybe, but it is one we \ncan always offer, to show a little diversity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7824-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I want to take a few moments to recognize \nthe work of Mr. Mark Lacovara, who has retired after more than 27 \nyears' employment in the Senate.\n  Mark came to the Senate in 1969 as a reference assistant in the \nSenate Library and has since served in various capacities with the \nOfficial Reporters of Debates, the Sergeant at Arms, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, and administrative services. The position from which he \nleaves us is that of assistant Journal clerk.\n  To those of us who are a part of the Senate, Mark's regard for this \ninstitution is well-known and highly valued. Such dedication is no \ndoubt rooted in his early years. Mark grew up in the Washington, DC, \narea and observed his father, the late John Lacovara, in service as the \nSenate's Republican Deputy Sergeant at Arms. Mark began employment with \nthe Senate as a young man of 18. As he worked, he also earned a college \ndegree and served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.\n  Mark has been committed to the best interests of the Senate and to \nthe United States throughout his career. This is evident in both the \nquality of his work and his enthusiasm for it.\n  I want to thank Mark for his outstanding service in the U.S. Senate; \nwe will miss him. I'm certain my colleagues join me in expressing \nappreciation and in wishing him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7857-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE RETIREMENT OF JOHN ``MARK'' LACOVARA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, an individual with over 27 years of \ndedicated service to the U.S. Senate has retired. This conscientious \nand hard working individual is John ``Mark'' Lacovara, the assistant \nJournal clerk of the Senate.\n  Mark, a native-born Washingtonian, has served in numerous capacities \nin the Senate over the past 27 years. During those years of service, \nMark completed his college education and earned a degree from the \nUniversity of Maryland.\n  In March, 1969, Mark began his Senate service as a reference \nassistant in the Senate Library. Shortly thereafter, he moved to a \ndoorkeeper position at the pass desk under the auspices of the Senate \nSergeant at Arms. From the doorkeeper's position, Mark had the \nopportunity to return to work for the Secretary of the Senate as a \nclerk in the Senate stationery room.\n  In 1974, Mark was appointed clerk of enrolled bills on the \nlegislative staff of the Secretary. In 1979, Mark was named second \nassistant Journal clerk, and by 1984 was working as editor of morning \nbusiness for the Congressional Record.\n  In his capacity as morning business editor, Mark had the \nresponsibility of producing, compiling, and formatting copy for the \nMorning Business section of the Congressional Record. This section \nincludes Presidential messages, House messages, Executive \ncommunications, petitions and memorials, committee reports, the \nintroduction of legislation, as well as additional statements. Anyone \nwho takes a look at the Record will get a notion of the responsibility \nof the morning business editor.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Mark once served as second assistant Journal \nclerk. In 1993, Mark returned to that office in the capacity of \nassistant Journal clerk, where he remained until his retirement.\n  Often referred to as the ``bible'' of the Senate, the Journal \nreflects the official legal record of Senate proceedings. An individual \nwith the responsibility of making the entries plays a critical role in \nthe history of the Senate. Mark served in exemplary fashion as \nassistant Journal clerk, and took great pride in his work.\n  Mark loved the Senate. He served here with distinction. He believed \nin the Senate as a great institution and throughout his long service \ndemonstrated his loyalty and dedication.\n  Mr. President, I say to Mark, thank you for your long and \ndistinguished service. You will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7857-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7857-S7858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, throughout the Nation, whenever a \ncommunity leader passes, his or her death is noticed and mourned by \nmany. In small towns, however, the impact of such a loss is always \nmagnified, for in such places, the deceased is more than a well known, \nbut distant figure, he or she is a neighbor, a member of the local \nchurch, and more often than not, a friend. Such was the case on June 29 \nwhen Edgefield, SC suffered a tremendous loss with the passing of my \nfriend, Joanne Tisdale Rainsford.\n  Mrs. Rainsford first came to Edgefield to work as a teacher, and it \nwas not long before she became a well known and liked figure around \ntown. Her civic mindedness led her to become involved in a multitude of \norganizations and causes, and though not originally from Edgefield, she \nworked hard on behalf of her new hometown. Among other groups, the \nEdgefield United Way, the Olde Edgefield Trade Association, and the \nEdgefield Community Development Association all benefited from the \nefforts of this tireless, devoted, and enthusiastic woman.\n  One of the cornerstones of a small town is the community newspaper, \nand Joanne Rainsford played an important role in helping produce the \nlocal paper, the Citizen News. In the mid-1980's, she spent about a \nyear and a half as the managing editor of that publication, and she \nlater became the president of Edgefield County Communications, the \nparent company of the Citizen News.\n  Though Mrs. Rainsford enjoyed many pursuits, she was particularly \ninterested in history, and she worked hard to save and showcase the \nunique and rich history of Edgefield County. In recognition of her \nservice as their president, and her leadership in any number of \npreservation projects, the Edgefield County Historical Society just \nthis past June voted to rename its museum the Joanne T. Rainsford \nHeritage Center. This was an honor of which I know she was especially \nproud and the action of the society is all the more meaningful as they \napproved this recognition shortly before Mrs. Rainsford's death.\n  Whether it was through her work as a teacher, in her role as a \nnewspaper executive, or as a civic booster, Joanne Rainsford worked \nhard to promote Edgefield, to build the local economy, and to make her \nhometown an even more prosperous and desirable place to live. She was \nan articulate proponent of the heritage corridor, a unique project that \nblends history and tourism together over a 14-county region in our \nState stretching from the coast to the mountains. I was so impressed by \nher desire to bolster tourism, the No. 1 industry in the Palmetto \nState, that I appointed her as a delegate from South Carolina to the \nWhite House Conference on Tourism.\n  Mr. President, many people in Edgefield and throughout South Carolina \nmourned the passing of Mrs. Joanne T. Rainsford, as she was a woman who \nwas liked and admired by all those who knew her. She was also a woman \nwho approached life with great enthusiasm and who sought to leave her \nmark on the world through projects that benefited others. I can say \nwithout reservation that the work of the late Mrs. Rainsford had a \npositive effect on Edgefield County and that her work strengthened that \ncommunity in many different ways. I ask unanimous consent that a copy \nof an article from the Citizen News be included in the Record following \nmy remarks, it very nicely captures Mrs. Rainsford's accomplishments \nand her spirit.

Mr. President, I am saddened to report the passing of a \nlongtime friend, a great supporter, and one of the stalwart members of \nthe South Carolina Republican Party, Mrs. Julia Ravenel Dougherty.\n  In the not so distant past, South Carolina was what was known as a \none party State, where a victory in a primary election was all one \nneeded to secure office, and where a significant segment of the \npopulation had no outlet for its views, opinions, and politics. All of \nthat began to change in the 1960's when a cadre of forward looking \npoliticians and interested citizens began to fight to create a true \nRepublican Party in South Carolina.\n  One of the pioneers in that effort was Mrs. Dougherty, who is roundly \nrecognized as having been a woman of great humor, strong organizational \nskills, and inexhaustible energy, as well as someone who was a \ntremendous motivator. From the Charleston County Republican Party to \nthe gubernatorial races, and from my own Senate campaigns to the bids \nof GOP candidates for the White House, Julia Dougherty was always eager \nto roll up her sleeves and to lend her considerable talents to an \nelection effort. Her loyalty to the party, and activism on its behalf, \nearned her not only the thanks and admiration of countless people, but \nalso an appointment as a delegate to the 1964 and 1968 Republican \nConventions. Her loyalty and efforts were further recognized when in \n1968, she was a member of the electoral college, and cast her vote for \nRichard M. Nixon.\n  In addition to her partisan political work, Mrs. Dougherty had a \nstrong commitment to public service, and over the years, she made many \ncontributions to building South Carolina into an even better, safer, \nand more prosperous State for all its citizens. She was the first \nfemale to ever serve on the South Carolina Highway Commission, and in \nthat role, she was a forceful advocate for the modernization of the \nhighway patrol, as well as the increased professionalization of that \nforce. She later served as the State chairwoman of President Carter's \nfriendship force, and during the Reagan administration, she served on \nan advisory committee to the Department of Transportation. Truly an \nimpressive record, and one of which I know Julia was justifiably proud.\n  Despite her great love for politics and her commitment to public \nservice, Mrs. Dougherty never sought elected office herself. This is \ntruly a shame for I believe she would have made even more contributions \nto the Palmetto State as an elected official, and she certainly would \nhave set a high standard for ability, integrity, and dedication for \nothers to follow.\n  The death of Julia Ravenel Dougherty leaves a tremendous void in \nSouth Carolina politics and life in the lowcountry. Her family, which \nincludes her cousin and my good friend, State Senator Arthur Ravenel; \nhusband Francis; son Park; daughters Renee and Frances; and four \ngrandchildren, all have my deepest sympathies. Their wife, mother, \ngrandmother, and cousin will be missed by all those who knew this most \nremarkable woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7858-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7858-S7860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOUISIANA SENATE ELECTION CONTEST\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, nearly 3 months ago, the Senate Committee on \nRules and Administration voted to begin a preliminary investigation to \ndetermine the factual basis, if any, for a contest of the 1996 Senate \nelection in Louisiana. I want to take a few minutes today to review \nwhere the committee stands in this matter, how we got there, and why I \nbelieve it is past the time to bring an end to this investigation and \nto dismiss the petition of Louis ``Woody'' Jenkins contesting the \nNovember 1996 Senate election in Louisiana.\n  The Rules Committee is currently faced with a decision: whether or \nnot to allow an election contest to proceed, under the Senate's \nauthority and duty under the Constitution, without any evidence of \nfraud or irregularities affecting the outcome.\n  This is not the first such decision the committee has faced in this \nmatter.\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\nSenators will recall that the initial bipartisan report of the \ncommittee's outside counsel found no evidence to support the claims in \nthe petition, and suggested only the most limited review to determine \nwhether or not Mr. Jenkins' more sensational claims of paid multiple \nvoting had any merit. My colleagues will also recall that the \ncommittee, on a party-line vote, rejected that recommendation and moved \nforward with a substantially broader investigation at dramatically \nincreased costs. Subject to a protocol negotiated by outside counsel \nfor the majority and the minority, committee Democrats agreed to \nparticipate in a joint investigation.\n  Two teams of attorneys, accompanied by active duty and retired FBI \nagents, were dispatched to New Orleans, while here in Washington a pair \nof highly skilled Government Accounting Office [GAO] detailees reviewed \ntens of thousands of documents subpoenaed from state and local election \nofficials in Louisiana. In addition, Committee staff spent countless \nhours conferring with counsel, establishing procedures for the \ninvestigation, assisting GAO with its review, and managing the day-to-\nday operations in New Orleans.\n  In the course of the joint investigation, over 130 subpoenas were \nissued; key witnesses were interviewed, in some instances more than \nonce; voters were contacted in an effort to validate their election day \nsign-in at the polls; numerous election officials were interviewed; and \nhundreds of documents were produced by both Mr. Jenkins' and Senator \nLandrieu's campaign organizations.\n  What has the committee learned as a result of all this effort, which \nhas cost the taxpayers well in excess of the $250,000 originally \nbudgeted, Mr. President?\n  We have learned that there is no evidence--I repeat, no evidence, Mr. \nPresident--of any fraud or irregularity on election day in Louisiana \nthat would have affected the outcome of this election.\n  We have learned that key witnesses to alleged vote buying and \nmultiple voting were paid and schooled in fabricating their stories--\nnone of which were confirmed by other records--and may have even been \nthreatened once they revealed the truth about the attempt to mislead \nthis committee. Those allegations of witness tampering which occurred \nafter the election have been referred to the proper law enforcement \nofficials for review.\n  We have learned that virtually none of the thousands of so-called \n``phantom votes'' identified by Mr. Jenkins exist, nor are they \ncorroborated by the mounds of election documents subpoenaed.\n  We have learned that numerous other so-called irregularities in the \nelection are not violations of the Louisiana Election Code, but are \nsimply technical violations or are so insignificant that Louisiana \nState law would not recognize them as a valid basis for overturning an \nelection.\n  Some have suggested that the committee suspend the investigation \nuntil such time as the law enforcement authorities conclude their \nseparate investigations into allegations of witness tampering. I \nbelieve such sentiment--which I would like to believe is the product of \ncaution and not partisanship--is misguided.\n  Investigations of criminal tampering with committee witnesses are not \ndesigned to turn up evidence that is relevant to, let alone sufficient \nfor, a finding by the Senate that but for fraud or irregularity, the \n1996 Louisiana Senate election would have been decided differently. \nSpecifically, evidence that witnesses were paid after the election to \nlie about illegal activities that did not occur, did not affect the \noutcome of the election itself, and would not be a basis for \noverturning the election.\n\n  I would like to respond to the allegation, made by Mr. Jenkins, at \nleast one of my Republican colleagues on the committee, and Mr. \nJenkins' attorney that the Democrats on the committee are hostile to \nthis investigation and have decided to kill it for partisan reasons. In \nresponse, let me remind my colleagues and everyone else present about \nthe time line in this case:\n  After his defeat on November 5, 1996, Mr. Jenkins claimed that his \nloss was due to massive voting by dead or incompetent voters. He also \nalleged that certain African-American precincts in New Orleans had \nturned out at greater than 90 percent--in one case at more than 100 \npercent--and in support of Senator Landrieu. Both allegations proved \nfalse after petitioner sought a court order for death and incompetency \nrecords--which yielded nothing--and after an Orleans Parish official \nrevealed that no precinct had turned out at more than 82 percent and \nthat 8 of the top 10 precincts had been majority-white and supported \nJenkins in the election.\n  On November 14, 1996, Jenkins then brought a State law election \nchallenge, making no mention of dead or incompetent voters or \nabnormally high turnouts. Instead, he alleged that so-called precinct \naudits prepared by volunteers from election records--which themselves \nwere produced under court order--yielded thousands of phantom votes and \nmismatched signatures on election documents, plus evidence of improper \nassistance by poll workers. Jenkins dismissed his own suit, citing an \ninability to gather sufficient evidence--despite the judge's offer to \nextend the statutory deadline for filing an amended complaint.\n  On December 5, 1996, Jenkins filed a contest petition with the \nSenate--which he then amended on December 17--in which he restated his \nallegations of phantom voting and mismatched signatures, adding a \nserious of sensational allegations of vote buying, multiple voting, \nfraudulent voter registration and other election fraud, as well as a \nlaundry list of other complaints including vote hauling, malfunctioning \nvoting machines, failure of poll workers to identify voters, and \ncampaign finance violations. After Senator Landrieu responded on \nJanuary 17, 1997, Mr. Jenkins filed a response on February 7, 1997, \nreiterating his earlier allegations and presenting more supporting \nmaterial to the committee. Eventually, Mr. Jenkins' submissions to this \ncommittee totaled over 9,000 pages. Key portions of this material were \nblacked out by Jenkins to obscure the names of individuals claiming to \nhave participated in or having witnessed fraud on election day.\n  In response to these extensive submissions, the Rules Committee \nretained two outside counsels to wade through the material and make a \nrecommendation to the committee regarding the sufficiency of the \npetition. On April 8, 1997, counsel presented the committee with a \nreport recommending dismissal of the bulk of Jenkins' allegations, with \ncounsel to conduct a limited investigation into the most sensational \nallegations of vote buying, multiple voting, and fraudulent voter \nregistration. On April 15, 1997, Mr. Jenkins testified against the \nbipartisan report, claiming that it would result in the committee \noverlooking or ignoring serious evidence of fraud and irregularity in \nthe November 1996 election.\n  On April 17, the Rules Committee--on a party-line vote--rejected the \ncounsels' report and instead initiated a wide-ranging investigation. \nAlthough the committee Democrats disagreed strenuously with the \ndecision to open up the scope of the investigation, we agreed to \ncontinue to participate in a bipartisan investigation.\n  Beginning the next week, our outside counsel met with the majority's \nchoice of outside counsel, and together they drafted a protocol not \nonly to guide our investigation but to serve as a basis for the detail \nof FBI agents and GAO personnel to the committee on a nonpartisan \nbasis. The agents were especially important, because Mr. Jenkins \nrefused to turn over his documents to the committee or our outside \ncounsel--including the crucial names of his fraud witnesses--until he \nwas assured that they would be delivered to FBI agents detailed to the \ncommittee.\n  On May 12, the majority and minority chief counsels traveled to New \nOrleans to select space in the Federal building to serve as temporary \ncommittee office space. Chairman Warner subsequently requested a 60-day \nlease of the space which expires on July 31.\n  On May 13, committee staff were joined in Louisiana by members of \nboth the majority and minority outside counsel teams. The group \nconducted interviews with the Governor, the leadership of the Louisiana \nLegislature, the secretary of state, the commissioner of elections, and \nthe State district attorney for East Baton Rouge. It was during these \ninterviews that the\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\nthen-lead attorney, Richard Cullen, advised that the 45-day \ninvestigative period began that day.\n  During the week of May 19, with the concurrence of committee \nDemocrats, Chairman Warner issued over 130 subpoenas to Louisiana \nelection officials. The vast majority of the subpoenas were answered in \na timely manner.\n  On May 30, 1997, again with concurrence of committee Democrats, \nChairman Warner issued subpoenas to political committees affiliated \nwith both Senator Landrieu and Mr. Jenkins. Senator Landrieu delivered \nher documents on June 3, the deadline for delivery in New Orleans, but \nMr. Jenkins--despite having months to prepare documents in support of a \ncase brought at his behest--sought and received an extension until \nMonday, June 9.\n  Meanwhile, GAO evaluators detailed to the committee had begun work on \nJune 2, 1997, reviewing petitioner's allegations of the existence of \nmore than 7,400 so-called phantom votes in the November 1996 Louisiana \nsenate election. Included in the materials Mr. Jenkins submitted on \nJune 9 was a substantial revision of the phantom vote totals downward \nto just over 5,700 votes--less than the margin of difference in the \nNovember election. Nevertheless, Mr. Jenkins continued to express the \nbelief that upon further scrutiny, the election records would yield \nenough phantom votes to more than make up the difference. As has been \nwidely reported, we now know from the GAO evaluators detailed to the \ncommittee that this is not true. In fact, GAO detailees have concluded \nthat further investigation of the allegations they have reviewed to \ndate would be unwarranted.\n  Back in New Orleans, investigators were interviewing individuals \nnamed in the unredacted materials finally provided to the committee by \nMr. Jenkins on June 9. Within a week, a disturbing pattern emerged. Not \nonly were the allegations of fraud untrue, the witnesses revealed that \nthey had been paid by agents of the petitioner to tell their stories.\n  Subsequently, on June 20, committee investigators discovered that at \nleast one of these witnesses had been threatened, by agents of Mr. \nJenkins, and told to reaffirm their original stories of fraud. For his \npart, Mr. Jenkins denies paying any witness and claims no knowledge of \nany payments by his agents for testimony.\n  Once I learned that the only evidence of election fraud in this \nmatter was clearly false and purchased by agents of Mr. Jenkins, I \ndecided that I could not, in good conscience, continue Democratic \nparticipation in the joint investigation. On June 23 I advised Chairman \nWarner of my concerns. On June 25, the committee Democrats announced \nour withdrawal from the investigation.\n  On that same day, June 25, I asked the U.S. Department of Justice to \ninvestigate whether the witnesses were threatened in violation of \nFederal law, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1505, which prohibits obstruction of a \nSenate investigation.\n  It is my understanding that Chairman Warner subsequently made a \nsimilar referral to the Republican district attorney for East Baton \nRouge Parish, Mr. Doug Moreau, who has scheduled interviews with both \nthe witnesses and the agents of Mr. Jenkins who allegedly paid them to \nlie. According to press reports, Mr. Moreau and his staff are also \ncurrently reviewing allegations that poll workers may not have followed \nthe Louisiana Election Code to the letter. Mr. Jenkins has said that he \nsupports these parallel investigations, but believes that the Rules \nCommittee should continue its probe as well.\n  I should add that when committee staff and the two teams of outside \ncounsel met with Mr. Moreau on May 13, he advised them that his office \nhad neither the resources nor the expertise to conduct a full-scale \ninvestigation of alleged election fraud that may have occurred in the \n1996 Senate election fraud that may have occurred in the 1996 Senate \nelection. Mr. Moreau was also reluctant to state unequivocally that his \noffice, located in Baton Rouge, had jurisdiction over alleged criminal \nactivity in New Orleans Parish. And yet, that is exactly what Chairman \nWarner has requested Mr. Moreau to investigate.\n\n  Based upon the review of evidence to date, it is unfair for \npetitioner or anyone else to claim that Democrats want to kill this \nprobe prematurely. This case has consumed over 7 months, hundreds of \nthousands of dollars--not to mention hundreds of thousands more in the \nparties' legal fees, a portion of which they are customarily reimbursed \nby the Senate--and countless hours of staff time. After all this \nexpenditure, the investigation has produced no evidence--none at all--\nthat would support continued investigation, let alone action by the \nSenate to overturn the election.\n  Finally, in the interest of fairness I believe we should remember our \ncolleague Senator Landrieu, who has faithfully continued serving the \npeople of Louisiana while patiently enduring countless allegations and \nmonths of uncertainty in order for the Rules Committee to pursue each \nand every one of Mr. Jenkins' charges--none of which have produced a \nshred of credible evidence.\n  As has been widely reported, I am currently involved in negotiations \nwith Chairman Warner and other members of his caucus regarding the \nappropriate way to close this investigation in an orderly fashion. \nWhatever resolution we reach on this issue should, in my opinion, \nfirst, acknowledge that the investigation to date has produced no \nevidence of any fraud, error, or irregularity in the 1996 Louisiana \nSenate election, and second, set a fixed, firm date on which the Rules \nCommittee will meet to vote on whether to terminate the investigation \nand dismiss the petition of Mr. Jenkins.\n  I join my entire Caucus in expressing our full and complete support \nfor our colleague, Senator Mary Landrieu, and call on Chairman Warner \nand members of the majority to end this investigation and remove the \nunjustified cloud of doubt overshadowing Senator Landrieu and the \nelected officials and good people of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7858-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7860-S7861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE OMNIBUS PATENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the report is finally \navailable for S. 507, The Omnibus Patent Act of 1997. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee voted 17 to 1 in favor of a Hatch-Leahy substitute \nto this bill on May 22. I urge all Members to take the time to learn \nabout this legislation, which is designed to assist American \ninnovation.\n  The Omnibus Patent Act would reform the U.S. patent system in \nimportant ways. The bill would:\n  Reduce legal fees that are paid by inventors and companies;\n  Slash redtape in the Patent and Trademark Office;\n  Increase the value of patents to inventors and companies; and\n  Facilitate U.S. inventors and companies' research, development, and \ncommercialization of inventions.\n  In Vermont, we have a wide variety of independent inventors and small \ncompanies. It is especially important to me that this bill help them as \nwell as larger, more specialized firms. I have spoken with independent \ninventors and representatives of smaller companies to learn what \nreforms they recommended. I have tried to ensure that their \nrecommendations were incorporated into the Hatch-Leahy substitute \namendment that was reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am especially gratified that the Hatch-Leahy substitute responds to \nthe concerns of independent inventors and small businesses concerning \nthe matter of 18-month publication. These concerns were articulated at \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee hearing by the president of the Vermont \nInventors Association, Bill Parker. Mr. Parker suggested giving \napplicants who only file in the United States a choice whether or not \nto publish early. He also recommended that we enhance the protections \ngranted to those who choose 18-month publication if we wish to \nencourage them to take that course.\n  The substitute does both of these things. In particular, it allows \nany applicant to avoid publication before the granting of the patent \nsimply by making such a request upon filing the application and by \ncertifying that the application has not--and will not--be published \nabroad. The substitute also provides for the issuance of patents on \nindividual claims in published applications as they are approved, \nrather than waiting for the disposition of all claims contained in such \nan application, as\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nnow occurs. This allows applicants to gain full patent protection--\nincluding reasonable royalties, damages, and attorneys fees when \nappropriate--for some of their component inventions earlier than they \nwould have under the original draft of the bill.\n  I was also concerned that, as introduced, the bill did not adequately \nprotect an applicant who is diligently prosecuting a patent but whose \napplication takes more than 3 years to process. The ability to have a \nfull 17 years of patent protection is important to small and large \npatent applicants alike. The Hatch-Leahy substitute makes clear than a \napplicant who diligently prosecutes a patent application before the PTO \nshould receive a full 17 years of patent protection.\n  Another matter of special importance to me is the section I suggested \nbe added in the Hatch-Leahy substitute to enhance access to patent \ninformation. I have long thought that electronic access should be more \nwidespread, and I want to work with the Patent and Trademark Office to \nensure the effective implementation of statewide electronic \naccessibility of patent information in rural Sates and eventually in \nall areas to make it easier for inventors to study prior art and make \nfurther advances. This should be of particular benefit to Vermont, \nwhich is only now getting a patent and trademark depository library.\n  Although the goal of the reexamination provisions--reducing legal \nbills for patent applicants--was laudable, I was concerned that the \nlegislation protect again harassment by third parties. The Hatch-Leahy \nsubstitute enhances protection against harassment by strengthening the \nestoppel provisions, to prevent a party from raising an issue that was \nraised or could have been raised in one forum from raising it in some \nother forum thereafter. In this way, the reexamination provision in the \nHatch-Leahy substitute will provide an alternative to the current \ncostly and time-consuming process of Federal litigation and, at the \nsame time, protect patent applicants against undue harassment.\n  I am also glad that the substitute amendment clarifies that it is not \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee's intent to undercut the Copyright \nOffice in any way. The Copyright Office has served this country well \nfor over a hundred years, and it should continue in that role.\n  Vermont has a great tradition of ``Yankee ingenuity.'' In fact, the \nvery first U.S. patent was granted to Samuel Hopkins, a native of \nPittsford, VT, who discovered a process for making potash. Today's \ninventors can be much like the inventors of Thomas Jefferson's day--\nindividuals in a shop, garage, or home lab. They can also be teams of \nscientists working in our largest corporations or at our colleges and \nuniversities. Our Nation's patent laws should be fair to American \ninnovators of all kinds--independent inventors, small businesses, \nventure capitalists, and larger corporations. To maintain America's \npreeminence in the realm of technology, which dates back to the birth \nof this republic, we need to modernize our patent system and patent \noffice. Our inventors know this and that is why they support this \nlegislation.\n  I am delighted that our Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, has \njoined as a cosponsor of this important legislation. I urge the \nRepublican leadership to proceed to Senate consideration of S. 507 \nwithout delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7860-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7861-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 748.

A bill to prohibit discrimination in employment on the basis \nof genetic information, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                        THE GENETIC JUSTICE ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the advent of testing for genes that may \nindicate a predisposition to disease has presented us with a new series \nof opportunities and challenges. While prior awareness of \nsusceptibility to disease offers millions the chance to take preventive \nmeasures that will help them live healthier and longer lives, there \nalso exists the possibility that genetic information will be misused. \nIt is for that reason that I am introducing S. 1045, The Genetic \nJustice Act. This legislation will ensure that employees will not \nsuffer adverse employment consequences as a result of improper use of \ngenetic information and that employee privacy is protected.\n  Scientific advances now make it possible to identify genes that may \nindicate a predisposition to disease. For example, tests for genes \nassociated with hereditary breast cancer will soon be commercially \navailable. Genetic information may prove highly beneficial in areas \nrelated to prevention, treatment, diet, or lifestyle. While this is \nprofoundly good news for patients, it also raises fears regarding how \ngenetic information will be used in the workplace. Advances in genetic \ntesting and screening, accelerated by the National Institutes of Health \nHuman Genome Initiative, increase physicians' ability to detect and \nmonitor chromosomal differences. These technologies and their resulting \ngenomic data will enhance medical science, but may also lead to \ndiscrimination.\n  Regrettably, many employers may not hire individuals whom they \nbelieve will require time off or medical treatment at some point in the \nfuture due to a genetically transmitted disease. This discrimination \ncould result despite the fact that genetic testing only indicates that \nan individual may be predisposed to a disease--not whether that disease \nwill develop.\n  Anecdotal evidence suggests that fear of discrimination already has \ninhibited people who may be susceptible to disease from getting genetic \ntesting. In some cases, this means that gene carriers will miss out on \nearly diagnosis, treatment or even prevention. If consumers avoid \ntaking advantage of available diagnostic tests out of fear of \ndiscrimination, they may suffer much more serious--and more expensive--\nhealth problems in the long run.\n  We will pay the price in more than increased health care costs if we \nallow genetic information to be used in a discriminatory manner. \nDiscrimination based on genetic factors can be as unjust as that based \non race, national origin, religion, sex, or disability. In each case, \npeople are treated inequitably, not because of their inherent \nabilities, but solely because of irrelevant characteristics. Genetic \ndiscrimination that excludes qualified individuals from employment robs \nthe marketplace of skills, energy, and imagination. Finally, genetic \ndiscrimination undercuts the Human Genome Initiative's fundamental \npurpose of promoting public health. Investing resources in the Genome \nInitiative is justified by the benefits of identifying, preventing, and \ndeveloping effective treatments for disease. But if fear of \ndiscrimination deters people from genetic diagnosis or from confiding \nin physicians and genetic counselors, and makes them more concerned \nwith job loss than with care and treatment, our understanding of the \nhumane genome will be for naught.\n  Because genetic information could be used unfairly, Congress must \nexpand the scope of employment discrimination law to include a ban on \ngenetic discrimination. Our bill forbids employers from discriminating \nin hiring or in the terms and conditions of employment, and limits \ntheir ability to acquire genetic information. In order to acquire such \ninformation, an employer must show that the information is job-related \nand that the employee has consented to the disclosure.\n  Now, before the use of genetic information becomes widespread, we \nmust make sure that dramatic scientific advances do not have negative \nconsequences for the public. We have an historic opportunity to preempt \nthis problem.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill text be printed \nin the Record and hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nimportant legislation.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1045\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Our legislation authorizes the National \nScience Foundation [NSF] for fiscal years 1998 and 1999 and is similar \nto the legislation that was approved by the House of Representatives by \nvoice vote on April 24, 1997.\n  The strong bipartisan support which NSF enjoys is a product of its \nhistoric contribution to American security and competitiveness. The \nprominent role of science in the American war effort during World War \nII left Americans with a new appreciation of the importance of research \nin establishing and preserving economic and military security. \nFederally funded research provided the American war effort with radar, \nsonar, the proximity fuse, blood plasma, sulfanilamide, penicillin, and \nthe atomic bomb. In 1944, President Roosevelt charged Vannevar Bush, \nhis chief science adviser, with evaluating the most effective way to \nharness this technological infrastructure in peace-time. The Bush \nreport--Science--The Endless Frontier--established a strategy and \nrationale for Federal support of basic research. The report argued that \n``a nation which depends upon others for its new basic scientific \nknowledge will be slow in its industrial progress and weak in its \ncompetitive position in world trade regardless of its mechanical \nskill.'' This report provided the blueprint for creation of the \nNational Science Foundation.\n  NSF was established in 1950 to ``develop and encourage the pursuit of \na national policy for the promotion of basic research and education in \nthe sciences.'' Eight years later, following the 1957 Soviet launch of \nthe Sputnik satellite, this mission was expanded to provide greater \nsupport for science education and literacy. Over the next three \ndecades, NSF became the primary Federal sponsor of basic scientific \nresearch in mathematics, physical sciences, computer science, \nengineering, and environmental science at colleges and universities. \nEqually important to the future of our Nation, NSF has become a primary \ncatalyst for math and science education reform.\n\n\n             NSF's Role in Federal Research and Development\n\n  The legislation which I am introducing with my colleagues authorizes \n$3.5 billion for the National Science Foundation in fiscal year 1998 \nand $3.6 billion in fiscal year 1999. Although the National Science \nFoundation's budget accounts for only 4 percent of Federal research and \ndevelopment funding, NSF provides 25 percent of Federal support to \nacademic institutions for research. NSF's contribution is even greater \nin some disciplines--NSF provides nearly 50 percent of all Federal \nsupport for basic research in certain fields of science, including \nmath, computer science, and environmental science. This funding \nsupports approximately 19,000 research and education projects at more \nthan 2,000 colleges, universities, primary, elementary, and secondary \nschools, businesses, and other research institutions. Competition for \nthese grants is fierce. NSF funds only about one-third of the 30,000 \nproposals it reviews annually.\n  The importance of this investment cannot be exaggerated. Over the \npast decade, private sector investment in research and development has \neclipsed Federal investment in public science. However, the Federal \ninvestment in basic science plays a preeminent role in industrial \ninnovation in the United States. A recent review of American industrial \npatent applications revealed that the Government or nonprofit \nfoundations supported 75 percent of the main papers cited as the \nfoundation for the new industrial innovation. The remaining 25 percent \nwere funded by industry.\n\n\n        NSF's Role in Science Education and Technology Literacy\n\n  This bill authorizes $645 million for the education and human \nresources directorate [EHRD] in fiscal year 1998. EHRD has primary \nresponsibility for NSF's education and training activities. In contrast \nwith the programs of the Department of Education, NSF science and math \neducation programs are experiments which link learning and discovery. \nProposals are selected by outside peer review panels on the basis of \ntheir potential to provide long-lasting and broad impact. NSF has made \nnotable contributions in the areas of curriculum and instructional \nmaterial development, professional development, and improved the \nparticipation in science research and science education of women, \nminorities, and individuals with disabilities. This legislation \nstrengthens and enhances these efforts.\n  And finally, I would be remiss if I did not speak about the \npartnership which has been forged between the State of Vermont and the \nNational Science Foundation. Last year, NSF grants were provided to the \nBarre Town Elementary School, Mountshire Museum of Science, Cabot \nSchool, Charlestown Elementary School, St. Michael's College, Johnson \nState College, and the University of Vermont. In 1992, the Vermont \nInstitute for Science, Math, and Technology received a 5-year award of \n$7.9 million to establish a collaborative statewide education reform \neffort linking business, higher education, government, and community \nsectors.\n  Our bill builds upon partnerships like that forged with the State of \nVermont and offers a credible bipartisan response to the research and \nscience education challenges facing our Nation. I urge the support of \nall my colleagues in the Senate for this worthwhile legislation.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator \nJeffords and Senator Frist as a sponsor of the National Science \nFoundation Authorization Act of 1997. This bipartisan legislation looks \nto the future by strengthening our national commitment to research and \ndevelopment. It also ensures the continued success of NSF's teacher \ntraining and professional development programs. In addition, it will \nimprove science and math education from kindergarten to graduate \nschool, and maintain America's competitive edge into the 21st century.\n\n[[Page S7865]]\n\n  Few Federal agencies deliver as much bang for the buck as the \nNational Science Foundation. The NSF funds 19,000 peer-reviewed science \nand education projects at more than 2,000 colleges, universities, \nschools, businesses, and research facilities in the United States.\n  NSF accounts for only 4 percent of total Federal research and \ndevelopment funding, yet it provides 25 percent of basic research \nsupport at academic institutions, and as much as half of all Federal \nfunding for research in fields such as mathematics, computer science, \nenvironmental science, and the social sciences.\n  The NSF also plays an important role in training teachers and \ndeveloping math and science curricula to prepare students for \ntomorrow's challenges. It has promoted innovative education programs in \npartnership with colleges, universities, elementary and secondary \nschools, science museums, and state and local governments. These \nprograms encourage the discovery of new knowledge and its application \nto real-world problems.\n  NSF support for basic research and science education has played an \nimportant role in encouraging economic growth over the last 50 years. \nAccording to a recent study, each dollar that the Federal Government \nhas spent on basic research has contributed 50 cents or more to the \nnational output. These economic benefits are spread throughout the \neconomy, enhancing the productivity of the Nation's work force and \nimproving the quality of life of all Americans.\n  At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for example, NSF funds \nhave encouraged scientists to explore the commercial applications of \ntheir research. Technology developed at MIT had a role in the launching \nof 13 companies in 1995. They manufacture products ranging from \ncomputer chips to communication networks. These enterprises have \nbolstered the State and local economies, and provided jobs and \nopportunities for many citizens.\n  In Massachusetts, the National Science Foundation is funding a wide \nrange of projects on the cutting edge of research. NSF grants have been \ninstrumental in building the State's biotechnology industry, mapping \nthe oceans at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, developing new \nsuperconductors at Harvard University's Material Research Science and \nEducation Center, and fostering cooperative partnerships with schools, \nparents, businesses, and community organizations to strengthen math and \nscience education programs.\n  Nationwide, NSF grants also cover a broad range of projects from \nhealth care to crime-fighting to protecting the environment. Specific \ngrants are improving the treatment of arrythmia, facilitating the \naccurate identification of crime suspects, developing new biotechnology \ntechniques to clean hazardous waste sites, and analyzing an Antarctic \nmeteorite to determine whether or not life existed on Mars.\n  NSF funds benefit the humanities as well. The Next Generation \nInternet project will give researchers access to information from the \nworld's libraries and museums at rates that are 100 to 1,000 times \nfaster than today's Internet.\n  Recent budget projections by the American Association for the \nAdvancement of Science paint a bleak picture for future funding of \nresearch and development. Discretionary spending, which funds all R \nprograms including NSF grant support, is expected to shrink from one-\nsixth to one-seventh of the Federal budget by the year 2000. As a \nresult, funds for NSF research and development will likely face \nreductions of 18 percent. At the same time, Germany, Japan, and France \nare projected to begin to overtake the United States in R \nexpenditures. These developments will jeopardize America's leadership \nin science and technology as the 21st century approaches.\n  The impact of these cuts will be felt heavily in Massachusetts, which \nranks third among States in NSF funding. Nearly 1,400 projects at over \n140 sites in Massachusetts are funded at more than $224 million \nannually, and an 18-percent decrease in grant support would adversely \naffect students, scientists, researchers, and citizens in all 50 \nStates.\n  The National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1997 that we are \nsponsoring will place research and development on a more secure footing \nover the next 2 years. It will increase NSF funding by 7.2 percent in \nfiscal year 1998 and 3.7 percent in fiscal year 1999. The legislation \nalso strengthens efforts to improve science, mathematics, engineering, \nand technology training for teachers and students, and will enable NSF \nto continue to play an important role in developing a faster and more \npowerful Internet. In addition, it authorizes the Office of Science and \nTechnology Policy to prepare a report analyzing indirect costs, which \nplay a vital but poorly understood part of Federal R spending.\n  The National Science Foundation is doing an outstanding job of \nfulfilling their missions, and I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1047. A bill to settle certain Miccosukee Indian land takings \nclaims within the State of Florida; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n                   Miccosukee Settlement Act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Florida, \nSenator Graham, to introduce legislation approving an agreement between \nthe Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and the State of Florida. \nThis agreement arose from disputes surrounding the construction of \nInterstate 75 through the Miccosukee Reservation in Florida.\n  By way of background, Mr. President, when the interstate was built \nfrom Naples across to Fort Lauderdale, the Florida Department of \nTransportation dredged fill dirt off the northern Miccosukee Indian \nReservation and used it to construct the roadbed. The Miccosukees \nsubsequently sued in Federal District Court on the basis of an unlawful \ntaking of property.\n  The State and the Miccosukees subsequently worked out a settlement \nwhereby Florida would keep the fill-dirt and the Indians would get \nseveral parcels of State land. One parcel is adjacent to the tribe's \npermit lands on Tamiami Trail and another is near the Krome Detention \nCenter in Miami. This agreement has been signed by the Miccosukees and \nthe Department of Interior and was endorsed unanimously by the Governor \nand Cabinet of Florida.\n  The bill we are introducing today will direct the Secretary of the \nInterior--as the Federal trustee of the Miccosukees--to:\n  First, aid and assist in the fulfillment of the settlement agreement \nin a reasonable manner; second, upon finding that the agreement is \nlegally sufficient, the Secretary should sign the agreement on behalf \nof the United States; third, facilitate the transfer of Miccosukee \nland--the fill-dirt--to the Florida Department of Transportation under \nthe terms of the agreement, and; fourth, receive in Federal trust--on \nbehalf of the Miccosukees--the land put up by the State for the swap--\nadjacent to Permit Area and Krome.\n  Mr. President, this legislation has also been introduced by \nRepresentative Diaz-Balart in the House of Representatives. The \nenactment of this legislation is very important to the Miccosukee Tribe \nand I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 1049. A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to make a \nminor adjustment in the exterior boundary of the Hells Canyon \nWilderness in the States of Oregon and Idaho to exclude an established \nForest Service road inadvertently included in the wilderness; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n           HELLS CANYON NATIONAL RECREATION AREA LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that \ncorrects a Forest Service mapping error on the border of the Hells \nCanyon National Recreation Area [HCNRA], in northeast Oregon, that has \nled to the closure of an important access road. The bill will restore \npublic access to Hells Canyon, while preserving additional wilderness \nacreage for the enjoyment of generations to come.\n  In 1975, Congress created the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area \nwhich includes the Wilderness Area and overlooks the Snake River and \nthe Oregon-Idaho border. Along the western\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\nrim of Hells Canyon lies Forest Service Road 3965. The 1975 act \ndirected the development of a comprehensive management plan for the \nHCNRA and specifically addressed the need to analyze road access on the \nwestern rim of the canyon. The 1982 Comprehensive Management Plan, \ndeveloped with extensive public participation, provided for continued \nmotor vehicle use of Road 3965 for recreation and fire prevention \npurposes. The road existed prior to the HCNRA designation, but upon the \ndiscovery that the road crossed into the designated wilderness area, \nthe road was closed.\n  The Forest Service inadvertently erred in its location of the \nwilderness boundary in question. This legislation will, therefore, \nadjust the wilderness boundary to bring it in line with what Congress \nintended when the wilderness was established. This correction will \nactually increase wilderness acreage.\n  For decades, Oregon residents have traveled this service road to \nexperience the natural beauty of Hells Canyon. The recreation area is \nan important part of our heritage, and public access to it is vital. I \nlook forward to the Forest Service managing the road with continued \nsensitivity to all cultural, environmental, and economic impacts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1049\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. BOUNDARY ADJUSTMENT, HELLS CANYON WILDERNESS, \n                   HELLS CANYON NATIONAL RECREATION AREA.\n\n       The Secretary of Agriculture shall revise the map and \n     detailed boundary description of the Hells Canyon Wilderness \n     designated by section 2 of Public Law 94-199 (16 U.S.C. \n     460gg-1) to exclude Forest Service Road 3965 from the \n     wilderness area so that the road may continue to be used by \n     motorized vehicles to its historical terminus at Squirrel \n     Prairie, as was the original intent of the Congress. The road \n     shall continue to be included in the Hells Canyon National \n     Recreation Area also established by such Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself, Mrs. Murray, and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1050. A bill to assist in implementing the plan of action adopted \nby the World Summit for Children; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n    the james p. grant world summit for children implementation act\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today, on behalf of myself, \nSenator Murray, and Senator Snowe, to introduce the James P. Grant \nWorld Summit for Children Implementation Act of 1997.\n  At the 1990 World Summit for Children, the United States and 158 \nother nations made a promise to the world's children. In signing the \nsummit declaration and plan of action, they pledged, by the year 2000, \nto reduce child mortality rates by at least one-third, to reduce \nmaternal deaths and child malnutrition by one-half, to provide all \nchildren access to basic education, and to provide all families access \nto clean water, safe sanitation and family planning information, and \nservices. In the declaration they stated, ``We are prepared to make \navailable the resources to meet these commitments.''\n  We have, in fact, made some progress over the last several years in \nmeeting these admittedly ambitious objectives. Child mortality rates \nhave fallen. Over 80 percent of the world's children are now immunized, \nsaving 3 million lives annually. Nonetheless, millions of children are \nstill dying every year for want of a vaccine costing just a few dollars \nor a Vitamin A capsule costing a few cents. It is estimated that 12 \nmillion children still die each year from preventable diseases and \nmalnutrition.\n  The objective of the legislation Senators Murray and Snowe and I are \nintroducing today is to keep the United States focused on the \ncommitments it made at the World Summit on Children. The bill would \nshift funds within the existing foreign assistance budget to meet the \nneeds of children--without increasing overall foreign assistance. \nSpecifically, it calls for increased allocations of funds for child \nsurvival, basic education, Vitamin A and other micronutrients, UNICEF, \nAIDS prevention and care, refugee assistance, family planning, and \ntuberculosis prevention and treatment.\n  This is not just a foreign assistance bill. We can and must do more \nin our own country to improve the health and welfare of children at \nrisk. Therefore, this legislation also calls for increased funding of \ndomestic programs which touch the lives of children, namely Head Start \nand the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants, and \nChildren, also known as WIC. Both of these programs have proven track \nrecords of improving the lives and prospects of children from low-\nincome families.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that Congress is in the midst of serious \nfiscal belt tightening in order to meet our balanced budget objectives. \nThis means that we must focus on our highest priorities. I would \nmaintain, though, that we have no higher priority than our children and \nproviding for their future. The programs cited in this bill, if \nproperly funded, will improve the quality of life of children, here and \nabroad, and help them grow into healthy, productive adults. Moreover, \nit will do so without increasing our overall foreign assistance and \nwith only a modest increase in the two domestic programs cited.\n  Mr. President, this bill is good for children, good for their \nfamilies, and good for our future. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am delighted to once again join my \ncolleague from Vermont, Senator James Jeffords, in introducing the \nJames P. Grant World Summit for Children Implementation Act. I \nparticularly want to pay tribute to Senator Jeffords for his continuing \nleadership in the effort to aid all children.\n  The World Summit for Children Implementation Act is our effort to \nensure that the United States implements the plan of action adopted at \nthe 1990 United Nations World Summit for Children. Our legislation \nproposes a series of life-saving, cost-effective programs to protect \nthe health and well-being of children worldwide. Importantly, while \nthis legislation proposes several increases in individual foreign \nassistance programs, it does not call for an increase in overall \nforeign aid levels.\n  Specifically, the Jeffords-Murray bill increases funding allocations \nfor child survival, basic education, vitamin A and other \nmicronutrients, UNICEF, AIDS prevention and care, refugee assistance, \nand family planning. Our bill also calls for an increase in funding for \ntwo important domestic programs: WIC and Head Start.\n  The world's children have a right to adequate nutrition, full \nimmunization, a decent education, and health care. The United States \nhas traditionally led the way in promoting the well-being of children. \nBecause the nations of the world are more interdependent than ever \nbefore, the well-being of children around the globe affects us here in \nthe United States. Children are not just the foundation of our society \nand our future; they are truly the foundation of the future of the \nworld.\n  According to UNICEF, more than 33,000 children die each and every \nday; most from easily preventable diseases. The under 5 mortality rate \nfor children in the least developed countries is 20 times greater than \nthat of the United States and other industrialized nations.\n  More than 2 million children under age 5 die each year from vaccine \npreventable diseases like diphtheria, measles, pertussis, polio, \ntuberculosis, and tetanus. Diarrhoeal diseases, often caused by a total \nlack of clean sanitation facilities and clean water, kill an additional \n3 million children per year. And for every child that dies, several \nmore live on with stunted growth, ill health, and diminished potential.\n  The world's political leadership can ill-afford to ignore these \nstatistics. These are just the mortality statistics for young children. \nEqually disturbing figures are available regarding access to education, \nthe treatment of young girls, nutrition, and child labor. Clearly, our \nwork on behalf of children is far from completed. While we have much to \ncelebrate, we have much more to do. And I am delighted to be joining \nSenator Jeffords to unequivocally state our belief that the United \nStates must continue to champion the future health, education, and \neconomic well-being of children everywhere.\n  Importantly, to reach children, we must reach out to the world's \nwomen including young mothers, family providers, and elders. Women are \noften overlooked in tradition development programs. Fortunately, the \nWorld\n\n[[Page S7867]]\n\nSummit for Children recognized to improve the lot of children, the \nstatus of women also had to improve.\n  For example, recognizing the important link between child survival \nand family planning, the World Summit for Children called for universal \naccess to family planning education and services by the end of this \ndecade.\n  Family planning saves the lives of both women and children. We know \nthat babies born in quick succession to a mother whose body has not yet \nrecovered from a previous birth are the least likely to survive. \nIncreasing funds in this area has been a top priority for me in my work \nin the Senate, and is addressed positively in the legislation we are \nintroducing today.\n  Basic education is another important component of this legislation. \nOf the 143 million children in the developing world not attending \nschool, 56 percent are girls. Of the world's 900 million illiterate \nadults, nearly two thirds are women. World Bank studies have estimated \nthat each additional year of education for a young girl results in a \n10-percent decrease in birth rates and child death rates, and a 10 to \n20 percent increase in wages earned.\n  Foreign aid is never a popular item. I applaud Secretary of State \nMadeleine Albright for her advocacy work in support of foreign aid and \nU.S. assistance abroad. And I am pleased that the both bodies of the \nCongress have voted to provide additional moneys for foreign assistance \nin fiscal year 1998. In my view, our foreign aid dollars are best spent \nwhen we are investing in programs that strengthen families around the \nglobe, and give a special hand to women and children.\n  That is exactly what Senator Jeffords and I propose to do with the \nJames P. Grant World's Summit for Children Implementation Act. I urge \nmy colleagues to review and support this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1051. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to enhance \nprotections against unauthorized changes of telephone service \nsubscribers from one telecommunications carrier to another, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n             the interstate slamming prevention act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill address a significant consumer issue--the unauthorized change of \ntelecommunications subscribers from one carrier to another, otherwise \nknown as slamming.\n  Consumers have the right to choose their primary long distance \ncompany and to change companies whenever they wish. Sometimes a \nconsumer's telecommunications company is changed without the consumer's \nknowledge or consent, a practice known as slamming. As competition \namong telecommunications carriers has increased, so has the number of \ncomplaints arising from unauthorized or unknowingly authorized changes \nof consumers' telecommunications carriers.\n  To give an idea of the scope of the problem, the Federal \nCommunications Commission [FCC] reports that it received over 1,700 \ncomplaints during fiscal year 1993. By 1995, that number had escalated \nto over 38,000 consumer telephone complaints and over 25,000 written \ncomplaints. In fact, the FCC says slamming complaints are their fastest \ngrowing category of consumer complaint, and my home State of Colorado \nranks among the top five States in 1996 slamming complaints per million \ncustomers.\n  The FCC reports that a slammed consumer may lose important service \nfeatures, get lower quality service, or be charged higher rates for his \nor her telephone calls. Slamming also distorts the telecommunications \ncompetitive market by rewarding companies that engage in deceptive and \nmisleading marketing prices. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 \nincludes provisions designed to reduce slamming, and it charges the FCC \nto adopt rules to implement these provisions.\n  The bill I am introducing today will give teeth to the Commission's \nefforts to curb slamming. I firmly believe that enforcement, \nstreamlined processing of slamming complaints, and consumer education \nwill help stem the tide of unauthorized carrier changes.\n  My bill, the Interstate Slamming Prevention Act of 1997, imposes a \ndeadline of April 30, 1998 for the completion of the FCC's rulemaking \non slamming.\n  Currently, the Telecommunications Act does not define a deadline for \naction, and one is needed to ensure that consumers are protected as \nsoon as possible from companies that engage in deceptive marketing \npractices. Nine months is sufficient time for the FCC to build a full \nrecord, solicit input from all interested parties, and put forth new \nantislamming rules.\n\n  My legislation directs the FCC, in its rulemaking, to develop rules \nand regulations regarding penalties and liabilities--including \nsubstantial fines or forfeitures under section 503 of the \nCommunications Act--for the unauthorized switching of a customer's \npreferred telecommunications carrier.\n  It also directs the FCC to consider whether telecommunications \ncarriers should be required to set up toll-free numbers dedicated to \nreporting unauthorized long distance carrier switches, with the \nobligation for a customer service representative to answer incoming \ncalls within 2 minutes.\n  I support such a toll-free number with call answering standards. \nRequiring consumers to pay for a call to report a slamming incident or \nhaving them endure a long wait before speaking to a customer service \nrepresentative, would pose real barriers to accurate reporting.\n  My legislation further directs the Commission to consider a process \nthat would secure facts and statistical data from telecommunications \ncarriers related to the number of consumer complaints they receive \nregarding slamming.\n  By October 31, 1998, the bill directs the FCC to report to Congress \nthe identities of those telecommunications carriers that represent the \n10 top slammers for 1997--based on the ratio of annual customer \ncomplaints regarding unauthorized carrier changes to the total number \nof customers served by such carriers.\n  It is my hope that such a list will serve as an effective deterrent \nto companies contemplating deceptive marketing campaigns. Negative \npublicity could be the best defense in the fight against slamming.\n  This report also should identify whether telecommunications carriers \nhave been assessed fines or forfeitures by the Commission--including \nthe amount of the fine or forfeiture, and whether the assessment was \nthe result of a full prosecution or pursuant to a consent decree.\n  After the first report in October 1998, the bill requires an annual \nreport be submitted by the FCC to Congress each April 30.\n  Before Congress takes more dramatic action in this regard, my bill \nwould look to the FCC for its recommendations on the following issues: \nWhether consumers should be provided a private cause of action, with \nminimum statutory penalties, relating to unauthorized slamming; whether \nthe FCC's current fine and forfeiture authority is sufficient to \nmeaningfully address and curb actions of telecommunications carriers \nthat engage in slamming; and what penalties should be applied to \ntelecommunications carriers which switch a customer's preferred \ntelecommunications carrier without a customer's authorization either \nwillfully and knowingly or by means of a forged document?\n\n  It is simply unfair for unsuspecting consumers, especially senior \ncitizens, who in good faith select a long distance carrier only to have \ntheir long distance phone service changed without their knowledge. \nSlamming is unfair and against the law.

A bill to amend the Andean Trade Preference Act to prohibit \nthe provision of duty-free treatment for live plants and fresh cut \nflowers described in chapter 6 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the \nUnited States; to the Committee on Finance\n\n\n The Andean Trade Preference Act Flower Exemption Amendment Act of 1997\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in 1991 Congress enacted the Andean Trade \nPreference Act which provided for duty-free treatment, or reduced \nduties, on many products, including fresh-cut flowers, imported from \nthe four South American Andean countries of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, \nand Peru. This legislation was proposed as a means of promoting \nalternatives to coca cultivation and production by offering broader \naccess to U.S. markets for legal products.\n  However, the impact of the ATPA on our domestic flower industry, \nparticularly in my home State of California, has been devastating. \nColombian fresh-cut flowers have been the greatest beneficiary of the \nATPA. In 1992, Colombia exported $87.7 million worth of fresh cut \nflowers to the United States. By 1995, Colombian exports increased to \nover $374.4 million. This represents a 427-percent increase over that \n3-year period.\n  Domestic growers of roses and carnations have been particularly hard-\nhit. In 1996, Colombia exported approximately 1.7 billion roses and \ncarnations to the United States. Colombia now controls more than 50 \npercent of the United States market for roses and 80 percent of the \ncarnation market. Overall, Colombian flowers account for about 65 \npercent of the United States fresh-cut flower market.\n  The preferential treatment accorded Colombian fresh-cut flowers under \nthe ATPA has had a direct and dire impact on the United States flower \nindustry--approximately 58 percent of which is located in California. \nThis preferential treatment, however, does not appear to be serving its \nintended purpose.\n  In 1996, an International Trade Commission report found that the \n``ATPA had little effect on drug crop eradication in the Andean region \n* * *.'' In fact, quite the opposite has happened. The number of \nhectares devoted to coca cultivation in Colombia increased from 37,500 \nin 1991 to more than 50,000 in 1995. The ITC report also found that \n``[the] ATPA had a small and indirect * * * effect on crop substitution \nduring 1995 * * *.'' Thus, the intended goal of reducing drug crop \ncultivation by providing market access for alternative crops has not \nbeen achieved.\n  Mr. President, I applaud and support the goals of the Andean Trade \nPreference Act. We must do all we can to encourage Colombia to seek \nalternatives to drug production. The impact of the ATPA on our domestic \nflower industry, however, has been far too great to justify the \ncontinued inclusion of fresh-cut flowers. It is imperative, therefore, \nthat we exempt fresh-cut flowers from the ATPA.\n  In enacting the ATPA, Congress specifically exempted certain \nproducts, that is textiles and apparel, watches and watch parts, and \npetroleum products, which were considered particularly sensitive to \nimport competition. Fresh-cut flowers should be considered a similarly \nsensitive domestic product, and thus also exempted from the ATPA. Thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1052\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     reauthorization of the office of national drug control policy\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since I released my first annual drug \nstrategy in\n\n[[Page S7869]]\n\n1990, I have argued that it was imperative that we needed to act, \ninstead of just talk, in order to confront the problem of drug abuse \nand drug related crime. This means focusing quickly on the risks \nconfronting our youth, identifying practical steps our communities can \ntake to reduce these risks, and committing ourselves to the hard work \nand resources needed to steer young people to productive lives instead \nof wasted lives.\n  The administration's 1998 national drug strategy provides significant \nsteps toward these goals. Under the leadership of General McCaffrey, \nthe administration's 1998 drug strategy calls for a 10-year antidrug \nplan and a 1998 budget request that includes full funding for drug \ncontrol efforts that have proven to work.\n  The administration's budget request includes: $8.4 billion for \ndomestic drug enforcement; $3.3 billion for drug treatment; $2.2 \nbillion for drug education and prevention--including $680 million for \nSafe and Drug-Free Schools; and $2.1 billion for interdiction and \ninternational antidrug efforts--including broad, across-the-board \nincreases for law enforcement agencies like the FBI, DEA, INS, and U.S. \nAttorneys.\n  In addition to funding these existing programs, the budget request \nestablishes a national media campaign of prime-time antidrug television \nadvertisements to stop kids from trying drugs in the first place--\nfunded by $175 million from Federal Government and $175 million from \nprivate industry.\n  These are all positive steps which I urge my colleagues to pass into \nlaw.\n  What is more, these positive steps illustrate just how vital the \noffice of the Drug Director truly is. Because, if we did not have an \noffice--a single, responsible office charged with overseeing the \nFederal antidrug policy we could not even debate whether \nGeneral McCaffrey's drug strategy makes sense. I believe it does. But, \nthere may be others who do not. My key point is that without a Drug \nDirector, we would have lost even the chance to have an informed debate \nover a specific proposal.\n\n  I remind my colleagues what we faced on the drug policy front when I \nfirst began calling for a drug office in 1980: it was pretty simple, \nthere was no drug office, there were more than 50 Federal departments, \nagencies, and offices putting together a hodge-podge of antidrug \nefforts with no coherant plan.\n  Contrast this to what we have today, General McCaffrey has submitted \na strategy and a budget--and we can now all debate what a majority of \nus favor and what a majority of us oppose.\n  This is the fundamental reason why I am today introducing legislation \nto reauthorize the Office of National Drug Control Policy. I know that \nthe administration, led by General McCaffrey, has worked hard to craft \nthis legislation, and I believe that it deserves speedy consideration--\nand the votes--of my colleagues.\n  One of the important refinements offered in this legislation is to \nbuild in some long-term planning while at the same time adding some \ngreater accountability for the drug strategy and all its component \nparts.\n  This legislation does so by calling on the Drug Director to develop a \n10-year plan, a 5-year budget coupled with a detailed annual status \nreport assessing the progress on the strategy, as well as a detailed, \nprogram-by-program, annual budget.\n  In other words, this legislation would keep the Drug Director's key \npower to develop, define, and submit to Congress a detailed annual drug \nbudget. A process which holds unique powers to focus congressional \ndebate on the topic of drug policy, and which is the strongest \ninstitutional power of the Office of National Drug Control Policy \nwithin the executive branch.\n  In addition, this legislation will enhance a function which too often \nis ignored--that function: accountability. Here, the Drug Director has \ncalled for long- and short-term measureable objectives. In fact, as \npart of General McCaffrey's on-going efforts at the Drug Office, the \nGeneral has already identified more than 54 performance targets and \nanother nearly 80 measures of program effectiveness.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will help formalize this \nprocess. Let me also add, that calling on the Drug Director to provide \na 10-year plan will not prevent any future administration--nor even \nthis administration--from changing or refining that plan. It is simply \nto recognize that we are at a stage in our effort against drugs where \nwe must focus on implementation and results. And, this is exactly what \nthe legislation I offer today is all about.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the legislation I offer today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING CATASTROPHIC NATURAL \n                   DISASTERS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) catastrophic natural disasters are occurring with great \n     frequency, a trend that is likely to continue for several \n     decades according to prominent scientists:\n       (2) estimated damage to homes, buildings, and other \n     structures from catastrophic natural disasters has totaled \n     well over $100,000,000,000 during the last decade, not \n     including the indirect costs of the disasters such as lost \n     productivity and economic decline;\n       (3) the lack of adequate planning for catastrophic natural \n     disasters, coupled with inadequate private insurance, has led \n     to increasing reliance on the Federal Government to provide \n     disaster relief, including the appropriation of \n     $40,000,000,000 in supplemental funding since 1989;\n       (4) in the foreseeable future, a strong likelihood exists \n     that the United States will experience a megacatastrophe, the \n     impact of which would cause widespread economic disruption \n     for homeowners and businesses and enormous cost to the \n     Federal Government; and\n       (5) the Federal Government has failed to anticipate \n     catastrophic natural disasters and take comprehensive action \n     to reduce their impact.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should consider legislation that embodies the \n     following principles;\n       (1) Persons who live in areas at risk of natural disaster \n     should assume a practical level of personal responsibility \n     for the risks through private insurance.\n       (2) The insurance industry, in partnership with the Federal \n     Government and other private sector entities, should \n     establish new mechanisms for the spreading of the risk of \n     catastrophes that minimize the involvement and liability of \n     the Federal Government.\n       (3) A partnership should be formed between the private \n     sector and government at all levels to encourage better \n     disaster preparation and respond quickly to the physical and \n     financial impacts of catastrophic natural disasters.\n\n[[Page S7871]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               WELLSTONE (AND MIKULSKI) AMENDMENT NO. 949\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Ms. Mikulski) proposed an amendment to \nthe bill, S. 1034, supra; as follows:\n\n       On page 85, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n       Sec. 423.

Mr. President, the European Community is engaged \nin the blatant misuse of its authority to review United States mergers \nshamelessly to protect Airbus Industrie. It has decided that it will \nuse its authority to block the merger of Boeing and McDonnell Douglas. \nIts rationale is that the combined commercial aircraft company poses \ntoo great a risk to Airbus Industrie.\n  For the past 25 years, America has watched the Europeans pour \nbillions of dollars of subsidies into Airbus Industrie to create what \nis now without question a highly competitive aircraft company. Airbus \nIndustrie today boasts more than 30 percent of the global market for \nlarge jet transports. Its goal is to have 50 percent of the market and \nit is aggressively pursuing that goal. Many of us were shocked with \nFrench President Chirac's shameless pursuit of aircraft orders in China \nin exchange for the French's Government's commitment to defeat a U.N. \nhuman rights resolution.\n  Airbus Industrie has already destroyed the viability of the Douglas \nAircraft Co. Airbus' market share has come largely at the expense of \nMcDonnell Douglas, which last year had only 4 percent of the market. \nNow the Europeans, in a final blow to Douglas, want the Boeing Co. to \ndivest itself of Douglas Aircraft Co. and put the 14,000 remaining \nDouglas employees out on the street.\n  While most Americans will find it inconceivable, the Europeans do in \nfact have the legal authority to block this American merger. This is \ntrue even though neither Boeing nor McDonnell Douglas have significant \noperations in Europe and despite the fact that our own Government has \nthoroughly reviewed the merger and approved it without conditions.\n  The Europeans have disregarded our own exhaustive review process in \nthe United States.\n  The Boeing Co. has engaged in a good-faith effort to try to address \nthe concerns raised by the European Commission about the merger--but to \nno avail. Nevertheless, the EC plans to block the merger. This means \nthat Boeing aircraft may well be prevented from being sold in Europe.\n  From the very beginning, the European merger review proceedings have \nbeen dominated by the political considerations of the Airbus member \nsales. I warned the President about this in a May letter on this \nsubject. My colleagues in the Senate supported my sense-of-the-Senate \nresolution on the subject last week.\n  The United States can no longer stand aside and allow Europe \nblatantly to protect Airbus at the expense of our own civil aircraft \nindustry and our own American employees. The administration should send \na clear signal that it will not allow this type of protectionism to \ncontinue and that we will retaliate decisively if the Europeans block \nthe merger.\n  The European Commission's indifference to appropriate antitrust \nconsiderations and its undisguised protectionism was expressed candidly \nby the EC's Karl Van Miert on Tuesday, July 15 on Belgian radio: ``The \nEC does not want a competitive market, it wants a guaranteed \nmarket.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7873-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n THE 25th ANNIVERSARY OF THE RESTORATION OF THE PERMANENT DIACONATE IN \n                                PATERSON\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to mark a special \nanniversary. This year is the 25th anniversary of the restoration of \nthe Permanent Diaconate in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Paterson, NJ. \nIn the Catholic faith, a deacon is a layman who willingly gives his \ntime, talent and treasure to help not only his own church community \nbut, through his work, the entire community. His is a life of service.\n  Mr. President, I deeply admire the commitment of these lay people to \nserve others. They bring to mind the words of the great humanitarian, \nAlbert Schweitzer, ``The greatest gift we can give to another, is the \ngift of ourselves.''\n  The work done by the 146 deacons of Paterson's Diocese also reminds \nme of the long tradition of service which communities of faith have in \nAmerica. Whether Christian, Jewish, Muslim, or other religion, these \ncommunities not only minister to individuals' spiritual needs, but to \nall of their needs. They may provide tangible support like food and \nshelter, or simply compassion, counseling, and concern.\n  Mr. President, I offer my congratulations to the Diaconate of the \nDiocese of Paterson, and to Msgr. Ken Lasch who, 25 years ago, laid the \ncornerstone upon which the Diaconate's success has been built. As a \nnative of Paterson, I am pleased that we have these dedicated men in \nour midst who are serving both their church and our community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7873-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7873-S7874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CELEBRATING THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, many of us returned home to our \nStates to celebrate the Fourth of July and the birth of this great \nNation. All across this country, in both urban and rural communities, \nwe joined as one to honor our Founding Fathers and their commitment to \nfreedom as reflected in the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution. Together these two documents form the foundation of our \nNation.\n  It seems most fitting and appropriate to take a moment after we have \nreturned from our Fourth of July activities to take note of two groups \nof Wyoming students that came to our Nation's Capital recently as part \nof programs celebrating the history of our Nation and its place in the \nworld.\n  To celebrate the Constitution, and its effect on our lives as \ncitizens, a team from Central High School in Cheyenne traveled to \nWashington to participate in a competition entitled ``We the People * * \n* The Citizen and the Constitution.'' In that event, students from \nacross the United States competed against each other as they \ndemonstrated their remarkable understanding of and sensitivity to the \nfundamental principles upon which this Nation was founded. They proved \nthat the values that are embodied in our Nation's Constitution still \nresonate with meaning and importance in our lives today as they serve \nto fire our children's imaginations and interest in our past.\n  In the process of preparing for this event, those students learned a \nlot about the Constitution. I would imagine many of them were surprised \nto learn that it is truly a living document. Through the years it has \nbeen changed and amended to address the problems of a growing \ndemocracy. It has weathered every storm, including a Civil War and \ncountless crisis faced by our Nation's leaders. Through it all, it has \ncontinued to provide the guideposts we have followed to ensure that our \nNation remains strong and free.\n  It was very gratifying personally to see such attention focused on \nour Nation's Constitution. That document holds a great deal of meaning \nto me personally.\n  I have always drawn inspiration from the words our Founding Fathers \nused as they drafted the U.S. Constitution. In fact, when I served as \nthe mayor of Gillette, WY, I always had a copy in my coat pocket. I \ngave copies to the members of the council each year on Constitution Day \nand every other year we read it as part of our proceedings.\n  Now that I have been elected to the Senate, I have to say it has new \nmeaning for me. It refers to me. It is my job description. It is not \njust the basic rules for someone way off in Washington. It speaks \ndirectly to me and the purpose I serve as a Member of the Senate, a \nrepresentative of the dreams, hopes, and ambitions of the people of my \nhome State of Wyoming.\n  Just a few weeks ago another group came to Washington as part of a \nprogram to promote and encourage our children's interest in and \nenthusiasm for history. We are all familiar with the famous quote of \nGeorge Santayana,\n\n[[Page S7874]]\n\n``Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.''\n  That is why it is so important that we continue to encourage our \nchildren to study the past and learn about the mistakes that were made, \nand the triumphs, too, that have made this Nation what it is today.\n  Looking over the list of subjects that those who participated in \nWyoming History Day had worked on, I was quite impressed by the many \ndifferent areas of history that had drawn their attention. I am certain \nthey were all amazed by how much they had learned by examining the \nevents they had chosen in detail as they prepared for the competition.\n  Like those young students, I also enjoyed studying our Nation's \nhistory when I was in school. I was fascinated by the stories of our \npast, and I took a special interest in the history of Wyoming and the \ndays of the Old West. I read everything I could get my hands on that \nhad to do with the early days of the West and our State's first \nsettlers. They were brave pioneers and together they faced a great many \nhardships and trials as they worked to make it out West. They were \nremarkable people blessed with special skills and strengths. The \nheritage they passed down to their children is still reflected in the \nfaces of those who have a long history with and strong ties to the land \nthey love and rely on for their lifeblood. Our grandfathers and great \ngrandfathers passed down their great love of independence and freedom \nto us, and their lifestyles helped shape our character and made Wyoming \nwhat it is today: fiercely proud, independent, and strongly self-\nreliant.\n  These programs are the kind of projects we should continue to \nencourage our children to pursue as a regular part of their education. \nBy studying and reading about the history of our Nation and the world, \nwe will not only learn how to avoid the mistakes of the past, but we \nwill also learn how to properly plan and prepare for our future. \nStudying about the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence and \nthe work our Founding Fathers put into this great Nation at its \nconception is a good place to begin. What better time to take up this \nsubject than now, so close to our Fourth of July celebration. That is \nwhat Independence Day is really all about. We take great pride in our \nhistory. We celebrate the lives and work of that relatively small group \nof individuals, banded together by their commitment to freedom, and the \ndream of democracy; and who saw the reality and reassurance of a new \nrepublic. On that day in July in 1776 they began a series of events \nthat have served to change the face of the world forever.\n  I am very proud of these and all our students who are studying the \nworld's history, and our place in it. As the father of a schoolteacher, \nI know the commitment that is necessary to provide our children with a \ngood education. For that process to be successful, we must all do our \npart--teachers, students, and parents. We should all continue to \nencourage our children to participate fully and actively in the \nprograms and projects offered by their schools. The resulting \nchallenges they will face and the rewards they will receive will have a \ndramatic effect on their lives. Congratulations to all those who won \nawards in these programs, and to those who gave their best efforts as \nparticipants. We are very proud of each one of you--and counting on you \nfor the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7873-3", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JOHN J. SULLIVAN\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, earlier this month, the American flag \nwas flown proudly throughout Connecticut and across this great land, as \nwe celebrated our Independence Day. But the previous Friday, Old Glory \nwas flying at half-staff in the town of Fairfield, CT, as the town \nmourned the passing of its longest serving first selectman--John J. \nSullivan.\n  John Sullivan came to Fairfield from Salem, MA, in the 1930's, and \nfor more than 20 years, he was known throughout town as the owner and \noperator of Sullivan's Flower Shop on the Post Road. But in 1959, John \nSullivan ran for public office for the first time in his life, and he \nwas elected as the town's first selectman. His election was \nparticularly significant, because it broke a 51-year Republican hold on \nFairfield's top job. Although John Sullivan was a Democrat in a town \ndominated by Republicans, he was reelected 11 times, and his 24-year \ntenure stands as the longest in the town's history.\n  I think that a large reason John Sullivan was so successful in \nreaching across party lines to be an effective leader is because his \nfirst concern was people, not politics. When describing his management \nstyle as the head of the board of selectmen, John Sullivan said, ``I \ndon't tell them how to vote * * * I tell them it's good for the \ncommunity.''\n  One of the most notable battles of his political career came in 1965, \nwhen John won reelection over a popular young challenger named Stewart \nB. McKinney. After this defeat, Mr. McKinney went on to serve seven \nterms in the U.S. House of Representatives, and John Sullivan often \njoked that if it weren't for him, McKinney would have never been a \nCongressman. The two of them went on to form a close political \nfriendship. In fact, the only building in Fairfield which bears John \nSullivan's name is the Sullivan-McKinney senior housing complex.\n  During his tenure as first selectman, the population of Fairfield \nincreased by 25 percent and the town's annual budget increased \nfourfold. But while John Sullivan oversaw the growth and development of \nFairfield, the greatest sign of his legacy is the 1,200 acres of land \nthat he had set aside as open space. Under John Sullivan's leadership, \nthe town of Fairfield was able to secure Federal funds to purchase open \nspace land and beach-front property. John Sullivan fought to maintain \nthe small-town character of Fairfield, and there are now parks and \nwoodland areas in Fairfield that serve as a peaceful refuge in this \narea of rapid urbanization.\n  John Sullivan remained active in the community long after his \npolitical career ended. He worked on behalf of many charitable \norganizations, in particular St. Vincent's Medical Center Foundation in \nBridgeport where he served as associate executive director. A devout \nRoman Catholic, John was a longtime member and trustee of St. Thomas \nAquinas Church. He went to Mass every day, and in 1984, John was \nappointed a Knight of St. Gregory by Pope John Paul II.\n  I think that the one quote that best illustrates what kind of person \nJohn Sullivan was came in 1983 when he retired from public office. John \nsaid, ``I am the richest man in the world. I ask for nothing. I want to \ngive as much as I can.''\n  I attended John Sullivan's funeral, and having known him personally, \nI was not surprised to see how many people came out to pay tribute to \nthis wonderful man. John Sullivan was a true patriot, and he will be \ndearly missed by all who knew him.\n  John was the husband of the late Mary B. Cahill Sullivan. He is \nsurvived by his brother Edwin Sullivan, his daughter Mary Donahue, and \nhis seven grandsons, John, James, Brian, Robert, Paul, William, and \nPatrick. I offer my most heartfelt condolences to all of them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7874-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7874-S7875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ROBERT C. WEAVER\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Dr. Robert C. Weaver, adviser to \nthree Presidents, director of the NAACP, and the first African-American \nCabinet Secretary, passed away last week at his home in New York City. \nDr. Weaver spent his entire life broadening opportunities for \nminorities in America. I rise today to pay tribute to this great man.\n  Dr. Weaver began his career in government service as part of \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt's ``Black Cabinet,'' an informal \nadvisory group promoting job and educational opportunities for blacks. \nThe Washington Post called this work his greatest legacy, the \ndismantling of a deeply entrenched system of racial segregation in \nAmerica.\n  In 1960 he became the president of the NAACP, and would become a key \nadviser to President Kennedy on civil rights. Dr. Weaver was appointed \nin 1961 to the Housing and Home Finance Agency, an organization that \nlater became the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1966, \nwhen President Johnson elevated the agency to Cabinet rank, Dr. Weaver \nwas, in Johnson's phrase, ``the man for the\n\n[[Page S7875]]\n\njob.'' He thus became its first Secretary, and the first African-\nAmerican to head a Cabinet agency.\n  Following his government service, Weaver was, among various other \nacademic pursuits, a professor at Hunter College, a member of the \nSchool of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon, and the \npresident of Baruch College in Manhattan. Dr. Weaver earned \nundergraduate, master's and doctoral degrees in economics from Harvard, \nwrote four books on urban affairs, and was one of the original \ndirectors of the Municipal Assistance Corp. designed to rescue \nfinancially strapped New York City in the 1970's.\n  America, and Washington in particular, has lost one of its \ninnovators, one of its creators and one of its true leaders--for Robert \nWeaver, like so few of leaders today, led not only with his words but \nmore importantly with his deeds.\n  I ask that an editorial in Monday's Washington Post and an obituary \nfrom Saturday's New York Times be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 21, 1997]\n\n                            Robert C. Weaver\n\n       Native Washingtonian Robert C. Weaver, who died on Thursday \n     in New York City at age 89, had a life of many firsts. Dr. \n     Weaver served as a college president, Cabinet secretary, \n     presidential adviser, chairman of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People and as a director of \n     the Municipal Assistance Corp., which helped save New York \n     City from financial catastrophe. But his greatest legacy may \n     be the work he did, largely out of public view, to dismantle \n     a deeply entrenched system of racial segregation in America.\n       Before the landmark decade of civil rights advances in the \n     1960s, Dr. Weaver was one of a small group of African \n     American officials in the New Deal era who, as part of the \n     ``Black Cabinet'' pressured President Franklin D. Roosevelt \n     to strike down racial barriers in government employment, \n     housing and education. It was a long way to come for the \n     Dunbar High School graduate who ran into racial \n     discrimination in the 1920s when he tried to join a union \n     fresh out of high school. Embittered by that experience, Bob \n     Weaver went on to Harvard (in the footsteps of his \n     grandfather, the first African American Harvard graduate in \n     dentistry) to earn his bachelor's, master's and doctorate in \n     economics. At another time in America, his university degrees \n     might have led to another career path. For Bob Weaver in \n     1932, however, those credentials--and his earlier job as a \n     college professor--made him an ``associate advisor on Negro \n     affairs'' in the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n       Subsequent work as an educator, economist and national \n     housing expert--and behind-the-scenes recruitment of scores \n     of African Americans for public service--led to his \n     appointment as New York State rent administrator, making him \n     the first African American with state cabinet rank. President \n     John F. Kennedy appointed him to the highest federal post \n     ever occupied by an African American--the Housing and Home \n     Finance Agency. Despite the president's support, however, the \n     HHFA never made it to Cabinet status, because Dr. Weaver was \n     its administrator and southern legislators rebelled at the \n     thought of a black secretary. Years later President Lyndon \n     Johnson pushed through the Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development and named Robert Weaver to the presidential \n     Cabinet.\n       For the nation, and Robert Weaver, the appointment was \n     another important first. For many other African Americans who \n     found lower barriers and increased opportunity in the last \n     third of the 20th century, Robert Weaver's legacy is lasting.\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 19, 1997]\n\n         Robert C. Weaver, 90, First Black Cabinet Member, Dies\n\n                           (By James Barron)\n\n       Dr. Robert C. Weaver, the first Secretary of Housing and \n     Urban Development and the first black person appointed to the \n     Cabinet, died on Thursday at his home in Manhattan. He was \n     90.\n       Dr. Weaver was also one of the original directors of the \n     Municipal Assistance Corporation, which was formed to rescue \n     New York City from financial crisis in the 1970's.\n       ``He was a catalyst with the Kennedys and then with \n     Johnson, forging new initiatives in housing and education,'' \n     said Walter E. Washington, the first elected Mayor of the \n     nation's capital.\n       A portly, pedagogical man who wrote four books on urban \n     affairs, Dr. Weaver had made a name for himself in the 1930's \n     and 1940's as an expert behind-the-scenes strategist in the \n     civil rights movement. ``Fight hard and legally,'' he said, \n     ``and don't blow your top.''\n       As a part of the ``Black Cabinet'' in the administration of \n     President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Dr. Weaver was one of a \n     group of blacks who specialized in housing, education and \n     employment. After being hired as race relations advisers in \n     various Federal agencies, they pressured and persuaded the \n     White House to provide more jobs, better educational \n     opportunities and equal rights.\n       Dr. Weaver began in 1933 as an aide to Interior Secretary \n     Harold L. Ickes. He later served as a special assistant in \n     the housing division of the Works Progress Administration, \n     the National Defense Advisory Commission, the War Production \n     Board and the War Manpower Commission.\n\n\n   a behind-the-scenes civil rights strategist during the 1930's and \n                                 1940's\n\n       Shortly before the 1940 election, he devised a strategy \n     that defused anger among blacks about Stephen T. Early, \n     President Roosevelt's press secretary. Arriving at \n     Pennsylvania Station in New York, Early lost his temper when \n     a line of police officers blocked his way. Early knocked one \n     of the officers, who happened to be black, to the ground. As \n     word of the incident spread, a White House adviser put \n     through a telephone call to Dr. Weaver in Washington.\n       The aide, worried that the incident would cost Roosevelt \n     the black vote, told Dr. Weaver to find the other black \n     advisers and prepare a speech that would appeal to blacks for \n     the President to deliver the following week.\n       Dr. Weaver said he doubted that he could find anyone in the \n     middle of the night, even though most of the others in the \n     ``Black Cabinet'' had been playing poker in his basement when \n     the phone rang. ``And anyway,'' he said, ``I don't think a \n     mere speech will do it. What we need right now is something \n     so dramatic that it will make the Negro voters forget all \n     about Steve Early and the Negro cop too.''\n       Within 48 hours, Benjamin O. Davis Sr. was the first black \n     general in the Army; William H. Hastie was the first black \n     civilian aide to the Secretary of War, and Campbell C. \n     Johnson was the first high-ranking black aide to the head of \n     the Selective Service.\n       Robert Clifton Weaver was born on Dec. 29, 1907, in \n     Washington. His father was a postal worker and his mother--\n     who he said influenced his intellectual development--was the \n     daughter of the first black person to graduate from Harvard \n     with a degree in dentistry. When Dr. Weaver joined the \n     Kennedy Administration, whose Harvard connections extended to \n     the occupant of the Oval Office, he held more Harvard \n     degrees--three, including a doctorate in economics--than \n     anyone else in the administration's upper ranks.\n       In 1960, after serving as the New York State Rent \n     Commissioner, Dr. Weaver became the national chairman of the \n     National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \n     and President Kennedy sought Dr. Weaver's advice on civil \n     rights. The following year, the President appointed him \n     administrator of the House and Home Finance Agency, a loose \n     combination of agencies that included the bureaucratic \n     components of what would eventually become H.U.D., including \n     the Federal Housing Administration to spur construction, the \n     Urban Renewal Administration to oversee slum clearance and \n     the Federal National Mortgage Association to line up money \n     for new housing.\n       President Kennedy tried to have the agency raised to \n     Cabinet rank, but Congress balked. Southerners led an attack \n     against the appointment of a black to the Cabinet, and there \n     were charges that Dr. Weaver was an extremist. Kennedy \n     abandoned the idea of creating an urban affairs department. \n     Five years later, when President Johnson revived the idea and \n     pushed it through Congress, Senators who had voted against \n     Dr. Weaver the first time around voted for him.\n       Past Federal housing programs had largely dealt with \n     bricks-and-mortar policies. Dr. Weaver said Washington needed \n     to take a more philosophical approach. ``Creative federalism \n     stresses local initiative, local solutions to local \n     problems,'' he said.\n       But, he added, ``where the obvious needs for action to meet \n     an urban problem are not being fulfilled, the Federal \n     Government has a responsibility at least to generate a \n     thorough awareness of the problem.''\n       Dr. Weaver, who said that ``you cannot have physical \n     renewal without human renewal,'' pushed for better-looking \n     public housing by offering awards for design. He also \n     increased the amount of money for small businesses displaced \n     by urban renewal and revived the long-dormant idea of Federal \n     rent subsidies for the elderly.\n       Later in his life, he was a professor of urban affairs at \n     Hunter College, was a member of the Visiting Committee at the \n     School of Urban and Public Affairs at Carnegie-Mellon \n     University and held visiting professorships at Columbia \n     Teachers' College and the New York University School of \n     Education. He also served as a consultant to the Ford \n     Foundation and was the president of Baruch College in \n     Manhattan in 1969. His wife, Ella, died in 1991. Their son, \n     Robert Jr., died in 1962.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7874-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7875-S7876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CREATING IMPROVED DELIVERY OF CHILD CARE: AFFORDABLE, RELIABLE, AND \n                   EDUCATIONAL ACT OF 1997 (CIDCARE)\n\n Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nsupport for S. 1037, the Creating Improved Delivery of Child Care: \nAffordable, Reliable, and Educational Act of 1997--better known as the \nCIDCARE Act. I want to commend my colleague from Vermont, Senator \nJeffords, for his steady work on this important measure and for his \ncommitment to enhancing the quality of child care throughout the \nNation. I firmly believe that Senator Jeffords\n\n[[Page S7876]]\n\nhas crafted a measure that would stimulate the demand for higher \nquality child care and I am proud to join Senator Dodd as an original \ncosponsor of this bill.\n  Our society has braved a storm of changes during the last five \ndecades. Our Nation's work environment has changed, too, with the \nintroduction of personal computers, high-speed modems, cellular phones, \npagers, and fax machines. American suburbanization has created a need \nfor audio and video conferencing, satellite offices, and most \nimportantly, telecommuting. In addition, there has been an influx of \nwomen into our nation's work force. According to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, 76 percent of mothers now work. Moreover, 63 percent of two \nparent households now see both parents working outside of the home. \nWhile the number of working women in our country continues to rise, so \nhas the number of children enrolled in child care. Unfortunately, the \nquality of this care has not risen to match the rapid increase in \nenrollment. That is why we must modernize the way we provide child care \nassistance by allocating our scarce resources more efficiently. By \ndoing so, our children will benefit. That is clearly an investment in \nour Nation's future. Congress must legislate with the times to provide \nopportunities for our Nation's parents and child care providers to make \nthat investment.\n  It is often the case with a lot of families that one parent works to \npay the bills while the other one works to pay the taxes. A lot of \npeople are working two jobs just to make ends meet, and often, both \nparents are working two jobs. The resulting increase in the number of \nemployed women in the work force has dramatically expanded the number \nof child care providers. This expansion is truly beneficial to parents \nwho need available child care, but the ratio of children to providers \nand the ensuing reduction in the quality of that care when staff and \nresources are stretched is still troubling. A recent nationwide study \nindicates that 40 percent of the child care provided to infants poses a \npotential risk of injury. Moreover, 15 percent of the care at center-\nbased providers is so deficient that a child's health and safety are \nthreatened.\n  In Wyoming, the quality of the care provided to our children is taken \nvery seriously. Child care providers licensed by the State of Wyoming \nmust have 12 credit hours in education, CPR training, meet fire marshal \nstandards, and have a minimum amount of floor space for the children \nentrusted to their care. The State ensures that all licensed providers \ncomply with these requirements and would continue to do so if this bill \nis passed --but they would do so much more effectively. This \nlegislation would provide a $260 million competitive grant program to \nassist States in improving the quality of care we provide our children. \nStates must use at least 30 percent of the grant funds awarded to \nestablish a subsidy program to provide salary increases to licensed \nchild care providers. The remainder of the grant funds awarded could be \nchanneled toward establishing a scholarship program to help child care \nproviders meet the costs of education and training; expanding State-\nbased child care training and technical assistance activities; \nimproving consumer education efforts including the expansion of \nresource and referral services and child care complaint systems; \nproviding increased rates of reimbursement provided under Federal or \nState child care assistance for children with special-needs; or even \nfor purchasing special supplies, equipment, or meeting other expenses \nnecessary for the care of special needs children. Moreover, this \nlegislation would further expand the Community Development Block Grant \nto States to help renovate existing child care facilities.\n  Equitable distribution of resources based on the percentage of income \na family uses to meet child care expenses must be represented in any \nchange to the current system. This legislation reduces, but does not \neliminate, the dependent care tax credit for upper income taxpayers by \nchanging the way the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit is \nadministered. The income level for the receipt of the highest \npercentage of employment-related child care costs would be increased \nfrom $10,000 to $20,000. The percentage would be decreased at a rate of \n1 percent for each additional $2,500 in adjusted gross income and a \nminimum percentage of 10 percent would be set for incomes of $70,000 \nand above. Employers would be allowed to contribute more to a dependent \ncare assistance plan account. Moreover, families who qualify for the \nearned income tax credit [EITC] would receive a refund of the child \ncare tax credit on a quarterly basis. The EITC was originally geared to \nassist families with dependent children--not couples without any kids \nat all. Clearly, changes are in order.\n  Small businesses are fighting an uphill battle in meeting the child \ncare needs of their employees. Having played the small business owner \nrole for over 25 years, I can appreciate the need for giving such \nemployers a break. This legislation creates a tax credit for employers \nproviding, or otherwise supporting, child care arrangements for their \nemployees. Fifty percent of the expenses incurred by a business to meet \nthe child care needs of employees would be credited toward the \nbusiness' Federal tax liability. Included in this provision are startup \ncosts, renovations to meet accreditation standards, professional \ndevelopment for child care providers, general operating expenses, and \nsubsidized child care for lower paid employees. Small businesses need \nincentives in order to be more involved in meeting the child care needs \nof employees. After all, Congress is placing more parents into the work \nforce following last year's welfare reform legislation. We should \nprovide some tax incentives to employers who are providing those jobs.\n  This legislation would also authorize $50 million a year to establish \nand operate a technology-based training infrastructure to enable child \ncare providers nationwide to receive the training, education, and \nsupport they need to improve the quality of care they provide. We must \nreap the benefits of the Internet to enhance the quality of child care. \nWe spend a lot of time talking about how the Internet can be harmful to \nchildren. Here's a chance to show how it can dramatically help them. By \ncreating a child care training and education interactive network, child \ncare credentialing and accreditation entities for training, skills \ntesting, and other activities needed to maintain child care credentials \nwould be greatly enhanced. Moreover, a no-interest revolving loan fund \nwill be established to enable child care providers to purchase \ncomputers, satellite dishes, and other equipment which would enable \nthem to participate in the child care training provided by this \ntechnological infrastructure.\n  The current system for funding child care in our nation yearns for \nimprovement. This legislation does not reinvent the wheel, it changes \nthe tires. States must continue to receive assistance in order to \nachieve a higher quality of care for our children. This legislation \nsimply provides more efficient and pragmatic methods for administering \nthat assistance. I believe that this legislation provides the proper \nincentives for enhancing the quality of care we provide our children. \nOur society's work force is driven by changing trends. I can \ncomfortably argue that our society is one of the most trendy in the \nworld--a fact that has kept America on the leading edge of \ntechnological innovation. I hope that before people begin making up \ntheir minds on this bill they will take a close look at the language \nand what it really calls for--better care for our kids. Our Nation's \nwork force is calling for this much-needed change. I urge my colleagues \nto support S. 1037, the CIDCARE bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7875-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7876-S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MILWAUKEE VET CENTER\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to praise the people of \nthe Milwaukee Vet Center. For 17 years now these Wisconsinites have \ncounseled and assisted veterans during the difficult period of \nreadjustment from frontline to homefront.\n  Fighting a war is a terrible experience, inflicting physical and \npsychological wounds which few veterans can fully heal on their own. \nThe Milwaukee Vet Center has helped over 8,800 veterans of American \nmissions in their attempts to overcome these psychological battle \nscars. Originally established for Vietnam veterans, its doors are now \nopen to veterans of every major American engagement since World War II.\n\n[[Page S7877]]\n\n  This center stands as a prime example of success in our Nation's \nsocial services. A division of the Department of Veterans Affairs, it \nprovides comprehensive and personalized counseling, not only to male \nand female veterans but also to their spouses and children. Although \nthe center's responsibilities include 91,513 eligible veterans in 13 \neastern Wisconsin counties, its workers strive to make personal contact \nwith as many veterans as possible. Its outreach programs engage \nveterans in the context of their communities, granting a fuller \nknowledge of where each individual stands geographically, \npsychologically and socially. Working with other specialized \norganizations, the center provides individualized services for native \nAmerican and African-American veterans, among others.\n  Those who enter the Milwaukee Vet Center seeking help know they are \ndealing with some of America's most experienced social workers. \nCollectively, the center's employees possess decades of experience in \nthe fields of drug and alcohol abuse, mental health problems, \nvocational rehabilitation, women's health treatment, and psychiatric \ntreatment. They have worked in the public and private sectors, schools, \nhospitals, even disaster areas.\n  The Vet Center provides hands-on field experience for students in \nlocal colleges and universities such as the University of Wisconsin at \nMilwaukee, the Milwaukee Area Technical College, and the Stratton \nBusiness Institute. By sharing their wealth of experience, the Vet \nCenter's professionals enrich these students' education and more \nimportantly guide them on the path to a fulfilling career in public \nservice.\n  I commend the heroic efforts of these public servants, and personally \nthank them for playing an important part in making Wisconsin \ngreat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7876-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MFN FOR CHINA\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr President, I rise to comment briefly on an \naction taken by the Senate last week. We voted on an amendment offered \nby the Senator from Arkansas, Senator Hutchinson, expressing the sense \nof the Senate that China should not receive most-favored-nation tariff \ntreatment.\n  I voted against the Hutchinson amendment, but not because I \nnecessarily support the further extension of most-favored-nation status \nto China. I opposed the amendment because I believe this kind of \namendment should not have been offered to a must-pass appropriations \nbill, especially when the Senate had limited time to debate it.\n  At the appropriate time, we do need to have an extensive debate \nconcerning our trade relationship with China. That debate is long \noverdue and greatly needed, and that debate should cover a range of \nissues. One of the issues that we should debate is the geometric growth \nin our trade deficit with China. In the past dozen years, our \nmerchandise trade deficit with China has grown from $10 million to the \nstaggering total of $40 billion.\n  Mr. President, trade is only beneficial if it is a two-way street. \nAnd right now there is no way that we can characterize our trading \nrelationship with China in that way. We do not have reciprocal, free, \nand open access to China's markets.\n  Yes, our exports to China may have grown threefold and more since \n1980, from $3.6 to $12 billion. However, Chinese exports to America \nduring the same period grew almost fiftyfold, from $1.1 to $51.5 \nbillion.\n  China is a critical part of the overall trade crisis that we face \nright now. We have the largest merchandise trade deficit in our \nhistory. Our second highest trade deficit is with China. China is \nrapidly working to build its manufacturing base and export trade. It is \nfollowing in the footsteps of Japan, which has consistently been the \ncountry with which we have had our largest individual trade deficit.\n  We need to be concerned because trade statistics released last week \nindicated that for the third time in history, our monthly trade deficit \nwith China exceeded our monthly trade deficit with Japan. That should \ngive us cause to take a second look in considering what the future may \nbring in our trade relationship with China.\n  So I am very concerned about our trading relationship with China. But \nwe ought to have a substantial debate on this issue. We ought not offer \nan MFN amendment to an unrelated appropriations bill, have a quick \nlittle debate, and then vote.\n  At the proper time, let us have a real debate about our trade \nrelationship with China. Let us talk about trade deficits, market \naccess, and reciprocity. Let us talk about selling more American wheat, \noilseeds, beef, pork, and other agricultural commodities to China. Let \nus talk about China's tariff and nontariff trade barriers, content \nrules, and labor systems. Let us debate most-favored-nation status for \nChina and the MFN law itself. And, most certainly, let us debate the \nissues of religious freedom and human rights in China, since these \nshould have a bearing too on whether we grant MFN status to China.\n  These are important issues that deserve full and thoughtful \nconsideration by this body and our entire Nation. I look forward to \ncontributing to that debate, and hope that it can be done in a way that \nis productive and useful for the people of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7877-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7877-S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MARVIN SONOSKY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nman who spent his life and career working on behalf of Indian tribal \ngovernments and ensuring that the United States fulfilled its trust \nresponsibility to Indian people, Marvin Sonosky of Alexandria, VA. On \nJuly 16, Mr. Sonosky died of heart failure. He was 66 years old. I join \nhis many friends in mourning the loss of one of Indian country's \ngreatest advocates. I would like to convey my sympathy to his wife, \nShirley Freimuth Sonosky, and his daughters Judith Kreisberg, Joann \nHirsch, and Karen Hecker and his seven grandchildren and one great \ngrandchild.\n  Mr. Sonosky was born in Duluth, MN, and received his undergraduate \nand law degrees from the University of Minnesota. After 4 years of \nprivate practice, Mr. Sonosky came to Washington in 1937 and joined the \nLands Division of the Department of Justice where he served for 17 \nyears. As a special assistant to the Attorney General he frequently \nargued before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In 1951, Mr. Sonosky returned to private practice. In 1976, he formed \nthe firm of Sonosky, Chambers & Sachse, where he practiced until his \ndeath. He remained active in the trial practice of the firm through the \nlast week of his life.\n  Mr. Sonosky was a unique individual in this city in that he was one \nof the best advocates in his field yet he never sought the accolades or \ntributes that so many seek. Instead his tribute came from knowing that \nevery day that he worked he had the potential to improve perhaps just \none Indian person's life.\n  I would like to share with this body some of the many legislative \ninitiatives involving Indian tribes that were the brainchild of Mr. \nSonosky. These are but one measure of the impact that he had in \nimproving the lives and opportunities of Indian tribal governments and \ntheir people and ensured that the United States stands behinds its \ntrust obligations to them.\n  Following devastating losses of Indian reservation land and its \nresulting poverty, Mr. Sonosky worked with Congress to secure the \nenactment of federal statutes that returned over 1 million acres of \nundisposed surplus lands within those reservations to the tribes--the \nresources from these lands have been vital to the economies of many of \nthese Indian communities.\n  Mr. Sonosky also brought to the attention of Congress the need to \namend Federal law authorizing Indian tribes to recover just \ncompensation for lands taken by the United States so that the damages \nawarded would not be unfairly diminished by the value of food and \nrations that the United States had promised in exchange for the lands \nit acquired. When Government officials unlawfully offset welfare claims \nagainst trust funds of individual Indians, Mr. Sonosky successfully \nchallenged the practice in Federal court. He subsequently worked with \nCongress to ensure that all individual Indians who had been harmed by \nthis practice were properly reimbursed.\n  While much of Mr. Sonosky's congressional efforts focused on righting \npast wrongs, an equal part of his work resulted in legislation that \nwill protect Indian rights for generations to come.\n\n[[Page S7878]]\n\n  Through his efforts Federal law that had previously allowed States to \nassume jurisdiction over certain matters on Indian reservations was \namended to expressly require tribal consent prior to application of \nState jurisdiction. And, most significantly, when limitations contained \nin the statutes governing Federal court jurisdiction effectively barred \nIndian tribes from invoking that forum to vindicate federally protected \nrights, Mr. Sonosky successfully developed and advocated for a Federal \nlaw that today vests Federal courts with jurisdiction to adjudicate any \nclaim brought by an Indian tribe.\n  The honor of the Nation with regard to our obligations to Indian \npeople has indeed been well served by Mr. Sonosky. We will miss him \ndearly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/22/senate-section/article/S7877-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "22", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 748\n\n  Mr. BOND.
