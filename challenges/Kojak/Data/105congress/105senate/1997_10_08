Crucial issues \nawait our attention. Unmade decisions demand our concentration. And we \nknow that the choices we make will affect us, others around us, our \nNation and the world.\n  It's with that in mind that we say with the psalmist, ``Show us Your \nways, O Lord; teach us Your paths.

Under the previous order, \nthere will now be 1 hour equally divided in the usual form, prior to \nthe cloture vote on S. 25.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, am I correct that the 1 hour between \nnow and the vote at 12 is equally divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to yield to the Senator \nfrom Arkansas such time as he may desire, and take this opportunity to \ncome preside while he speaks.\n  (Mr. McCONNELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nyielding time.\n  Yesterday I voted to invoke cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill. \nToday I will oppose that effort.\n  I voted for cloture because I want campaign finance reform. I want an \nopportunity to amend McCain-Feingold, which I believe is a seriously \nflawed bill. I want a chance to vote on a reform bill and I want to ban \nor limit soft money. But it is now clear that there is no consensus in \nsupport of McCain-Feingold, and if we are to have serious and \nmeaningful reform, we will and must take a different direction.\n  I absolutely do not support the current version of McCain-Feingold. \nIn my opinion, and I have expressed it both publicly and privately, \nMcCain-Feingold contains provisions that threaten free speech and pose \nserious constitutional problems, especially in the area of issue \nadvocacy. These groups, which play such an important part in the \npolitical process, regardless of their affiliation, deserve to play \nthat important role. And we must not in any way place a chill on their \nright of free expression and their ability to criticize their public \nofficials. There have been abuses, no doubt about that. But it is far \nbetter for us to err on the side of freedom and to err on the side of \nliberty and to err on the side of the Constitution than to take a \nchance of passing a misguided, though popular right now, reform bill \nthat would in fact begin that erosion of those liberties and freedoms \nand the right of free expression that we cherish as Americans and that \nwe always should.\n  It is clear there is no consensus on McCain-Feingold and will not be. \nIt is equally clear that repeated cloture votes on McCain-Feingold is a \npart of a political strategy to portray opponents of McCain-Feingold as \nopponents of reform. As unfortunate as it is for the American people, \nthe McCain-Feingold bill has become so politicized that even supporters \nof campaign finance reform, like myself, are disgusted with the \npolitical tactics that have been used in this debate. You have to \nquestion the sincerity of a strategy that disrupts Senate business and \ndistracts the Senate from other important business such as ISTEA, the \ntransportation funding bill, fast track, appropriation conference \nreports and judicial nominations, all of these vitally important\n\n[[Page S10502]]\n\nthings, pressing business of the American people, and to set that aside \nso we can hold press conferences to portray opponents of McCain-\nFeingold as opponents of reform, which is not true and is not fair.\n  If supporters of McCain-Feingold truly wanted to put forth a serious \neffort to enact reform, they would take a different approach by working \nto find consensus, by working to find agreement, rather than attempting \nto score political points.\n  I will not be a part of these partisan guerrilla warfare tactics. I \nfully and completely support campaign finance reform. I think we have \nneed to address it. I think we need to reform the system and \nparticularly deal with that area in which there has been abuse, in the \narea of soft money. But I will not again vote to invoke cloture on S. \n25 and be a part of a political game that is more concerned about \nportraying political opponents in a certain bad light than enacting \nmeaningful and real and significant reform.\n  I thank again the Senator from Kentucky for his leadership and for \nhis genuine deep convictions in defense of the first amendment and the \nright of free expression. I yield the floor.\n  (Mr. HUTCHINSON assumed the chair.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with keen interest to the \ncomments of the Senator from Arkansas and want to congratulate him for \nhis decision. With his decision there is an excellent chance that today \nwe will reach a historic high in opposition to measures similar to \nMcCain-Feingold. So I commend the Senator from Arkansas for his \nconviction and thank him for his support in defense of the first \namendment. I think he has done the courageous and correct thing.\n  I want to make a few brief observations this morning. There is not a \nwhole lot left to say in this debate. But I wanted to refer to a few \narticles over the last few days that I think ought to be noted and \nprinted in the Record.\n  A USA Today column on Monday, by Richard Benedetto, is worth noting, \nin terms of the attitude of the press on this issue. Americans have \nevery right to expect that the press will not take sides on an issue \noff of the editorial page. Here is Mr. Benedetto's column of Monday, \nthat I think is noteworthy, in USA Today. He says:\n\n       If you think the news media are providing the straight \n     story on efforts to revise campaign finance laws, look \n     closer.\n       Much of the reporting is tilted toward voices in favor of \n     wholesale reform. Those who take an opposing view are mostly \n     portrayed as either corrupt or partisan.\n       Little space or time is devoted to sober, broad looks at \n     arguments on all sides of the issue. Instead, coverage is \n     often emotional and selective. Reporting usually begins from \n     the premise that the McCain-Feingold reform bill now before \n     the Senate is good, and that any attempt to slow it, stop it \n     or change it is bad.\n       Proponents say the fate of our democracy hangs on reform. \n     And given a predisposition of many in the media to agree, \n     that message is hammered home and almost daily.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       CNN gives its position away in the title of a show on \n     campaign finance it will air Tuesday: The Money Trail; \n     Democracy for Sale.\n  This was ostensibly an objective piece by CNN on campaign finance, an \nissue which the occupant of the chair has just said is largely about \nthe first amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. Benedetto goes on:\n\n       Thanks to coverage such as that, it's no surprise polls \n     show that a majority of Americans want Congress to pass \n     legislation to tighten the rules under which politicians and \n     political parties collect money.\n       Never one to misread a popular trend, President Clinton has \n     enlisted on the side of reform. Never mind that it was \n     alleged abuses of current law by Clinton and Vice President \n     Gore in 1996 that intensified calls for change in the first \n     place. He's now a believer.\n  Just a couple of other comments from his column, Mr. Benedetto's \ncolumn in USA Today of Monday:\n\n       Media conduct on this one is not pure liberal bias. It's \n     another example of what Washington Post columnist Robert \n     Samuelson calls ``pack journalism run amok.''\n       ``We media types fancy ourselves independent and skeptical \n     thinkers,'' he recently wrote. ``Just the opposite is often \n     true. We're patsies for the latest social crusade or \n     intellectual fad.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent Mr. Benedetto's column in USA \nToday be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From USA Today, Oct. 6, 1997]\n\n              Media Too Quick To Buy Into Campaign Reform\n\n                         (By Richard Benedetto)\n\n       If you think the news media are providing the straight \n     story on efforts to revise campaign finance laws, look \n     closer.\n       Much of the reporting is tilted toward voices in favor of \n     wholesale reform.

In one sentence, readers are given two \n     negative cues on campaign finance. The first: that Virginia \n     law is ``one of the nation's most liberal.'' The second: the \n     loaded phrase ``raking in.''\n       CNN gives its position away in the title of a show on \n     campaign finance it will air Tuesday: The Money Trail: \n     Democracy for Sale.\n       Thanks to coverage such as that, it's no surprise polls \n     show that a majority of Americans want Congress to pass \n     legislation to tighten the rules under which politicians and \n     political parties collect money.\n       Never one to misread a popular trend, President Clinton has \n     enlisted on the side of reform. Never mind that it was \n     alleged abuses of current law by Clinton and Vice President \n     Gore in 1996 that intensified calls for change in the first \n     place. He's now a believer.\n       While reform may be needed, there are several arguments for \n     moving carefully. For example, enacting limits on \n     contributions could run afoul of the Constitution.\n       In 1976, the Supreme Court ruled 9-0 that campaign \n     contributions are the equivalent of speech and that attempts \n     to limit them could violate First Amendment rights. How \n     thoroughly has that issue been aired? Not very. The focus of \n     most reporting is on procedural maneuvering of opponents.\n       When Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., introduced \n     an amendment last week to require labor unions to get \n     permission of members before spending dues money for \n     political purposes, news reports said he was ``muddying the \n     water.''\n       Opponents called it ``a poison pill.'' Newspaper editorials \n     denounced the move as shamefully partisan. The charge: \n     Republicans want to hamper unions' ability to raise money \n     because the millions of dollars they raise for campaigns go \n     mostly to Democrats.\n       But if that's legitimate cause for denouncing the \n     amendment, why is it not similarly legitimate to question the \n     motive of Democrats seeking to ban ``soft money?'' Those are \n     unlimited contributions that go to political parties and are \n     supposed to help pay for party-building activities such as \n     get-out-the-vote efforts.\n       Republicans collect more soft money than Democrats. So it \n     would seem in the Democrats' interest to get rid of that GOP \n     advantage. Yet, few raise that point. According to the \n     prevailing wisdom, soft money must go--period.\n       Media conduct on this one is not pure liberal bias. It's \n     another example of what Washington Post columnist Robert \n     Samuelson calls ``pack journalism run amok.''\n       ``We media types fancy ourselves independent and skeptical \n     thinkers,'' he recently wrote. ``Just the opposite is often \n     true. We're patsies for the latest social crusade or \n     intellectual fad.''\n       The anti-smoking campaign is a recent example of the media \n     buying in with few reservations. Global warming, too. Now \n     it's campaign finance reform.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.  Also there was a recent and interesting survey \nconducted by Rasmussen Research, out of North Carolina.\n\n       Most Americans think that friendly reporters are more \n     important to a successful political campaign than money, \n     according to a Rasmussen Research survey of 1000 adults. By a \n     3-to-1 margin (61 percent to 19 percent) Americans believe \n     that if reporters like one candidate more than another, that \n     candidate is likely to win--even if the other candidate \n     raised more money in a campaign.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that be printed in the Record as well.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nReporters More Influential Than Campaign Cash?--Most Americans Say Yes!\n\n       Waxhaw, NC.--Most Americans think that friendly reporters \n     are more important to a successful political campaign that \n     money, according to a Rasmussen Research survey of 1,000 \n     adults. By a 3-to-1 margin (61% to\n\n[[Page S10503]]\n\n     19%) Americans believe that if reporters like one candidate \n     more than another, that candidate is likely to win--even if \n     the other candidate raised more money in the campaign.\n       ``This finding raises basic questions about the types of \n     reform that it will take to restore voter confidence in \n     representative democracy,'' noted Scott Rasmussen, president \n     of Rasmussen Research. ``Campaign contributions that buy \n     special favors are viewed by the American people as a problem \n     that needs to be addressed. However, most also think that \n     much more serious reform will be needed to solve our nation's \n     electoral problems.''\n       Earlier surveys by Rasmussen Research have found the most \n     Americans think the passage of new campaign finance laws will \n     not end corruption in government. The consensus view is that \n     new laws would simply encourage politicians to find new ways \n     of obtaining money in exchange for votes or other favors. \n     Nine-out-of-ten Americans believe that members of Congress do \n     exchange votes for campaign cash.\n       Americans are also generally suspicious of reporters. More \n     than seven-out-of-ten registered voters believe that the \n     personal biases of reporters affect their coverage of \n     stories, issues, and campaigns.\n       Additional survey information on campaign finance reform \n     and other issues can be found at www.PortraitoAmerica.com, a \n     web site maintained by Rasmussen Research.\n       Rasmussen Research is a public opinion polling firm that \n     conducts independent surveys on events in the news and other \n     topics. The survey of 1,000 adults was conducted September \n     27-28, 1997. The survey has a margin of sampling error of +/\n     -3 percentage points, with a 95% level of confidence.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, there was a fascinating column by Robert \nSamuelson in Newsweek of October 6, Monday of this week. The headline \nsays, ``Making Pols Into Crooks--Campaign-Finance `Reform' Criminalizes \nPolitics and Deepens Public Cynicism.''\n  Let me just take a few excerpts out of this article, because I think \nit really is excellent, and sums up the nature of this debate. Bob \nSamuelson says:\n\n       The ``reformers'' claim they're trying to lower public \n     cynicism by cleansing politics of the evils of money. \n     Actually, they're doing the opposite: by putting so many \n     unrealistic restrictions on legitimate political activity, \n     the ``reformers'' ensure that more people--politicians, \n     campaign workers, advocacy groups--will run afoul of the \n     prohibitions. Public cynicism rises as politics is \n     criminalized.\n\n  Mr. Samuelson goes on:\n\n       There is no easy way to curb the role of money in politics \n     without curbing free expression. If I favor larger (smaller) \n     government, I should be able to support like-minded \n     candidates by helping them win. Campaign ``reformers''--who \n     would like to replace private contributions with public \n     subsidies and impose strict spending limits--reject this \n     basic principles.\n       Money, they say, is corrupting politics. It isn't.\n       Campaign spending isn't out of control or outlandish. In \n     the 1996 election, campaign spending at all levels--\n\n  At all levels, Federal, State and local--\n\n       totaled $4 billion, says political scientist Herbert \n     Alexander of the Citizens' Research Foundation. That was one \n     twentieth of one percent of the gross domestic product of \n     $7.6 trillion. Americans spend about $20 billion a year on \n     laundry and dry cleaning. Is the price of politics really too \n     steep?\n\n  Robert Samuelson asks.\n  Further in the article he says:\n\n       More menacing are the artificial limits that ``reformers'' \n     have imposed on political expression----\n       Something the Senator from Arkansas was just referring to a \n     few moments ago in his speech----\n       What's been created is a baffling maze of election laws and \n     rules that, once codified, establish new types of criminal or \n     quasi-criminal behavior. Anyone tiptoeing around the rules is \n     said to be ``skirting the law.'' And there are violations. In \n     the futile effort to regulate politics, the ``reformers'' \n     have manufactured most of the immorality, illegality and \n     cynicism that they deplore.\n       Today's ``abuses'' stem mostly from the 1974 ``reforms'' \n     enacted after Watergate. Congress then limited the amount \n     individuals could give a candidate to $1,000 per election; \n     total giving to all candidates (directly, through parties or \n     committees) was limited to $25,000 a year. What happened? The \n     limits inspired evasions. Suppressing contributions to \n     candidates encouraged new political-action committees. People \n     gave to PACs, which give to candidates. In 1974, there were \n     608 PACs; now there are 4,000.\n       Another evasion is ``independent spending'': groups (the \n     Supreme Court says) can promote a candidate by themselves if \n     they don't ``coordinate'' with a candidate. The present \n     evasion of concern is ``soft money'': contributions to \n     parties for ``party-building'' activities like voter \n     registration. ``Soft money'' contributions have no limits; so \n     Tamraz could give $300,000. But ``soft money'' can also be \n     used for general TV ads that mention candidates as long as \n     they don't use such words as ``vote for.'' Does any of this \n     make any sense? Not really. Ordinary people can't grasp all \n     the obscure, illogical distinctions.\n\n  And he is talking, Mr. President, about current law, even before we \ntalk about making it more complicated.\n\n       No matter. The failure of past ``reforms'' is no barrier to \n     future ``reforms.'' The latest effort is the McCain-Feingold \n     bill now before the Senate.\n\n  Samuelson says:\n\n       Most of the bill flouts the spirit, if not the letter, of \n     the First Amendment.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Oct. 6, 1997]\n\n   Making Pols Into Crooks--Campaign-Finance ``Reform'' Criminalizes \n                  Politics and Deepens Public Cynicism\n\n                        (By Robert J. Samuelson)\n\n       The prospect that an independent counsel will be named to \n     investigate the alleged campaign-law violations of President \n     Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore exposes a central \n     contradiction of ``campaign-finance reform.'' The \n     ``reformers'' claim they're trying to lower public cynicism \n     by cleansing politics of the evils of money. Actually, \n     they're doing the opposite: by putting so many unrealistic \n     restrictions on legitimate political activity, the \n     ``reformers'' ensure that more people--politicians, campaign \n     workers, advocacy groups--will run afoul of the prohibitions. \n     Public cynicism rises as politics is criminalized.\n       The distasteful reality is that politics requires money. To \n     compete, candidates must communicate; and to communicate, \n     they need cash. Someone has to pay for all the ads, direct \n     mail and polls. There is no easy way to curb the role of \n     money in politics without curbing free expression. If I favor \n     larger (smaller) government, I should be able to support \n     like-minded candidates by helping them win. Campaign \n     ``reformers''--who would like to replace private \n     contributions with public subsidies and impose strict \n     spending limits--reject this basic principle.\n       Money, they say, is corrupting politics. It isn't. Campaign \n     spending isn't out of control or outlandish. In the 1996 \n     election campaign spending at all levels totaled $4 billion, \n     says political scientist Herbert Alexander of the Citizens' \n     Research Foundation. That was one twentieth of one percent of \n     the gross domestic product (GDP) of $7.6 trillion. Americans \n     spend about $20 billion a year on laundry and dry cleaning. \n     Is the price of politics really too steep?\n       Nor have contributions hijacked legislation. Consider the \n     tax code. It's perforated with tax breaks, many undesirable. \n     Some tax breaks benefit wealthy constituents who sweetened \n     their lobbying with generous campaign contributions. But the \n     largest tax breaks stem mostly from politicians' desire to \n     pander to masses of voters. In the 1997 tax bill, Clinton and \n     Congress provided huge tax breaks for college tuition. Does \n     anyone think these passed because Harvard's president is a \n     big contributor?\n       The media coverage and congressional hearings of today's \n     alleged campaign-finance ``abuses'' have, of course, revealed \n     the frenzied and demeaning efforts of politicians of both \n     parties to raise money. But there hasn't been much evidence \n     of serious influence buying. The worst we've heard is of \n     President Clinton's, in effect, subletting the Lincoln \n     Bedroom to big contributors and of businessman Roger Tamraz's \n     giving $300,000 to Democrats in the hope of winning \n     government support for an oil pipeline. All Tamraz got was a \n     brief chat with Clinton and no blessing for the project. This \n     sort of preferential ``access'' isn't dangerous.\n       More menacing are all the artificial limits that \n     ``reformers'' have imposed on political expression. What's \n     been created is a baffling maze of election laws and rules \n     that, once codified, establish new types of criminal or \n     quasi-criminal behavior. Anyone tiptoeing around the rules is \n     said to be ``skirting the law.'' And there are violations.

Congress then limited the amount \n     individuals give a candidate to $1,000 per election; total \n     giving to all candidates (directly, through parties or \n     committees) was limited to $25,000 a year. What happened? The \n     limits inspired evasions. Suppressing contributions to \n     candidates encouraged new political-action committees. People \n     give to PACs, which give to candidates. In 1974, there were \n     608 PACs; now there are nearly 4,000.\n       Another evasion is ``independent spending'': groups (the \n     Supreme Court says) can promote a candidate by themselves if \n     they don't ``coordinate'' with a candidate. The present \n     evasion of concern is ``soft money'': contributions to \n     parties for ``party-building'' activities like voter \n     registration. ``Soft money'' contributions have no limits; so \n     Tamraz could give $300,000. But ``soft money'' can also be \n     used for general TV ads that mention candidates as long as \n     they don't use such words as ``vote for.'' Does any of this \n     make sense? Not really. Ordinary people can't grasp all the \n     obscure, illogical distinctions.\n       No matter. The failure of past ``reforms'' is no barrier to \n     future ``reforms.'' The latest effort is the McCain-Feingold \n     bill now before\n\n[[Page S10504]]\n\n     the Senate. Named after its sponsors (Republican John McCain \n     of Arizona and Democrat Russell Feingold of Wisconsin), it \n     would outlaw ``soft money'' and try to ban ``issue advocacy'' \n     ads in the 60 days before an election (``Issue advocacy'' ads \n     favor or oppose candidates; the distinction between them and \n     ``independent spending'' cannot briefly be explained.) Most \n     of the bill flouts the spirit, if not the letter, of the \n     First Amendment:\n       ``Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of \n     speech . . .; or the right of the people peaceably to \n     assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of \n     grievances.''\n       The connection between campaign ``reform'' and the Clinton-\n     Gore predicament has emerged, ironically, in the complaints \n     of some ``reformers'' that the president and vice president \n     are being unfairly targeted. In The Washington Post, \n     Elizabeth Drew says that Gore behaved like a ``klutz,'' but \n     ``klutziness isn't a federal crime.'' The 1883 law that he \n     and the president may have violated (soliciting contributions \n     from federal property), argues Drew, aimed to protect civil \n     servants from being shaken down by politicians. In The New \n     York Times, former deputy attorney general Philip Heymann \n     says the campaign against Gore aims only to ``destroy the \n     Democratic front runner for president.''\n       All this is true. But it misses the larger point: the \n     campaign-finance laws are so arbitrary and complex that they \n     invite ``criminality'' or its appearance. Bad laws should be \n     discarded. Rep. John Doolittle of California sensibly \n     suggests abandoning all contribution limits and enacting \n     tougher disclosure laws. The best defense against the undue \n     influence of money is to let candidates raise it from as many \n     sources as possible--and to let the public see who's giving. \n     That would be genuine reform.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, also in the Wall Street Journal of \nOctober 1, there was a piece by Jonathan Rauch, who is a contributing \neditor to the National Journal. I want to read a few parts of that.\n  Mr. Rauch said:\n\n       The McCain-Feingold bill being debated in the Senate this \n     week has become the default option for campaign-finance \n     reformers: If you are an editorialist who needs to suggest \n     something better than today's tumbledown system, you press \n     the McCain-Feingold button on our word processor. Well, the \n     system today is rotten, and radical change is needed. But \n     McCain-Feingold, for all its good press and good intentions, \n     is a bad bill. It would do nothing to end the failures of the \n     past 20 years. Indeed, it would unflinchingly compound them.\n       At the core of today's troubles are two realities that will \n     not yield to any amount of legislative or lawyerly \n     cleverness. The first is that private money--a lot of it--is \n     a fact of life in politics, and if you push it out of one \n     part of the system it tends to re-enter somewhere else, \n     usually deeper in shadow. The second is that money spent to \n     communicate with voters cannot be regulated without impinging \n     on the very core of the First Amendment, which was written to \n     protect political discourse above all.\n\n  That is what they were thinking about when they wrote the first \namendment, political discourse.\n\n       We got into today's mess by defying both of these \n     principles, with predictable results. When reformers placed \n     limits on money spent to support or defeat candidates, \n     lobbies simply shifted to ad campaigns that omitted explicit \n     requests to vote for or against candidates: ``issue \n     advocacy,'' which the courts have ruled is constitutionally \n     protected. And when reformers placed tight limits on \n     contributions to candidates, donors began giving to political \n     parties instead: ``soft money.''\n       The distinctions between ``hard'' and ``soft'' money, and \n     between ``express advocacy'' and ``issue advocacy,'' are \n     grounded in legalistic mumbo-jumbo, and so the attempts to \n     enforce them have made campaign law bewilderingly complex \n     without accomplishing any of the law's goals. Campaigns are \n     neither cheaper nor fairer nor less dependent on private \n     money than, say, 30 years ago--just the opposite, in fact. \n     One conclusion you might draw is that the 1970s-style, money-\n     regulating model is bankrupt. Another is that a horse-\n     doctor's dose of the old medicine will finally heal the \n     patient. Enter Sens. John McCain and Russell Feingold.\n       Among many things their bill would do, two are paramount. \n     First, it would ban ``soft money'' given to political \n     parties. Second, to make the ``soft money'' ban work, it \n     would also restrict independent ``issue advocacy.'' Voila--no \n     more money, right?\n       Wrong. Lots and lots of money, but in different places. Ban \n     soft money, and lobbies would bypass the parties and conduct \n     their own campaign blitzes. Candidates and parties are \n     already losing control of their messages as lobbies--which, \n     unlike candidates and parties, are not accountable to \n     voters--run independent advocacy campaigns.\n\n  Mr. President, I see that my friend from Wisconsin is here. I am \ngoing to reserve the remainder of my time and ask that the entire \nJonathan Rauch article that I just was reading from be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:]\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 1, 1997]\n\n               Vote Against McCain, Wait, Can I Say That?\n\n                          (By Jonathan Rauch)\n\n       The McCain-Feingold bill being debated in the Senate this \n     week has become the default option for campaign-finance \n     reformers: If you are an editorialist who needs to suggest \n     something better than today's tumbeldown system, you press \n     the McCain-Feingold button on your word processor.

Another is that a horse-\n     doctor's dose of the old medicine will finally heal the \n     patient. Enter Sens. John McCain (R., Ariz.) and Russell \n     Feingold (D., Wis.).\n       Among many things their bill would do, two are paramount. \n     First, it would ban ``soft money'' given to political \n     parties. Second, to make the ``soft money'' ban work, it \n     would also restrict independent ``issue advocacy.'' Voila--no \n     more money, right?\n       Wrong. Lots and lots of money, but in different places. Ban \n     soft money, and lobbies would bypass the parties and conduct \n     their own campaign blitzes. Candidates and parties are \n     already losing control of their messages as lobbies--which, \n     unlike candidates and parties, are not accountable to \n     voters--run independent advocacy campaigns. The McCain-\n     Feingold bill would accelerate the alienation of politicians \n     from their own campaigns, and, for good measure, it could \n     also starve the parties of funds.\n       The sponsors are aware that independent advertising might \n     replace soft money: thus the bill's remarkable new limits on \n     all ads that mention candidates within 60 days of an \n     election. In the words of Sen. McCain: ``Ads could run which \n     advocate any number of causes. Pro-life ads, pro-choice ads, \n     antilabor ads, pro-wilderness ads, pro-Republican Party ads, \n     pro-Democrat Party ads--all could be aired in the last 60 \n     days. However, ads mentioning the candidates could not.'' So, \n     for example, I might commit a federal crime by taking out an \n     ad in this newspaper criticizing Sen. McCain for supporting \n     his bill. The Founders would have run screaming from such a \n     notion, and rightly so: You cannot improve the integrity of \n     any political system by letting politicians restrict \n     political speech.\n       In real life the courts are likely to strike down McCain-\n     Feingold's speech controls, in which case, of course, the \n     limits would not work. But even if the limits were allowed to \n     stand, they still would not work: Everybody would race to \n     game the system by dressing up political expression in absurd \n     costumes, whose legitimacy would be contested ad nauseam in \n     the courts. Maybe my ad couldn't say ``Vote against McCain \n     and Feingold,'' but could it say ``Show the promoters of the \n     dangerous McCain-Feingold bill how you feel''? Who would \n     decide?\n       The potential for speech micromanagement is endless. \n     Imagine the fun lawyers could have with the bill's exception \n     for ``voter guides''--a permissible voter guide being (hold \n     on tight, now) any printed matter written in an ``educational \n     manner'' about two or more candidates that (1) is not \n     coordinated with a candidate, (2) gives all candidates an \n     equal opportunity to respond to any questionnaires, (3) gives \n     no candidate any greater prominence than any other, and (4) \n     does not contain a phrase ``such as'' (my italics), ``vote \n     for,'' ``re-elect,'' ``support,'' ``defeat,'' ``reject'' or \n     other ``words which in context can have no reasonable meaning \n     other than to urge the election or defeat of one or more \n     candidates.'' Is that clear?\n       So, after McCain-Feingold, campaign law would become even \n     more complex and mystifying. Politicians would remain \n     mendicants, forced by low contribution limits to beg every \n     day and in every way for donations. Our already weak parties \n     would lose their main source of funds, becoming weaker still. \n     If the speech controls were upheld, political discussion \n     would be both chilled and\n\n[[Page S10505]]\n\n     contorted. And if the speech controls were struck down, \n     political campaigns would be run by lobbies (``independent \n     expenditures'') rather than by candidates and parties. Quite \n     a reform.\n       Even total deregulation would be better than McCain-\n     Feingold, provided disclosure were retained. For that matter, \n     doing nothing would be better. Best by a very long measure, \n     however, would be a combination of deregulation, disclosure \n     and generous public financing for candidates who forgo \n     private fund-raising--a plan which, instead of trying to \n     eliminate or micromanage private money, would give voters an \n     alternative to it, and make the acceptance of private \n     donations an issue in every campaign.\n       Alas, all of those admittedly imperfect ideas are bitterly \n     opposed by the anti-money crusaders who gave us the system we \n     have now, and who still predominate in the ``reform \n     community.'' To change their minds, campaign-finance law will \n     probably have to be made worse before it can be made better. \n     That task, at least, McCain-Feingold would perform admirably.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Thank you, Mr. President. Let me, first of all, \ncongratulate the occupant of the chair for his vote yesterday. I heard \nhis comments this morning. The occupant of the chair did the right \nthing yesterday. He voted for cloture and joined 52 other Senators--a \nSenator we had not in the past known for sure whether or not he was \ngoing to vote for cloture on any occasion, and I very much appreciate \nthat.\n  I realize that his words are sincere. He does, in fact, support \ncampaign finance reform. It is important that, again, the Senator from \nArizona and I signal what we have signaled in the past, and that is \nthat we are very eager to negotiate, whether on the floor or off the \nfloor, to make a bill that would be more palatable to Members on both \nsides of the aisle.\n  I think the Senator from Arkansas has indicated some excellent ideas \nin the past. That is the signal I want to give, despite whatever \nindications one might feel from the press accounts, which, of course, \nall of us have to take with a grain of salt on both sides of the issue. \nThe fact is that many of us really would like to change this system, \nand I believe the Senator who occupies the chair is one of them.\n  Let me reiterate our offer, which I think we have made good on time \nand time again, that if modifications need to be made to pass this \nterribly important bill, we are ready to do it. That is how the junior \nSenator from Maine became such a tremendous advocate for our cause. She \nhad some ideas that were better than ours, and we incorporated them and \nmoved on to make the bill even better.\n  So I look forward to working with the occupant of the chair so that, \nonce again, he can feel comfortable voting for cloture as we continue \nto press this issue on the floor, which we will do until we get the \nresult that the American people demand.\n  Let me also suggest, this is a point that seems to be missed in this \ndebate frequently. The Senator from Kentucky speaks frequently and \neloquently about the first amendment. But the way our system is \nestablished, surely if you pass a bill in the Congress, a piece of \nlegislation, a statute, it doesn't amend the Constitution. There is \nmore to the process. The President has to sign the bill, and it has to \ngo up to the United States Supreme Court, unless nobody challenges it. \nAnd I have a sneaking suspicion that somebody might challenge this bill \nif it became law.\n  So what is the worst-case scenario? The worst-case scenario is that \nif, in fact, there is a shred of our bill that is unconstitutional, the \nSupreme Court will say so and strike it down. They know how to do their \njob. If we do our job, they will do their job. That is exactly what \nthey did in the very famous case of Buckley versus Valeo. They \ndetermined that some elements of the bill were constitutional, despite \nthe claim of the ACLU and others that they were not, and they said they \nwere OK.\n  For example, having a limitation on contributions. It is, obviously, \nthe law now, and the Senator from Kentucky cannot dispute that it is \nthe law, that right now somebody can't give more than $2,000 in the \ncourse of 6 years to a U.S. Senate candidate in hard money. That is a \nlimitation. The Supreme Court said it is OK.\n  On the other hand, in Buckley versus Valeo, the Court said you can't \nhave overall mandatory spending limits because that, in their view, \nwould be a violation of the first amendment.\n  So what is the threat to the first amendment of passing a piece of \nlegislation about which we have a good-faith disagreement as to its \nconstitutionality? I happen to think it is clear that the major \nprovisions of our bill are constitutional.\n  I would be the first to concede that the closest case would be the \none that the Senator from Kentucky has focused most of his firepower on \nin this debate, and that is the issue of what I like to call phony \nissue ads. But I can see that would be something the Supreme Court \nwould have to take a long and hard look at, and I think they should. \nThat is why, Mr. President, I don't support a constitutional amendment \nto get this done. The first amendment is too sacred.\n  So, I want to address your concern about the first amendment to tell \nyou that I was, I believe, the first or second Member of the U.S. \nSenate to come out here and oppose something called the Communications \nDecency Act. People fell all over each other voting for that bill that \nwould have censored the Internet. I came out here and said, ``Look, on \nthe face of this, even though I am not a leading constitutional expert \nbut I have looked at the Constitution, on the face of it, this is \nunconstitutional.'' Yet, I believe 84 Members of this body, including \nthe Senator from Kentucky, voted for it, sent it up to the Supreme \nCourt and, guess what? Unanimously that Supreme Court--of which a \nmajority of the Members were appointed by the majority party \nPresidents--unanimously ruled that that was unconstitutional.\n  Mr. President, both with regard to your concern that we be flexible \nand open to other people's ideas, which I think you and I have \nestablished a good record on, and with regard to the issue of the first \namendment to the Constitution, not only couldn't I agree with you more, \nbut I believe we have a lot to talk about and work together on to \nachieve campaign finance reform.\n  Since the Senator from Kentucky continues in his steadfast way to \nmake a record, which I hope one day will get before the Supreme Court--\nhe hopes it won't get that far--let me address a couple of other issues \nand put a few things of concern to me in the Record.\n  The Senator from Kentucky has been proudly suggesting that the \nMcCain-Feingold bill is dead, and yet we are out here today debating it \nagain, and we will be debating it again. That is because it is not \ngoing away. It is because it is not simply a question of various \nelements of the media saying that the McCain-Feingold bill is a good \nidea. There are others who are not in the media who, I think, are not \neasily duped by the media who think we ought to enact some of the \nthings that are in the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Let me just put a few of those items in the Record. First, I ask \nunanimous consent that letters from former Presidents Gerald Ford, \nJimmy Carter, and George Bush endorsing a soft money ban--a soft money \nban, which is the centerpiece of the McCain-Feingold proposal--be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Houston, TX,\n\n                                                    June 19, 1997.\n     Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: First, let me commend you and the \n     former Vice President, Ambassador Mondale, for taking a \n     leadership role in trying to bring about campaign reform.\n       I hope the current Congress will enact Campaign Reform \n     legislation.\n       We must encourage the broadest possible participation by \n     individuals in financing elections. Whatever reform is \n     enacted should go the extra mile in demanding fullest \n     possible disclosure of all campaign contributions.\n       I would favor getting rid of so called ``soft money'' \n     contributions but this principle should be applied to all \n     groups including Labor.\n       I congratulate you for working for better campaign finance \n     law enforcement.\n       With my respects to you and Vice President Mondale I am, \n     sincerely,\n                                                      George Bush.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n                                                    July 17, 1997.\n     To Vice President Walter Mondale:\n       I am pleased to join former Presidents Bush and Ford in \n     expressing hope that this Congress will enact meaningful \n     campaign finance reform legislation. For the future of\n\n[[Page S10506]]\n\n     our democracy, and as our experience may be emulated by other \n     nations, prompt and fundamental repair of our system for \n     financing federal elections is required.\n       The most basic and immediate step should include an end to \n     ``soft money,'' whether in the form of corporate or union \n     treasury contributions to federal campaigns, or large and \n     unregulated contributions from individuals. The initial step \n     should also include measures that provide for complete and \n     immediate disclosures of political contributions and \n     expenses.\n       To accomplish these and other reforms and to lay the basis \n     for future ones, we also need to develop a strong national \n     consensus about the objectives of reform. It will take more \n     than just the action of this Congress, but fundamental reform \n     is essential to the task of repairing public trust in \n     government in our leaders. We must take significant steps to \n     assure voters that public policy is determined by the \n     exercise of their franchise rather than a broken and suspect \n     campaign finance system.\n       Please extend to Senator Nancy Kassebaum Baker my \n     appreciation for the work that she has undertaken with you to \n     advance the essential cause of bipartisan campaign finance \n     reform.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jimmy Carter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                                    July 10, 1997.\n       Dear Senator Kassebaum: Our system of financing federal \n     election campaigns is in serious trouble. To remedy these \n     failings requires prompt action by the President and the \n     House and Senate. I strongly hope the Congress in cooperation \n     with the White House will enact Campaign Reform legislation \n     by the forthcoming elections in 1998.\n       Public officials and concerned citizens. Republicans and \n     Democrats alike, have aleady identified important areas of \n     agreement. These include (1) the need to end huge \n     uncontrolled ``soft money'' contributions to the national \n     parties and their campaign committees, and to bar \n     solicitation of ``soft money'' from all persons, parties and \n     organized labor by federal officeholders and candidates for \n     any political organizations; (2) the need to provide rapid \n     and comprehensive discount of contributions and expenditures \n     in support of, or opposition to, candidates for federal \n     office; and (3) the need to repair the system of campaign \n     finance law enforcement by assuring that it is effective and \n     independent of politics.\n       A significant bi-partisan effort across party lines can \n     achieve a legislative consensus in campaign reforms that will \n     help to restore the confidence of our citizens in their \n     federal government.\n       I commend you and former Vice President Mondale for your \n     leadership on behalf of campaign reform.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gerald R. Ford.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to mention just a sentence \nfrom President Bush's letter, who I don't think is usually considered a \npawn of the liberal media. He says:\n\n       I would favor getting rid of so called ``soft money'' \n     contributions but this principle should be applied to all \n     groups including Labor.\n\n  Of course, our soft money ban in our bill is comprehensive and \nincludes labor.\n  A letter from President Carter also indicates as follows:\n\n       The most basic and immediate step should include an end to \n     ``soft money,'' whether in the form of corporate or union \n     treasury contributions to federal campaigns, or large and \n     unregulated contributions from individuals.\n\n  From President Carter.\n  President Ford indicated in a letter:\n\n       . . . the need to end huge uncontrolled ``soft money'' \n     contributions to the national parties and their campaign \n     committees, and to bar solicitation from ``soft money'' from \n     all persons, parties and organized labor by federal \n     officeholders and candidates for any political organizations \n     . . .\n  Mr. President, how can these three Presidents, two from the \nRepublican Party and one from the Democratic Party, be considered pawns \nof a solely Democratic effort to pass campaign finance reform? On its \nface it is absurd to suggest a bill led by the Senator from Arizona, a \nstrong Republican, is such a bill. But here are two Republican \nPresidents saying we should ban soft money. Yet, the effort to kill \nthis bill would prevent the core element of our bill to ban soft money.\n  Let me add, it is not just former Presidents, Mr. President, it is \nalso former Members of this body and of the other body. Former Members \nof Congress have endorsed our bipartisan campaign finance reform bill \nand the end of soft money.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a statement of former Members of \nCongress, dated September 29, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                Statement of Former Members of Congress\n\n       We are pleased to join former Presidents Bush, Carter and \n     Ford in expressing the hope that the current Congress enact \n     meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation.\n       The distinguished former Presidents have identified the \n     indispensable core of reform: (1) a ban on ``soft money'' \n     contributions to the national parties and their campaign \n     organizations, applied equally to contributions of corporate \n     and union treasury funds, as well as to large individual \n     contributions in excess of those permitted by law; (2) \n     complete and rapid disclosure of political contributions and \n     expenses; and (3) effective and politically independent \n     enforcement of campaign finance laws.\n       Some of us favor additional proposals, including provisions \n     to assure that a ban on ``soft money'' is not circumvented \n     through campaign advertisements that are thinly disguised as \n     ``issue advocacy.'' Together we believe it is time to test \n     the merits of different or competing ideas through debate and \n     votes, but that any disagreement over further reforms should \n     not delay enactment of essential measures, beginning with a \n     ban on soft money, where agreement is within reach.\n       Our democracy will be strengthened when the Congress acts \n     to assure the American public that the nation's campaign \n     finance system honors our nation's ideals.\n         Nancy Kassebaum Baker (R-KS), Howard H.

Mr. President, in that letter, a number of our former \ncolleagues from both Houses of the Congress state:\n\n       We are pleased to join former Presidents Bush, Carter and \n     Ford in expressing the hope that the current Congress enact \n     meaningful bipartisan campaign finance reform legislation.\n\n  This includes the names of people like the distinguished former \nMember Nancy Kassebaum Baker, former Senator from Kansas; Howard Baker, \nJr., former leader and Senator from Tennessee; former Republican \nSenator John Danforth of Missouri, who I had the honor to serve with \nbriefly; former Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon; former Senator Walter \nMondale and former Vice President; former Senator Bill Bradley from New \nJersey; former minority leader of the other body, Robert Michel; former \nU.S. Senator Sam Nunn; former Senator Al Simpson, the Senator from \nWyoming with whom I disagreed frequently on the floor of the Senate who \nwas among the toughest and most clever opponents you could have on the \nfloor, but he cosponsored the McCain-Feingold bill last session after \nhe made his retirement announcement, and he still supports it. And the \nlist goes on.\n  Mr. President, I do not think these folks are merely pawns of the \nmedia. These folks have been here; they have seen it; they have done \nit. And they know that spending a tremendous amount of your time in \nraising money is the corrupting of this process. And many of them, as \nthey announced their retirements, said they were sick and tired of \nspending their time as Members of Congress raising money. The\n\n[[Page S10507]]\n\nkilling of the bill, the vain attempt to kill this bill, as it turns \nout, would prevent the first efforts to get our attention away from \nraising money and back to the business we were elected to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan op-ed piece that appeared in the July 18, 1997, Washington Post \nauthored by former Republican Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Baker, and \nformer Vice President Walter Mondale calling for bipartisan campaign \nfinance reform and a ban on soft money.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 18, 1997]\n\n                        Campaign Finance: Fix It\n\n            (By Nancy Kassebaum Baker and Walter F. Mondale)\n\n       President Clinton has challenged Congress to ``make this \n     summer a time not of talk but of action'' in fixing our \n     broken system of campaign financing. We agree wholeheartedly.\n       Earlier this year the president asked the two of us, a \n     Republican and a Democrat, to assist in the cause of \n     bipartisan campaign finance reform. Although pessimism about \n     the will of Congress to reform campaign finance laws is \n     widespread, we are optimistic that the task can be achieved \n     through a clear focus on necessary and achievable reforms, \n     leadership and determination.\n       Last month, we submitted an Open Letter to the President \n     and Congress recommending four areas in which to begin, \n     without delay, the task of ensuring that our nation's \n     campaign finance system serves, rather than undermines, the \n     interests of American democracy.\n       First, Congress should promptly ban ``soft money,'' the \n     huge uncontrolled contributions to national parties and their \n     campaign organizations that have so dismayed the public. This \n     prohibition would do much to slow the flood of campaign money \n     and enable the nation to adhere to the justified premise of \n     earlier reforms, that massive amounts of money from powerful \n     sources distort elections and government.\n       Second, we must ensure that ``soft money'' not continue its \n     corrosive work under the this disguise of ``issue advocacy.'' \n     The election law should be tightened to distinguish clearly \n     between media advertisements that are campaign endorsements \n     or attacks and those that genuinely debate issues. to make a \n     ``soft money'' ban fully meangingful the election law should \n     establish consistent rules for the financing of all \n     electioneering advertisements.\n       Third, disclosure rules should be broadened to ensure that \n     voters know who is responsible for the accuracy and fairness \n     of campaign advertisements. Increasingly, candidates are \n     bystanders in their own campaigns, not knowing the identity \n     of sponsors of messages that dominate the airwaves close to \n     elections. Also, with today's technology, even last-minute \n     contributions and expenditures can be revealed before \n     Election Day.\n       Fourth, no reform will be worth much without effective \n     enforcement. The Federal Election Commission must be \n     strengthened. This should include the appointment of \n     knowledgeable and independent-minded commissioners. \n     Additionally, changes are needed to allow for the full and \n     timely resolution of issues through the courts when the \n     commission is deadlocked or cannot act because of lack of \n     funds.\n       Significant majorities might be found for other reforms. As \n     the debate goes forward, Congress should be encouraged to \n     consider further steps to provide relief from the incessant \n     treadmill of fund-raising. However, we should not delay \n     action on those measures that can pass now.\n       Time is of the essence. Congressional elections are coming \n     up next year. The presidential campaign for the year 2000 \n     will begin soon after. Each day these elections draw closer, \n     the passage of reform becomes even more difficult. Now is the \n     best time to advance legislation that will provide the \n     American people with a more effective and more equitable \n     election process.\n       It is no secret that the Senate will be the first \n     battleground for reform. There are honest differences that \n     warrant debate there but also votes on their merits. We are \n     confident that the Senate's leadership will recognize its \n     responsibility to schedule campaign finance reform for early \n     and full debate. And speaking plainly, we further believe \n     that the American public will deem unacceptable any tactic \n     that prevents a majority of the Senate from coming to a final \n     vote.\n       We appreciate the value of Senate rules on debate. But \n     campaign finance issues are well known to every member. \n     Whatever any senator's individual views on campaign finance \n     issues may be, all senators should unite in one conviction. \n     The future of our democracy requires them to address their \n     differences in public debate on the Senate floor and for \n     their votes on final passage to be recorded.\n       Most important is to set aside attempts to gain or maintain \n     partisan advantage. The time is now to come together to \n     address the integrity of our national government. Restoring \n     that integrity demands honest, bipartisan campaign finance \n     reform.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record an opinion piece from last Sunday's Washington \nPost coauthored by former Presidents Carter and Ford, who actually ran \nagainst each other in 1976, calling for campaign finance reform and the \nend of the soft money system.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 5, 1997]\n\n                      And the Power of the Ballot\n\n                   (By Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford)\n\n       When we ran against each other in 1976, the modern campaign \n     finance system was in its infancy; it was the first \n     presidential election governed by strict limits and public \n     financing. Looking back, it is easy to recognize why the \n     reforms of the 1970s were so essential. Today it is \n     disheartening to witness changes that have distorted those \n     reforms and shaken Americans' faith in their democracy.\n       We have watched as elections have grown more controversial, \n     more expensive, riddled with soft money and less \n     understandable to the average voter. We have watched as \n     participation in presidential elections has declined--\n     plummeting during the last election to the lowest levels \n     since 1924.\n       Less than half of the voting-age population cast their \n     ballots for president in 1996, and while there are many \n     factors that might contribute to this disturbing figure, we \n     believe that a lack of public trust in government and in our \n     system of democratic elections is a major part of the \n     problem. When people feel disenfranchised from their \n     political system, they stop participating in it. And when \n     that happens, democracy suffers.\n       We have both worked in our public lives toward the goal of \n     exporting our democratic system to other nations. Our model \n     (or ``the U.S. model'') must be fundamentally reformed in \n     terms of campaign financing to warrant the faith of other \n     countries.\n       We can both personally attest that there is no greater \n     honor than to serve your country. Yet the honor of public \n     service is being tarnished by a system of campaign funding \n     that has made many Americans lose faith in the concept of \n     public service as a virtue. That service is diminished when \n     elected officials are forced to spend so much time raising \n     money instead of focusing on the many important issues they \n     were elected to address.\n       We firmly believe that now is the time to restore \n     Americans' faith in their democracy, their government and \n     their democratically elected institutions. Meaningful, \n     bipartisan campaign finance reform is needed to rein in a \n     system that is out of control.\n       As a minimal first step, Congress and the president should \n     approve legislation that bans soft money, enhances \n     enforcement of existing campaign finance laws and creates a \n     more accountable disclosure system that informs rather \n     than obfuscates. These are the areas identified by former \n     vice president Walter Mondale and former senator Nancy \n     Kassebaum Baker in their effort to promote reform. It is \n     particularly important to seize this opportunity for \n     reform now so it can improve the next presidential \n     election.\n       In order to accomplish this goal, both parties must lay \n     down their partisanship and rise to meet this challenge \n     together. Leaders of both parties have demonstrated their \n     ability to work together on critical and contentious issues \n     to do what is right for the country. This is another such \n     issue where cooperation is the only road to results. It is \n     impossible to expect one side to disarm unilaterally in this \n     massive arms race for funds. Rather, both sides must agree \n     that bilateral limits are the only rational course of action \n     to preserve the moral integrity of our electoral system.\n       One item that we should all agree on is a ban of so-called \n     ``soft money'' for national parties and their campaign \n     committees. Soft money was initially intended exclusively for \n     ``party building'' activities but has metamorphosed into a \n     huge supplemental source of cash for campaigns and \n     candidates. It is one of the most corrupting influences in \n     modern elections because there is no limit on the size of \n     donations--thus giving disproportionate influence to those \n     with the deepest pockets.\n       According to the Federal Elections Commission, both parties \n     raised a record-breaking $262 million in soft money during \n     the 1996 elections. Recent news reports showed that figure \n     will be shattered again in 2000 if current fund-raising rates \n     continue.\n       These figures make it absolutely clear what is at stake. If \n     Congress does not act now to stem this massive flow of soft \n     money, Americans' cynicism and mistrust of government will \n     only increase. And that step is only the beginning of needed \n     fundamental reform.\n       We must demonstrate that a government of the people, by the \n     people and for the people is not a thing of the past. We must \n     redouble our efforts to assure voters that public policy is \n     determined by the checks on their ballots rather than the \n     checks from powerful interests.\n       Jimmy Carter was president from 1977 to 1981. Gerald Ford \n     was president from 1974 to 1977.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to place in the Record as \nwell a couple of items from groups across the country that I think have \nindependent judgment, who are not easily fooled by a media campaign in\n\n[[Page S10508]]\n\nfavor of a bill that would otherwise not have merit. The suggestion \nthat this is all that is going on here is on its face absurd, it is \neven a little insulting.\n  But I do not think you can say of the National Council of the \nChurches of Christ that they were somehow tricked into supporting \nsomething that isn't really reform. So I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a statement by the National Council of the \nChurches of Christ endorsing comprehensive campaign finance reform \nwhich includes, Mr. President, specific references to a number of the \nprovisions in the McCain-Feingold bill and specifically references the \nMcCain-Feingold bill asking ``legislators to oppose amendments \ncurrently being offered to the McCain-Feingold measure in an effort to \nkill its passage.'' I think it is an unmistakable reference to the Lott \namendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record, and a \nstatement by NETWORK, a national Catholic social justice group. The \npress release endorses the McCain-Feingold reform proposal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           National Council of the\n\n\n                                Churches of Christ in the USA,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 4, 1997.\n       The National Council of Churches joins with others today to \n     urge legislators to break the logjam which has blocked \n     campaign finance reform efforts for so long and to pass a \n     meaningful bipartisan reform bill. Our long-standing \n     commitment to campaign finance reform grows directly from \n     profound religious faith: every human being is a person of \n     dignity and worth as a child of God. In our democracy a \n     signal of that dignity and worth is a fair and just electoral \n     process where all people are included equitably and with \n     respect.\n       What a moral affront to buy or sell either the public trust \n     or the individual vote! In our policy statements we have long \n     held that unfair campaign financing violates the moral \n     integrity of public life.\n       Our support for current campaign finance reform comes from \n     seeing it as an important step in moral correction. Of \n     course, even the proposed legislation is not perfect. \n     Inequities will still need attention. But we believe that \n     such reform can strengthen the control of corrupting \n     processes that attack the very heart of democratic elections. \n     The undue influence of money diminishes the voting power of \n     ordinary citizens.\n       Further, we are very concerned about widespread \n     disillusionment with public life, and especially political \n     life. Religion means for us God's mandate for the well-being \n     of all people. We have long sought ``the common good''. We \n     have long stood against religious self-seeking or the private \n     advantage of any religious group. It is not our ``good'' we \n     seek; it is the ``common good''. Disillusionment and cynicism \n     over politics and electoral processes must be addressed. We \n     believe that campaign finance reform can be a step toward \n     building ``the common good.''\n       Let me add one more piece to our public endorsement of \n     campaign finance reform. In Protestant Christian heritage we \n     have long affirmed what we call ``Christian vocation''. Many \n     elected public officials see their works as a public trust, \n     and go about it with a genuine sense of religious \n     commitment--a ``vocation''. They serve God by serving the \n     well-being of all people. When public officials are consumed \n     by constant fund raising, they cannot adequately invest \n     themselves in fulfilling the public leadership role with \n     which they have been entrusted. Our current campaign \n     financing practices inflict frantic demands and exhausting \n     requirements on political leaders. Every sensitivity to them \n     has to insist on reform.\n       So here we are--I on behalf of the National Council of \n     Churches--to urge support for effective campaign finance \n     reform. We call for prompt consideration and passage of such \n     a reform bill, and urge legislators to oppose amendments \n     currently being offered to the McCain-Feingold measure in an \n     effort to kill its passage. It is rooted in our religious \n     tradition of public morality and the pursuit of the common \n     good. We call on people in churches and other religious \n     communities across the land to support leaders in the \n     Administration and the Members of Congress who have the \n     wisdom and courage to enact genuine reform.\n                                   Rev. Dr. Albert M. Pennybacker,\n     Associate General Secretary, NCCC.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n  Catholic Lobby Demands Congress Move on Campaign Finance Reform Now\n\n       NETWORK, a National Catholic Social Justice Lobby supports \n     campaign finance reform that promotes greater participation \n     in the election process for all and believes comprehensive \n     reform must include a public financing component as well as \n     spending limits. NETWORK is very disappointed and concerned \n     about the lack of commitment by Members of Congress for real \n     campaign finance reform and demands that Congress top its \n     political maneuvering and bring campaign finance reform up \n     for debate and a vote. ``To not deal with campaign finance \n     reform would be an affront to the voice of the people of our \n     country. Project Independence is a clear example of the \n     desire people have for real campaign finance reform'' \n     declares Kathy Thornton, RSM, NETWORK's National Coordinator.\n       NETWORK sees the stripped down version of the McCain (R-\n     AZ)--Feingold (D-WI) campaign finance reform bill S. 25 as a \n     positive incremental step, not as the final answer to \n     reforming the campaign finance system. Therefore, NETWORK \n     does support S. 25, but opposes Senator Lott's amendment \n     because it sees it as a poison pill that is designed to kill \n     meaningful campaign finance reform.\n       NETWORK, a National Catholic Social Lobby is a membership \n     organization which lobbies, educates and organizes on the \n     federal level from a faith-based perspective promoting \n     economic justice for people who are poor and marginalized.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that statements \nby Jerome Kohlberg, founder of the Campaign Reform Project, Thomas S. \nMurphy, and Richard Rosenberg, and a list of two dozen former and \ncurrent corporate chief executive officers who have endorsed \nbipartisan, comprehensive campaign finance reform be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                     CRP Business Advisory Council\n\n         (By Jerome Kohlberg, Founder, Campaign Reform Project)\n\n       Thank you for joining us this morning, My name is Jerome \n     Kohlberg. I founded the Campaign Reform Project (and its \n     sister organization Campaign for America) for one purpose--to \n     end the influence of money in politics.\n       Some of you may be more familiar with my past activities in \n     the business world. Perhaps you are curious why a successful \n     businessman is getting involved in this ugly debate. And \n     what's more, why he is persuading other business leaders to \n     follow suit.\n       Personally, I was never a major political donor. It was not \n     until 1988 when Michael Dukakis ran for President that I \n     began to make substantial political contributions. He was a \n     fellow graduate of Swathmore, and I though he was an \n     honorable man who would make a good President. During that \n     race, I contributed $100,000 in soft money to the Democratic \n     Party.\n       I continued to support the party through 1992, but became \n     increasingly uncomfortable with the process. Although I \n     wasn't looking for access, I was given the opportunity many \n     times. I could only imagine what someone who was looking for \n     access might get for his or her money. When decisions from \n     the routine to the profound are shaped by who gave money and \n     how much, who didn't and why, and who might in return for \n     what, we have a problem. Clearly, money is undermining, \n     rather than supporting democracy.\n       Therefore, while I continue to have a great deal of respect \n     for those individuals who choose public service, and I \n     continue to support individual candidates from both parties, \n     I no longer give soft money.\n       I, and my colleagues on the Business Advisory Council of \n     the Campaign Reform Project, believe these large money \n     contributions distort the system giving unequal weight to the \n     opinions of the rich, the corporations and the labor unions.\n       Our children and grandchildren deserve a better legacy--a \n     legacy of a responsive and responsible federal government. \n     Therefore, rather than just cease making donations, I want to \n     insure that the campaign finance system is reformed for my \n     grandchildren and, ultimately, for the country. Therefore, I \n     am committing substantial personal resources to this effort \n     because the stakes are too high not to.\n       I have dedicated funds to both the Campaign Reform Project \n     and the Campaign for America. Both organizations are \n     committed to fundamental campaign finance reform. The \n     Campaign for America joined with Common Cause in Project \n     Independence to collect the signatures of over one million \n     citizens who support campaign finance reform.\n       With the Campaign Reform Project, we've worked to organize \n     business leaders in support of this issue. Many of our \n     members are elder statesmen from the business community. The \n     presence here today of Mr. Murphy and Mr. Rosenberg \n     illustrates the deep concern they have with this system.\n       Any many other individuals. Warren Buffett, Alan \n     Hassenfeld, and Arjay Miller, to name just a few, have joined \n     with us in this fight for reform.\n       I call it a fight because I know it would be one. While a \n     very sensible and modest proposal toward reform has been \n     offered in the Senate, I fear that there are many who would \n     prefer the status quo.\n       All of us sitting around this table understand the process \n     for making a deal. We've been deal-makers. We know that \n     closing a deal on campaign finance reform isn't going to be \n     easy. But, we do believe it is possible. The proposal that is \n     pending now before the Senate is a reasonable one. It seems \n     to us that it's a package everyone should support. However, \n     we suspect there are those who may try adding amendments that \n     are likely to make it unreasonable--in other words, kill the \n     deal. We believe that is unacceptable.\n       Democracy is serious business. Campaign finance reform will \n     help restore some public confidence in our democratic system \n     of campaigns and elections. We are here today to\n\n[[Page S10509]]\n\n     say the system must be changed. I have been pleased that so \n     many business leaders have been willing to put their name to \n     the call for reform as is evidenced by the ad we will run \n     tomorrow. We will continue, over the next weeks, to further \n     galvanize the business community in support of reform. Thank \n     you.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     CRP Business Advisory Council\n\n(By Thomas S. Murphy, Retired-Chairman & CEO, Capital Cities/ABC, Inc.)\n\n       It is a pleasure to be here and join Jerry in this \n     important endeavor. As members of the Campaign Reform \n     Project's Business Advisory Council evaluated the prospects \n     for reform this year, it became clear that doing something to \n     curtail the explosion of soft money needed to be a top \n     priority.\n       All of the improprieties being examined in the Senate \n     Government Affairs Committee are related to soft money. It is \n     a system that has gone out of control.\n       As you know, in the 1996 election cycle, the parties raised \n     over $260 million in soft money--more than three times the \n     $87 million raised in the 1992 election cycle. What's more, \n     although a Los Angeles Times survey released earlier this \n     week indicated that 26 percent of the nations largest 544 \n     corporations made no political contributions, this percentage \n     was even higher four years ago. Unfortuantely, more and more \n     business leaders feel in order to come out on top, they must \n     play the soft money game.\n       Therefore, a soft money ban would go a long way toward \n     fixing the most egregious problem. But, it is not enough. It \n     is also necessary to improve the system of reporting \n     contributions. Electronic disclosure would be one step, \n     expanding reporting requirements for independent expenditure \n     campaigns might be another. An FEC with teeth would also be a \n     major improvement.\n       Our group, the Business Advisory Council, has worked to \n     solicit the support from several of our colleagues for this \n     effort.\n       We began at the beginning of the year with only a few of \n     us. As you can see from the ad, however, the number of \n     business leaders calling for reform in 1997 has grown \n     substantially.\n       And this list is a work in progress. Many others, as \n     evidenced by the survey I cited earlier, support these modest \n     reforms which will help restore public confidence in the \n     political process.\n       We're not naive. We're pragmatic. We believe that Congress \n     can no longer avoid taking action.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                     CRP Business Advisory Council\n\n     (By Richard Rosenberg, Former Chairman & CEO, Bank of America)\n\n       When I first became involved with the Campaign Reform \n     Project it was around a broad set of principles--reducing \n     special interest money in political campaigns, strengthening \n     financial disclosure requirements, leveling the playing field \n     between challengers and incumbents, increasing access to \n     electronic media, and curtailing the cost of campaigns.\n       When members of the Business Advisory Council met this past \n     spring and summer, we affirmed our support for these \n     principles, but we also focused on what we could accomplish \n     now.\n       As business executives, we know the value of both short and \n     long term results. We recognize that business has a critical \n     role to play in reforming the current campaign finance \n     system. Nothing would revive reform faster than corporate \n     America halting its soft money contributions. Many business \n     leaders already feel the system has become an industry unto \n     itself, caught up in a perpetual cycle that undermines both \n     democracy and genuine business interests.\n       So what could we do in the short term? We decided to \n     educate other business leaders and recruit them to join us. \n     We also evaluated the prospects for reform and decided that \n     something had to be enacted this year. We came to a consensus \n     that any reform must include, at a minimum: a ban on soft \n     money and stronger financial disclosure requirements and \n     reporting rules.\n       Changes in both of these areas would constitute significant \n     first steps. But, I must stress, only first steps. Our long-\n     term agenda focuses on the principles I outlined earlier. I \n     think they are important enough to mention again--leveling \n     the playing field between challengers and incumbents, \n     increasing access to electronic media in order to facilitate \n     more direct communication from candidates, and curtailing the \n     overall cost of campaigns.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                       Business Advisory Council\n\n       Jerome Kolberg, Founder.\n       Robert L.

Mr. President, this one makes an interesting point, \nthat is, that in addition to the various church and other religious \ngroups, in addition to former Presidents, in addition to former Members \nof Congress, in addition to the hundreds of editorials by liberal \npapers, conservative papers, moderate newspapers all across the country \nthat have supported McCain-Feingold and believe it has merit, that what \nwe have discovered, Senator McCain and I, the Senator from Arizona and \nI have discovered, is that there are a whole lot of businesspeople that \nare tired of being the fall guys of this system.\n  Under the system, even with hard money, let alone soft money, where \nthey can be asked for hundreds of thousands of dollars, a lot of these \nCEO's feel like they have become the fall guys of American politics.\n  I actually had the CEO of one of these companies, the Federal Express \nCo., come to visit me after last year's episode, where they were able \nto insert a provision into the Federal aviation bill that allowed them \nto not have a national union even though, as we very well know, their \ncompetitor, the United Parcel Service does have a national union, which \nthey had to contend with recently, but they were able to place a \nprovision in that bill, even though they had not won a vote on any \noccasion on the particular issue, shortly after they gave each of the \ntwo parties--I want to check my notes on this--but I believe they gave \nthem each $100,000 of soft money just a few days--just a few days--\nbefore this provision was inserted into the bill.\n  When I met with the CEO, who is a tremendous entrepreneur in this \ncountry, he said he has no choice, in effect, that if this is the way \nthe rules are set up, he has to represent his employees and his \nshareholders and he has to fight and make political contributions, and \nhe has to play hardball in effect. He did. He won.\n  You know what? During that UPS strike, Federal Express, which has \nthat protection against such national union advocacy, Federal Express \npicked up something like 10 to 15 percent of UPS's market share, \nsomething they had been trying to do forever.\n  My point in introducing this item from the business leaders is to \nsuggest that even the business leaders, who many might associate with \nthe other side of the aisle in many cases, are saying, we are sick and \ntired of being the fall guys of a system that essentially has the \npotential to shake them down, otherwise, they are afraid their \ncompetitor might get an edge.\n  It is almost exactly what Mr. Tamraz said when he indicated by paying \n$300,000 he got the room the other people got that paid $300,000. That \nis access, and that is how you get in the room, and that is in effect \nthe American way. That seemed to be what he was saying. It is pretty \nsad that has become the American way.\n  Even some of the corporate leaders of this country do not want this \nto become what it has become, which is in effect a corporate democracy, \na democracy dominated by big money, not by the average citizen's right \nto have their vote count the same as others.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a statement by Jay Lintner of the United Church of Christ \ncalling for comprehensive campaign finance reform, and a statement from \nthe Church Women United endorsing the McCain-\n\n[[Page S10510]]\n\nFeingold proposal, and a statement by the Religious Action Center of \nReform Judaism in support of comprehensive campaign finance reform.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Office for Church in Society\n\n\n                                      United Church of Christ,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1997.\n\n                 Press Statement--The Rev. Jay Lintner\n\n       Do we have a democracy or a dollarocracy? Do politicians \n     represent people or money?\n       Our mythology is democracy. The reality, made very apparent \n     in the elections last Fall, is that politicians are bought \n     and sold in the open market. All efforts at reform have \n     collapsed, and the Senate prepares to filibuster and confuse \n     the issue.\n       Every other country in the world knows that money rules. \n     Are we the last naive country on earth? Or are we the first \n     country whose guiding ideology may lead us into a new \n     reality? Is the Holy Spirit at work, empowering people to \n     turn the political order upside down?\n       I'm speaking today on behalf of 18 major denominations and \n     faith groups--AME, Methodist, Episcopal, United Church of \n     Christ, Union of American Hebrew Congregations. We are here \n     to say that campaign finance reform is not just some \n     political, partisan issue. It is a moral issue.\n       The prophet Isaiah said it well: ``Your princes are rebels \n     and companions of thieves. Everyone loves a bride and runs \n     after gifts. They do not defend the orphan and the widow's \n     cause does not come before them'' (Isaiah 1:23).\n       The front page today says that the Capitol Hill princes put \n     129 pork barrel projects in the recent military construction \n     bill, more money given away in one bill than all the campaign \n     contributions that bought the politicians. Is there some bill \n     here where they've sneaked some money for the widows and \n     orphans?\n       Can we get moral corruption out of the political process? \n     Politicians count on public apathy, public cynicism, public \n     awareness that this is the way rulers always rule.\n       This is more than a moral problem. This is a spiritual \n     problem. Have we given up faith in government, in our common \n     community shaping a moral order? No. We sent out 100,000 \n     packets of petitions to our churches and synagogues, and now \n     our petitions are laid at the feet of the capitol.\n       We will not go away. The gates of hell will not prevail and \n     the gates of Washington will not prevail. We demand a ban on \n     soft money, and we demand much more comprehensive reform that \n     breaks the power of big money buying our electoral process. \n     We want our politicians back, accountable to we the people, \n     not we the dollars.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n      Church Women United Supports Campaign Finance Reform Efforts\n\n       Washington, DC, October 6, 1997.--Church Women United (CWU) \n     stands in solidarity today with all citizens concerned over \n     the integrity of our democratic system. In particular, we \n     support the efforts of Senators McCain, Feingold and Thompson \n     and Representatives Shays and Meehan to reform the current \n     system of raising and spending private money to finance \n     election campaigns.\n       Church Women United is a 55-year-old, ecumenical movement \n     of Christian women from Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox \n     traditions. Since our beginnings, we have worked for a just \n     and peaceful world, with a special concern for women and \n     children. In 1986, CWU adopted a policy in support of \n     campaign finance reform which calls for tougher restrictions \n     on special-interest PACs and spending limits for \n     congressional candidates.\n       CWU is aware of the increasing role special interest money \n     plays in influencing politicians and policy. Members of \n     Congress are rapidly losing their ability to represent the \n     interest of the common good in favor of a more narrow, \n     wealthy constituency. As such, we view campaign finance \n     reform as one of the major challenges in ensuring that the \n     needs of poor women and children are taken seriously in the \n     formation and implementation of public policy. Until \n     politicians are freed from the pressures of monied interests, \n     it will remain difficult to have the needs of those without \n     means heard.\n       The McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill is a first \n     step at recognizing and correcting the imbalance of power in \n     our political system. We applaud all members of the House and \n     Senate who are co-sponsoring the bill. We encourage others \n     who currently are not supportive to join in these efforts to \n     help make the electoral process more representative of the \n     interests of all U.S. citizens.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n Statement of Mark Pelavin--Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, \n                            October 6, 1997\n\n       On behalf of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and \n     the Central Conference of American Rabbis, their 860 \n     congregations and 1,800 rabbis, and the 1.5 million Reform \n     Jews throughout the United States and Canada, I am proud to \n     be here today to add our voice to those calling, urgently, \n     for serious campaign finance reform.\n       Our call for comprehensive campaign finance reform is \n     reflective of the views of many mainstream religious \n     communities. From the pews and pulpits of our churches and \n     synagogues across the nation, we hear that campaign finance \n     reform is not an esoteric technical issue of election \n     regulations, but one that goes to the essence of the ethical \n     and moral life of our nation. We hear people asking:\n       How can we expect just results from an unjust system, one \n     in which monied interests hold every advantage, and those who \n     most need the helping hand of government--the poor, our \n     children--cannot make their voices heard above the din?\n       How can we--whose religious calling includes the imperative \n     to speak for the widow and the orphan, for the poor and the \n     children--accept an electoral process which structurally and \n     systematically favors the richest among us?\n       How can we acquiesce in a system which forces those who \n     seek public office, or who wish to continue in public \n     service, to spend so much of their precious time and energy \n     not raising the nation's moral conscience but raising \n     campaign funds?\n       If we are serious about seeking justice, and we are, then \n     we cannot, and we will not, accept such a system.\n       We stand at the brink of a historic opportunity. Real \n     reform is within reach. But first, the Senate must prove that \n     it is committed to ending the status quo. The Lott Amendment, \n     which the Senate will consider tomorrow, was designed as a \n     distraction, crafted to protect politics as usual. (And \n     how ironic, and revealing, that in attempting to derail \n     vital legislation to open up our political system, Senator \n     Lott and his supporters' first thought is to undermine the \n     political voice of America's working men and women!)\n       We call on our elected leaders to reject the Lott Amendment \n     and to work toward the creation of a more ethical campaign \n     financing system, a system which will reinforce rather than \n     tarnish the principles of American democracy, a system which \n     can help salvage our collective faith in public service. We \n     pledge our vigorous support in this historic effort.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, at this point these are all the items I \nwant to place in the Record at this time. But fortunately this debate \nwill continue in one form or another. We will have an important cloture \nvote shortly on the overall bill.\n  Tomorrow, there will be two more cloture votes. And it will continue \nbecause it is absolutely essential that we do not disgrace ourselves by \ngoing home, certainly for the 1998 elections, and even more importantly \njust going home at the end of this session having displayed to the \nAmerican people all the abuses of the current system, the areas where \nthe law is insufficient, the areas where there are loopholes in the \nlaw, and then to return home and say to everyone, ``You know what? We \ndidn't do anything about it. We didn't pass a single piece of \nlegislation.''\n  I don't think any of us on either side of the aisle consider that to \nbe an acceptable outcome.\n  I would like finally to say again to the Chair, I look forward to \nworking to negotiate the kind of legislation that he can support. And I \nagain thank him for his vote yesterday.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Parliamentary inquiry, in a quorum call is the time \nequally charged to both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is charged to the side which puts in \nthe quorum call, unless consent is granted to divide that equally.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that four \nletters from the American Civil Liberties Union, outlining the \nconstitutional infirmities of the McCain-Feingold bill, be printed in \nthe Record. I understand that the Government Printing Office estimates \nthe cost of printing these articles in the Record to be approximately \n$2,500.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 1, 1997.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: Ever since the very first version \n     of the various McCain-Feingold campaign finance bills were \n     introduced in the Senate, the ACLU has gone on record to \n     assert that each version was fatally and fundamentally flawed \n     when measured against settled First Amendment principles. Now \n     the Senate is debating a new ``revised'' incarnation of the \n     bill. While we are\n\n[[Page S10511]]\n\n     pleased that the sponsors of the new version have abandoned \n     some of the more egregious provisions that appeared in \n     earlier versions, the ``pared down'' bill still cuts to the \n     core of the First Amendment. We once again urge you to reject \n     McCain-Feingold's unconstitutional and unprecedented assaults \n     on freedom of speech and association.\n       Although the bill has a number of constitutional flaws, \n     this letter focuses on those that impose restrictions \n     primarily on issue advocacy. It is important to note at the \n     outset that the recent letter from 126 law professors, \n     commenting on McCain-Feingold, was silent on the issue \n     advocacy restrictions in the bill, which are the subject of \n     this letter.\n       1. The unprecedented restrictions on issue advocacy \n     contained in the McCain-Feingold bill are flatly \n     unconstitutional under settled First Amendment doctrine.\n       The Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo well understood the \n     risks that overly broad campaign finance regulations could \n     pose to electoral democracy because ``[discussion of public \n     issues and debate on the qualifications of candidates are \n     integral to the operation of the system of government \n     established by our Constitution.'' 424 U.S. at 14. The Court \n     recognized that ``the distinction between discussion of \n     issues and candidates and advocacy of election or defeat of \n     candidates may often dissolve in practical application. \n     Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to \n     public issues involving legislative proposals and \n     governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the \n     basis of their positions on various public issues, but \n     campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest.'' \n     424 U.S. at 43. If any discussion of a candidate in the \n     context of discussion of an issue rendered the speaker \n     subject to campaign finance controls, the consequences for \n     free discussion would be intolerable and speakers would be \n     compelled ``to hedge and trim,'' Id., quoting Thomas v. \n     Collins, 323 U.S. 516, 535 (1945).\n       Accordingly, the Court reasoned, under the First Amendment, \n     campaign finance controls had to be limited and could only \n     apply to ``communications that in express terms advocate the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.'' \n     Conversely, all speech which does not ``in express terms \n     advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified \n     candidate'' must be totally free from permissible controls. \n     ``So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they \n     want to promote the candidate and his views.'' 424 U.S. at \n     45. And they are free from reporting and disclosure \n     requirements as well.\n       The Court fashioned the express advocacy doctrine to \n     safeguard issue advocacy from campaign finance controls, even \n     though such discussion might influence the outcome of an \n     election. The doctrine provides a hard, bright-line, \n     objective test that protects political speech and association \n     by focusing solely on the content of the speaker's words, not \n     the motive in the speaker's mind or the impact of the \n     speaker's opinions, or the proximity to an election, or the \n     phase of the moon. The doctrine marks the boundary of \n     permissible regulation and frees issue advocacy from any \n     permissible restraint.\n       The Buckley Court could not have been more clear about the \n     need for that bright line test which focuses solely on the \n     speaker's words and which is now an integral part of settled \n     First Amendment doctrine. It was designed to protect issue \n     discussion and advocacy by allowing independent groups of \n     citizens to comment on and criticize the performance of \n     elected officials without becoming ensnared in the federal \n     campaign finance laws. And it permits issue discussion to go \n     forward at the time that it is most vital in a democracy: \n     during an election season.\n       The new version of the McCain-Feingold bill once again \n     would obliterate the bright line test of ``express advocacy'' \n     which the courts have fashioned over a period of 25 years to \n     protect the broad range of issue discussion in America from \n     campaign finance controls. Instead, the bill would impose \n     unprecedented controls on issue advocacy in clear violation \n     of settled First Amendment principles.\n       The new bill attacks issue advocacy on a number of fronts.\n       It abandons the bright-line test of express advocacy in \n     favor of a permanent year-round restriction on issue advocacy \n     redefined in an unconstitutionally vague, overbroad and \n     watered-down fashion.\n       It imposes, in effect, a two-month, 60 day blackout before \n     any federal election on any radio or television advertisement \n     on any issue if that communication ``mentions'' any candidate \n     for federal office.\n       It restrains any communication that expresses ``support for \n     or opposition to'' anyone who is a candidate for office.\n       These unprecedented restrictions would effectively silence \n     issue advocacy by the countless hundreds and thousands of \n     groups that add to the political debate in America.\n       These proposals would all undermine the purpose of the \n     ``express advocacy'' doctrine, which is to keep campaign \n     finance regulations from overwhelming all political and \n     public speech. They would do so by dramatically expanding the \n     statutory definition of express advocacy and thereby \n     impermissibly sweeping an enormous amount of protected issue \n     advocacy within the net of campaign finance regulations.\n       The current version of McCain-Feingold takes a ``new'' \n     approach to silencing issue advocacy, but it is no less \n     flawed than its predecessors. Once again, the clear purpose \n     and inevitable effect of the provisions in the revised \n     McCain-Feingold bill will be to shut down citizen criticism \n     of incumbent officeholders standing for re-election at the \n     very time when the public's attention is especially focused \n     on such issues.\n       Given the fact that the proposed restraints on issue \n     advocacy are targeted primarily at criticism of incumbent \n     legislators during an election season, the danger to the core \n     purposes of the First Amendment posed by such legislation is \n     clear and present.\n       2. The unprecedented and sweeping restraints on the ``soft \n     money'' funding of issue advocacy and political activity by \n     political parties raise severe First Amendment problems.\n       A central critical distinction has informed the Supreme \n     Court's campaign finance jurisprudence. Contributions and \n     expenditures made by federal candidates, or those who \n     expressly advocate their election or defeat, may be subject \n     to regulation. All other political and issue advocacy and \n     discussion--even though it might influence the outcome of an \n     election--may not be subject to governmental control. This \n     constitutional Continental Divide is compelled by the First \n     Amendment and is built upon the concept that only ``express \n     advocacy'' of the election or defeat of specific federal \n     candidates can be subject to regulation.\n       Accordingly, while candidate-focused contributions and \n     expenditures and ``express advocacy'' can be subject to \n     various restrictions or regulations, the Court in Buckley v. \n     Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) held that all speech which does not \n     ``in express terms advocate the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate'' is totally free of any \n     permissible regulation: ``So long as persons and groups \n     eschew expenditures that in express terms advocate the \n     election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they \n     are free to spend as much as they want to promote the \n     candidate and his views.'' 424 U.S. at 45 (emphasis \n     supplied). The purpose of this profound distinction is to \n     keep campaign finance regulations from overwhelming all \n     political and public speech. And it is this distinction \n     which defenders of the constitutionality of a ban on \n     ``soft money'' continue to disregard.\n       The same principles that protect unrestrained advocacy by \n     issue groups safeguard issue advocacy and activity by \n     political parties. ``Soft money'' is funding that does not \n     support ``express advocacy'' of the election or defeat of \n     federal candidates, even though it may exert an influence on \n     the outcome of federal elections in the broadest sense of \n     that term. It sustains primary political activity by parties \n     such as get-out-the-vote drives and issue advertising. \n     Because it is not used for express advocacy, it can be raised \n     from sources that would be restricted in making contributions \n     or expenditures. Compare Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990) with First National Bank of \n     Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978).\n       Indeed, the unrestricted use of soft money by political \n     parties and non-party organizations like labor unions has \n     been invited by Buckley (``So long as persons and groups \n     eschew . . .''), authorized by Congress (see 2 U.S.C. \n     sections 431 (8)(A)(I) and (B)(xii) which permit soft money \n     for state elections and voter registration and get out the \n     vote drives), sanctioned and enhanced by rulings of the \n     Federal Election Commission and acknowledged by the Supreme \n     Court last year in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \n     Committee v. Federal Election Commission, 116 S.Ct. 2309 \n     (1996), which upheld unlimited ``hard money'' independent \n     expenditures by political parties on behalf of their \n     candidates.\n       Most pertinently, the Colorado Republican Court reached \n     that conclusion despite arguments that unrestrained soft \n     money contributions were undermining the Act's limitations on \n     hard money party funding:\n       ``We recognize that FECA permits individuals to contribute \n     more money ($20,000) to a party than to a candidate ($1,000) \n     or to other political committees ($5,000). . . . We also \n     recognize that FECA permits unregulated ``soft money'' \n     contributions to a party for certain activities, such as \n     electing candidates for state office . . . or for voter \n     registration and ``get out the vote'' drives. . . . But the \n     opportunity for corruption posed by these greater \n     opportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated. \n     Unregulated ``soft money'' contributions may not be used to \n     influence a federal campaign, except when used in the limited \n     party-building activities specifically designated by \n     statute.'' Id. at 2316.\n       And the Court's suggestion that Congress ``might decide to \n     change the statute's limitations on contributions to \n     political parties''--which has been taken out of context by \n     defenders of McCain-Feingold's soft money ban--referred to \n     hard money donations.\n       Accordingly, we submit that McCain-Feingold's sweeping \n     controls on the amount and source of soft money contributions \n     to political parties and disclosure of soft money \n     disbursements by other organizations continue to raise severe \n     constitutional problems. Disclosure, rather than limitation, \n     of large soft money contributions to political parties, is \n     the more appropriate and less restrictive alternative.\n       McCain-Feingold's labyrinth of restrictions on party \n     funding and political activity can have no other effect but \n     to deter and discourage precisely the kind of political party \n     activity that the First Amendment was designed to protect.\n       The ACLU continues to believe that the most effective and \n     least constitutionally\n\n[[Page S10512]]\n\n     problematic route to genuine reform is a system of equitable \n     and adequate public financing. While reasonable people may \n     disagree about the proper approaches to campaign finance \n     reform, this bill's restraints on political party funding and \n     issue advocacy raise profound First Amendment problems and \n     should be opposed. The bill has a number of other severe \n     flaws, some old, some new, which we will address in a future \n     communication. But we wanted to take the opportunity to share \n     our assessment of two of the most salient problems with the \n     bill now.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ira Glasser,\n       Executive Director.\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director, Washington Office.\n     Joel Gora,\n       Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School, and Counsel to the \n     ACLU.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\nQuestions and Answers About Issue Advocacy (With Specific Reference to \n                   the Revised McCain-Feingold Bill)\n\n\n                       1. what is issue advocacy?\n\n       Issue advocacy can best be defined as any speech relating \n     to issues and the policy positions taken by candidates and \n     elected officials. It can be as simple as a statement like \n     ``Senator Doe's position on school vouchers is grievously \n     mistaken.'' Or it can be as involved as a multimillion dollar \n     campaign of broadcast and print advertisements that spreads \n     the same message. Any group or individual can engage in issue \n     advocacy.\n       Under current law, a message stops being considered ``issue \n     advocacy'' if it is accompanied by ``express advocacy'' or \n     actual statements advocating the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate for office, i.e. ``Senator Doe's \n     position on school vouchers is grievously mistaken and anyone \n     who cares about the separation of church and state should \n     vote against him in November.''\n       Although issue advocacy can leave the impression that a \n     listener should support or oppose a particular candidate, \n     such messages cannot--under current law--be treated (and \n     therefore regulated) as express advocacy by the Federal \n     Elections Commission.\n\n\n         2. Why is Congress trying to regulate issue advocacy?\n\n       During the 1996 elections, groups across the political \n     spectrum engaged in intense issue advocacy campaigns. Many \n     members of Congress felt they lost control of their campaigns \n     because of the unregulated and undisclosed advertising from \n     issue groups. Their concern that elections are ``out of \n     control'' seems to be the driving force in current efforts to \n     regulate issue advocacy.\n       Because of this loss of control, some federal lawmakers \n     seem to believe that candidates' interests should trump the \n     right of citizen involvement and speech. Also, many members \n     of Congress believe that issue advocacy became far too \n     political and powerful during the last election cycle. They \n     assert that these issue ads are really a subterfuge for \n     express advocacy communications. Many lawmakers and advocacy \n     groups think that all communications that could influence \n     the outcome of elections should be regulated by statute.\n\n\n   3. How will the revised McCain-Feingold legislation affect issue \n                               advocacy?\n\n       The legislation that the Senate will most likely vote on \n     during the next several days is a revised version of the \n     McCain-Feingold bill. The ACLU will soon be releasing an \n     analysis of the new legislation, but in the meantime, we \n     continue to assert that the issue advocacy provisions of the \n     revised bill are unconstitutional. Such unconstitutional \n     provisions include:\n       A permanent, year-round restriction on issue advocacy \n     achieved through redefining express advocacy in an \n     unconstitutionally vague and watered-down manner. The key to \n     the existing definition of express advocacy is the inclusion \n     of an explicit directive to vote for or vote against a \n     candidate. Minus the explicit directive or so-called ``bright \n     line test,'' what constitutes express advocacy will be in the \n     eye of the beholder, in this case the FEC. Few non-profit \n     issue groups will want to risk their tax status to engage in \n     speech that could be interpreted by the FEC to have an \n     influence on the outcome of an election.\n       A two-month black out on all television and radio issue \n     advertising before primary and general elections. The only \n     individuals and groups that will be able to characterize a \n     candidate's record on radio and television during this 60 day \n     period would be the candidates, PACs and the media. It seems \n     this ban would exclude issue advertising on cable, the \n     Internet, in print and in ads on movie screens.\n       A misleading ``exception'' for candidate voting records. \n     The voting records that would be permitted under this new \n     statute would be stripped of any advocacy-like commentary. \n     For example, depending on its wording, the ACLU (as a \n     501(c)(4) corporation) might be banned from distributing a \n     voting guide that highlighted members of Congress who have a \n     100 percent ACLU voting record as members of an ``ACLU Honor \n     Roll.'' Unless the ACLU chose to create a PAC to publish such \n     guides, we would be barred by this statute even though we do \n     not expressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate.\n       Redefining ``expenditure,'' ``contribution'' and \n     ``coordination with a candidate'' so that legal and \n     constitutionally protected activities of issue advocacy \n     groups would become illegal. If the ACLU decided to take out \n     an advertisement lauding--by name--Senators for their \n     effective advocacy of constitutional campaign finance reform, \n     this ad would be counted as express advocacy on behalf of the \n     named Senators and therefore prohibited.\n       The Senate is threatening to erect a Byzantine set of laws \n     that pose a formidable barrier to citizen speech. This \n     barrier to free speech and free participation in the \n     electoral process is like a barbed wire fence. No individual \n     or group should try to scale it unless they are willing to \n     become ensnared in a complicated set of laws that have \n     significant penalties.\n       These provisions of the new McCain-Feingold legislation \n     would silence citizen speech to give candidates more control \n     over what is said about them prior to an election and \n     throughout the election year. Similar bans and disclosure \n     requirements were contained in the original McCain-Feingold \n     bill.\n       In addition, many of the pending reform bills in the House \n     and Senate such as H.R. 2183, the Bipartisan Campaign \n     Integrity Act of 1997, H.R. 493, the Bipartisan Campaign \n     Reform Act (which has evolved into H.R. 1776 and 1777, the \n     Campaign Independence Restoration Act, Parts I and II) and \n     H.R. 600, American Political Reform Act, among others, would \n     ban or impose burdensome and unconstitutional disclosure on \n     issue speech.\n\n\n 4. what are the problems with Congressional attempts to rein in issue \n                               advocacy?\n\n       The proposals being considered in the House and Senate have \n     manifold constitutional and practical problems.\n\n                       A. Constitutional Concerns\n\n       All of the proposals violate the First Amendment. Attempts \n     to regulate and require disclosure of issue advocacy through \n     statute and through FEC regulation have repeatedly been \n     declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court and lower \n     federal courts. The Court has always viewed issue advocacy as \n     a form of speech that deserves the highest degree of \n     protection under the First Amendment. Not only has the Court \n     been supportive of issue advocacy, the justices have \n     affirmatively stated that they are untroubled by the fact \n     that issue advertisements may influence the outcome of an \n     election. In fact, in Buckley v. Valeo, the justices stated:\n       ``The distinction between discussion of issues and \n     candidates and advocacy of the election or defeat of \n     candidates may often dissolve in practical application \n     Candidates, especially incumbents, are often intimately tied \n     to public issues involving legislative proposals and \n     governmental actions. Not only do candidates campaign on the \n     basis of their positions on various public issues, but \n     campaigns themselves generate issues of public interest. \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976) at 42.''\n       Those of us who truly understand and defend the phenomenon \n     of issue advocacy freely acknowledge that the advertisements \n     and statements of issue groups do have political impact. In \n     fact, many groups hope that the voters will take candidate \n     positions and voting records into account when voters go to \n     the polls.\n       For example, groups like the ACLU want to continue to \n     discuss candidate positions on civil liberties issues before, \n     during and after elections, even though we are barred by our \n     own policies from endorsing or opposing particular candidates \n     for public office. Forbidding us to do so would make much of \n     our legislative advocacy irrelevant during large portions of \n     the year. Would we, for example, be permitted to criticize \n     Senator Doe for his position on vouchers after September 4?\n       The premise of the Federal Election Campaign Act and \n     current campaign reform proposals is that Congress can \n     control the quantity and qualify of all speech that \n     influences the outcome of elections in an attempt to make \n     elections ``fair.''\n       The Supreme Court has responded on repeated occasions to \n     this attempt to regulate political speech by invoking the \n     primacy of the First Amendment instead of deferring to the \n     concept of ``political speech equalization'' asserted by \n     Congress and FECA.\n       The only justification for any regulation of political \n     speech upheld by the Court has been to guard against the \n     reality or appearance of corruption. Although many have \n     criticized issue advocacy, few, if any, are asserting that it \n     fosters a quid pro quo form of corruption that the Court has \n     allowed Congress to guard against.\n       Defenders of the First Amendment know that the freedom to \n     engage in robust political debate in our democracy will be at \n     risk if the Congress or the FEC is given the authority to ban \n     issue ads close to an election, or evaluate the content of \n     issue ads to determine if they are really a form of express \n     advocacy. The Supreme Court recognized this danger long \n     before it decided Buckley. In an opinion issued in 1945 in \n     Thomas v. Collins, the Court stated:\n       ``. . . the supposedly clear-cut distinction between \n     discussion, laudation, general advocacy, and solicitation \n     puts the speaker in these circumstances wholly at the mercy \n     of the varied understanding of his hearers and consequently \n     of whatever inference may be drawn as to his intent and \n     meaning. Such a distinction offers no security for free \n     discussion. In these conditions it blankets with uncertainty \n     whatever may be said. It compels the speaker to hedge and \n     trim. Thomas v. Collins,'' 323 U.S. 516 (1945).\n       Given the Court's concern about the chilling effect \n     regulation has on speech, one\n\n[[Page S10513]]\n\n     can better appreciate the need for a clear-cut standard for \n     limiting the kinds of communications that can be regulated by \n     campaign finance laws. While some are disheartened that the \n     FEC only has clear authority to regulate communications that \n     include express advocacy terms like ``vote for'' and ``vote \n     against,'' ``elect Doe for Congress,'' etc., others are \n     relieved that the FEC is not free to regulate all \n     political speech.\n       It is noteworthy that none of these proposals seek to \n     regulate the ability of the media to exercise its enormous \n     license to editorialize in favor or against candidates. If \n     the sponsors of these proposals to regulate issue advocacy \n     have their way, the only entities that would be free to \n     comment on candidates' records would be the press, PACs and \n     the candidates themselves.\n       With no proven record of corruption, why are citizen groups \n     being ejected from political debate during the crucial period \n     before elections?\n\n                       B. Practical Implications\n\n       The proposed McCain-Feingold statutory limitations on issue \n     advocacy would force groups that now engage in issue \n     advocacy--501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4)--to create new \n     institutional entities--PACs--to ``legally'' speak within 60 \n     days before an election. The groups would also be forced to \n     disclose all contributors to the new PAC.\n       Opportunities that donors now have to anonymously \n     contribute to issue groups would be eliminated. Not all \n     members of non-profit organizations want to become members of \n     PACs. Separate accounting procedures, new legal costs and \n     separate administrative processes would be imposed on these \n     groups, merely so that their members could preserve their \n     First Amendment rights to comment on candidate records. It is \n     very likely that some groups will remain silent rather than \n     risk violating this new requirement or absorbing the \n     attendant cost of compliance.\n       This new provision may trigger Internal Revenue Service \n     review of the non-profit status of groups that elect to \n     create PACs. The IRS may justifiably examine the primary \n     purpose of the issue groups. Groups could face a loss of \n     members and tax deductible gifts for exercising their First \n     Amendment rights.\n       It is notable that the much ballyhooed Brennan Center \n     constitutional law professors letter recently released by \n     Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russ Feingold (D-WI) is \n     conspicuously silent on the advocacy restrictions contained \n     in the bill.\n\n\n   5. Has Congress previously enacted laws regulating issue advocacy?\n\n       Yes, in 1974 Congress enacted a similar issue advocacy \n     disclosure law that was struck down in federal court. The \n     Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 was amended in 1974 to \n     require the disclosure to the Federal Election Commission of \n     issue groups engaged in ``any act directed to the public for \n     the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election, or \n     publishes or broadcasts issues to the public any material \n     referring to a candidate (by name, description, or other \n     reference) . . . setting forth the candidates position on any \n     public issue, [the candidate's] voting record, or other \n     official acts . . . or is otherwise designed to influence \n     individuals to cast their votes for or against such a \n     candidate or to withhold their votes from such candidate.'' 2 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 437A.\n       Such groups would have been required to disclose to the FEC \n     in the same manner as a political committee or PAC. They \n     would have to make available every source of funds which were \n     used in accomplishing such acts.\n       This provision of the 1974 amendments was challenged by the \n     ACLU as part of the Buckley case. When the challenge came \n     before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit (prior to \n     coming before the Supreme Court), the provision was struck \n     down because it was vague and imposed an undue burden on \n     groups engaged in activity that is, and should be, protected \n     by the First Amendment. The D.C. Circuit Court ruling stated:\n       ``To be sure, any discussion of important public questions \n     can possibly exert some influence on the outcome of an \n     election preceding . . . But unlike contributions and \n     expenditures made solely with a view to influencing the \n     nomination or election of a candidate, issue discussions \n     unwedded to the cause of a particular candidate hardly \n     threaten the purity of the elections. Moreover, and very \n     importantly, such discussions are vital and indispensable to \n     a free society and an informed electorate. Thus, the interest \n     group engaging in nonpartisan discussions ascends to a high \n     plane, while the governmental interest in disclosure \n     correspondingly diminishes.''\n       It is noteworthy that the FEC did not appeal this aspect of \n     the Circuit Court's ruling.\n\n\n  6. Has the federal government and the Federal Elections Commission \n   tried to regulate issue advocacy in a way that would treat it as \n                           express advocacy?\n\n       It certainly has. In one early telling incident, three \n     elderly citizens with no connection to any candidate or \n     political party published an advertisement in early 1972 in \n     The New York Times that condemned the secret bombings of \n     Cambodia by the United States. The advertisement also called \n     for the impeachment of President Nixon and printed an honor \n     roll of those members of Congress who had opposed the \n     bombings. The honor roll included Senator George McGovern.\n       Although the ad was a classic example of speech protected \n     by the First Amendment, it violated a federal campaign \n     finance law, which effectively barred such expenditures on \n     the ground that they could influence the upcoming \n     presidential election by criticizing President Nixon and \n     applauding one of his possible opponents, Senator McGovern. \n     On the basis of this law, the U.S. government sued the three \n     in federal court, seeking to enjoin them from publishing such \n     ads, and wrote a letter to the Times threatening them with \n     criminal prosecution if they published such an ad again.\n       The ACLU represented the three citizens and won. But the \n     FEC has tried to regulate issue advocacy repeatedly since \n     then. As recently as October 5, 1995, and on March 13, 1996, \n     the FEC attempted to issue regulations severely \n     circumscribing the rights of issue advocacy groups to \n     communicate information on candidates.\n       In fact, the FEC has a terrible track record of trying to \n     broadly interpret current FECA statues to encompass issue \n     advocacy speech. While it is impossible to go into the facts \n     of every case, with the narrow exception of FEC v. Furgatch, \n     869 F.2d 1256 (9th Cir.

Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: On February 20, 1997, I wrote to \n     you on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union urging \n     our strong opposition to S. 25, the Bipartisan Campaign \n     Reform Act of 1997. In that letter, we set forth the reasons \n     why we believe that bill is ``fatally and fundamentally \n     flawed when measured against First Amendment values.''\n       Thereafter, a letter was sent to Senators John McCain and \n     Russell Feingold by the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU \n     School of Law. That letter asserted that the ACLU's analysis \n     of the constitutionality of S. 25 was based on arguments \n     which had been rejected in the Buckley case and would not \n     command majority support on the current court. Despite the \n     eminence of its author, however, the letter is incomplete and \n     incorrect in a number of key respects. We appreciate this \n     opportunity to demonstrate why and to respond to the charge \n     that we presented ``distorted descriptions of existing \n     constitutional law.''\n       Those provisions of S. 25 which seek to induce candidates \n     to adhere to spending limits in Senate campaigns and penalize \n     those who refuse, which severely restrict political action \n     committees and which likewise restrain contributions to \n     political parties are not justified by Buckley or later \n     cases. They will not survive strict scrutiny. The provisions \n     of the bill which assault independent political activity and \n     invade the absolutely protected sphere of issue speech are \n     precisely condemned by Buckley and its progeny and are all \n     but per se invalid. The entire sweep of the bill, including \n     the greatly expanded enforcement powers given to the Federal \n     Election Commission, is worse than the sum of its parts. It \n     is as objectionable an assault on political freedom as were \n     the provisions of the Federal Election Campaign Act at issue \n     in Buckley.\n       Preliminarily, we would note that our condemnation of three \n     of the most extreme provisions of the bill--the total and \n     complete ban on any political contributions by political \n     action committees (Section 201), the sweeping new public \n     disclosure requirements targeting people who give as little \n     as $50 (Section 304) or even $20 (Section 101) to a Senate \n     candidate, and the xenophobic ban on political contributions \n     by lawful resident aliens--went unremarked in the Brennan \n     Center letter. Nothing in Buckley would justify the \n     constitutionality of these provisions, and we would welcome \n     the Brennan Center's joining us in denouncing them.\n\n\n         I. S. 25: The Unconstitutional Offer You Can't Refuse\n\n       Replying to our assertion that ``S. 25's coercive and \n     punitive scheme designed to compel candidates to accept \n     spending limits in Senate elections and to penalize those who \n     refuse, violates First Amendment principles,'' the Brennan \n     Center asserts that this is an argument that the ACLU lost in \n     the Buckley case.\n       There are three reasons why this is not so and why Buckley \n     does not control the validity of these provisions of S. 25.\n       First, we didn't lose that argument in Buckley because we \n     never made it. The primary contention was that the \n     Presidential public funding scheme discriminated against \n     those candidates and parties whom it excluded, not that it \n     exacted unconstitutional conditions and limitations from \n     those whom\n\n[[Page S10514]]\n\n     it benefited, nor that it coerced compliance by penalizing \n     those who declined the offer.\n       Second, the Buckley Court did state that Congress could \n     condition acceptance of public funds on a candidate's \n     agreement to abide by specified spending limits, because a \n     candidate may decide voluntarily to forego private \n     fundraising and accept public funding. But a candidate or \n     party was free to reject that offer and choose to try to \n     raise and spend more money than the conditional limits would \n     permit, without regard to what opposing candidates or parties \n     did. The choice of one candidate did not affect the rights of \n     others. Whether that conditional funding scheme would survive \n     close scrutiny under the Court's unconstitutional conditions \n     doctrine is a substantial question.\n       But the scheme in S. 25 is not just a conditional funding \n     scheme which requires candidates to give up rights in order \n     to get benefits and which penalizes non-complying candidates \n     by denying them free television prime time, half-priced \n     purchased and discounted mass mailings rates. S. 25 is also a \n     contingent benefits scheme whereby the exercise of protected \n     campaign spending rights by a noncomplying candidate triggers \n     statutory fundraising benefits to his or her complying \n     opponent. Thus, if any noncomplying Senate candidate exceeds \n     the applicable spending limit by only 5% the complying \n     candidate's spending limit is raised tenfold by 50%. \n     Likewise, if a noncomplying candidate's expenditures exceed \n     155% of the limit, the complying candidate's ceiling is again \n     raised tenfold to 200%. And in both instances, the \n     contribution limits for the complying candidate, but not the \n     noncomplying one, are doubled from $1,000 to $2,000, making \n     it easier for the complying candidate to raise funds to \n     ``drown out'' the noncomplying candidate. Adding insult to \n     injury, noncomplying candidates are subject to more \n     burdensome disclosure requirements in order to enforce the \n     triggering mechanism that raises the spending limits and \n     contribution caps for their complying opponents.\n       Further, the law mandates that 60% of all contributions \n     must be raised in state in order to be eligible for the \n     benefits. Residency requirements can be the basis for who can \n     vote in an election but should not be the basis for who can \n     speak about an election. See McIntyre v. Ohio Board of \n     Elections, 517 U.S. (1995). Moreover, in-state limitations \n     could deprive particular kinds of underfinanced, insurgent \n     candidates of the kind of out-of-state support they need. \n     Just as much of the civil rights movement was fueled by \n     contributors and supporters from other parts of the nation, \n     so, too, are many new and struggling candidates supported by \n     interests beyond their home states. This proposal would \n     severely harm such candidacies. Perhaps that is its purpose.\n       In addition, Congress is our national legislature, and \n     although its representatives come and are elected from \n     separate districts and states, the issues that are debated \n     are, by definition, national issues that transcend district \n     and state lines and may be of concern to citizens all over \n     the nation. When such issues become central in certain \n     campaigns, people and groups from all over the country should \n     be entitled to have their views and voices heard on those \n     issues. Any other approach takes a disturbingly insular and \n     isolated view of political accountability and the obligations \n     of a Member of Congress.\n       The clear purpose and patent effect overall of this \n     conditional funding scheme is to chill and deter, dollar for \n     dollar, any candidate from trying to mount an effective high-\n     spending campaign. With this contingent limitation scheme, \n     incumbents, who will almost always opt for the public \n     funding, have arranged a way to have their cake and eat it \n     too. That scheme, which coerces candidates to accept the \n     limitations by penalizing them if they do not, is a far cry \n     from anything sustained in Buckley. It is an offer that few \n     can refuse.\n\n\n                      II. S. 25's Attacks on PACs\n\n       The bill whose constitutionality the Brennan Center vouches \n     for would totally and entirely ban PAC contributions to \n     Senate candidates, a wholly unprecedented restriction of the \n     rights of literally millions of Americans, most of them small \n     donors in the $25 to $100 range, to pool their resources to \n     amplify their voices. Such small-donor PACs affiliated with \n     groups running the gamut from the National Abortion Rights \n     Action League, the Human Rights Campaign Fund and Emily's \n     List, on the one hand, to the National Right to Life \n     Committee, the Christian Coalition and the National Rifle \n     Association, on the other, would be denied the right to \n     support the candidates of their choice.\n       Nothing in Buckley sustains such a radical restraint on the \n     right of freedom of speech and association. Buckley upheld a \n     $5,000 limit on political action committee contributions \n     to individual federal candidates, not the $0 limit, total \n     ban that Section 201 of S. 25 would impose on all Senate \n     campaigns.\n       Even the ``fall back'' provision that would impose a 20% \n     cap on the amount of PAC contributions that any Senate \n     candidate could receive operates, effectively, as a $0 limit, \n     total ban once that limit is reached. Once any Senate \n     candidate has received PAC contributions totaling 20% of the \n     applicable spending limit, all other groups are barred from \n     supporting that candidate and effectively silenced. In \n     Buckley the Court said that ``[g]iven the important role of \n     contributions in financing political campaigns, contribution \n     restrictions could have a severe impact on political dialogue \n     if the limitations prevented candidates and political \n     committees from amassing the resources necessary for \n     effective advocacy.'' 424 U.S. at 22. The Court found that \n     the contribution limits there survived close scrutiny under \n     that test, in large part precisely because the Act, though \n     limiting individual contributions to $1,000, permitted PACs \n     to contribute five times that amount, and provided for a \n     proliferation of PACs to fill the fundraising gap. Id. at 23, \n     29-30. A total or near-total ban on PAC contributions would \n     fail the Buckley test.\n       That is why reducing the PAC contribution ceiling to $1,000 \n     is also extremely suspect. In 1976 dollars, that would be \n     about a $350 ceiling on contributions. It is simply \n     incredible to believe that the Buckley Court would have \n     upheld that low a limit on individual or PAC contributions, \n     especially when so many PACS are small donor PACs where the \n     concern with corruption is attenuated. The Brennan Center \n     letter is simply wrong in its assertion that ``in the years \n     since Buckley, the Supreme Court has upheld every \n     contribution limit that has come before it in an election \n     context.'' (p. 2). In Citizens Against Rent Control v. \n     Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290 1981), cited in our earlier letter, \n     the Court, by a vote of 8 to 1, invalidated a $250 limit on \n     personal contributions to local referendum campaigns. S. 25's \n     limits would be similarly vulnerable.\n\n\n           iii. s. 25's attacks on issue advocacy and speech\n\n       One of the central tenets of the Supreme Court's campaign \n     finance jurisprudence has been the critical distinction \n     between contributions and expenditures made by federal \n     candidates, or their campaigns or those who expressly \n     advocate their election or defeat, on the one hand, and all \n     other political and issue advocacy and discussion and \n     activity, even though it might influence the outcome of an \n     election, on the other. This constitutional Continental \n     Divide is compelled by the First Amendment and is built upon \n     the concept that only ``express advocacy'' of the election or \n     defeat of specific federal candidates can be subject to \n     regulation.\n       It is not that there is an inherent distinction between \n     issue speech and electoral advocacy. Quite the contrary, as \n     the Buckley Court recognized: ``For the distinction between \n     discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of election \n     or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical \n     application. Candidates, especially incumbents, are \n     intimately tied to public issues involving legislative \n     proposals and governmental actions. Not only do candidates \n     campaign on the basis of their positions on various public \n     issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of public \n     interest.'' 424 U.S. at 43. But Buckley held that if any \n     mention of a candidate in the context of discussion of an \n     issue rendered the speaker or the speech subject to campaign \n     finance controls, the consequences for the First Amendment \n     would be intolerable.\n       Accordingly, while candidate-focused contributions and \n     expenditures and ``express advocacy'' can be subject to \n     various restrictions or regulations, the Court clearly held \n     in Buckley that all speech which does not ``in express terms \n     advocate the election or defeat of a clearly identified \n     candidate'' is totally free of any permissible regulation: \n     ``So long as persons and groups eschew expenditures that in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate, they are free to spend as much as they \n     want to promote the candidate and his views.'' 424 U.S. at 45 \n     (emphasis supplied). The purpose of this profound distinction \n     is to keep campaign finance regulations from overwhelming all \n     political and public speech.\n       The effect of the distinction has been manifold. It is the \n     express advocacy concept that defines the notion of ``soft \n     money'' which is political funding that is used for party-\n     building, get-out-the-vote activities and generic advertising \n     (``Vote Democratic''), all activities which do not \n     ``expressly advocate'' the election or defeat of specific \n     federal candidates. Because it is not used for such express \n     advocacy, it can be raised from sources that would be \n     restricted in making contributions or expenditures. It is the \n     express advocacy concept that separates an illegal corporate \n     expenditure advocating the election or defeat of a specific \n     candidate from an allowed issue advertisement discussing \n     public and political questions. Compare Austin v. Michigan \n     Chamber of Commerce, 494 U.S. 652 (1990) with First National \n     Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978). It is the \n     express advocacy concept that defines and cabins the concept \n     of independent expenditures and determines the permissibility \n     of coordinated expenditures. It is the express advocacy \n     concept that protects the myriad on non-partisan, issue-\n     oriented groups like the ACLU in their right to comment on \n     and criticize the performance of elected officials without \n     becoming ensnared in the federal campaign finance laws. See \n     Buckley v. Valeo, 519 F.2d 817, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1975).\n       And it is that critical constitutional distinction which S. \n     25 seeks to blur beyond recognition.\n\n                             A. Soft Money\n\n       As indicated, soft money is funding that does not support \n     ``express advocacy'' of the election or defeat of federal \n     candidates, even though it may exert an influence on the \n     outcome of federal elections in the broadest sense of that \n     term. It sustains primary political activity such as get-out-\n     the-vote drives\n\n[[Page S10515]]\n\n     and issue advertising. That is why, contrary to the Brennan \n     Center's letter, the relevant precedent is not Austin which \n     involved express advocacy by corporations, but Colorado \n     Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal Election \n     Commission, 116 S.Ct. 2309 (1996), which upheld unlimited \n     independent expenditures by political parties on behalf of \n     their candidates.\n       Indeed, the unrestricted use of soft money by political \n     parties and non-party organizations like labor unions has \n     been invited by Buckley (``So long as persons and groups \n     eschew . . .''), authorized by Congress (see 2 U.S.C. \n     sections 431 (8)(A)(I) and (B)(xii) which permit soft money \n     for state elections and voter registration and get out the \n     vote drives), sanctioned and enhanced by rulings of the \n     Federal Election Commission and acknowledged by the Supreme \n     Court in last year's Colorado Republican case. In that case, \n     and despite a brief filed by the Brennan Center with charts \n     and graphs detailing large individual and corporate soft \n     money contributions to the two major parties and contending \n     that ``soft money contributions to local political parties \n     have cascaded into a flood of dollars from corporations, \n     labor unions, and wealthy donors that threaten the integrity \n     of the Act's federal contributions restrictions. . . .'' \n     (Brief, p. 8) the Court nonetheless stated:\n       ``We recognize that FECA permits individuals to contribute \n     more money ($20,000) to a party than to a candidate ($1,000) \n     or to other political committees ($5,000). . . We also \n     recognize that FECA permits unregulated ``soft money'' \n     contributions to a party for certain activities, such as \n     electing candidates for state office . . . or for voter \n     registration and ``get out the vote'' drives. But the \n     opportunity for corruption posed by these greater \n     opportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated. \n     Unregulated ``soft money'' contributions may not be used to \n     influence a federal campaign, except when used in the limited \n     party-building activities specifically designated by \n     statute.'' Id. at 2316.\n       Accordingly, S. 25's sweeping and convoluted limitations on \n     the amount and source of soft money contributions to \n     political parties (Section 211 to 213) and disclosure of soft \n     money disbursements by other organizations (Section 211) are \n     not justified by precedent. Disclosure, rather than \n     limitation, of large soft money contributions to political \n     parties, is the appropriate remedy.\n       Nonetheless, we recognize that during the last election \n     cycle, many candidates for federal office spent as much time \n     responding to issue advertising and independent expenditures \n     as they did campaigning against the advertising emanating \n     from their opponents. The solution to this problem is not to \n     tamp down on issue advocacy, independent expenditures or soft \n     money contributions in a vague, overbroard and \n     unconstitutional manner. Rather, Congress should lift the \n     individual and PAC contribution limits so that candidates \n     have better control and access to the larger sums of money \n     necessary to finance their own campaigns, subject, of course, \n     to timely and appropriate disclosure.\n\n                      B. Independent Expenditures\n\n       The Court has repeatedly stated that independent \n     expenditures are at the core of the First Amendment's \n     protection because they embody citizen commentary on \n     government, politics, and candidates for elective office. See \n     Buckley v. Valeo, supra; FEC v. National Conservative PAC, \n     470 U.S. 480 (1985); Colorado Republican Federal Campaign \n     Committee v. FEC, supra. In our initial letter we identified \n     a number of ways in which S. 25 burdens and restrains \n     these core First Amendment rights.\n       First, S. 25 broadly expands the definition of \n     ``coordination'' so that virtually any person or group who \n     has had even the most casual interaction with a candidate or \n     a campaign is therefore barred from making independent \n     expenditures. Section 405.\n       Second, the bill imposes a number of new and burdensome \n     reporting and disclosure requirements on those who would make \n     such expenditures. Sections 241, 405. For example, any person \n     or group who spends more than $1,000 to place a small \n     political advertisement in The New York Times--a very small \n     ad--within three weeks of an election must file a report with \n     the government within 24 hours of when they arrange for the \n     ad--before it even runs. Section 241. Failure to do so can \n     result in civil monetary penalties or injunctive suits by the \n     Federal Election Commission. And what triggers the \n     application of these extensive new controls is any political \n     content which the government might deem ``express advocacy'' \n     under the patently unconstitutional definition of that \n     concept contained in this bill. See infra.\n       Ignoring these serious concerns, the Brennan Center letter \n     focuses solely on the question of coordination between a \n     party and its candidate. Section 404. But even there the \n     letter ignores the fact that the Colorado Republican case \n     rejected the validity of a conclusive conclusion of \n     impermissible coordination whenever a party made an \n     expenditure in favor of its candidates. Yet S. 25 replaces \n     the rejected automatic conclusion with an all but conclusive \n     factual presumption of coordination and therefore limitation.\n\n                           C. Issue Advocacy\n\n       S. 25's worst assault on settled First Amendment principles \n     is its efforts to obscure the bright line test of ``express \n     advocacy'' that has been fashioned by the courts for 25 years \n     to protect the broad range of issue discussion in America \n     from campaign finance controls. The Buckley Court could not \n     have been more clear about the need for that bright line, \n     objective test which focuses solely on the speaker's words. \n     That test is an integral part of the First Amendment, no less \n     than the ``actual malice'' rule of New York Times Co. v. \n     Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964) in defamation cases, or the \n     ``incitement test'' of Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444 \n     (1969) in subversive advocacy cases.\n       Indeed, the ACLU's initial encounter with campaign finance \n     laws was to defend against their very first use to try to \n     muzzle a small handful of dissenters who had published an \n     advertisement in The New York Times criticizing the President \n     of the United States. The government claimed that the ad was \n     ``for the purpose of influencing'' the outcome of the 1972 \n     Presidential election. The government was resoundingly \n     rebuffed, and the courts ruled that the campaign finance laws \n     could not be used in such an open-ended fashion to control \n     issue speech. United States v. National Committee for \n     Impeachment, 469 F.2d 1135, 1139-1142 (2d Cir. 1972); see \n     also, American Civil Liberties Union v. Jennings, 366 F.Supp. \n     1041, 1055-57 (D.D.C. 1973, three-judge court); Buckley v. \n     Valeo, 519 F.2d. 817, 832 (D.C. Cir. 1975, en banc); Buckley \n     v. Valeo, 424 U.S. at 42-45 and 76-80. Instead, ``express \n     advocacy'' would be the bright dividing line between campaign \n     advocacy and issue speech.\n       Now, S. 25 attempts to replace that time-honored concept \n     with the kind of vague and over broad formulas that Buckley \n     and other courts rejected, and the circle has turned full \n     round. Buckley said the First Amendment required that the law \n     could only regulate ``expenditures for commutations that in \n     express terms advocate the election or defeat of a clearly \n     identified candidate for federal office.'' Id. at 44, 80. The \n     very language and concepts that the Buckley Court rejected as \n     permissible definitions of regulatable electoral advocacy \n     have now reappeared in this bill. In Buckley the Court \n     rejected a triggering provision that regulated advocacy \n     speech ``relative to a clearly identified candidate.'' S. 25 \n     regulates advocacy speech that ``refers to a clearly \n     identified candidate.'' Section 406. and any communication by \n     a political party to the public which ``refers to a clearly \n     identified candidate'' would be subject to regulation, \n     without more.\n       Beyond that, First Amendment rights would turn once again \n     on such vague and subjective concepts as whether the \n     communication ``conveys a message'' that advocates the \n     election or defeat of a particular candidate or that ``a \n     reasonable person would understand as advocating the election \n     or defeat'' of a candidate and that is ``made for the purpose \n     of advocating the election or defeat of the candidate as \n     shown by . . . a statement or action by the person making the \n     communication, the targeting or placement of the \n     communication, or the use by the person making the \n     communication of polling, demographic, or other similar data \n     relating to the candidate's campaign or election.'' \n     Publication of ``box core'' voting records would be allowed \n     only if ``limited solely to providing information about the \n     voting record of elected officials on legislative matters and \n     that a reasonable person would not understand as advocating \n     the election or defeat of a particular candidate.'' That's \n     how incumbents would impede dissemination of information \n     about their voting records and official actions.\n       In an effort to defend these suspect provisions, the \n     Brennan Center letter distorts the meaning of the concept of \n     ``independent expenditure'' as defined by the Court. A \n     communication cannot be defined as an independent expenditure \n     because it is ``designed to affect the outcome'' of a federal \n     election or because the speaker's ``purpose and effect was to \n     advocate the election or defeat of an identified candidate'' \n     or because the speaker's ``predominant intent'' was to do so. \n     The courts have rejected these subjective tests as \n     treacherously dangerous boundary lines to mark First \n     Amendment rights. Under the First Amendment, an independent \n     expenditure is only one which ``expressly advocates the \n     election or defeat'' of a specific candidate. And references \n     to ``so-called `issue ads' '' or ``phony `issue ads' '' \n     (Letter, pp. 5, 6) cannot change that fact. It is not \n     surprising that the letter cites no precedent for its support \n     of a bill which would undue 25 years of bright line \n     protection for issue-oriented speech.\n       S. 25 remains ``fatally and fundamentally flawed when \n     measured against First Amendment values.'' It contains 87 \n     pages of tortured twists and turns seeking more and more \n     limits on political funding and therefore on political \n     speech. As we all know, that approach has not worked, and we \n     think it will not work, politically or constitutionally. We \n     think it is time instead, to explore ways to expand political \n     participation and opportunity that do not entail restricting \n     political speech such as meaningful and constitutional public \n     financing. We look forward to working with you to do so.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ira Glasser,\n       Executive Director.\n     Laura W. Murphy,\n       Director, Washington Office.\n     Joel Gora,\n       Professor of Law, Brooklyn Law School, and Counsel to the \n     ACLU.\n\n[[Page S10516]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing this letter to set \n     forth my views and those of the American Civil Liberties \n     Union National Office with respect to the constitutionality \n     of S. 25, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1997. A year \n     ago, I presented the opposition of the American Civil \n     Liberties Union to S. 1219, last year's campaign finance \n     bill. Once again, you have a bill before you which is fatally \n     and fundamentally flawed when measured against First \n     Amendment values. And one again we must oppose it.\n       The ACLU has long maintained that limitations on \n     contributions and expenditures used for the purpose of \n     advocating candidates and causes in the public forum violate \n     the First Amendment. Under the First Amendment, as properly \n     construed in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), Congress \n     cannot ration or restrict the political funding that \n     nourishes and sustains political speech. ``In the free \n     society ordained by our Constitution it is not the \n     government, but the people--individually as citizens and \n     candidates and collectively as associations and political \n     committees--who must retain control over the quantity and \n     range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.'' \n     424 U.S. at 51.\n       I was an ACLU staff attorney who helped shape our pleadings \n     and argued before the Court in the Buckley case, which was a \n     landmark of political freedom. And, as a Professor of Law at \n     Brooklyn Law School, I have worked with the ACLU on these \n     issues ever since. Just last year, the continuing validity of \n     the First Amendment principles recognized in Buckley  was \n     reaffirmed by the Supreme Court, by a wide 7 to 2 margin, in \n     Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee v. Federal \n     Election Commission, 116 S. Ct. 2309 (1996), a ruling which \n     struck down limitations on independent expenditures by \n     political parties.\n       In a number of critical respects, S. 25 runs afoul of these \n     cherished principles. For example:\n       S. 25's coercive and punitive scheme, designed to compel \n     candidates to accept spending limits in Senate elections and \n     to penalize those who refuse, violates First Amendment \n     principles.\n       The ban and severe limitations on political action \n     committees cuts to the heart of freedom of association.\n       The unprecedented restrictions and controls on raising and \n     spending `'soft money'' by political parties and even non-\n     partisan groups trammel the First Amendment rights of parties \n     and their supporters in a manner well beyond any compelling \n     governmental interest and violate the ruling in the Colorado \n     Republican case.\n       The radically expanded definition of ``coordinated'' \n     expenditure will improperly restrict the core area of \n     independent electoral speech and wreak havoc on freedom of \n     association.\n       Worst of all, the new definitions of what constitutes \n     ``express advocacy'' are so vague and overbroad that they \n     transgress the great Constitutional Divide between partisan \n     electoral advocacy, subject to some regulation, and the \n     absolutely protected sphere of issue discussion, subject to \n     no permissible restraint. For twenty-five years courts have \n     fashioned and fostered that bright-line distinction in order \n     to protect the core values of the First Amendment. S. 25 \n     seeks to undo those carefully crafted categories and \n     obliterate those constitutionally compelled distinctions.\n       The reduced record keeping threshold for contributions and \n     disbursements, from $200 down to $50, or for ``eligible'' \n     candidates as low as $20, is a gross invasion of political \n     privacy.\n       The ban on political contributions by persons not eligible \n     to vote is an insult to the First Amendment which guarantees \n     free speech to all within our shores.\n       Last, but by no means least, the new enforcement powers \n     given to the Federal Election Commission to go to court in \n     the midst of a campaign to enjoin ``a violation of this Act'' \n     pose an ominous and sweeping threat of prior restraint and \n     political censorship.\n       Let me elaborate briefly on these concerns.\n       1. S. 25's coercive and punitive scheme designed to compel \n     candidates to accept spending limits in Senate elections and \n     to penalize those who refuse, violates First Amendment \n     principles.\n       Title I of the bill, providing ``spending limits and \n     benefits'' for Senate campaigns, is an attempt to coerce what \n     the law cannot command, a backdoor effort to impose campaign \n     spending limits--which almost always benefit incumbents--in \n     violation of essential free speech principles and the \n     doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. The provisions for \n     ``voluntary'' expenditure limits and other campaign funding \n     controls, imposed in order to induce candidates to accept \n     ceilings and restrictions on political speech and penalize \n     and disadvantage those who will not do so, raise serious \n     First Amendment problems.\n       The receipt of public subsidies or benefits should never be \n     conditioned on surrendering First Amendment rights. That \n     would penalize the exercise of those rights. See Perry v. \n     Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972); FCC v. League of Women \n     Voters, 468 U.S. 364 (1984); Board of County Commissioners v. \n     Umbehr, 116 S. Ct. 2342 (1996). Since candidates have an \n     unqualified right to spend as much as they can to get their \n     message to the voters, and to spend as much of their own \n     funds as they can, and to raise funds from supporters all \n     over the country, they cannot be made to surrender those \n     rights in order to receive public benefits.\n       In Buckley the Court suggested that Congress might \n     establish a system where candidates would choose freely and \n     voluntarily between public funding with expenditure limits \n     and private spending without limits, so long as the non-\n     participating candidate remained free to engage in unlimited \n     private funding and spending. In that setting, the purpose of \n     the public financing of Presidential campaigns was ``not to \n     abridge, restrict or censor speech, but rather to use public \n     money to facilitate and enlarge public discussion and \n     participation in the electoral process, goals vital to a \n     self-governing people.'' 424 U.S. at 92-93.\n       S. 25 fails this test, for its overall purpose and effect \n     are to limit speech, not enhance it. The bill imposes \n     substantial penalties on those disfavored, non-complying \n     candidates who will not agree to limit their campaign \n     expenditures, while it confers significant fund-raising \n     benefits upon those privileged candidates who adhere to the \n     limits. Privileged candidates get free broadcast time, and \n     sharply reduced broadcast and mailing rates. Disfavored \n     candidates must pay double promotional costs for the very \n     same communications. The bill contains triggers which \n     dramatically raise the spending ceilings and the contribution \n     caps for privileged candidates whenever disfavored candidates \n     threaten to mount a serious, well-funded campaign, or \n     whenever independent groups speak out against a privileged \n     candidate.\n       In effect, the bill tries to insure that privileged \n     candidates will always be able to counteract the messages of \n     disfavored candidates and their supporters. The law stacks \n     the deck against the candidate who will not agree to limits, \n     which will usually be the challenger trying to defeat \n     an incumbent. In short, this scheme does everything \n     possible to enable the candidate who agrees to spending \n     limits to overwhelm the candidate who does not. That is \n     not a level playing field. Lower courts have been quick to \n     invalidate such one-sided, lopsided ``voluntary'' schemes. \n     See Shrink Missouri Government PAC v. Maupin, 71 F.3d \n     1422, 1426 (8th Cir. 1995) (``We are hard-pressed to \n     discern how the interests of good government could \n     possibly be served by campaign expenditure laws that \n     necessarily have the effect of limiting the quantity of \n     political speech in which candidates for public office are \n     allowed to engage.''); Day v. Holohan, 34 F.2d 1356 (8th \n     Cir. 1994).\n       2. The various limitations on PAC contributions violate \n     freedom of speech and association.\n       Section 201 of the bill would ban all political \n     contributions by political action committees. This would cut \n     to the heart of the First Amendment's protection of freedom \n     of political speech and association. The bill would give a \n     permanent political monopoly to political parties and \n     political candidates, and would silence all those groups that \n     want to support or oppose those parties and candidates. PACs \n     come in all sizes and shapes and provide vehicles for \n     millions of Americans to amplify their voices. There is not a \n     word in Buckley or any case which suggests that the Court \n     would uphold a total ban on PAC contributions to federal \n     candidates and still all those voices. Frankly, this is just \n     political grandstanding. That's why there is a ``fall back'' \n     provision which would impose a $1,000 cap on PAC \n     contributions, which is also of very doubtful \n     constitutionality. See Committee Against Rent Control v. \n     Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290 (1981); Meyer v. Grant, 486 U.S. 414 \n     (1988); Carver v. Nixon, 72 F.3d 633 (8th Cir. 1995). In any \n     event, this provision is fatally overbroad because it treats \n     all PACs alike, even those made up only of small \n     contributors.\n       Likewise, the ban on ``bundling'' of individual PAC \n     contributions would abridge the freedom of association which \n     the Supreme Court has recognized as a ``basic constitutional \n     freedom.'' Kusper v. Pontikes, 414 U.S. 51, 57 (1973). As the \n     Court has pointedly observed, ``the practice of persons \n     sharing common views banding together to achieve a common end \n     is deeply embedded in the American political process.'' \n     Citizens Against Rent Control v. Berkeley, 454 U.S. 290, 294 \n     (1981).\n       Finally, the cap of 20% on PAC contributions that may be \n     received will simply make it harder for candidates to raise \n     funds, intrude upon freedom of speech and association and act \n     like yet another backdoor effort to limit overall campaign \n     expenditures, all in violation of Buckley's core principles.\n       3. The unprecedented controls on ``soft money'' are \n     unjustified restraints on political parties and other \n     organizations, as are the restraints on coordinated \n     expenditures.\n       Sections 211, 212, 213 and 221 of the bill would severely \n     limit and restrict the sources and use of soft money by \n     political parties and other organizations. The new sweeping \n     limitations and controls on ``soft money'' contributions to \n     and disbursements by political parties and other \n     organizations, federal, state or local, would expand the \n     reaches of the FECA into unprecedented new areas, far beyond \n     what any compelling interest would require. The reach of \n     these proposals is breathtaking and unprecedented.\n       Indeed, just last June, the Court cast grave doubt upon the \n     constitutionality of these various provisions. By a 7 to 2 \n     margin, the Court ruled that even candidate-focused, ``hard \n     money'' expenditures by political parties were fully \n     protected by First Amendment principles and the Buckley \n     precedents.\n\n[[Page S10517]]\n\n     In Federal Election Commission v. Colorado Republican Federal \n     Campaign Committee, supra, the Court gave full constitutional \n     protection to unlimited party independent expenditures and \n     invalidated the FEC rule that treated all candidate-focused, \n     independent party expenditures as though they were \n     ``coordinated'' with the candidate and therefore subject to \n     limitations. In language powerfully relevant here the Court \n     held: ``We do not see how a Constitution that grants to \n     individuals, candidates, and ordinary political committees \n     the right to make unlimited independent expenditures could \n     deny the same right to political parties.'' 116 S.Ct. at \n     2317. The case for thorough protection for ``soft money'' is \n     even stronger, since it is used by definition for voter \n     registration, get-out-the-vote, ``generic'' advertising like \n     ``Vote Democratic'' and other party-building activities.\n       Equally significant, the Court squarely rejected the \n     sweeping claims that soft money spent by political parties \n     was ``corrupting'' the system and had to be stopped: ``We \n     also recognize that the FECA permits unregulated `soft money' \n     contributions to a party for certain activities. . . . But \n     the opportunity for corruption posed by these greater \n     opportunities for contributions is, at best, attenuated.'' \n     116 S.Ct. at 2316.\n       Finally, Section 404, the new provision that tells \n     political parties that they can continue to make \n     ``coordinated'' expenditures on behalf of their candidates \n     only if they forfeit their Colorado Republican Committee \n     right to make independent expenditures supporting that \n     candidate is yet another example of how this bill coerces the \n     surrender of one constitutional right in order to exercise \n     another. That kind of coercion should be rejected out of \n     hand.\n       4. The new restrictions on independent expenditures \n     improperly intrude upon that core area of electoral speech \n     and impermissibly invade the absolutely protected area of \n     issue advocacy.\n       Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after \n     twenty years of campaign finance decisions. First, \n     independent expenditures for ``express'' electoral advocacy \n     by citizen groups about political candidates lie at the very \n     core of the meaning and purpose of the First Amendment. \n     Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lie totally outside \n     the permissible area of government regulation. See Buckley v. \n     Valeo, 424 U.S. at 14-15, 78-80, First National Bank of \n     Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765 (1978); FEC v. Massachusetts \n     Citizens For Life, 479 U.S. 238, 249 (1986). This bill \n     assaults both principles.\n       First, Section 405 of the bill vastly expands the concept \n     of ``coordinated'' expenditures so that virtually any person \n     who has had any interaction with a candidate or a campaign is \n     therefore barred from making independent expenditures. These \n     definitions and limitations embody an impermissible kind of \n     ``gag order by association.'' See De Jonge v. Oregon, 299 \n     U.S. 353 (1937). Second, if significant independent \n     expenditures are made ``in support of another candidate or \n     against'' an eligible, privileged candidate, the spending \n     limits of the latter are raised to make it easier to \n     counteract the independent. speech. Finally, new and expanded \n     reporting requirements are imposed on independent speakers. \n     All of this is designed to chill and deter core electoral \n     advocacy.\n       Worst of all is S. 25's blunderbuss assault on issue-\n     oriented speech. The weapon is an unconstitutional expansion \n     of the definition of ``express advocacy'' in order to sweep \n     classic issue speech within the zone of regulation as \n     independent expenditures. The bill abandons the bright line \n     test of express advocacy (words which in express terms \n     advocate the election or defeat of a candidate, such as \n     ``Vote for Smith,'' ``Vote Against Jones,'' ``Elect,'' \n     ``Defeat''), a test which the Supreme Court held was mandated \n     by the First Amendment. Instead, Section 406 of the bill \n     would treat as express advocacy any communication ``that \n     conveys a message that advocates the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified candidate'' or, worse, ``that a reasonable \n     person would understand as advocating the election or defeat \n     or a candidate.'' A safe harbor provision, for a \n     communication that ``is limited solely to providing \n     information about the voting record of elected officials on \n     legislative matters and that a reasonable person would not \n     understand as advocating the election or defeat or a \n     particular candidate'' is circular and no safe harbor at all. \n     Indeed, the prospect of subjecting free speech rights to the \n     post facto assessment of a ``reasonable person'' test would \n     undo decades of First Amendment jurisprudence designed to \n     protest First Amendment rights against the vagueness and \n     uncertainly of such a standard.\n       This provision attacking issue ads and legislative advocacy \n     would sweep in the kind of essential issue advocacy which \n     Buckley and cases predating Buckley by a generation, see \n     Thomas v. Collins 323 U.S. 516 (1945), have held immune from \n     government regulation and control. It seems to be targeted \n     exactly against the kind of voting record, ``box score'' \n     discussion that emanates from the hundreds and thousands or \n     issue organizations that enrich our public and political \n     life. In Buckley, the Court adopted the bright line test line \n     test of express advocacy in order to immunize issue advocacy \n     from regulation: ``So long as person or groups eschew \n     expenditures that in express terms advocate the election or \n     defeat of a clearly identified candidate, they are free to \n     spends as much as they want to promote the candidate and his \n     views.'' Id. at 45.\n       Most significantly, the Act at issue in Buckley contained a \n     similar provision regulating issue-oriented groups because of \n     their ``box score'' ratings of public officials and \n     comparable activities. That provision was unanimously held \n     unconstitutional by the en banc Court of Appeals, without any \n     further appeal by the government. See Buckley v. Valeo, 519 \n     F.2d 817, 832 (D.C. Cir 1975). Circuit Judges running the \n     gamut from Bazelon and Wright to Robb and Mackinnon were \n     unanimous in their condemnation of that effort to control \n     issue speech. The new and expanded definition of ``express \n     advocacy'' in S. 25 is similarly, grievously flawed.\n       5. The bill gives unacceptable new powers of prior \n     restraint and political censorship to the Federal Election \n     Commission.\n       With all of these problems with the bill, particularly \n     those that pertain to issue advocacy and independent \n     expenditures, giving the Federal Election Commission sweeping \n     new powers to go to court to seek an injunction on the \n     allegation of a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . \n     . is about to occur'' is fraught with First Amendment peril.\n       Where sensitivity to the core constitutional protection for \n     issue advocacy is concerned, the Commission has, in the words \n     of one appellate judge, ``failed abysmally.'' See Federal \n     Election Commission v. CLITRIM, 616 F.2d 45, 53-54 (2d Cir. \n     1980)(Kaufman, C.J. concurring). And ever since then, non-\n     partisan, issue-oriented groups like the ACLU, the National \n     Organization for Women, the Chamber of Commerce, Right-to-\n     Life Committees and many others have had to defend themselves \n     against charges that their public advocacy rendered them \n     subject to all the FECA's restrictions, regulations and \n     controls. The kind of ``chilling effect'' that such \n     enforcement authority generates in the core area of protected \n     speech makes the strongest case against giving the Commission \n     additional powers to tamper with First Amendment rights.\n       S. 25 is not the way to reform campaign finance. It is bad \n     constitutional law and bad political reform. True reform \n     would expand political participation and funding, without \n     limits and conditions, not restrict contributions and \n     expenditures by which groups and individuals communicate \n     their messages to the voters.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to set forth these views.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Joel M. Gora,\n\n                                                 Professor of Law,\n                                              Brooklyn Law School.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there was an editorial in Friday's Wall \nStreet Journal entitled ``The Beltway's Hale-Bopp'' with regard to the \nbill before us today. And I ask unanimous consent that that be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 3, 1997]\n\n                        The Beltway's Hale-Bopp\n\n       Campaign finance reform, also known as McCain-Feingold, \n     isn't merely a legislative proposal. Campaign finance reform \n     is now a religion.\n       Somehow in the past several years, campaign finance reform \n     transmuted from a cause into a belief system. It is the \n     Beltway's version of the Heaven's Gate cult, in which the \n     powers attributed to the Hale-Bopp comet have been \n     transferred to the McCain-Feingold bill. It has become the \n     mothership that will transport the American people away from \n     the failings of modern politics and toward a purer system of \n     government. One can almost hear the pundits' plaintive chorus \n     preparing for the bill's passage: ``Knock, knock, knockin' on \n     heaven's door.''\n       Interestingly, most of the McCain-Feingold cult's adherents \n     aren't run-aways or overworked computer programmers. Instead, \n     they hold down jobs in the print and electronic media. \n     Articles and editorials evangelizing for McCain-Feingold pour \n     forth like a river. An acquaintance of ours had the \n     misfortune of finding herself flying cross-country recently \n     seated next to a McCain-Feingold fundamentalist. It was an \n     arduous six hours.\n       We raise these matters not in a spirit of rank partisanship \n     (the Anti-Partisans being another aborning Beltway cult, \n     incidentally), but out of concern for these loved ones. By \n     nature, our media brethren are a skeptical lot. A managing \n     editor once told us that some of his reporters declined his \n     entreaties to get involved in the life of their local \n     communities because ``it might compromise my objectivity.'' \n     Normally, excepting the occasional marches on behalf of \n     abortion rights, these are hard cases.\n       So how else, other than religious belief, to explain why so \n     many have become so attached to a legislative proposal that \n     is objectively unconstitutional, that would cheerfully allow \n     federal bureaucrats to regulate political speech while \n     shrinking from, as if from sunlight, the regulation of \n     pornography?\n       One of the two most important components of McCain-Feingold \n     would explicitly forbid ``issues ads'' that mention a \n     candidate's name within 60 days of a federal election. The \n     Supreme Court made no dent with a whole series of decisions \n     starting in 1976 with Buckey v. Valeo, which held that\n\n[[Page S10518]]\n\n     the law may be able to limit contributions, but that limits \n     on expenditures, even from the personal fortune of an actual \n     candidate, violate the Constitution. But the crusade rolls on \n     even in the face of a Supreme Court decision as recent as \n     last year's Colorado Republican Party v. Federal Election \n     Commission, in which the court struck down limitations on \n     official party spending on behalf of its candidates. That is \n     to say the second half of McCain-Feingold, the ban on ``soft \n     money,'' is also unconstitutional. Justice Breyer wrote for \n     the court: ``The independent expression of a political \n     party's views is `core' First Amendment activity.''\n       Then, of course, there is the phrase with which the First \n     Amendment closes, about making no law abridging the right \n     ``to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.'' \n     That is, lobbying. Now admittedly the Founding Fathers were \n     rationalists who lived in the shadow of the long-ago \n     Enlightenment. In our newer age no stronger article of faith \n     abides around the Beltway than that anyone who ``lobbies'' \n     the Congress about their grievances against, say, the Clean \n     Air Act, is corrupting the vestal virgins who inhabit that \n     place. McCain-Feingold, according to Senator McCain, would \n     thwart the lobbies from interfering with the deliberations of \n     Congress. That is to say, the politicians who command a third \n     of all the money in the Gross Domestic Product want to pass \n     laws against taxpayers trying to influence them.\n       At the end of the day we remain skeptics, less so of \n     McCain-Feingold than of its advocates' professions of \n     nonpartisanship. The problem with campaign finance as it \n     exists is not so much the inevitable corruptions, but that \n     these corruptions are so secret, as the tortuous hearings of \n     the Thompson Committee have proven. Full disclosure--daily, \n     publicly, electronically--of contributions from whatever \n     source, from cloistered Buddhist nuns to ethanol fanatics, \n     would let voters decide for themselves which imperfect soul \n     they wished to vote into office.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Further, Mr. President, there was an op-ed piece in \nthe Washington Times by Peggy Ellis of the Cato Institute entitled ``10 \nBig Lies About Campaign Finance Reform. . . .'' I ask unanimous consent \nthat it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Oct. 7, 1997]\n\n            10 Big Lies About Campaign Finance Reform . . .\n\n                            (By Peggy Ellis)\n\n       Lie No. 1: The American people are clamoring for campaign \n     finance reform. Outside of Washington and the political \n     elites, campaign finance reform finishes at the bottom of the \n     list of issues people care about (3 percent). Most voters \n     believe that whatever reforms are passed, politicians will \n     find a way around the new rules (73 percent). By huge \n     margins, voters are less likely to vote for their member of \n     Congress if they vote for reforms that are unconstitutional \n     (88 percent), make it easier for them to get re-elected (71 \n     percent), make it more difficult for citizens' groups to \n     inform voters of candidates' voting records (80 percent) or \n     increase the relative power of the media (69 percent) \n     (Tarrance Group, June 1997).\n       Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican known as \n     the ``Darth Vader of campaign finance reform,'' won re-\n     election last year with a 160,000 vote margin--without the \n     endorsements of the two largest newspapers because of his \n     stance on ``reform'' and with the maximum contributions \n     allowed by law from the tobacco companies. Rep. Linda Smith, \n     Washington Republican, won her first election while being \n     hugely outspent by the incumbent. She then became the darling \n     of campaign finance reformers and almost lost.\n       Lie No. 2: Only wealthy special interests have access to \n     members of Congress. Poppycock. The first item on all \n     members' calendars is, and will always be, constituents. \n     Members of Congress meet with lobbyists and policy experts \n     all day long and then go vote the way they want to. Further, \n     it is part of every legislative aide's job to meet with all \n     sides to best prepare their boss for whatever the issue might \n     be. As Senator Bob Bennett, Utah Republican, said at a recent \n     hearing, ``I'll tell you who has access to me--anyone \n     registered to vote in the state of Utah.''\n       Lie No. 3: Banning soft money is the only way to ensure \n     that the scandals of the '96 presidential election don't \n     happen again. The best way to make sure the abuses of '96 \n     don't happen again is to punish those who have broken the \n     law. Soft money was banned in the original 1974 rules and the \n     1976 election was run without soft money. Parties were so \n     strapped for cash that traditional activities such as bumper \n     stickers and get-out-the-vote drives were sharply curtailed. \n     One of the primary purposes of the 1979 amendments to federal \n     election law was to restore soft money. Traditional party-\n     building activities are clearly not what the reformers want \n     to control. It is the issue ads run by the parties--which are \n     the essence of First Amendment protected speech. To eliminate \n     this distortion, eliminate the limits on party contributions \n     to their candidates. It is bizarre that political parties \n     cannot give directly to their candidates as much as they \n     want. No claims can be made of a corrupting relationship \n     between a candidate and his or her political party. And for \n     those who want to open up the political process and loosen \n     the grip of incumbents political parties are the one group \n     that will always support a challenger.\n       Lie No. 4: You can constitutionally control issue advocacy. \n     It is often forgotten that in the original 1974 amendments to \n     the Federal Elections Campaign Act, Congress sought to limit \n     issue ads, just as many do now. The Supreme Court overturned \n     these rules. Nothing is more central to the core of what our \n     country was founded on than the ability of private \n     individuals and groups to discuss, criticize and protest \n     their elected officials and those that seek office. A 20-year \n     string of court decisions reaffirm that free and unencumbered \n     political speech enjoys the highest First Amendment \n     protection and cannot be regulated by the federal government.\n       Lie No. 5: Most issue ads are ``thinly veiled campaign \n     ads'' and, therefore, can and must be regulated by the \n     Federal Election Commission. Nothing is more central to the \n     First Amendment than the rights of individuals and groups to \n     participate openly and freely in our nation's political \n     debate. Reformers and misinformed senators claim that, since \n     issue ads are clearly intended to influence an election, they \n     should be regulated. Buckley vs. Valeo anticipated this \n     argument. Of course, the Court held, these ads are intended \n     to influence elections, but our First Amendment rights are so \n     central to our political freedom that unless the words ``vote \n     for'' or ``vote against'' are used, these ads are issue \n     advocacy and cannot be regulated by the government.\n       Lie No. 6: McCain-Feingold will open up the system. In \n     fact, McCain-Feingold could be renamed the Incumbent \n     Protection Act. The stratospheric incumbent re-election rate \n     we have today is a direct result of the 1974 rules. \n     Contribution and spending limits and tighter controls on \n     issue advocacy are blatant incumbent protection. All the \n     distortions in the current system are results of the 1974 \n     rules--the 90 percent incumbent re-election rate, the \n     explosion of issue advocacy and soft money and the increase \n     of millionaires in office, the amount of time candidates have \n     to spend raising money, the increase in the relative power of \n     the media and celebrities. More of the same is not the \n     answer.\n       Lie No. 7: Buckley was a 5-to-4 decision and ``a close \n     call,'' vulnerable to future court tests. On the contrary--we \n     have years of court decisions reaffirming the central \n     findings of the Buckley decision. In the area of issue \n     advocacy alone, in the years since Buckley was decided, both \n     the Supreme Court and lower courts have, time and time again, \n     reaffirmed the reasoning and holding of that decision as it \n     pertains to the protection of issue advocacy. The 126 \n     ``constitutional scholars'' currently said to endorse McCain-\n     Feingold do not endorse the issue advocacy restrictions at \n     all--only the soft money and spending limits. In fact, the \n     Fourth Circuit was so disturbed by the FEC's attempts to \n     redraw the lines defining issue advocacy that the court \n     demanded in April that the FEC pay Christian Action Network's \n     court costs.\n       Lie No. 8: Campaign costs are spiraling out of control. \n     This ``explosion'' is outside of candidate spending. \n     Candidate spending was virtually flat from 1994 to 1996, with \n     an explosion of issue ads outside of the campaigns \n     themselves. The answer, however, is not to trample the First \n     Amendment rights of private individuals, but to lift the \n     contribution limits on parties and candidates. Let the money \n     spent on many of the issue ads flow directly to the \n     candidates. As for the anger many members have at private \n     groups expressing their views and--absolutely--trying to \n     influence their election: too bad! Politics and political \n     campaigns belong to the people, not to the candidates and \n     certainly not the federal government. The right to seek to \n     persuade fellow citizens at election time is as fundamental \n     as the right to vote itself.\n       Lie No. 9: Obscene amounts of money are spent in political \n     campaigns. Congressional candidates spent approximately $740 \n     million in 1996. This is only slightly higher than the \n     approximately $700 million spent in 1994. It's a lot of \n     money--but not when compared to what we spend as a society in \n     other areas. These congressional totals average less than $4 \n     per eligible voter. If you look at every race in the country, \n     from dog catcher to president, the amount spent is less than \n     $10 per eligible voter. As a society, we spend more on potato \n     chips, Barbie dolls, yogurt and a host of other commodities \n     than we do on politics. While many of us may like Barbie \n     dolls and potato chips more than we like politics, only \n     politics has control over every aspect of our lives.\n       Lie No. 10: We must control the amount of money spent in \n     campaigns because candidates and members of Congress have to \n     spend all their time raising money. It is the ridiculous \n     $1,000 contribution limit that has limited the ability of \n     challengers to raise the money they need to mount a \n     successful campaign--and the reason members of Congress have \n     to spend so much time raising money. The answer is not to \n     control the amount candidates can spend, which would only \n     further entrench incumbents, but to eliminate the \n     contribution limits. Let the money flow directly to the \n     candidates and, with almost-instant electronic disclosure, \n     let the voters decide.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today at noon, we have another opportunity \nto invoke cloture on S. 25, the McCain-\n\n[[Page S10519]]\n\nFeingold campaign finance reform bill, which I support. I am sorely \ndisappointed that yesterday, the Republican majority once again \nsuccessfully blocked going to the bill.\n  After yesterday's two votes, the majority leader said that campaign \nreformers should just give up--that the bill's chances for enactment in \nthis session of the 105th Congress were dead.\n  I do not believe that the American people should be denied the \nbenefit of campaign finance reform that would, in my opinion, level the \nplaying field so that running for Federal office would not be so \nstrongly influenced by money.\n  It is amazing to me that after several months of public hearings by \nthe Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that anyone doubts the \ncritical need to rewrite our campaign funding laws. Throughout the \ncourse of the hearings we have witnessed example after example of the \nmisuse of our campaign finance laws.\n  And yet there remains a real crisis in the Senate over our inability \nto enact any campaign finance reform legislation. Moreover, this \nwholesale disdain for ending the money chase through substantive \nfinance reform fuels the distrust held by the American public of \nCongress and their belief that Congress does not wish to clean up its \nown house.\n  Our committee has examined allegations of foreign money influencing \nFederal campaigns, the use of Federal facilities to raise funds, \ncontributors donating in another's name, and access to Congress and the \nWhite House linked to campaign donations. Like my colleagues, I support \nprosecution by the Department of Justice of these allegations if it is \nappropriate. We have also had an opportunity to hear from expert \nwitnesses on how they would reform the funding of elections.\n  Mr. President, we can no longer allow the mad hunt for money to drive \nour elections. Nor can we ignore the dramatic increases in soft money \ndonations, the problems associated with unregulated independent \nexpenditures and issue advocacy, and the improper use of tax-exempt \norganizations.\n  And yet, despite the tremendous explosion in campaign expenditures \nand the dismay over the political system expressed by the voters, there \nremains steadfast opposition to reforming our Nation's campaign finance \nlaws, as evidenced by yesterday's votes.\n  I was hopeful, although perhaps too optimistic, to believe that S. \n25, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill would be embraced \nby most Members of the Senate. I was wrong.\n  With less than 50 percent of voting age Americans going to the polls \nin the last election, so much is at stake. The public's deep distrust \nof this Nation's elected officials by the voters will continue if the \nonly thing that comes from the Senate's investigation into campaign \nfinance abuse allegations and the abbreviated debate on S. 25 is \npolitical rhetoric and finger-pointing.\n  The Republican majority has seen fit to stifle the efforts of those \nSenators who support reforming the Nation's campaign finance laws. The \nonly hope I see in passing such reform at a future date lies with the \nAmerican voter. It will be up to the people of this great democracy to \ndemand that their Senators support campaign finance reform. There will \nbe no campaign finance reform until there is a nationwide movement to \nstop the campaign finance abuses uncovered by the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee.\n  S. 25, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 1997, was modified in \ngood faith, in an attempt to craft a bill more acceptable to the \nopposition. Unfortunately, it did not pass muster with those opposing \nit. In spite of yesterday's defeats, we have another chance to proceed \nto S. 25 by invoking cloture today.\n  Americans deserve a Government that works hard for their interests \nand not just the interests of monied contributors. Our citizens deserve \na more responsive, efficient, accountable and representative \nGovernment.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senate has the opportunity to improve \nthe system by which we finance our elections. Yesterday, the Senate had \nbefore it two proposals: one sponsored by Majority Leader Lott and \nSenator Nickles; the other sponsored by Senators McCain and Feingold. \nMuch of the discussion of these proposals, both here in the Senate and \nin the media, characterized them as mutually exclusive. For the most \npart, Republicans were expected to support the Lott proposal, and all \n45 Democrats and a handful of Republicans were committed to voting for \nMcCain-Feingold.\n  The paramount goals of any true effort to reform the system of \nfinancing elections for Federal office must be to reduce the influence \nof special interest money on elected officials and to level the playing \nfield between incumbents and challengers. The partisan division that \nhas created the procedural situation in which the Senate found itself \nyesterday suggests that these goals are not yet at hand. Although the \nproposals before us are not the final resolution to the problems that \nafflict the current system of campaign fundraising, they do provide a \ngood starting point.\n  I voted for cloture on both the Lott proposal and on the underlying \nMcCain-Feingold bill. Do I think that the majority leader's proposal is \nflawless? Of course I don't, no more than I think the McCain-Feingold \nbill provides all of the solutions to the outrages of the 1996 \nelections. But, I also do not agree with those on the other side who \nhave called the Lott amendment a poison pill. The truth is that \ntogether these proposals establish a sound starting point for a \nreasonable debate on campaign finance reform. It's time to let the \nprocess go forward. The Lott amendment should be opened up to \nimprovements, just as the McCain-Feingold bill should be amendable.\n  As I see it, the goal of the Lott amendment is meritorious. It is to \ngive union members some say over the political uses of their money. \nToday, union dues are used to support or oppose particular candidates \nwithout any authorization from the dues payers. McCain-Feingold takes a \nsmall step to address this problem, which amounts to compulsory \ncontributions to candidates. Under the McCain-Feingold bill, dues \npaying, non-union members would be eligible for a refund if they \ndisagreed with the political uses of their dues. That takes care of an \nestimated one million workers, but 16 million union members are left \nwithout any control over the political uses of their funds. That seems \nfundamentally unfair.\n  Senator Lott's amendment seeks to address this unfairness. According \nto the Lott amendment, unions would be prohibited from using dues for \npolitical purposes, including lobbying, unless individuals gave prior \nwritten consent. As I understand it, the prior consent requirement is \nviewed by opponents to be onerous, and, I think, the limitation on \nlobbying simply doesn't apply to the issue at hand--Federal election \ncampaigns. As many know, Senator Snowe and others--who feel as I do, \nthat this debate should move forward in an effort to find common \nground--have been working to refine this proposal. A vote for cloture \non the Lott amendment is a vote in favor of moving the process forward. \nIt is a vote in favor of opening up the Lott proposal to improvements.\n  I also voted for cloture on the McCain-Feingold bill. Senators McCain \nand Feingold have made considerable improvements to their bill. They \nhave worked to accommodate the concerns of other Senators, particularly \nSenator Collins who has worked hard to move this process forward. I \ncontinue to have concerns about some of the provisions of the bill. The \ntreatment of independent expenditures is not wholly satisfactory to me, \nalthough Senator McCain assures me these provisions were suggested by \ntop experts on Federal elections. I filed amendments that I believe \ncould improve the McCain-Feingold bill, but, of course, the Senate \ncannot get to the point of debating the merits and flaws of the bill \nunless cloture is invoked.\n  As far as I am concerned, the most important problem to be addressed \nthis year is one that barely existed a few years ago, the explosion of \nsoft money in the process. Not too many years ago, many of us were here \ndebating whether PAC's, political action committees, should be able to \ncontribute $5,000 per candidate, per election. We worried that these \nPAC contributions might appear to give special interests too much \ninfluence. But the soft money explosion has made those amounts seem \nlike pocket change. I believe that if all else fails, we must deal with \nthe soft money problem, and we must take steps, at least, to impose \ndisclosure requirements on the money that is spent\n\n[[Page S10520]]\n\non so-called ``issue ads.'' We also should seek common ground on the \nLott amendment. The Senate has the opportunity to make these important \nchanges in the current fundraising system by invoking cloture on both \nthe Lott amendment and the underlying McCain-Feingold bill.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the key issue in this debate is a simple \none: Will we enforce the campaign laws already on the books or not? \nWill we concoct some new layer of confusing and complex rules and \nregulations to distract the voters from the real issue, or will we do \nthe right thing? Are we going to insist that campaigns and candidates \nfollow the current rules, or are we going to keep changing the laws \neach time there is a new scandal? If we can't--or won't--even enforce \nthe laws we have now, what makes us think that a new set of laws will \nbe more effective?\n  The Senate and the American people have witnessed a flood of \ntestimony in recent weeks and months about illegal foreign \ncontributions, influence peddling, and money laundering at the highest \nlevels of our Government. The Attorney General has finally called for \nan investigation in the face of mounting evidence that, to many of us, \nclearly warranted a special investigator months ago.\n  Now, here we are debating a bill on the floor of the Senate that will \nnot only add new regulations and restrictions to the people's ability \nto participate in the election of their own representatives, but which \nignores the violations of campaign laws that apparently have already \ntaken place.\n  How does that play with the American people? I doubt it goes over too \nwell. Sure, Americans are distrustful of all the money in campaigns. \nThey are right to be suspicious when they read about Buddhist nuns \nbeing used to funnel foreign money into a Presidential campaign or the \nLincoln bedroom being used to cozy up with big-money campaign \ncontributors.\n  And they are also right to be dubious of what is going on here, \nbecause I think they understand and we are not tackling the real issue \nat hand. We are trying to divert their attention away from the simple \nfact that our campaign laws are not being enforced. This is the kind of \ncynicism that justifies the American people's distrust and apathy \ntoward Washington politicians.\n  History teaches us that when any law is not enforced, whether \ncampaign law or any other law, the people lose confidence in the \nsystem, whether it is the criminal justice system or the electoral \nsystem. When violations of the law go uninvestigated and unpunished, we \nsend the message that the law doesn't matter. We destroy one of the \ncore principles of our government--that we are a nation of laws, not of \nmen--and the law applies equally to everyone--not just to some and not \nothers.\n  We aren't doing anything to restore the American people's confidence \nin their Government until we begin to deal with this fundamental issue: \nDo the current campaign laws matter enough to be enforced or are they \njust an arbitrary system that can be followed or ignored depending on \nwhat is convenient for a campaign? The answer to this question must be \nemphatic--the laws that are here to protect our political system must \nbe enforced vigorously. Nothing less is acceptable.\n  Mr. President, there is a second reason the voters are dubious about \nour seriousness for cleaning up campaign finance violations. Many of \nthese voters are angry that their hard-earned money goes to candidates \nthey don't agree with. This happens through what essentially is \nextortion by the unions. Many hard-working union workers have part of \ntheir paycheck sent to political campaigns they don't support.\n  Yes, by codifying the Beck decision, this bill tries to make sure \nthat non-union members don't have their paychecks extorted for \npolitical use. But union members are left in a position of having to \nchoose between their job or their first amendment right to support the \ncandidate of their choice. With more and more union members voting \nRepublican in recent years, it's no wonder that the liberal union \nbosses are working to make sure this form of political blackmail is \nprotected.\n  Some will say this is no different than PAC's using their money to \nsupport candidates that a contributor may not agree with. Well if the \nSierra Club or the National Rifle Association or any other similar \ngroup uses your money to support a candidate you disagree with, you can \nstop giving your money to that group and its PAC. It's a voluntary \nchoice. But that's not possible in a union--at least not without \nputting your job at risk.\n  No, Mr. President, this effort does nothing to fix what's broken. \nThere are all sorts of schemes to make television stations give \ncandidates free air time, and to regulate what can and can't be said in \npolitical commercials. And there are even provisions that would have \nthe Federal Government establishing State and local campaign \nrestrictions. All of this adds up to putting chains around our \nfundamental first amendment rights.\n  The courts have repeatedly held that communications which do not \nexpressly advocate the election or defeat of a candidate are not \nsubject to regulation by the Government. But the proponents of this \nbill would make the Federal Election Commission into the politics \npolice. They would determine whether a reasonable person would know \nthat an ad is advocating the election or defeat of a candidate or not. \nThis would send a chill through our political process. Now the \nGovernment would decide what is reasonable or not. It is exactly the \nkind of temptation to tyranny that the Founding Fathers were protecting \nthe American people from when they adopted the first amendment.\n  Supporters of this bill contend there is too much money in politics. \nWhat they're saying is, they think there's too much free speech, too \nmuch involvement by free people expressing their views. But isn't that \nexactly what we want--more involvement and more participation? More \ncandidates are running for office now than ever. Voters now have more \noptions than ever. Placing further limits on speech will effectively \ndrive more citizens from the process.\n  We should stop this misguided effort and do what the American people \nreally want--and that is to enforce the laws that have been on the \nbooks for years. Only by doing so will we restore their confidence in \nthe political and electoral system that is supposed to send us here to \ndo their bidding.\n  Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nmake enforcing our current laws the No. 1 priority and put aside this \neffort to construct yet another monstrosity of bureaucracy and \ncomplexity that will add to American's skepticism of Washington.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum \ncall time be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 5\\1/2\\ minutes on each side.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If I might, claiming the time remaining on our side, just \nmake a comment about the pending business.\n  We will shortly be casting another vote on cloture on the issue of \ncampaign finance reform. The vote is going to be whether we invoke \ncloture on the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill.\n  Now, it is interesting, as we have been watching this develop over \nthe recent days, we have seen a form of legislative cholesterol \nclogging and plugging the system so that at the end some can say, \n``Well, we have considered campaign finance reform but they have, in \neffect, killed it.'' That has been the plan all along.\n  I mentioned yesterday that the great illusionists in America are \nthose who can convince people they have seen something that doesn't \nexist. We had that yesterday in which there was an assertion that we \nwere presented with a debate on campaign finance reform, but the debate \ndidn't really exist because no one was able to offer any\n\n[[Page S10521]]\n\namendments on campaign finance reform. The bill was brought to the \nfloor by someone who wanted to kill it, so he bound it up with a tight \nrope--what he called filling the tree with amendments, a tree of \namendments--so that no one else could offer any amendments, and then \nfiled a cloture motion designed to kill campaign finance reform.\n  The fact is this system doesn't work. The campaign finance system in \nthis country is broken. There is too much money in campaigns. I have \nshowed the chart out here on a number of occasions when I have spoken \nabout it. The red line on the chart on campaign spending goes straight \nup. And yet we have people in this Chamber and across the Capitol who \nbelieve the problem is we don't have enough money in politics, there is \nnot enough money in campaigns. What on Earth are they thinking about? \nWe need to reduce the amount of money in campaigns.\n  One of the issues that is involved in this legislation is soft money. \nWe ought to abolish soft money, the legal form of cheating from the old \ncampaign finance reform. For every rule there are people who try to \nfigure out how to get around it, over it or under it. In soft money, \nthe growth in the explosion of so-called soft money is the growth and \nexplosion of legal cheating in campaign finance, and we ought to change \nit.\n  There are only two sides to this issue: Those who want to reform the \nsystem, and those who are insisting the current system is just fine.\n  There are a majority of us in this Chamber, we believe, who will vote \nfor McCain-Feingold, for campaign finance reform, if only we can get it \nup on the floor of the Senate for a vote. I hope today, or perhaps \ntomorrow if further votes on cloture occur, that we will have an \nopportunity to demonstrate that, if we can get the bill to the floor of \nthe Senate, it will have a majority vote.\n  On my side of the aisle, 45 Members, every single Member, has signed \na letter saying we support this kind of campaign finance reform. We had \nthree, four, five Members on the other side of the aisle who have \nsupported it. If we can get it up for a vote, we will pass campaign \nfinance reform. But there are those who have tried to ride this into a \nbox canyon somewhere from which there is no escape because they by \ndesign want to kill campaign finance reform because they believe there \nis not enough money in politics. They want more money in American \npolitics. I have no idea where they get that sort of notion.\n  The American people know better. The American people support with an \n80-percent margin the need to pass campaign finance reform by this \nCongress. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture. Vote for cloture on \nthe McCain-Feingold bill and breathe some life into campaign finance \nreform and let's do what the American people know we should and what \nthe American people know we must--reform the system by which we finance \nAmerican campaigns, because the current system is broken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a cloture motion on \nwhat is, without question, a very important issue to all of us and to \nthe country at large. In fact, it is so important that this morning the \nPresident of the United States cried out, ``Save me from myself. Save \nme, please. I'm off to Philadelphia to raise money, and if you don't \nsave me by passing the new law, I may do something wrong, or I'm going \nto have to do what I'm going to do anyway.''\n  Well, Mr. President, I'm sorry, but all I ask you to do is to abide \nby the law that is on the books of the land today. That is what I do. \nThat is what the Senator who just spoke does. I doubt that Senator \nDorgan ever has attempted to violate campaign law. I know he hasn't. He \nis an honest man. He makes sure he doesn't because he hires an attorney \nand he hires an accountant and he keeps himself legal because what we \nlive under today is a well-regulated campaign finance system.\n\n  I am absolutely amazed that when the American family sits down at \nnight the first topic of the dinner table is not what about that \ncampaign finance reform they are talking about on the floor of the \nSenate; I suspect that family is talking about what happened to the \nchild who was lost on the streets of America today, or that classmate \nof your son or daughter whom you found out got arrested for drugs, or \nsome other issue like that. That makes a heck of a lot more sense to \nthe average American than the phenomenal, political, and media hype \nthat has been built over the last 3 or 4 months about campaign finance \nreform.\n  Mr. President, if I have heard it once, I have heard it 100 times, \nspoken from the other side of the aisle, ``Oh, they all do it.'' No, we \ndon't all do it. I just came out of a campaign and I didn't violate a \nlaw nor was I accused of violating a law. I raised money legally. I'm \nsorry if you have to use a smoke cloud or subterfuge to argue your \npolitical point of view. It is wrong.\n  Mr. President of the United States, it is wrong to say that everybody \ndoes it, because not everybody does. I am not about to save you, Mr. \nPresident, from yourself and from going to Philadelphia today to raise \nmoney. Last I checked, you touched out of here voluntarily. You left \nthis city voluntarily. And yet that was the argument that was used by \nthe President of the United States today. ``Well, the Senate yesterday \ndidn't pass a law so I got to go do it again.'' Sorry, Mr. President, \nthat isn't the issue here.\n  The Supreme Court yesterday spoke out very, very clearly when they \nsaid you can't deny the right of a citizen to speak out, you can't deny \nadvocacy in a free speech society. This Senate can talk all of the \npolitics it wants. It can line up all of the 30-second sound bites it \nwants, but it cannot violate the Constitution nor will the Court allow \nus to.\n  In this instance, I would love to quiet the voice of an advocate who \ndisagreed with me, and I had many of them last year in my campaign. I \nhad over a quarter of a million spent against me, and I will tell you, \nI don't think the ads were right. In fact, I think they were wrong. I \nthink they failed to tell the truth. But in a free society, doggone it, \nnow and then you have to withstand somebody who doesn't agree with you \nand you have to withstand somebody who may tell a lie about you. If you \nare in public life, that is a darn fact, the sureness of what will \nhappen, and we all know that.\n  What is wrong about it? Nothing is wrong about it. Oh, I could see \nwhere we should adjust some things, but I will tell you right now, if \nwe are going to say to a certain citizen in our society, ``You are \ngoing to provide money whether you want to or not, and that money is \ngoing to make it into the political system whether you want it to or \nnot,'' and our colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not allow \nthat to happen, they will not allow the average citizen to have full, \nvoluntary participation, then there will be no reform for this Senator \nto vote for.\n  That will not happen if I have the ability of most Senators to block \nissues from coming to the floor. If we are going to talk about major \ncampaign, we must talk about fairness, we must talk about equity, and \nwe must talk about the right of the citizen in free speech and \nvoluntarism.\n  So today I stand with pride in my defense of the Constitution and the \nright of the citizen. I will oppose cloture on this bill, not out of an \nembarrassment or not out of shame, but out of pride for the system that \ncan work when you play by the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say McCain-Feingold may be \ndead as most people around here seem to believe. I have always believed \nthe American people can have anything they want any time they are \nunified. The time is fast approaching when the American people are \ngoing to demand that we change a system that is rotten to the core. \nMcCain-Feingold goes a long way in that direction. It doesn't go nearly \nfar enough to please me personally, but at least it will be a \nbeginning.\n  The two things you can do to restore people's faith in the American \nGovernment and Congress, the two things you can do that will instill \nmore confidence than anything else would be to balance the budget and \nchange the way we finance campaigns.\n  I have heard all the sophistry about the constitutionality of this \nbill. I just\n\n[[Page S10522]]\n\nwant to tell you, when it comes to free speech, you can hang your hat \non free speech if you want to, but the thing that makes this system \nrotten is that a guy who can afford to belly up for $100,000 gets a lot \nmore free speech than some guy giving $25. The reason he doesn't give \n$25 is because he knows it gets him nothing--not even good government.\n  So I plead with my colleagues, for God's sake, let's do something \nthat the vast majority of the American people want us to do--that is, \nto level the playing field for all parties. You don't have a democracy \nwhen the people we elect and the laws we pass depend on how much money \nwe raise for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10501-4", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10522]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to proceed to Calendar No. 188, S. \n1173, the so-called ISTEA legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the motion. Is there \ndebate?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, was that a unanimous-consent request?\n  Mr. LOTT. No. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield, it is a \nmotion. But it is debatable. I understood the Senator from New Jersey \nintended to debate the motion.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes.\n  Mr. LOTT. Could I inquire of the Senator from New Jersey how long he \nthinks that he would need to do that?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I can speak for myself, I think, about the bill that \nI want to explain but I can't certainly speak for any other colleagues.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not asking for a specific hour, just some general--an \nhour or two.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is not my intention to tie the Senate up with this \nfor some indefinite period--not at all--but I do want to discuss some \nof the problems that I see with the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Does the Senator think an hour is about what he is thinking \nabout?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am not going to enter into a time agreement.\n  Mr. LOTT. I am not asking for an agreement--just for the information \nof all Senators so we know when there might be some further action--\njust some general idea of the time expected.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In fairness to the majority leader, who I have found \nto be an understanding person, I would take the time necessary; \nprobably--I do not know--an hour or so.\n  Mr. LOTT. That would be fine. Will the Senator require a rollcall \nvote?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. No.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if we can achieve order in the \nChamber, it would be easier for us to communicate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate come to order?\n  The Senate will come to order.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the Senate is \nnot in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). The Senator from Kentucky is \ncorrect. The Senate is not in order.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, once again, I thank you.\n  Mr. President, we are about to consider a radical departure from the \nstructure as we have known it to take care of our highway and \ntransportation needs for the next 6 years. But I view this approach as \nsomewhat premature and want to discuss what some of the problems are \nwith it. As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and \nalso, Mr. President, as having been the chairman of the Senate \nTransportation Subcommittee of Appropriations, and currently the \nranking member, I view it from a particular vantage point.\n  So I want to use this opportunity to alert my colleagues to some of \nthe problems that I see with the bill and those opportunities perhaps \nto change it. I know, Mr. President, that when I discuss concerns with \nthis bill that I also reflect----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senate please come to order? The \nSenator from New Jersey has the floor and has the right to be heard.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank you and the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is still not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator from New Jersey hold for a \nmoment? Will those having conversations please take them to the \nCloakroom so we can hear the Senator from New Jersey?\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, once again I thank you. I sense that \nthe excitement about the comments that I want to make has just \novertaken the Senate and it is hard for people to settle down. But if \nthey will settle down and listen, their fondest dreams will be \nrealized.\n  Mr. President, I think we ought to take some time to pause before we \ntalk\n\n[[Page S10523]]\n\nabout amendments to the bill known as ISTEA to consider what it is that \nwe are about to discuss, and amendments we will be offering once we are \nengaged in debate about the bill. But before we start that debate, \nagain I want to point out what I think are some of the serious \ndiscrepancies in its development.\n  I am not alone in my concerns about it. As I have indicated, other \nStates--I know my friends and colleagues from Illinois have distinct \nconcerns about it. I was particularly interested in a discussion that \nwe had just a while ago in a conference with some of the Democratic \nMembers to learn some of the facts about Illinois roads that I am sure \nthe senior Senator from Illinois will want to discuss. Our colleagues \nfrom Massachusetts have some misgivings about the bill. The Senators \nfrom Maryland have also indicated the fact that they are not happy with \nwhat has been offered in this bill. My colleagues across the river in \nthe State of New York have indicated to me that they are looking \nseriously at the bill, as other States not exactly in the Northeast \ncorner have also indicated--as I mentioned, the State of Illinois. I \nknow there are some concerns in the State of California and some \nconcerns in the State of Pennsylvania. Again, I will not speak for \nthose Senators, but those are the States where the formula change wound \nup dealing with these States in a fairly negative fashion.\n  So, Mr. President, as we begin to discuss bringing this bill to the \nfloor for discussion, it is time, I think, to begin debating not simply \nthe motion to proceed but the substance of the bill.\n  This 6-year authorization bill which governs transportation spending \nand planning is going to set the future of every State's transportation \nsystem into the next century. As we go forward with this debate, we \nbetter be sure that the serious transportation needs of the American \npeople, of their businesses, of their jobs, of their regions, and their \nStates are being met by this bill.\n  Frankly, there is some good to be said for this legislation. I have \nmy doubts that ultimately it achieves the goal that the distinguished \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the \ndistinguished ranking member are seeking. Those are not the objectives \nthat we see being met as we discuss the reauthorization of ISTEA.\n  Transportation, as we all know, is not just about roads, rail, and \nbike trails. It is about the economy. It is about jobs. It is about \nmoving goods efficiently and effectively. It is about building better \ncommunities. It is about a quality of life that surrounds our \ntransportation networks or, in fact, is developed as a result of \nefficient and competent transportation infrastructure. It is about \nsmart investment. It is about protecting our environment and human \nhealth. It is about quality of life in its fullest expanse. It is about \nmaking sure that we do what we can to leave a clean environment for \nfuture generations. It is about being more independent and not simply \njust asking other countries to supply us with oil at whatever price \nthey determine the market will bear. We never know when that changes, \nas we saw if we look at history back just a couple of decades.\n  So this is far more than simply, again, roads and rails and \nwaterways. It is about quality of life. It also, frankly, tells us what \nAmerica is going to be doing in the next century to be more competitive \nin this global marketplace. That is a very serious question for us, \nbecause as we see the European Union forming to establish its \neconomies, we know they are going to be using the latest in technology. \nThey have far, far better rail and transit systems than we see \ntypically in our country--high-speed rail. We see roads where the \npavement endures a far greater period of time than do those in our \ncountry and in our States.\n  So we have to think very long and hard about how this Congress is \ngoing to make its mark on transportation investments and policies for \nthe next 6 years. The question is, Does this legislation fully address \nthe needs of the national transportation system and provide necessary \nfunding and guidance where it is most needed? Do we consider \ntransportation issues as if they affect the whole country? Because \nwhether they are about roads in New Jersey or roads in Illinois or \nroads throughout the Northeast or North-South, the fact is it has a \nbearing on the way society functions, the way our country's economy \nproduces.\n  Sometimes those issues get lost, Mr. President, when we see the \nregional differences kind of expand, when we see that now suddenly in \nthe closing period when the original version of ISTEA was produced, \nthere is a change being attempted in a very short period of time to \nchange formula, to change the way we function. I do not care which \nparty is in power or which region of the country has more seniority. \nThe fact is that we have to work together as a national enterprise \nbecause otherwise we will pay a price that is not yet seen nor \nunderstood.\n  When we talk about a transportation bill, do we consider such \ncritical factors as relieving choke points of congestion, ensuring \nadequate infrastructure in ports and along corridors to necessitate the \nfree flow of goods, providing sufficient access to remote areas of the \ncountry. I know that we hear from Senators whose States are more rural \nthan mine or some of the States that I have named in my list, but that \ndoes not mean that those people ought not have available transportation \nfacilities so that they can get their children to school or get to \nthe marketplace or get to their jobs. I am honestly concerned about \nthat. The Senators from the more rural States know very well that \nSenator Frank Lautenberg from New Jersey has tried to preserve things \nlike essential air service so that communities are not suddenly \nisolated and removed and not able to communicate with the rest of the \nworld outside their direct boundary.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Does the bill ensure that the most heavily traveled \ncorridors and highways are fully maintained and upgraded to handle not \nonly the traffic of today but the expectations for traffic tomorrow? So \nas I said at the beginning of my statement and as we are seeing, I have \nmy doubts.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will be happy to yield for a question.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I would like to put a question to the Senator from \nNew Jersey. The Senator's points are very well taken and particularly \nthe point that the Senator makes with regard to the synergies, if you \nwill, between different types of transportation modalities and how all \nof them come together in this ISTEA legislation.\n  I would like to call to my colleague's attention a picture really \nthat I shared earlier this morning concerning the pivotal role as \nalmost a hub State that Illinois plays in terms of national \ntransportation. Because our State, Illinois, is situated kind of in the \nmiddle of the country as it is and goes from north to south, as it \nturns out, most of the commodity flows--this is from 1993--as you can \nsee, most of the commodity flows go through the State of Illinois. \nWhether from California on the west, Florida on the south, Florida-\nTexas, or from the east coast, they come together at the hub in \nIllinois.\n  Yet, having said that, it is also a fact that Illinois right now is \nsuffering from inadequate attention to the convergence of \ntransportation and transit activities in the State. We have seen in my \nState real difficulties with road funding to begin with. I have some \nheadlines here: ``Illinois Roads in Shambles,'' and then it goes on \nwith report after report regarding the dismal shape of Illinois roads. \n``Illinois Roads Among the Worst in the Nation.'' That is on the road \npart of the equation.\n  On the transit part of the equation, it is also news back in my State \nthat there have been reductions in service for public transportation, \nmoving people from place to place so as to give a breadth, if you will, \nto the economic activity in the State.\n  So with both the road aspect of funding as well as the transit \nfunction, Illinois winds up being a hub State. Actually, in addition to \nbeing a hub State, Illinois is a donor State. We wind up contributing \nmore to the funding of our interstate highway program than many other \nStates. We are way down there in terms of dollars sent to Washington \nand dollars received back.\n  My question to my colleague would be whether or not the formula with \nrespect to highway funding takes into\n\n[[Page S10524]]\n\nadequate account the importance of the hub activities, of the \nconvergence of transportation modalities in a State such as Illinois \nand whether or not this legislation addresses the transportation needs \nof the country by failing to adequately do so?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Illinois for her question \nbecause it ties exactly into things that I see. The situation is not \ndissimilar, as I am sure the Senator is aware, from my State of New \nJersey. Much as Chicago and environs in Illinois are just at the \ncrossroads where the traffic flows east and west from the rich \nagricultural sectors of our country to the export opportunities at the \nports on the east coast or the marketplaces on the east coast and to \nthe places where habitation is large and the materials have to move \nrapidly in order to get there at an appropriate time for the product to \nbe effective in the marketplace, we have the same thing. Our corridor \nis north-south.\n  If one travels north-south in New Jersey, it helps originate some of \nthe jokes that frankly I don't like about, ``You live in New Jersey. \nWhat exit?'' People, trying to make jokes--again, I think poor jokes--\nthink of New Jersey as a large highway with some occasional rest stops \nalong the way. But we carry that traffic. We want to play our role in \nthe national being, in the national economy.\n  We try to make it convenient for the trucks and the traffic to pass \nthrough expeditiously, but we can't do it unless we have particular \nfunding addressed to those issues. Why should New Jersey be the \nrecipient of foul air created by that incredible amount of vehicular \ntraffic when it is not ours? We do not gouge the travelers at our \nservice stations or towns. Our prices are in keeping with the \nmarketplace because we want it to be a comfortable place. We don't want \nthe trucks and everybody else to wind up in traffic congestion, spewing \nfoul air. But we cannot pay for it entirely by ourselves. We are being \nasked to carry a load for the whole sector of the country. The Senator \nis right on the mark, and I hope she will take note of that as she \nevaluates this bill that is being proposed.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Will the Senator yield for another question? Is it \nnot a fact that the original ISTEA, Intermodal Surface Transportation \nAct, referred to the needs of local and interstate commerce, the \nnational and civil defense? And, in so doing, makes direct reference to \nthe needs of the various States to work together to collaborate in \nbehalf of our national interest in commerce, in both local commerce and \nnational commerce, as well as our defense needs? And is it not also a \nfact, therefore, that to the extent that this legislation focuses in \njust on miles of road as opposed to these goals of the act, that it not \nonly creates a burden for the States so affected, but also creates a \nburden for the country in failing to meet the express goals of the \noriginal legislation?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We certainly must consider that. If one looks back to \nthe origination of the highway system, going back into the 1950's, much \nof that was designed to assure that, if necessary, our defense \ncapability was strong, that we could move the traffic, move the \nequipment, move the personnel rapidly through our society. And that \ncannot be ignored. So that all of these things relate to the same \nneeds.\n  That emphasizes the fact--and once again I am grateful to my \ncolleague and friend from Illinois--it emphasizes the fact that this \nhas to be considered a national enterprise. And, suddenly, one region's \ngain against another's does little for the country. It may look like a \nnew sector is gaining something. They gain nothing if they don't have \nthe marketplace, if they don't have the access, if we can't move our \ntroops and equipment, Heaven forbid at a critical time, rapidly and \nefficiently. Then we have lost a lot more than the simple gain from an \nadjustment, untimely as this one, frankly, seems to be.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. If the Senator will yield, I suggest the biggest \nthreshold challenge that we have to overcome in this debate is a matter \nof one's perspective. If indeed this is seen as pitting one State's \ninterest against another State's interest, then one can arrive at a \nformula that rewards the powerful and ``who is on the committee,'' and \nall kinds of factors that have nothing to do with commerce, with our \nnational civil defense, with transportation or, indeed, our economy.\n  If, on the other hand, our perspective is one of those larger goals \nthat were pointed to in the original act, then that would lead to a \nformula in the first instance that would produce a very different \nresult, or a different result than the one that we see here.\n  So I ask my colleague whether or not it is his impression, since he \nhas worked so diligently and closely on this matter over time, whether \nor not the formula itself may be flawed in that it sets up this \ncompetition among and between the States instead of requiring us to \nfocus on what is in the interests of our country, what is in our \nnational interests, what is in the interests of transportation as a \ngeneric label for all the ways we move goods and services and matters \nof interest around, within the United States.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. My answer is that if there was--and there has been--a \nconcern about the formulas by which funds were distributed, that a \nreview is certainly in order. But the review, in my view, ought to take \nplace in an orderly fashion so it can be debated here on the floor, so \nit can be debated in the respective committees. There are several \ncommittees that have jurisdiction over parts of this. So it takes a \nlittle bit of time to get this done.\n  Now, because we have procrastinated so long in getting this done, it \nseems we have to rush to put in the new bill. Something that affects so \nmuch of the way we function as a society I think deserves more than a \nrush to judgment. Frankly, my offhand suggestion would be that we \nextend the current bill for a period of time. And I think 6 months \nwould be a disaster; probably a year, so that we can consider in a \nthoughtful forum what we ought to be looking at.\n  The Senator mentioned something very interesting. Right now there has \nbeen a change in the manner, the philosophy of the way this body \noperates. Power has moved in a particular direction. But what goes \naround comes around, as is said. Are we going to be looking at changes \nin structure for something as important as our transportation \ninfrastructure differently every time there is a power shift? If it's \nDemocrats one time and Republicans the next; if it's western one time \nand eastern or southern or central the next, will we therefore at that \npoint in time suddenly make changes that take care of our region? Do \nyou know what that will produce? Everyone knows what that will produce: \nChaos. It will produce competition at the worst level.\n  I see it now in State after State, where some States are willing to \nmodify their environmental requirements, willing to modify their labor \nrequirements, to try to steal business from another State. What good \ndoes it do us in the final analysis? It does us no good because \neventually the price is paid. I am going to talk about that a little \nbit later.\n  My State is a State that has prospered. We benefited from some of the \ningenuity that went into the development of the industrial revolution. \nMuch of it took place in the State of New Jersey. Edison and his \nnumerous inventions were largely out of New Jersey. We have a high-\ntechnology business in pharmaceuticals and electronics and computers. \nAs the Senator knows, I was in the computer business before I came to \nthe Senate. Some days, ruefully, I look back, especially payday. But \nthe fact of the matter is that we are a high-technology State and thus \nwe have been able to create a pretty good job market.\n  The result is that New Jersey is No. 50 among States--last--in \ngetting a return on the tax dollars it sends here to Washington. And I \nhear about it from all of my constituents, let me tell you. They don't \nunderstand why it is we are sending money down here and, where we have \na slight advantage, which has been in ISTEA, the transportation bill, \nsuddenly now it is being taken away. The question is being asked back \nhome, whether by a newspaper or in town meetings or just individual \ndiscussions: Are they after New Jersey again? Do they want to make us \npay more of our tax dollars into the national interest so States that \nare poverty stricken or don't have the job network or don't have the \neconomic infrastructure that we have, they want to take it again from \nNew Jersey? My answer, unfortunately, has to be, ``I think so.'' \nBecause that is the way it looks, based on what the formulas are.\n\n[[Page S10525]]\n\n  I want to see the day when we stand on the floor of this U.S. Senate \nand we talk about distributions of tax dollars received here in \nWashington. Maybe what we ought to do is put this under an umbrella \nthat says everybody gets 100 cents on the dollar. Every State, send \nyour money to Washington, you get it back. We will see how the roads \nthat cross through some States function; and we will see how welfare, \nand how education assistance, and nutrition for children gets taken \ncare of in those States.\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. If the Senator will yield for another question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Please.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. That seems to me exactly the point. When you base \na formula on per capita income, what happens then is, No. 1, just at \nthe outset you wind up penalizing those States that are contributing \nthe most.\n  There is an interesting quote out of the Advisory Committee on \nIntergovernmental Relations, which I want to call my colleague's \nattention to, which says, ``Per capita income is not a proxy for State \nwealth.''\n  That is exactly what is happening, using that as a proxy for State \nwealth. It is much to the point. It is not just a matter of sharing. \nBecause, if anything, I would encourage the Senator from New Jersey and \nmy colleagues to think about this as something in which we are called \nupon to share. We are called upon to share resources in our national \ninterest to see to it that the transportation needs of our country are \nadequately addressed.\n  But what we have here, it seems to me, is a formula that is flawed--\nNo. 1, in regards to the numbers that go underneath it that are used to \ndetermine State wealth, on the one hand. It seems to be flawed also in \nnot giving adequate consideration to the use and reuse and overuse, in \nsome instances, of transportation modalities, whether they are roads or \nhighways or transit systems. The fact is, the more people you have the \nmore these systems are going to be used. Just like any other physical \nthing, the more that it is used the more it deteriorates.\n  So we have a situation in which infrastructure, as a fundamental \nissue, is addressed in this legislation based on a series and a host of \nfactors and considerations that may not adequately comprehend that this \ninfrastructure is infrastructure that serves all of our needs. It's not \njust New Jersey's roads or Illinois' roads. It's roads through which \nAmerican products will move, roads over which Americans travel, \ntransportation that allows for an American economy. All of us have an \ninvestment and a stake in seeing to it that all of the States that form \nthe crux of our economic mix get adequately served by the allocation \nthat this formula represents.\n  So, my question to my colleague--and this will be my last question to \nmy colleague--my question to my colleague is whether or not he believes \nthat it will be possible for us to engage with the committee and \nothers--I am not a member of the committee but at the same time have \ntried to interact with the committee that made this decision--but \nwhether or not, if we were given the additional time to take up these \nquestions, in terms of whether the formula presently being used to \nallocate resources actually meets the needs of our country--if given \nadditional time we might be able to reshape some of the integral parts \nof that decisionmaking in way that it would more closely serve the \ngoals of the Transportation Act?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Once again, I say to my colleague from Illinois, I \nagree fully with the response that was elicited, because of the nature \nof the question. It is our Nation. It is a national goal. It is a \nnational objective and we have to keep that in mind.\n  I know the Senator from Illinois shares my view that when an \nemergency comes in our country, and whether it be floods or earthquakes \nor tornadoes, our hearts are breaking here. I say, this was across \nparty lines, both parties. When we saw the people in North Dakota and \nSouth Dakota and States like that during the flood, I never voted \nagainst funding for FEMA, for our Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nor those actions that were taken to get a community restored after a \nnatural disaster. It is then and then only, it seems, that we are \nreminded that we are a national unit, that we are a national \nfederation, that we are one country.\n  Suddenly we will spring into action when it comes to relieving the \ndistress that results from a natural disaster; a consequence. We have \nto keep that in mind when we look here at what we are doing on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate today. That is, ensuring that all States in \nall parts of the country are treated with a degree of fairness. I know \nwe will hear from other colleagues who say: Well, New Jersey has been a \ndonee State, gotten back more than it has sent down in gasoline tax.\n  I say yes, that is true. That is true. It was the only place, as I \nmentioned earlier, that we could make up for the deficiency in return \non our tax dollars that we usually get from the transmissions that we \nmake. So this is why I am so intent on making sure that this new piece \nof legislation, this reauthorization, this NEXTEA, or whatever we want \nto call it, reflects the fact that New Jersey is being shortchanged \nhere as are these other seven or eight States, drastically \nshortchanged, and that we want to try to restore it if he we can and \nbring sense to the thing. We will have an earnest debate, however long \nthat takes, to see that the adjustments are properly made.\n  The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, known as ISTEA, \nexpired less than 2 weeks ago. ISTEA in its origination was far-\nreaching and visionary, and we ought to keep that as a theme for what \nwe are doing now. It declared for the first time that the interstate \nsystem was complete and that transportation policy and planning should \nshift the focus from building eight-lane highways to improving the \ntransportation systems in our communities.\n  Earlier transportation policies specifically encouraged people to \nabandon existing communities and cities in favor of new development in \npreviously untouched green spaces--the suburbs.\n  (Mr. THOMAS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the suburbs have become the \nresidential location of choice, and traffic patterns have shifted \naccordingly. I have seen it, once again, in my own State, and I have \nseen it in bordering States, where a new highway will be built which is \ndesigned to serve traffic that exists there and traffic that might \ndevelop. Within no time--and I say this, again, coming from the most \ndensely populated State in the Union--in no time, there are traffic \njams on those highways, be it Highway 78, Highway 24 or Highway 80. I \ncan give you the list of highways that were built which looked like \nthey were the highways of the future and, before you know it, they are \nthe highways of yesterday, because people took advantage of the \nopportunity to move out of town: ``Let's get out of here.''\n  It hasn't spoken very well of our urban policy, I will tell you that, \nbecause what happened in the grand design that emerged in the early \nfifties by my former commander in chief, also the commander in chief of \nthe Senator from Rhode Island, then became President, was a system for \nnational highway transportation that had an unfortunate consequence. \nThe distinguished Senator from New York, Senator Moynihan, often talks \nabout how it enabled people to leave the problems of the cities behind, \nmove out to the suburbs and, as a consequence, we have had the despair \nthat has followed in the cities because the revenue bases were taken \naway from them.\n  We found out that that is not a particularly good policy for America \nand that we have to make sure we have a balanced transportation \nnetwork, one that permits a city dweller to get to work in another part \nof the city or another city, just as it does to aid the rural resident \nin getting to his or her place of work and the needs that each of the \nfamilies has.\n  A 1996 report conducted by the Eno Transportation Foundation entitled \n``Commuting in America II,'' found that today, the dominant commuting \nflow pattern is suburban, with 50 percent of the Nation's commuters \nliving in the suburbs and over 41 percent of all jobs located there, up \nfrom 37 percent in 1980. Suburban areas are now the main destination of \nwork trips. The report also found there was a substantial increase in \nreverse commuting, central city to suburbs, commuting rose from 9 \npercent share of growth over the decade from 1970 to 1980 to 12 percent \nfrom 1980 to 1990.\n\n[[Page S10526]]\n\n  However, earlier transportation policies also discouraged land use \nplanning, creating new and growing congestion around new and growing \ncommunities. While our cities died, our metropolitan areas grew too \nquickly and overwhelmed the infrastructure. So there is a paradox here: \nIn one way, the cities were falling moribund and, in another way, \nsuddenly these metropolitan areas just grew around them and became \nalmost the definition of--certainly far more than a metropolis. The \nsuburban sprawl drew industry to the suburbs and drained cities of \nincome and jobs. This trend continues today and is even expanding.\n  The effect of this trend on such critical issues as quality of life, \nsafety, the environment and economic development is undeniable. I want \nto read from a study by the Surface Transportation Policy Project. It \nsaid:\n\n       One of the most far-reaching effects of our transportation \n     spending patterns is the increasingly spread-out pattern of \n     American cities. The results of this new pattern range from \n     the loss of open space--\n\n  We know that happens regularly.\n\n     sprawl consumes a million and a half acres of farmland each \n     year--to more driving and the problems it creates.\n\n  One study found that vehicle miles traveled per household increased \nby 25 to 30 percent when residential density is cut in half. Just think \nabout it. Vehicle miles traveled per person increased by 25 to 30 \npercent when residential density was cut in half.\n  Do you know what that means, Mr. President? Cars, cars, cars, cars, \ncars. And how do you handle them efficiently is a large question. We \nhave talked at times about the elimination of Amtrak as a real \npossibility if we don't tend to its capital needs, the elimination of \nour only major inter-city passenger rail service in the country. Look \nat what happens if that disappears.\n  If it disappears, the airspace between Boston and Washington would \nrequire that we put up 10,000 737 flights a year or more. Can you \nimagine? Right now, look at Newark Airport. It is beautifully designed, \na very progressive airport. Constant delays. Why? Because the airspace \nabove the airport cannot accommodate the number of flights we would \nrequire.\n  Look at the highways. It would put hundreds of thousands of cars or \nmore per year on the highways between Boston, New York, and Washington. \nNot a terribly good idea.\n  ISTEA was designed to try and grapple with these problems in trends \nin a fair, sound, and efficient manner. It sought to employ sounder \nland-use planning by incorporating communities into the process. It \nrecognized good transportation policy does not mean simply pouring more \nconcrete and asphalt. Instead, it focused on moving goods and people in \na way that makes the most sense for our Nation, our States, our \neconomy, and our communities.\n  ISTEA increased planning and flexibility and placed emphasis on local \ndecisionmaking, encouraged new technology and made environmental and \nsocial needs a priority. I saw some of that new technology in place \nyesterday when a coalition of firms appeared in the Capitol and showed \nus what might be by way of new transportation opportunities with the \nuse of technology.\n  They talked about an experiment near San Diego, CA. A 7.2-mile \nsection of road was equipped with magnets. We heard from someone from \nthe Department of Federal Highways about a ride that she was taking at \nfairly high speeds, the normal speed for this section of the country on \nthese highways. She suddenly realized that her driver was reading USA \nToday looking at the sports section.\n  I asked if he got in the back seat and she drove the car. She said, \nno, he was still in the front seat behind the wheel, and here he was \nreading a newspaper as he was traveling along at 60 to 70 miles per \nhour. They employed new technology, and when they equip the cars with \nthe appropriate transmission and receiving response from the magnets on \nthe highways, they are able to move along with the traffic. You can go \nto sleep if you want to, and if the traffic slows, the vehicle slows.\n  It is a wonderful thing, but it needs investment. In order to do \nthat, we have to make sure that our transportation planning \nincorporates all of these suggestions, as well as more highways and \nmore transportation opportunities are made available.\n  I know that in the New York-New Jersey region, there is a new \ntechnology to pay tolls. It is relatively painless until you get the \nbill, and then you see it has been a daunting experience. But with just \na little device put on the windshield, you can ride through tolls on \nthe George Washington Bridge, and the other bridges and highways around \nthe New York area. It is going to be expanded. It shows what can happen \nwhen there is cooperation among various agencies on a bi-State basis. \nYou can improve things without impairing any State's right to grow and \ndevelop. It is working very well. That is just a small precursor of \nwhat we might expect in the future if we employ technology properly.\n  Those are the kinds of things that we have to think about as we \ninvest in our transportation system.\n  ISTEA is where this regard for technology really developed. It was \nthen called Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems. I was the author of \nmuch of that part of the bill. I tried something different. I tried to \ndevelop what we might call intelligent drivers. It was an impossible \ntask, Mr. President. So instead, we tried to develop intelligent \ntechnologies so that the car would take over driving; it didn't have to \ndepend on the driver's emotion to keep it cool and keep it straight.\n  It worked very well. The advances are just beginning to develop. That \nis so consistent with what our future planning ought to be about that \nwe have to make sure that everything is encompassed in this very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  ISTEA increased planning and flexibility, placed emphasis on local \ndecisionmaking, encouraged new technology and made environment and \nsocial needs a priority.\n  ISTEA strongly reaffirmed the Federal commitment in transportation \nplanning and investment. While the Nation's existing infrastructure \ncontinues to decay and we face reduced budgets, economic competition \ndemands ever increasing efficiency and growth. Federal policy should \ncontinue to emphasize these goals while empowering local and regional \ngovernments to make their own decisions on transportation investment. \nAs we approach the close of the 20th century, we need to build upon \nISTEA's successes to prepare for more intense global economic and \ntechnological competition.\n  Transportation investment has a direct and indirect impact on our \neconomy and society. Transportation by itself generates 20 percent of \nthe gross domestic product. Each billion dollars invested in \ntransportation produces more than 25,000 construction-related jobs. A \nsound, efficient, and innovative transportation system will make a \nmajor contribution to national efforts to match the productivity of our \ntrading partners.\n  As we begin to consider the next surface transportation \nreauthorization bill, we need to think more deeply about what it is \nthat we really want to achieve. The most important goal is to ensure a \nsound transportation system, one that recognizes that commerce and \ntravel does not necessarily stop at a State's border. It recognizes \nthat we are a nation of States and not autonomous nation-States. Our \neconomy depends on the free and efficient flow of goods. It depends on \none sector taking advantage of its natural opportunities, be it \nagriculture or lumber or other things, while another State takes care \nof its availability of energy and another takes advantage of its \nability in telecommunications and electronics.\n  That is what makes us the Nation that we are. I have great respect \nfor the farming and agricultural population of our country. The \nexchange of opportunity for them is important to me. I cooperate, as I \nsaid earlier, when they need flood control measures or irrigation \nopportunities. That then ought to beget reciprocation from those parts \nof the country when we look at a State like New Jersey, an industrial \nState.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair is not at liberty to answer, \nbut I will pose a rhetorical question. That is, which State has the \nmost horses per acre of any State in the country? I will answer because \nI know that the occupant of the chair, being a Senator from Wyoming, \nwould love to respond, but I will take advantage of my position\n\n[[Page S10527]]\n\nhaving the microphone to answer. It is New Jersey. New Jersey has more \nhorses per acre than any other State in the country.\n  That surprises people because they think of us as having more \nsmokestacks than any other part of the country. Well, the fact is that \nNew Jersey is a place where people like to live, horses like to live, \nand we raise them. We do not have, I do not think, the bucking bronco \ntype that we see in Wyoming, but we have horses fleet of foot and the \nheadquarters of the equestrian society in this country.\n  So we are interconnected, interrelated. That is what intermodal talks \nabout. Simply put, that means the success of our transportation policy \ncannot always be measured by an evaluation of dollar-for-dollar return \non gas consumption or other criteria that denies real transportation \nproblem solutions and trends confronting the entire Nation.\n  I would wager--and I have traveled across most of this country, so \nthat I have seen small cities in less populated States--one thing I \nhave noticed is that they all have something in common, the cities in \nmy State and the cities in other States. They have traffic congestion \nat the wrong time--at perhaps the right time, because that is when \npeople are commuting from work and from school and from home and \nshopping and all of those things.\n  Our policy should not be designed to pit State against State but \nshould be designed for effective, efficient, and economically sound \ntransportation, while at the same time it encourages rational and \nreasonable planning and new construction to meet anticipated new \ngrowth.\n  As I have said, I fear that for all of its good intention, this bill \ndoes not succeed in accomplishing this goal. We need one national \ntransportation policy to promote a national system. In an era of a \nshrinking budget, the least we should do is prioritize our investments, \nthe least that we should do is to ensure that our existing \ntransportation system is adequately maintained and preserved before \nthere are significant investments in new capacity.\n  Unfortunately, the incentive at the State and local level is to build \nnew roads, complete with ribbon-cutting ceremonies and all of the \nhoopla that goes along with an occasion like that, but to rather do \nthat, it seems, than the less glamorous job of investing in the proper \nmaintenance of existing roads. That is a less glamorous pursuit and \ndoes not get the same kind of interest. But if you are driving along \nand you are bouncing on potholes and you can't get by road construction \nprojects, it is quickly understood.\n  Since 1991, more than half of the highway money available for repairs \nand to be spent in metropolitan areas has been diverted to State \ndepartments of transportation to pay for the construction of new \nhighways. This, in my judgment, is a bad way to invest. Building a new \nroad costs far more per mile than repairing an existing one.\n  New roads in metropolitan areas have been estimated to cost as much \nas $1 billion a mile. And I can give a specific example in the New York \nmetropolitan area. In contrast, the Federal Highway Administration \nestimates that it costs approximately $1.26 million for 1 mile of \npavement reconstruction on urban highways.\n  Put another way, the way to fix what we have in favor of building new \ncapacity also costs money. The FHWA estimated the cost of routine \nmaintenance of pavement in good condition at about 8 cents per square \nfoot, whereas the cost of rehabilitating failed pavement was closer to \n80 cents per square foot--10 times the amount that it would require if \nit was maintained in good condition.\n  There is another thing, and we have been reading a lot about it of \nlate, and that is the time that pavement lasts in other countries, \nespecially in Europe, is far, far longer than we see in our country. We \nought to be looking at that problem as we review our highway needs to \nsee whether we can get longer use out of existing roads without having, \nagain, construction blockades and things of that nature.\n  This bill as written abandons ISTEA's programs that place emphasis on \npreservation and maintenance of the existing infrastructure in favor of \nlaying new roadbed. In my opinion, we are headed in the wrong \ndirection. We must first take care of what we have rather than spend \nbillions of dollars on new paving.\n  Mr. President, I have not risen to speak in order to deny new \ntransportation needs. That is not my mission, because I have had a long \nrecord of involvement with transportation. I am in the Senate now 15 \nyears and have been involved with transportation for all of those \nyears, because in my State transportation is the lifeblood of our \nexistence.\n  So I favor spending more money on transportation infrastructure. I \nfavor the modality of rail and high-speed trains and aviation and \nhighways and waterways. We are now seeing a proliferation in the New \nYork area of ferries crossing the Hudson River and the East River to \nget people from State to State without having to wait for long lines \nthrough tunnels and bridges and congestion, and working very well.\n  So all of these things have to be considered. I want us to invest in \nall of them. What I am talking about this very day is to consider that \nthese are national obligations and we ought to invest accordingly.\n  Any legislation we consider and pass should recognize the fact that \nwhat we face in critical transportation corridors is crumbling \ninfrastructure, roadways that are falling apart and unable to bear the \nload they carry.\n  My plea here is for prudence and sound economic policy. What I am \ntalking about is ensuring that our tax dollars are used wisely and well \nand that our transportation policies will meet the real needs of both \ntoday and the next century.\n  We underinvest in our transportation infrastructure, Mr. President. \nOur Nation's future standard of living depends on our infrastructure. \nYet, for many years we have failed to make needed investments, and \nAmericans are paying a price for this failure. In metropolitan and \nsuburban areas throughout our country traffic congestion has become a \nmajor problem. Commuters waste hour after hour sitting in traffic. They \nsit in their cars unproductive, tempers running away from them, time \nlost, time away from families, away from spouses, away from children. \nIt is a terrible waste of time, and it is eroding the quality of life \nfor millions of Americans.\n  Our roads are not being maintained. Potholes mar our streets and \nhighways. Bridges are deteriorating. Our railroads and transit systems \nare not being maintained sufficiently nor being invested in \nsufficiently to take advantage of new technologies.\n  Too many airports are underequipped, and delays are rampant. The sky \ncan be used far more efficiently than we are using it. We get tied up \nwith weather delays in this country. In other countries, some of them \nhave figured out how to land in weather in which it is almost ground \nzero. It is because the technology is available. We do not use those \ntechniques in our country. The scope of these problems is enormous, Mr. \nPresident.\n  In 1994, the Federal Highway Administration estimated that 57 percent \nof all roads have been allowed to deteriorate into poor quality, into \nmediocre or fair condition. They also estimated that 30 percent of \nmajor urban roads suffer from congestion.\n  According to the 1995 National Bridge Inventory, there are 186,000 \nstructurally deficient or functionally obsolete bridges. That is a \nterrible condition. We have seen the bridge collapses. We have seen \ntieups around bridges. We have seen sudden emergency calls to replace \nthe bridges which cannot be done in a hurry. We ought to be taking care \nof the maintenance of these things in a proper fashion.\n  Mr. President, failing to meet our transportation infrastructure has \nreal economic needs. One study estimated that congestive roads in our \nNation's 25 largest urban areas costs motorists $43 billion annually in \nwasted time and fuel-- $43 billion. I guess when it is said like this, \nthe impact isn't real. When it is translated into costs per person or \ncost per family, it comes down to a significant burden that we all have \nto carry.\n  Another study estimates that American motorists spent an additional \n$21.5 billion in extra vehicle operating costs in 1994 as a result of \ndriving on roads in poor or fair condition.\n  I will not identify the community, but I was driving Friday night, it \nwas\n\n[[Page S10528]]\n\nafter dark, about 8 o'clock at night, and I hit a pothole that was so \ndeep that I thought the wheels fell off my car. I got out to see if \nthere was any damage, and I could not see it. But this thing was 1\\1/2\\ \nfeet deep. Imagine hitting that if you are going 30 miles an hour and \nsuddenly--and it had to be 2 feet wide, so it caught the wheel very, \nvery fully.\n  We see it all the time in all the States across the country. I hear \nabout the condition of roads. The Senator from Illinois held up a \nnewspaper article in which it said Illinois had among the worst \nroadways in the country. Well, I think that can be imagined by lots of \npeople as they travel the roads in their own States. It is an \ninexplicable condition that arises around when we say that we want \nthings to be better but we are unwilling to make the investments in \nmaintenance and care that we ought to.\n  Meaning no slight to the auto and truck repair industry, with \nstatistics like these it is clear that at least one sector of our \neconomy will continue to prosper if these conditions are not addressed.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, in 1994, $57 billion \nin capital investment would have been required from all levels of \nGovernment just to maintain--now that is in 1994, $57 billion would \nhave been required just to maintain 1993 conditions in performance. \nImagine that. In 1 year we created a need for $57 billion in capital \njust to maintain the level of quality that existed on our roads.\n  In 1993, by comparison, we spent only $40 billion on highway and \ntransit capital investment compared to the $57 billion that would have \nbeen required a year later.\n  In other words, to simply maintain current conditions and performance \non our highway and transit systems we would have to have increased \ninvestments by over 40 percent. This kind of dramatic underinvestment, \nMr. President, simply cannot be sustained without our entire country \npaying a severe price in the long run. Keep in mind, Mr. President, \nthat what we need to do more than simply maintain current conditions of \nperformance if America is going to compete successfully in the future, \nwe need to make improvements, as well. There is just no escaping the \nneed for a greater commitment of resources.\n  For example, to invest in all those highway improvements that would \nyield greater benefits than costs, the Department of Transportation \nestimates we would have to invest $80 billion. In other words, to \nimprove conditions to optimal levels based on economic and engineering \nfactors, we have to double our current capital investment in highway \nand transit.\n  We, in this body, often talk about the importance of the marketplace \nin driving the economy. Well, Mr. President, I have owned, started, and \noperated a business and I know firsthand that investment in the long \nterm is required. The first question that we should ask of any \nlegislation that purports to address transportation needs is whether in \nthe long term it is going to help or hinder our Nation's ability to \ncompete effectively in the global marketplace, and whether it will meet \nthe needs of our citizens on a day-to-day and year-to-year basis.\n  I feel especially strongly about the importance of transportation \nbecause in my State, as I said earlier, it is critical.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. SARBANES. This transportation bill is critical to every Member of \nthe Senate. It is highly critical to every State, is it not?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. It certainly is. To answer the question of the \nSenator even more broadly, the fact of the matter is that in this \nchange in program some States have had adjustments that are as high as \n48 or 50 percent over their previous year, while other States took a \ncut. So when the Senator asks is it critical to every State, \nabsolutely.\n  In a State like that of the Senator from Maryland or my State, it has \na unique character because of the crowded conditions under which our \npeople live--densely populated States, metropolitan States.\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further for a question, I \nsimply ask the Senator, in fact, my State is the second-highest traffic \ndensity on the urban interstates of any State in the Nation. You may be \nNo. 1. Now, that makes a very important point.\n  The purpose of the Federal Highway Program is to provide a high-\nquality road system. I understand the claim of donor States and I am \nnot trying to minimize that. I think attention has to be paid to that.\n  On the other hand, I always thought that the system was directed \ntoward the system's needs. The purpose is to construct an interstate \nhighway system that serves the entire country, and I think if you are \ngoing to have real equity in the distribution of highway funds you need \nto look at things like urban areas of highway traffic density, high \nvolume of vehicle miles traveled per lane mile, other systems that \nindicate how heavily the infrastructure is being used. I understand in \nrural States they have a different kind of problem and we need to take \naccount of that as well.\n  One of my difficulties with this bill, and I ask the Senator whether \nit is the same, if he has the same perception, is that this aspect of \ndeveloping an interstate highway system--of course, we built the \nsystem. Much of it now needs repair and rehabilitation\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Or maintenance.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In my State, we have not yet finished the interstate \nsystem. We have some very pressing problems in the Western part of my \nState with respect to certain interchanges. It was not done the way it \nshould have been done to begin with, and we now have to address that \nproblem.\n  I say to the Senator from New Jersey, I take it it is your \nperception, as well, that these considerations of system need and the \nneeds of the heavily urban areas in which there is this very heavy, \nheavy traffic, have not been adequately addressed in this legislation.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I could not agree more.\n  What has happened is the proposed formula is a much more mathematical \nexercise. It says if you put in this dollar's worth of gas tax, that \nyou have to get back your dollar's worth of investment in the highways.\n  On the other hand, States like yours and States like mine get a far \nless return on our total tax dollars, those dollars sent to the Federal \nGovernment, than many or most States in the country. In my case, we \nhappen to be number 50 in return on dollars that we send down to \nWashington. This was one place that there was an opportunity to regain \nsome of the advantage that was rightfully ours, and it is being \nignored.\n\n  So to answer the Senator's question, there are many conditions that \nought to be evaluated in terms of a national transportation investment \nthat go beyond simply the dollar-for-dollar return on gas tax. It ought \nto consider what contribution does the State of Maryland, does the \nState of Rhode Island, does the State of New Jersey make to the \nnational economy, to the national well-being as a result of having its \nroads available and open and in decent condition so that traffic that \ngoes from place to place--from the market, from the farm to the port, \nfrom the factory to the airport--what kind of a return ought we to get \nfor that? What kind of compensation ought we get for that?\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield further, I think he is \naddressing a very important point.\n  Let me give an example from my State. Maryland has one of the highest \ndensity levels on urban interstate in the country, as I said before, \nsecond. Apparently, New Jersey is first. The Baltimore-Washington \nregion interstates are the second most congested in the Nation. Now, my \ncolleagues can appreciate this because they are here in Washington and \nthey have some experience with this highway network I am talking about.\n  We are in the center of the I-95 corridor, the north to south \ncorridor. This corridor generates a huge amount of commercial and \npassenger traffic. It is adjacent to the Nation's Capital which \ngenerates additional commercial and personal through traffic. We are \nserving not just our own needs but national needs by having a first-\nrate interstate system here. In fact, we have a disproportionately \nlarge responsibility for complex infrastructure projects that\n\n[[Page S10529]]\n\nneed maintenance and rehabilitation. These projects--I-95, the Capitol \nbeltway, the Baltimore beltway, I-70--all carry through traffic \ngenerated outside the State of Maryland. Now, there are other States \nalong the eastern corridor--New Jersey is an obvious example--that are \nsort of through States. In other words, a lot of highway traffic is \nmoving through those States, going from one point to another point, and \nneither point related to the State through which they are passing.\n  Yes, we have to invest significant amounts of money, not only the \nFederal share that we receive, but State and local share as well, in \norder to maintain this highway network if we are going to maintain the \nexisting infrastructure and have the efficient movement of freight and \npassenger traffic.\n  Now, my perception of this bill is it does not adequately address \nthat consideration, that that is one of the things that has not been \nfocused on.\n  The formula allocation represents a very significant drop for my \nState from 1.72 to 1.51. The amount of money now that is provided for \nthe interstate discretionary program, as I understand it in this \nlegislation, is severely limited. As I understand it, and I ask the \nSenator from New Jersey, there is only $140 million a year nationwide \nfor both interstate highways and bridges, is that correct?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is correct, and it is an appropriate deficiency \nto note.\n  By the way, as the Senator talks about the State of Maryland and a \nchange in formula, ours goes from 2.82 to 2.41. There is a difference \nof more than 15 percent in just that change in formula.\n  The Senator was not in the Chamber when I talked about the fact that \nif changes were necessitated in formula, they should have been debated \nat length. They should have had the appropriate kind of committee \nreviews. I know the Senator sits on the committee where transit needs \nare considered. We have the Commerce Committee involved with aviation \nand rail, we have the Environment Committee on which I sit and under \nwhose auspice this bill is presented for highway and road travel. To \nsuddenly change that formula without considering the national aspects \nof the requirements that Maryland has imposed upon it or that New \nJersey has imposed upon it--Maryland happens to be in a critical \nlocation in terms of our defense needs. If there is an emergency, we \nhave to be able to move troops and equipment through in a hurry. That \nreadiness costs something to maintain.\n  There is also a requirement, I know the State of Maryland shares with \nNew Jersey an interest in having high-speed rail service pass through \nyour State and commuter rail service. Look at the success we have seen \njust with the establishment of WAMATA. The investments in those areas \nare critical if we are going to have a national perspective.\n  Can you imagine a system to serve the Capital and environs that isn't \ncontributed to in significant measure by the Federal Government? As it \nhappens, it is, but it describes very poignantly the need that exists \nwhen you participate in a national scheme.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Could I make a correction? The Senator from Maryland was \nin error in a statement.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am happy to yield for a response.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. There was only $140 million available for interstate \nrepair and maintenance. That is in the Secretary's discretionary \naccount and that is exactly what he has under the currently existing \nISTEA measure, but divided among the States it is some $6 billion--with \na ``b'' for billion.\n  So it is a long way from the $140 million the Senator thought was all \nthat was available.\n  Mr. SARBANES. The amount that is divided among the States, as I \nunderstand it, is a formula allocation.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. That is right.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I recognize there is a formula allocation. Here is the \nproblem, and I am glad the Senator interjected because I think it is \nvery important to focus on this problem. I understand the committee's \nproblem. The committee had to do a formula allocation, Members are at \nthem from all over the place, about the formula allocation.\n  Now, I concur with the Senator from New Jersey, and I appreciate his \ncontinuing to yield to me for a question. We didn't know what the \nformula figure was going to be until the committee came out with the \nformula figure, and then we were presented with this formula figure. So \nwe take a strong hit on the formula which I think does not adequately \nrecognize the kind of transportation challenges with which we are \nconfronted which have a national import.\n  Now, in addition to the formula allocation, there are also other \nmoneys that are available in the legislation--various discretionary \nprograms. The interstate discretionary program is one, the public land \nhighways is another, the Appalachian regional highway program is yet \nanother, and there are others, as well, which can be used if the \ncommittee is saying to us we can't do the formula allocation in a way \nthat takes into account all of these considerations. Then the least the \ncommittee should do is have these other programs which can then be used \nto offset the unfavorable impact of the formula allocations. It is my \nperception that that hasn't been done, as well.\n  Now, we have one unique problem in my State that I want to bring to \npeople's attention, and that is, the Federal Government owns the \nWoodrow Wilson Bridge; it is federally owned. It is the only facility \non the interstate system in which that is the case. Now, the committee \nhas provided $900 million, and that is certainly an important step \nforward, but it is barely over half of what would be required to get a \nnew Woodrow Wilson Bridge, which every expert agrees is necessary.\n  Now, the States have indicated that once a new bridge is done, they \nare willing to take over the responsibility of maintaining it from then \non out. But it is clearly unfair to dump the responsibility upon them \nthat was not met by the Federal Government. There is no way the States \ncan pay for this thing. Maryland receives, under the formula \nallocation, a little over $300 million a year in Federal highway money. \nWe are going to need, for one bridge, $1.6 to $1.8 billion, and this \nlegislation provides $900 million. I think it is the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility, frankly, to deal with the problem of this \nbridge. They need to face up and deal with that problem. Once they have \ndealt with it, then it can be shifted over to State responsibility. But \nyou ought not to dump this responsibility, which the Federal Government \nfailed to meet, upon the State. So this is a whole list of the kind of \nproblems we are talking about, which this legislation fails to come to \ngrips with.\n  (Mr. SANTORUM assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Well, if I might say to the Senator from Maryland, $900 \nmillion gets you a pretty good bridge, I think, if the Senator is \ndiscouraged by only $900 million for the bridge. I appreciate their \napproach to that as well. There have been some estimates that go as \nhigh as $1.6 billion. But the Senator ought to be aware of what the \nHouse proposal is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am aware of what the House does. I am not arguing the \nHouse bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. The House bill left it entirely up to Virginia and \nMaryland. So I would hope that the Senator would be somewhat grateful \nfor what the Senate is doing.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Well, I think we indicated that we understood the \ncommittee has done something. I am pointing out that it is not adequate \nto meet the problem. This is a pressing problem in the interstate \nsystem. The House approach would actually create a gaping hole in the \ninterstate system. I think the committee recognized that problem at \nleast. But, again, I am talking about this in the context of the other \nthings that are happening in this legislation. If the committee came to \nme and said, look, we have to redo a formula allocation, we understand \nthe problems it creates for you, we understand you have some other \npressing highway needs, and we are trying to help you address those, \nbut that hasn't happened. Any effort to try to get at that hasn't met \nwith any success.\n  I understand the committee has a difficult job and I, frankly, have \nbeen supportive of the effort to try to find more money with which the \ncommittee can work. I say to my friend from New Jersey, isn't it a fact \nthat if more money were available, it would be easier to work out these \nproblems?\n\n[[Page S10530]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Absolutely.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Some of us have supported the committee in its effort \nto find more money, and you come in and you are confronted with a bill \nlike this.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I had an opportunity earlier today to talk about \nthat. I will soon yield to my good friend from Montana. I had an \nobservation earlier today in a discussion that we had in miniconference \nout here that more money is more money, except that if more money comes \nand we continue to lose our share, it doesn't do what we think it ought \nto do, which is to improve the system generally, but not at the expense \nof our respective States. That is really the nub of our discussion.\n  If the Senator from Montana is asking if I will yield for a response, \nI am happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. This is basically a discussion here \non the bill. Obviously, it is the goal of the committee and the Senate \nto come up with a fair highway bill. That is what the Senator from \nRhode Island is attempting to do and the Senator from Virginia, who was \non the floor, the Senator from Montana, and the two Senators now \nspeaking seek that same goal. It is also true that we are in a \ntransition.\n  This country is changing. The country, in 1997, is not what it was in \n1987, not what it was in 1980. The fact is that, in 1991, in an ISTEA \nbill, the highway bill, this Congress essentially did not update data. \nIt just took the 1980 data. That is, lane and miles traveled, vehicle \nmiles traveled. We even used a postal roads component which was enacted \nmaybe at the turn of the century. We used very old data when we wrote \nthe ISTEA bill that we are now currently operating under. It is just \nunfortunate.\n  At the same time, in the earlier ISTEA bills--not the one before us, \nbut current law and the earlier one--the main effort was to complete \nconstruction of the interstate system. That was the main purpose of the \nprogram in the first place. The current ISTEA bill--not the one on the \nfloor, but current law--based its formula essentially, as I said, on \nold data and upon completion of the interstate program, and that is \nwhat we did.\n\n  In 1991, we just built upon the earlier data, which was data for the \ncompletion of the interstate. And in this last ISTEA, we then \napportioned more dollars to States which were completing their \ninterstate system, compared with States that were not completing their \ninterstate system. And the current law basically completes \nconstruction--not maintenance, but construction--of the interstate \nsystem. And so now, in 1997, the new transportation bill we are writing \nis one that recognizes that the interstate system has been completed. \nWe are now moving toward maintenance and intermodal systems, \nintelligent highway systems, and other programs to modernize, update, \nand make sure that the current transportation bill is no longer based \nupon older data, but rather is based upon current data.\n  That means that those States that got a lot of interstate completion \nmoney in the last several years are not going to get the same \nadditional dollars in this bill for the very simple reason that their \ninterstates are completed. On top of that, many States built their \ninterstates financed with tolls. That is, Federal dollars were not sent \nto those States; rather, those States charged their motorists tolls and \nthey built their own interstates, feeling that either they wanted to do \nit earlier or that way was a better way to do it, et cetera. A lot of \nthese States, after completing construction of their interstate \nsystems, based upon tolls, have now come back to the Congress--in fact, \nin the last ISTEA bill, they were able to convince this Congress that \nthey should get reimbursed again, even though those interstate systems \nwere paid for by tolls. This Congress paid Federal money again on top \nof the completion of the interstate.\n  So we have some States with lots of dollars in the last several years \nof the interstate system--that is, States with lots for interstate \ncompletion and States with what is called interstate reimbursement \ndollars going to those States. I know this is not a comfortable \nposition for some of these States to be in when they look at only the \ndollars because, obviously, those States would like to have a \npercentage increase again in the current years over the past dollars \nthey have been receiving, even though their interstate construction, \nwhich is more expensive in maintenance, is complete, and even though \nthose States got interstate reimbursement dollars on top of interstate \nsystems that were financed by toll roads.\n  So here we are trying to write a bill which recognizes, again, the \ncompletion of interstate construction and rather moves toward the \ncurrent new era which, as I mentioned, recognizes the completion of the \ninterstate construction. Now, the Senators make a very good statement \nand point when they talk about congestion and the number of miles--the \namount of congestion on I-95 or on the eastern corridor. In fact, as \nthe Senator from Maryland said, Maryland ranks second in the Nation in \nurban congestion. That is a fact. The State that ranks No. 1 is \nCalifornia. New Jersey is not too far down the list.\n  My thought here is that we have the challenge before us of trying to \naddress what I think are legitimate concerns and that is the congestion \nfactor that the Senators talk about. We are operating under very severe \nconstraints; that is, the amount of dollars in this ISTEA bill is \npretty tight, based upon the budget resolution, the President's \nproposal to Congress, and the increase in ISTEA dollars in this bill is \nnot as much as was the increase in ISTEA dollars in the last ISTEA \ntransportation bill. So it would be my thought that we find a way to \namend this bill so that, in effect, if not this year, at least next \nyear, there are potentially more dollars available, and in a way that \ncertainly it may recognize the concerns of the Senators.\n  I am not prepared at this point to say what that might be. There \nneeds to be more discussion to determine that. But I think that if the \namendment that we know is going to come up is passed, there might be a \nway to address that. You certainly have the assurance of this Senator \nto work in the context of that amendment to see if we can potentially \naddress some of the concerns the Senators have. But the main point is \nthat we are trying to work this all out. We hear what you are saying. \nThere are many opportunities: there are amendments, there is a \nconference, and it is my hope that we can pass a bill which is fair to \nall regions of the country. You have my assurance that I will do all I \ncan to achieve that goal.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I hear the Senator from Montana's \ninterests and concerns. I know that he is sincere. We have worked \ntogether for many years, as I had with the chairman of the committee. \nBut if this bill goes as it is, the chances for recovery, I think, are \npretty slim. And once in place, we will be running uphill to try and \nrecover.\n  What I would rather see is some kind of a consensus developed that \nincludes the States that are now disadvantaged. I was looking at the \nStates and I see that percentage points in a State that borders both of \nour States--Pennsylvania--is down to 20-some percent from its formula \nshare from where it was --22 percent, I think. We can't deal in this \nroom, at the moment, with the poor fate that befell Pennsylvania. I \ndon't know how their Senators are going to respond to it. I think if an \nadjustment is going to be made in the formula, there has to be a period \nof transition so that States are held harmless from where they were as \nadjustments take place. This isn't to suggest that review is out of \norder, not at all. I think reviews of the formula are always in order. \nBut I think the Senator from Maryland made an important contribution to \nthis debate when he highlighted the national interests and national \nobligations that some of our States have, being corridor States, as \nexpressed earlier by the Senator from Illinois. A corridor that runs \neast and west produces a lot of traffic through the State of Illinois.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, I will.\n  (Mr. ALLARD assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. My State has one of the Nation's great ports, the Port \nof Baltimore.\n  Mr. President, the road network from that port to the West is \ncritical for the commerce of the Nation--not just for\n\n[[Page S10531]]\n\nthe commerce of Maryland, but for the commerce of the Nation. A proper \nsystem of access for the movement of goods is extremely important to \nthe economic health of the country. So all of this needs to be taken \ninto account. We are on a major corridor for the movement of passengers \nand traffic north and south, and because of the port, we have a major \ncorridor that goes to the Midwest that is critical for the economic \nactivity in the Midwest. In many respects it is more critical for the \neconomic activity in the Midwest than in my own State. Those things \nneed to be considered in this legislation.\n  The Woodrow Wilson Bridge that we talked about--and I think the \nchairman is right, they have certainly done a better job than they have \ndone in the House. But we still have to get up to a point where we can \ndo this bridge, and this level will not allow that to happen. That is a \nmajor link on the entire interstate highway system. Every expert who \nhas examined it says the bridge needs to be replaced within the next 5 \nto 6 years. We have to move on that project.\n  Those are items that could be addressed I think in this legislation.\n  I also agree with the Senator from New Jersey. If you are going to \nstart adjusting the formula in recognition of, let's say, population \nshifts, which is what the argument is that is being made, at the \nleast--of course, I argue that you have to look at system needs in a \nmuch more significant way than I think has been done in this \nlegislation. But leaving that to one side, at the very least, the \ntransition period has to, in effect, cushion the impact of it so that \nStates don't all of a sudden find themselves unable to carry through on \ncommitted transportation projects which are essential for the vitality \nof their economy. That is what the whole issue is that we are \ndiscussing here.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator is right. The fact of the \nmatter is that among the items that have to be considered in \nestablishing a proper formula has to be the amount of mileage recorded \nwithin the States' roadbed systems. In my State we have north-south I-\n95, east-west through to I-80, and all kinds of cargo and material pass \nover these roads and cause enormous traffic congestion in New Jersey. \nOur roads are beat up, with heavy trucks taking more than their fair \nshare of the abuse. We stand there and kind of grin and bear it. But it \nis in the national interest.\n  If one wants to use an analogy, we have to look at what happens in \nenvironmental legislation. New Jersey, being in the location that we \nare on the east coast, is the unfortunate recipient of material carried \nby the prevailing winds from west to east. They carry all of the \npollutants and all of the particulate that is thrown up by stacks \nacross the rust belt, or the iron belt, or the steel belt in the \nmidwestern States. Some of that material travels hundreds of miles to \narrive at its place of deposition, which is New Jersey, Maryland, and \nNew York, in the eastern States.\n  So, as we consider environmental legislation, we try to accommodate \nwhat causes the problem. The problem is caused by the energy and \nindustrial nature of things from the Midwest. That is part of the \nformula. Here we are saying, listen, as we create new formulas, we \nought to debate them more thoroughly and let's talk about the \ncongestion on our roads that we receive as a result of being a corridor \nState.\n  New Jersey is a corridor State. Commerce travels in the Northeast and \nthe rest of the country. Over 60 billion--with a ``b''--vehicle miles \nare traveled on my State's roads annually. Our State is the Garden \nState. It is one of the most important links in our Nation's \ntransportation system.\n  The Senator from Maryland talked about the value of the port. I know \nthat the Senator from Rhode Island, the chairman of the committee, is \ntrying valiantly to improve the efficiency of the port outside of \nProvidence by making sure that there is rail access and truck access \nthat is good. I respect him. And, frankly, I see it as a positive thing \nfor my State of New Jersey. Could it be competitive? Of course, it \ncould be competitive. But I don't look at it that way. I think our \ncountry is obligated to continue to produce to the best of our ability \nto the maximum of our capacity. So we need these facilities.\n  So whether it is specifically located in New Jersey or Maryland or \nRhode Island, the fact of the matter is that what happens in the West, \nwhat happens in the South, and what happens in the center of the \ncountry depends very much on the capacity of our States in the East to \nbe able to help their export market, which is such a big part of \nthings, and also the industrial market because parts go from one place \nto another and assemblies are done in different States often than where \nmost of the parts are manufactured. It is an essential part of our \nnational being. Ten percent of the Nation's total freight either \noriginates, terminates, or passes through New Jersey. Almost 60 percent \nof this tonnage is strictly through traffic. Imagine that, 10 percent. \nGoods traveling just 24 hours on a truck from New Jersey will reach a \nmarket of 40 percent of the population of the United States and \nCanada--over 100 million people.\n\n  Mr. President, these aren't just cars from New Jersey; they are \nvehicles from every State in the Nation, as well as Canada, Mexico, and \nother nations.\n  In short, and to rephrase an old joke--I don't like jokes about my \nState--but if you are traveling on the east coast and you don't go \nthrough New Jersey, you just can't get there from here.\n  Millions of people travel along New Jersey's highways. They travel \nfrom the South, the West, New York City, Boston, and New England. \nPeople in New York and New England on their journeys travel to places \nlike the sea shore, Florida, Washington, DC, the Eastern Shore, or \ntrying to get to Long Island Sound and sallying up out of Rhode Island \nand those places. So we have to make sure that our roads are efficient \nand functioning, and that we are not drowning in pollution.\n  Every day 324,000 tons of goods made in my State of New Jersey are \ntransported on New Jersey's roads by 134,000 trucks. Many of these \ntrucks are coming from the ports of Newark and Elizabeth. They are \ntransporting cars and other goods that arrive from countries like South \nKorea, Great Britain, Germany, Taiwan, and Indonesia. The entire port \nof New York and New Jersey is the busiest port on the east coast. \nDespite the critical importance of New Jersey's infrastructure to the \nNation, it is in dismally poor shape and getting worse by the hour, by \nthe day, and by the week. Nearly 20 percent of New Jersey's interstate \nmileage is in poor or mediocre condition, and more than 45 percent of \nour bridges are in deficient condition. They are functionally obsolete \nin many cases.\n  Mr. President, New Jersey's roads and bridges take an unbelievable \npounding in hot summers, and harsh winters take a huge toll on our \ninfrastructure. Road salt in the winter and ocean salt year round add \nto the damage.\n  In addition, New Jerseyans and those who travel through my State \noften face unbearable congestion. Travelers in cars and trucks struggle \nfor hours every day with New Jersey's highway stops and starts, and our \nheavily used roads and bridges are badly in need of additional \nmaintenance.\n  Mr. President, the status of New Jersey's transportation \ninfrastructure has a direct effect on the State and the region's \neconomic vitality and on every resident's quality of life. But more \nimportantly, it affects the entire Nation's economic vitality. The \nfuture challenges to that infrastructure are ominous. In the next 6 \nyears there probably will be more travel on our roads, more cargo \ncoming into our ports, and more rapid deterioration of our \ntransportation infrastructure. That is not a particularly pleasant \nprospect, and I think that we have to prepare for it in the best \npossible way. The best possible way is to recognize that States like \nmine and those such as the State of Maryland have unique conditions \nthat have to be met.\n  I once again would like to review and restate the number of States \nthat are included--Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, \nCalifornia, and Massachusetts, to name but a few. There are eight \nStates in all that seem to have the heaviest share of the load. \nUnfortunately, the ISTEA bill before us does not adequately respond to \nthe challenge that we face. It doesn't address New Jersey's growing \nneeds.\n  Note that the highway title addresses density on highways, or \ncongestion.\n\n[[Page S10532]]\n\n While it recognizes the particular situation of some States, when it \ncomes to heavily used, densely populated urban States with significant \ncommerce and trade traffic, the bill is virtually silent. If a State's \nmotorists choose to not guzzle gas, either by using mass transit, \nwalking, or biking, this bill will penalize them. Therefore, it has to \nbe improved. I am not saying that New Jersey should get more than its \nfair share. I am simply saying, Mr. President, that it should and must \nget its fair share--nothing more, nothing less. The bill just doesn't \ndo that.\n  Mr. President, there is another bit of word and verbiage that goes \ninto the debate on highways. We talk about donor States and donee \nStates. The distinguished colleague of ours from Louisiana said you \ncan't explain that to the folks back home and said they want to see \nwhether or not their road and their infrastructure is getting \nattention, whether the potholes are being filled, and whether the roads \nare being maintained in a suitable fashion.\n  So I get tired of hearing complaints that emanate from the so-called \ndonor States. To make it very simple for any who might be listening or \nwatching, donor States are those that send down more in tax revenues, \ngasoline taxes in particular, than they get back. The others are called \ndonee States. The donor States complain about how they don't get their \nfair share of highway and transit funding. Many of those donor States \ndo quite well when one examines the total of Federal return on the \ndollar. Many of these States simply don't have the same needs as New \nJersey and other high-density transportation corridors.\n  Mr. President, when it comes to defense spending, spending by the \nInterior Department, agriculture spending, many urbanized, densely \npopulated States come out year after year after year as big losers. But \nwe have not said yet that the Government must spend as much on national \nparks in our region as we spend in western States. We have not yet \ndemanded an equal share of the defense spending or an equal share of \nagricultural spending. It is not realistic. Those States that now have \nthese investments being made have particular needs.\n  Those needs strike me as being part of the national requirement. If \nthere is a national park in Colorado, I would like to see it maintained \nbecause in visits by my constituents or my family or people from around \nthe country, I want them to be proud of it. I want them to say, why, \nthere is nothing prettier than Estes Park and other parks that exist in \nColorado, and so it should be. I want to make sure if airspace is \nneeded so that our airplanes can fly and practice and train--our Air \nForce Academy is in the State of Colorado--we continue to invest in \nthat and in that skill we have. I think it is going to be more required \nin the future. But a large part of that investment vests in Colorado. \nSo what. It is part of my national interest.\n  Or an equal share of agriculture spending. New Jersey is still called \nthe Garden State, and despite the density of population that we have--\nthe most densely populated State in the country, I remind everybody--\nabout 25 percent of our State is still forested, and that is really \npleasant to see. I see it often from airplanes. We have one reserve \nthat is a million acres today. But we are not looking for assistance \nwith our agriculture, even though our farmers perform an important \nservice for the community, because these demands are unrealistic. They \ndo not take into account the real needs of the entire Nation. They do \nnot consider that there is a benefit for all Americans by strategically \nfocusing resources to meet critical problems.\n  I said earlier and I repeat, when floods took over the Dakotas and \nparts of Minnesota or Missouri, I wanted us as a country to help out, \nand I was very vocal about it. I felt it was a responsibility that we \nhad, again, to confirm that we are one nation.\n  The fact is each State has its own individual needs, and they change \nfrom time to time. New Jerseyans send $15 billion more per year to \nWashington than they receive in total Federal dollar return--$15 \nbillion more. The Federal Government's job is to apportion funding \nwhere need is greatest, and sometimes we swallow hard and we say, if \none State has a higher need for family spending, welfare, OK, we are \nwilling to take some share of that.\n  On the other hand, Mr. President, when it is our turn, I think we \nought to get some consideration. The one area where we are a donee \nState is transportation, and that is because there was some recognition \nthat so much of the Nation's traffic load was carried by the State of \nNew Jersey. But now the intention is to change it. If I may say so--and \nI do not mean to castigate --the fact is that it was almost whimsical \nin its development, because States like mine took some pretty big hits.\n  Well, my State and my region's needs are largely in transportation. \nThat is our equivalent to agriculture for Iowa and Nebraska and those \nStates. We are in the most densely populated part of the country, with \nsome of the most highly traveled and congested roads. Anyone who has \ndriven the New Jersey Turnpike, Route 1, Atlantic City Expressway, \nInterstate 80 can attest to these needs. As I have already noted, many \nof these vehicles on these highways are from States other than New \nJersey. My kids used to love to play a game when they were little. We \nwould write down the States from the license plates that we saw, and we \nwould get pretty close to 49 besides ours because there were so many. I \ndidn't always enjoy being in the middle of that confluence of traffic, \nbut at least it kept the kids seated.\n  Mr. President, New Jersey isn't just asking from the Federal \nGovernment transportation dollars. We are investing our own funds in \nour infrastructure as well. State and local governments in New Jersey \nspend more highway dollars per lane mile than any other State in the \nNation--our money, reinvested in our infrastructure. We made this \ncommitment to transportation simply because our needs were so great. \nBut that does not excuse getting our fair share from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  There is nothing in any study, census projection, or economic trend \nto indicate that these needs will diminish in the future. In fact, \nquite the opposite is true. Some States are arguing that they should \nget back at least 90 percent of those payments they have made into the \nhighway trust fund. But I still think that their needs have to be \nexamined before that return is justified. It is part of a contribution \nto the national well-being, and it makes no sense to take away funds \nfrom regions that have greater needs.\n  I remind everyone that we are a single nation, one nation, and not a \ncollection of autonomous sovereignties. Can you imagine what would have \nhappened if at the Constitutional Convention our delegates included a \nclause in the Constitution mandating that each State must get back from \nthe Federal Government 90 percent of what it paid in taxes? What would \nhave happened to our country? We have people now who individually say, \nwell, I don't want to pay for this. We have people from extremes on the \nright like militia who say, I don't want to pay for the kind of liberal \njudicial system that we have, or I do not want to pay for that program \nor this program. Then we have people on the other side who say, I am \nunwilling to have my dollars go for defense needs. But we say, too bad; \nyou are an American; you are part of American society. You are part of \na great nation. You are part of a country the likes of which has never \nexisted on this Earth before and perhaps never will again. But we say, \nthat's your obligation. We are one country. We are one people with \nsometimes different actions, but we come together when we have to.\n\n  Those of us old enough to have served in World War II saw it, as did \nthe distinguished chairman of the Environment Committee, who had a very \ndistinguished war record. Mine was not so distinguished, but I did what \nI had to in Europe in World War II. We came together as a country. We \nsometimes forget that obligation, that we are one nation and we ought \nnot to pick at one another's opportunities or advantage and say, OK, \nyou've got this because you are a donee State and therefore we are \ngoing to take it away from you.\n  Unless the whole picture is examined, it is not a complete one. We \ncertainly never could have maintained our great national parks and \nforests; we could never have saved thousands of family farms from \nbankruptcy in difficult economic times; we could never afford to pay \nfor emergency relief from earthquakes, floods or hurricanes; we would \ncertainly not have a national transportation system; some States would \nhave\n\n[[Page S10533]]\n\npaved roads and some States would have dirt roads; there would be no \ninterstate highway system, no airports in rural areas if we said it \nwasn't part of the national responsibility.\n  I repeat that I am a supporter of essential air service for which the \nFederal Government pays a significant subsidy. For every passenger that \nflies into some of those airports, the Federal Government will pay two \nor three times, four times the cost for the seat because we do not want \nto see those communities isolated. They are very dependent. So we say, \nOK, it is part of an obligation we have. We certainly wouldn't have a \nnational passenger rail system. It may be more regional than national, \nbut it travels through important regions of the country. I don't know \nof any State, as infrequent as Amtrak rail service might be, that wants \nto give it up very quickly. We would not have a space program; we would \nnot have a National Science Foundation; we would not have the National \nInstitutes of Health; more importantly, we probably would not exist as \na nation because we would have no national defense, no Army, Navy, \nNational Guard, Air Force.\n  Thanks to the wisdom and forethought of our Founders, there is no \nminimum guarantee clause in the Constitution except to protect the \nindividual rights. Perhaps some in New Jersey think we might be better \noff if there were. We have a high per capita income, but we ought not \nto be penalized for it. We make our contribution in many ways. The fact \nis our Nation is stronger because Federal aid has been provided to \nareas with the greatest needs, and that is the way it ought to be.\n  I want to talk for a moment about another matter that is important to \nmy State, mass transit. Good public transit increases the efficiencies \nof existing roadways, especially in congested areas where many people \nlive. Transit is essential to rural, suburban and urban residents. It \nis a cost-effective solution to health care access, a key to successful \nwelfare reform, and an environmentally sensible way to meet commuting \nneeds. It is an increasingly important service for the elderly, for \npersons with disabilities, for students and those who cannot afford a \ncar.\n  Anyone who questions the necessity for transit services only has to \nvisit some of the more populated States like New Jersey or New York or \nCalifornia, where they do not have enough public transportation, or \nMaryland or the District of Columbia. The most densely populated State \nin the Nation, New Jersey has also the most vehicle density on its \nroads. Located between two heavily populated metropolitan areas, New \nJersey is known as the corridor State. Over 60 billion vehicle miles \nare traveled on New Jersey's roads annually. The ability of trucks and \ncars to move freely on New Jersey's roads directly affects our economy. \nIt affects the congestion, which has a dramatic effect on the \nindividuals living there.\n  It is also a primary commuter State. Millions of New Jerseyans face \nserious commuter problems each day. In many areas of New Jersey there \nis nowhere else to put a new road. Many of our people work in New York \nCity, and their residences are in New Jersey. Or in the southern part \nof our State, many of our people work in the city of Philadelphia. They \nhave to be able to get back and forth to work. But we simply can't \nbuild ourselves out of congestion. That is why my State is so heavily \nreliant on mass transportation. Nearly 10 percent of the New Jersey \nwork force uses mass transit.\n  We have a line just recently created called the Midtown Direct, a \nproject in the urban core, which is a program very successful thus far, \ndesigned to bring together railroad connections that exist throughout \nour State into New York. Midtown Direct was one part of it, and it was \ninaugurated 1 year ago. Within weeks, the ridership doubled its \nprojections.\n  Transit in New Jersey is well used and well supported. Nationally, \ntransit has also proven to reduce congestion and, of course, save \ndollars.\n  A 1996 report conducted by the Federal Transit Administration found \nthat the annual economic loss to U.S. business caused by traffic \ncongestion is $40 billion, and the additional annual economic loss if \nall U.S. transit commuters drove instead would be $15 billion. So we \nare looking at huge differences in our economy.\n  It is also obviously good for the environment. According to the \nFederal Transit Administration, transit use saves 1.5 billion gallons \nof auto fuel in our country each year, 1.5 billion gallons. If one \nwants to worry about what happens to America's independence, one need \nonly look at the quantity of imported oil that we are bringing into the \ncountry. Transit is energy efficient, and the less gasoline used the \nless the United States is dependent on foreign oil.\n  Americans also see direct public health benefits from transit use. \nAccording to the Environmental Protection Agency, up to 110 million \nAmericans breathe air that is unhealthful. The American Lung \nAssociation estimates that the national health care bill for air-\npollution-related illness is $40 billion a year. Transportation sources \ncause 40 to 60 percent of pollution that produce ozone, and 70 to 80 \npercent of carbon monoxide emissions. Nearly one-third of carbon \ndioxide emissions, the most significant greenhouse gas, comes from \ntransportation sources. And, on this debate, no matter how detached or \nhow unbelieving a person might be, one cannot be unconcerned about what \nwe see happening with our climate, what can be happening with our \nhealth in this country. Much of the problem, in my view, emanates from \nthe fact that we have these emissions in ever-increasing quantities in \nthis country, as much as we fight against it.\n  The fastest growing source of carbon dioxide emission is the \ntransportation sector. Transit produces real environmental benefits. On \naverage, riding transit instead of driving cuts hydrocarbon emissions \nthat produce smog by 90 percent and carbon monoxide by more than 75 \npercent. One person using mass transit for a year instead of driving to \nwork saves our environment 9 pounds of hydrocarbons, 62 pounds of \ncarbon monoxide, and 5 pounds of nitrogen oxides.\n  It doesn't stop there. Over the past 30 years, the U.S. transit \nindustry and its riders have prevented the emission of 1.6 million tons \nof hydrocarbons, 10 million tons of carbon monoxide, and 275,000 tons \nof nitrogen oxides into the air; the importation of 20 billion gallons \nof gasoline; and the construction and maintenance of the 20,000 lane-\nmiles of freeways and arterial roads and 5 million parking places to \nmeet demands, saving at least $220 billion a year.\n  Transit is an important part of our Nation's transportation system, \nand we ought to ensure that it is afforded the same priority as other \nmodes of transportation.\n  It is obvious, this bill also needs to address a crucial safety \nquestion, and one that I have worked on very hard over the years. That \nis, in the pursuit of safer highway travel we ought to do what we can \nto get drunken drivers off the road. This bill has to include a \nreduction in the blood alcohol measure, from .10 to .08 as a national \nstandard. It is already, by the way, the standard in 15 States.\n  Let me explain why we need this new standard. In 1996, 17,000 people \ndied in alcohol-related traffic accidents; 17,000 people. By the way, \nif we examine the history of the Vietnam war, where we lost over 50,000 \nof our service people, the high year was about 17,000 people killed. \nEvery year in America, 17,000 people die in alcohol-related traffic \naccidents. It is a national disgrace. Of those, 3,700 people, almost 9 \npercent, had alcohol levels below the .10 standard that most States \nenforce. Mr. President, .08 BAC laws have proven to have an effect on \neven heavy drinkers. The beverage industry fights us, and will continue \nto fight us on this. They tell you that it will ruin business, that the \n.08 law targets social drinkers and makes criminals out of them. \nNothing could be further from the truth. When I wrote the law that made \nthe drinking age across this country 21, the minimum drinking age, the \nbeverage and the hospitality people said you are going to ruin our \nbusiness.\n  Ruin their business? We saved 10,000 kids from dying on the highways \nsince I wrote that law in 1983. Mr. President, 10,000 families don't \nhave to mourn the loss of a young child. One can hardly say that \nbusiness in restaurants, taverns, and social places has been bad. They \ncan't say it now.\n\n[[Page S10534]]\n\n  To make the point, a man of my height and weight could drink four \nbeers in an hour on an empty stomach and still not hit .08. If I drank \na fifth beer, I would be over the .08 but I would still be under .10. \nShould anyone be legally entitled to drink that much alcohol and then \nget on the road? The question answers itself. Of course not. Keep this \nin mind, when you look at a group of people in a bar or restaurant \nhaving drinks, the .08 law would only affect one of those people, and \nthat is the person driving a car.\n  We are not asking people to stop drinking. This is not a morality \nplay. I am not telling people that they should not drink to their \npleasure. If someone falls off a bar stool, as long as he doesn't fall \non me it doesn't hurt me. But if he gets behind the wheel of a car, \nHeaven forbid, he could take away a child, a grandchild, mother, \nfather, brother, sister. It should not be allowed. It's a criminal act. \nIt turns an automobile from a thing of pleasure to a lethal weapon.\n\n  We say just control your habits. There is a point at which they need \nto put the cork on the bottle for their own safety and for the safety \nof everyone else who shares the road with them. Studies have shown that \nStates that have adopted .08 laws have had significant drops in \nalcohol-related traffic deaths and that a national .08 law could \nprevent up to at least 500 to 600 fatalities a year. Just that \ndifference, from .08 to .10, could save 500 to 600 people a year from \ndying on the highways.\n  In the State of Virginia, after it adopted its .08 law, it saw a drop \nnot only in traffic deaths but in driving under the influence arrests \nas well.\n  The Federal legislation that I introduced years ago to make 21 the \nnational drinking age engendered a heck of a fight with the liquor \nlobby. But the law has saved 10,000 lives, it is estimated. I believe \nthat .08 will save thousands more in a period of time. If we want \nconfirmation whether or not we are on the right track, the people who \nsupport the .08 limit include the American Medical Association, the \nAmerican Insurance Association, the American Trucking Association, the \nNational Safety Council, and the National Sheriff's Association.\n  Those who oppose .08, and I have to ask why, are principally in the \nbeverage and hospitality area. We ought to let them know that we don't \noppose social behavior of one's choice in restaurants and public \ngatherings, but we don't want to add anything to the fatality rate that \ncan be prevented.\n  Another safety issue that we are talking about in the legislation is \nbig trucks. Trucking companies are trying to get Congress to allow \nbigger trucks on the highways, double and triple trailers. My view, and \nthat of many others, is no. Motorists in my home State of New Jersey \nwant relief from the rising death toll of the past few years. Consider \nwhat we are talking about here. A triple trailer can be 120 feet long, \nlonger than a Boeing 747 jetliner. And it can weigh 64 tons. That is \nquite a behemoth on the highway. I am sure if you let your imagination \nwork, and think about what the consequence can be when you are driving \non a highway on a dark night, it is raining, doing about 55, maybe 60 \nmiles an hour. That's a safe speed in these conditions.\n  Suddenly a line of trucks starts to pass you. It is scary enough when \nthe truck is a standard 44-foot length. But what is it like if a line \nof three of these 120 footers went by, each one of them three times, \npractically, the size of the single truck that has you worried in the \nfirst place? It would be like driving through an eclipse. For more than \na solid minute the trucks would block your view of the road except for \nwhat is directly in front of you. For more than a minute your \nwindshield would be sprayed by the tire wash off 32 sets of wheels.\n  Your heart jumps each time one of those triple trailers weaves \nslightly into your lane. You know this type of truck needs at least \n1\\1/2\\ football fields to come to a stop. Imagine that, 1\\1/2\\ football \nfields. And it's worse in the rain. This kind of heart-thumping drive \nwould become more common if we allowed triple trailers greater access \nto highways. I know the people in my State don't want it. In 1994 to \n1995, fatal accidents involving trucks were up 13 percent. Trucking \naccidents overall were up 16 percent, 84 people died in each year, 1994 \nand 1995, and one stretch of road in my State, route 287, saw the \nnumbers of accidents involving trucks quadruple between 1988 and 1994.\n  I agree with them, the only cargo vehicle this size should also have \nwings and be racing down a runway, not barreling down a highway.\n  Mr. President, the debate on ISTEA is not only inevitable, it's \nessential, because this is such an important piece of legislation in \nour national structure. I agree that the chairman of the Environment \nCommittee, the ranking member of the Environment Committee, wants to do \nthe same things in their objectives as I do, and almost everyone else \ndoes. That is to continue to invest in our infrastructure, our \ntransportation infrastructure, making sure that we develop and refine, \nto the best of our ability, each of the modes of transportation: \nHighways, aviation, rail, transit, waterways. We want to know that all \nof these things are operating in the safest manner that can accommodate \nmost of our people efficiently.\n  The potential is there. I have been working publicly and privately to \nhelp meet that objective, as have my colleagues, but this bill just \ndoesn't do it. I want to help bring a bill to the floor that meets \nthese needs.\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think our colleagues in the House \nhave the right idea, and that is to pass a temporary extension. If we \npass a temporary extension, I think it has to be based on the formula, \nupon the structure of ISTEA as it presently is, not a newer version \nthat changes things. Then we can sit down and create a plan that is \nfairer to all States in all regions and addresses these crucial needs. \nBut it will take some significant discussion.\n  This is a major, major change that is contemplated, and because it \nwas concentrated in ultimately a few hands doesn't mean that it didn't \npursue the right path, but what it does mean is that it has not fully \nconsidered all of the needs of the country, as we see from the \nresistance to this, opposed by a number of us from States particularly \nin the East, but not exclusively.\n  My proposal is to see if we can find, not necessarily in order of \nimportance, A, a substitute; B, a program that in transition will give \nStates a chance to make adjustment, will hold those States that are \nbeing asked to take less of the funding pie harmless from year to year \nas the formula changes. I think that is the fairest way to do it; C, to \nlisten carefully to what our colleagues in the House of Representatives \nhave to say about their version of ISTEA. I am not talking about the 6-\nmonth bill that we see out there, necessarily, because I don't see a 6-\nmonth extension coming unless it proceeds under the present formula and \nstructure. But to take perhaps another year in transition and try to \ndevelop a fairer piece of legislation, try to develop a piece of \nlegislation that considers the needs, not just the tax cash-flow that \nresults from gasoline taxes, because, to be repetitive for emphasis, \njust because a State sends down a dollars' worth of tax dollars doesn't \nnecessarily mean that it ought to get a dollar in return on \ntransportation investments if it, in fact, gets other returns that are \nfar greater than the tax dollars they send down.\n  I call painful attention to the fact that my State is 50th in return \non the Federal tax dollar. The State of New Jersey is 50th. To make it \nabominably simple, it means that if we send down a dollar in taxes, we \nget 69 cents back--69 cents; 31 cents of New Jersey taxpayers' \ncontributions go to programs that benefit other States, other regions \nof the country.\n  We haven't seen a tax revolt in New Jersey. We swallow hard. We think \nwe ought to get more. We don't have the need for an agricultural \nsubsidy, but listen, if it is going to be given away, we are going to \nwant our share. If when we do have some advantage because of need, like \ntransportation, and we are not getting our fair share return on that, \nthen we are going to say, hey, listen, when I look at the defense \nbill--and I sit on the Defense Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee--I want to look at that bill to see if New Jersey gets a fair \nshare.\n  How absurd a conclusion that would be. Can you imagine, someone \nlooking\n\n[[Page S10535]]\n\nat the defense bill and saying, ``Wait a second, does my State get its \nfair share,'' or is the question really, is my country best protected? \nAs silly as that sounds, to say, well, give me my fair share, that \nsimply means spend the money in my State, even though we don't \naccomplish the objective, I hope that it will be out of consideration \nbecause it just doesn't make any sense.\n  A bill that doesn't take care of the needs of my State, which I \ninterpret as the needs of the country, is equally unfair. So I hope as \nthe discussion goes on that those who agree with me that this bill \nneeds some further review--I realize that this is not untimely to \nconsider reauthorizing the bill because the other one has expired, but \nI would like to make sure that we include the needs that my State and \nothers have.\n  I would like to reread the policy statement that accompanied the \noriginal ISTEA legislation. These are the views of our distinguished \ncolleague and friend to just about everybody here and one of the best-\ninformed people on transportation infrastructure. That is Senator \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan of the Empire State, the State of New York. \nAgain, Senator Moynihan has studied the transportation needs of this \ncountry. He knows so much about the origins of parts of our \ntransportation system, going from the early canals to the development \nof the National Highway System. He said:\n\n       I am especially proud of the principles we set out in ISTEA \n     6 years ago and wish to include them in this bill.\n       It is the policy of the United States to develop a National \n     Intermodal Transportation System that is economically \n     efficient and environmentally sound, provides the foundation \n     for the Nation to compete in the global economy, and will \n     move people and goods in an energy efficient manner.\n       The National Intermodal Transportation System shall consist \n     of all forms of transportation in a unified, interconnected \n     manner, including the transportation systems of the future, \n     to reduce energy consumption and air pollution \n     while promoting economic development and supporting the \n     Nation's preeminent position in international commerce.\n\n  I think it is fair to say that that summarizes certainly the \nbeginning principles of ISTEA's development, and we are living off of \nwhat I would say is a successful period of investment in our \ntransportation needs, intermodally balanced, not quite perfect in every \naspect, not quite sufficient funding.\n  When I see what we invest in our transportation infrastructure in \nthis country, it saddens me because in some cases we are ranked among \nthe lesser developed countries of the world instead of the most \ndeveloped countries of the world. When I look at high-speed rail \npassenger service, our per-capita spending is way below the average, \nand it is not right. This Nation ought to have a transit that can move \nat 180 miles an hour on a consistent basis as they have in France, or \nfaster in Japan. I saw the other day where a train in Japan for a \nlimited length of travel was at over 300 miles an hour, and they are \nlooking to make it even faster. It would relieve our skyways, it would \nrelieve our highways, and would broaden the opportunity if we have the \ninvestment in intercity rail that we need.\n  So, Mr. President, I am sorry that we have not come to an agreement \non what is an appropriate renewal or a new version of ISTEA as it \nexpires. Again, I am hoping that we will have time for debate on it. It \nis also my understanding that we are going to have a discussion on the \nappropriateness of continuing an affirmative action program in ISTEA, \nand I welcome that debate because I believe that DOT's affirmative \naction program continues to be necessary and could withstand \nconstitutional scrutiny under the standards set forth in the Adarand \ndecision.\n  I have been told that the junior Senator from Kentucky may be \noffering an amendment to strike the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise \nProgram from this legislation. Perhaps he is content to believe that we \nare now in a colorblind society, but I plan to oppose that amendment \nbecause I don't think we are.\n  The Department of Transportation's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise \nProgram, or DBE Program, provides a 10-percent national contracting \ngoal for socially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. \nCongress created this program in 1982 because minorities and women were \nshut out of transportation construction contracts, shut out not because \nthey were any less able to perform the terms of the construction \ncontract, shut out not because their bids were higher than their \ncompetitors, but shut out because they were not white, in some cases \nthey were not men. We decided in the 1982 highway bill that the old boy \nnetwork was no longer acceptable in Federal transportation construction \ncontracts. We were right then, and the chairman of both the \nTransportation Subcommittee and the full committee were right to \ncontinue this program in S. 1173.\n  I expect we will hear opponents of the DBE Program say that it \nimposes a quota or a set-aside for women- or minority-owned firms. It \ndoesn't do that. The statute provides a 10-percent goal which may be \nmodified by the Secretary of Transportation. States and municipalities \nare able to set their own goals which may be higher or lower than 10 \npercent. If a State doesn't reach its goal, there is no adverse \nconsequence.\n  I repeat, Mr. President, because it is an important point and one \nwhich the opponents to the DBE Program may not mention, the DBE Program \nprovides a goal, and if States do not meet this goal, DOT does not \ndirectly withhold transportation dollars. There is no adverse \nconsequence.\n  So why do we still need an affirmative action program for Federal \nconstruction contracts? Because we know the private sector looks to the \npublic sector for leadership on this issue. If we eliminate the DBE \nProgram at this time, we will return quickly to the good old boy \nnetwork that excludes women and minorities. How do we know that? \nBecause several States eliminated their versions of DOT's DBE Program, \nand within a matter of months, minority- and women-owned and controlled \nbusinesses received fewer, if any, construction contracts.\n  Minorities comprise approximately one-fifth of our population. Just \nunder 10 percent of construction firms are minority owned and \ncontrolled, yet receive only 5 percent of construction receipts.\n  I will give you another statistic, Mr. President. White business \nowners in the construction industry receive over 50 times as many loan \ndollars of equity capital as minority owners with the same borrowing \ncharacteristics.\n  Mr. President, I ask opponents of the DBE affirmative action program \nto explain why these numbers are so disproportionate if we did, in \nfact, live in a colorblind society.\n  I expect, Mr. President, we are going to have a lengthy discussion \nabout the DBE program and whether or not it is constitutional. Again, I \nlook forward to the debate because I believe after a full discussion, \nthe majority of my colleagues will agree that the DBE program is \nconstitutional under the Adarand standard.\n  In the 1995 Adarand decision, seven of the nine Supreme Court \nJustices recognized the continuing need for affirmative action programs \nto remedy the lingering effects of racial discrimination. After \nAdarand, affirmative action programs must serve a compelling \ngovernmental interest and be narrowly tailored to address that \ninterest.\n  The first court to apply this strict scrutiny standard set forth \nunder Adarand found that Congress met the compelling-Government-\ninterest component. It disagreed that the DBE program was narrowly \ntailored, but the district court judge went far beyond the Supreme \nCourt's holding by virtually deciding that no affirmative action \nprogram can be narrowly tailored.\n  The Justice Department is rightfully appealing this decision.\n  Mr. President, there will be time to discuss this matter further at a \nlater time. I look forward to that.\n  I am confident that the Senate will accept the responsibility of \nlooking at this program calmly and rationally rather than simply trying \nto fuel the fires of passion and hatred which the issue of affirmative \naction can ignite. Should the junior Senator from Kentucky offer this \namendment, I hope my colleagues will oppose it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S10536]]\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. What is the question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This chapter may be cited as the ``Transportation \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 1312. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a well-developed system of transportation \n     infrastructure is critical to the economic well-being, \n     health, and welfare of the people of the United States;\n       (2) traditional public funding techniques such as grant \n     programs are unable to keep pace with the infrastructure \n     investment needs of the United States because of budgetary \n     constraints at the Federal, State, and local levels of \n     government;\n       (3) major transportation infrastructure facilities that \n     address critical national needs, such as intermodal \n     facilities, border crossings, and multistate trade corridors, \n     are of a scale that exceeds the capacity of Federal and State \n     assistance programs in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (4) new investment capital can be attracted to \n     infrastructure projects that are capable of generating their \n     own revenue streams\n\n[[Page S10556]]\n\n     through user charges or other dedicated funding sources; and\n       (5) a Federal credit program for projects of national \n     significance can complement existing funding resources by \n     filling market gaps, thereby leveraging substantial private \n     co-investment.\n\n     SEC. 1313.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This chapter may be cited as the ``Transportation \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 1312. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a well-developed system of transportation \n     infrastructure is critical to the economic well-being, \n     health, and welfare of the people of the United States;\n       (2) traditional public funding techniques such as grant \n     programs are unable to keep pace with the infrastructure \n     investment needs of the United States because of budgetary \n     constraints at the Federal, State, and local levels of \n     government;\n       (3) major transportation infrastructure facilities that \n     address critical national needs, such as intermodal \n     facilities, border crossings, and multistate trade corridors, \n     are of a scale that exceeds the capacity of Federal and State \n     assistance programs in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (4) new investment capital can be attracted to \n     infrastructure projects that are capable of generating their \n     own revenue streams through user charges or other dedicated \n     funding sources; and\n       (5) a Federal credit program for projects of national \n     significance can complement existing funding resources by \n     filling market gaps, thereby leveraging substantial private \n     co-investment.\n\n     SEC. 1313.

For the information of all Senators, this exercise, \nunfortunately, is necessary to keep the Senate's focus on the vital \nlegislation to reauthorize our Nation's surface transportation programs \nfor the next 6 years.\n  Really good work has been done by the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. In fact, I believe it was reported by a vote of 18 to 0--\nunanimous. While there are obviously some concerns--at any time you \nhave concerns on a major transportation bill of this magnitude, there \nwill be Senators on both sides of the aisle who will have amendments \nthat will need to be offered and debated and voted on. And I am sure \nthey will have support on both sides of the aisle.\n  In accordance with all Senate rules, I have now completed the \namendment process with relevant and needed changes to the bill. It is \nthe intention\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\nof the manager to eventually have these necessary amendments agreed to \nby the Senate. However, in the meantime, these amendments will remain \npending and the manager will agree to a consent that will lay aside \namendment No. 1312 at any time any Member desires to offer a relevant \ntransportation amendment.\n  We have been in touch with Members who have relevant amendments they \nwould like to offer. We will have Senators prepared to begin offering \namendments this afternoon, and we will continue on that tomorrow.\n  I look forward to making progress on this bill prior to our recess at \nthe end of the week. I thank all colleagues for their cooperation. We \ndo have cooperation from Senator Baucus, who has been working on this \nwith Senator Chafee from the committee and Senator Warner and others on \nboth sides.\n  I know that there has been an agreement reached on some amendments \ncoming up later on after we come back from the religious holiday and \nthe Columbus Day recess, but we will have full time for debate.\n  I think this is perhaps the most important bill left that we need to \nget done before we go out for the year sometime later on this month or \nearly in November. So my intent would be to stay on it and try to make \nprogress.\n  I do not intend for this to become a campaign finance reform forum. \nThere will be votes on that issue tomorrow. They are already scheduled. \nThere will be other opportunities to debate this issue. But I think \nthat the transportation bill is a very important bill, and we have a \nlimited amount of time. The Senate is leading the way on this \nlegislation, so we need to go ahead and get the process underway. I am \nprepared to give as much time as it takes to try to get it completed.\n  Now, I might say for the information of all Senators, there is the \npossibility of at least one more vote. I had hoped we could clear the \nHUD-VA appropriations conference report. The chairman and the ranking \nmember are ready to go but don't have the papers yet, so apparently we \nare not going to be able to do that tonight. We hope to do that \ntomorrow. Then, if we cannot work it out, we may even have to have a \nrecorded vote to go out for the night.\n  Now, we do not know exactly what time that would come. But I presume \naround 6 or 6:30. Perhaps it will not be necessary. But the Members \nshould be on notice there is at this point the likelihood of one more \nvote tonight.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. BYRD. I do not want to go ahead of my own leader here. I prefer \nhe go ahead of me.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield the floor or respond to questions.\n  Mr. BYRD. I want my own leader first. And then I would like to----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if I could just respond, I appreciate \nvery much the consideration of the distinguished senior Senator from \nWest Virginia.\n  Let me just say, I regret that we are back into a situation very \nsimilar to that which we were in during the debate on campaign finance \nreform. The leader, as is his right, has chosen to now fill the tree \nonce more. In so doing, it will now require his consent before anybody \nhas the opportunity to offer an amendment. He has the right. That is \nthe prerogative of the majority leader. But he will determine the \nrelevancy of any amendment.\n\n  I will say that it is our right to provide the unanimous consent \nrequired to move off this legislation for any other purpose. We will \ncertainly invoke that right as the situation warrants. I regret that \nthis is necessary.\n  I regret that we could not take these issues up one by one and \nresolve them, as I know many colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nwould like to do. We are precluded from that. So we are now faced with \na very difficult set of circumstances. I am hopeful that we can find a \nway to address it.\n  The majority leader has indicated this is an important bill. And \ncertainly it is. I give great credit to the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their work in committee to bring us to this point. There is \na lot of work that needs to be done, and I hope we can get it done.\n  But it isn't the only important bill. There is another very important \nbill that we have been precluded from having a good debate on, and that \nis campaign finance. At least for the moment we are precluded under \nthese circumstances. But, again, I repeat what I have said before. This \nis a temporary set of circumstances that will be addressed successfully \nbefore we move on conclusively.\n  I yield the floor. Again, I thank the senior Senator from West \nVirginia for his willingness to allow me to make my comments.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could just respond. I am glad to hear \nthe minority leader's comments. As the leader of the Democrats, \ncertainly he has an obligation to represent their views.\n  I agree this is certainly important legislation, and we should \ncontinue to look for ways that we can have it freely debated and \namended and move forward. We will keep talking, and maybe we will find \na way to do that. It is my preference to have every Senator have a \nchance to make his case.\n  I would like to get out of the process we are in, but I want us to \nstay on the transportation bill and not have this become another debate \non campaign finance reform. There are other ways that will be done. \nThere are other opportunities that I am sure will come along, but we \nare trying to keep the focus on the highway bill.\n  I have discussed with other Senators amendments they have in mind. I \nam going to do everything I can to assure every Senator, he or she, who \nhas an amendment will be able to offer it. I would prefer it not be \ndone in this process, if we can work out some kind of arrangement \nwhereby we would not go with this, where any Senator, as is usually the \ncase, can get up and offer an amendment.\n  I know Senator Byrd, Senator Gramm, and others are working on an \namendment that there will be a lot of interest in. I want to make sure \nthat amendment has a freestanding opportunity to be fully debated and \nvoted upon. I do not think we can ever complete this legislation \nwithout that occurring. I would like for a lot of other amendments that \nyou have--this is important to every Senator. Every State will be \naffected by this, by the formula and by various parts of this bill--\nurban mass transportation. It is not something that is partisan. It is \nnot something that is regional. It cuts all kinds of different ways.\n  So if we can come up with a way over a period of time--I am not \nrushing to judgment, but I do want us to get on--I promised the \nchairman and the ranking member a week ago or more--and we had met \nearlier--that we would begin this bill today, the 8th of October. So I \nam trying to fulfill that commitment. I think we will find a way to get \nit done in a way that will allow us to complete our work, and then \nhopefully the House will follow our leadership on this.\n  I would be glad to yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Are you finished?\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, I will yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. No, I do not suggest you yield the floor.\n  I just wanted the recognition to state for the record that I do have \na measure to the bill, to the ISTEA bill. I wanted all Senators to be \naware of that. I would like them to take a look at my amendment when it \nis ready. Before they make any judgment to go with anybody else's \namendment, I have an amendment that I think will appeal to them, to \nevery State. But the leader has already stated that I have an \namendment, so that takes care of that situation.\n  Secondly, I just want to say that whenever we can do our conference \nreports on appropriations, I would like to do them. They are \nprivileged. I would like to get as many of those bills down as we can \nget down so we do not have to include them in a continuing resolution.\n  If the President is going to item veto any of them, I want him to do \nthat in ample time for us to offer a resolution to put those items \nright back on his desk. If he wants to veto that, OK. He has that right \nunder the Constitution. We, likewise, have the right to either override \nor sustain. But I would like for him to have time to veto those.\n  I hate that item veto with a passion. But it is there, until the \nSupreme Court knocks it down. I cannot see how the Supreme Court can \navoid knocking that--killing that bill which most Senators voted for, \nwhich most Members\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\nvoted for, but it is coming home to roost now.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield for a comment, I think there are \nprobably more Senators and House Members that would agree with you this \nweek than last week, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. BYRD. Well, I am heartened by that. I thank the leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. In my discussions \nwith the majority leader over a period of discussions of the campaign \nfinance reform bill, I told him that I would come back with an \namendment that I wanted an up-or-down vote on. I want to repeat again \nmy intentions to have that. I do not desire to tie up the Senate. I do \nnot desire to cause problems with ISTEA or other pieces of legislation \nbetween now and when we go out, but I will have an amendment that I \nbelieve is important and one that I think should be considered by the \nSenate. This issue should be resolved, I hope, before we go to recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I just want to make reference to the comments just \nmade by the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, my friend \nand colleague of 23 years. He has served here much longer than that. I \nhave had the opportunity to serve with him for now almost 23 years.\n  Mr. President, I have made it very clear in speeches on the floor and \ncomments to the public and people back in my home State of Vermont that \nI completely agree with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on \nthe question of the line-item veto.\n  I was one of those, as he knows, who voted against the line-item \nveto. I recall when he first came trying to say something to me about \nit. He may well recall this: I said, ``You don't even have to lay out \nthe arguments. I can't imagine why anybody in any legislative body \nwould want to give up the power of the purse strings to the \nExecutive.''\n  Again, I do not blame the Executive for asking for it. If any \nExecutive thought that the legislative body would be foolish enough to \njust hand over the most significant part of their power to them, well, \nfew Executives could resist the temptation.\n  Mr. BYRD. George Washington took the viewpoint that he had to veto \nthe entire bill or sign it or let it become law without his signature. \nHe could not do it piecemeal. Now the Senate and House have made it \npossible for any President to do just that. I do not think George \nWashington would have done that.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I say to my good friend from West Virginia, who has as \nstrong and abiding history as any person I have had the privilege of \nserving with, that it goes back to George Washington, that more of us \nshould say we want to go back to George Washington.\n  Unfortunately, we have a lot of people who give discussions about \nwhat were the Founders' intention, what was in the Constitution. I \nsometimes wonder if they have read either the Constitution, the \nFederalist Papers, or any history less recent than their latest poll.\n  I say this because I heard some Members say in the last couple days \nthat they wonder whether they made the right decision in voting for \nthat line-item veto but did not go on to say, ``But it was so popular \nin the polls''--so popular in the polls.\n  My good friend from West Virginia has read much on decisions made by \nthose who were at the drafting and introduction of the Magna Carta, has \ncertainly read The Federalist Papers more than anybody else here. He \nhas read the decisions that have been made at very difficult times in \nour history. And I suspect at most of those nobody was doing any \npolling.\n  I do not think that the Founders in Philadelphia--I do not think \nthere were many polls being taken. There were certainly discussions \namong people who had a great sense of not only history but the history \nthey were creating and the country they were putting together.\n  I suspect also, and my friend from West Virginia would probably agree \nwith this, I suspect also there were many, many there who read, as the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia knows, what happened to the \nRoman Senate. Caesar was given the power of the purse.\n  I think it is an interesting thing because shortly after the breakup \nof the Soviet Union, we had many visits here from parliamentarians \ncoming to see how to set up a democracy. I am still struck by one group \nfrom Russia who sat in my office asking, how do you do some of these \nthings? Suppose your President said, ``No, we will build this weapon \nand we will do that,'' and you said, ``No,'' how could you stop him? I \nsaid we would not give him the money, and they said, ``You mean you can \ndo that?'' That is why, after 200 years of being the most powerful \nnation on Earth, we are still a democracy. We are not a dictatorship \nbecause there is that check and balance.\n  I hope some who feel set upon because their own projects may have \nbeen vetoed, if they would go back and read history and think not just \nto be concerned because they are discomfited for the moment, but be \nmore concerned that they put an enormous hole in the walls that set up \nthe checks and balances in our Nation.\n  Does a Congress always use the power of the purse wisely? Of course \nnot. I can point to times I have been on the losing end in battles on \nappropriations and spending bills. The distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia rarely loses, but can still think, I am sure, of times he may \nhave. But it was the Senate working its will. It was the other House \nworking its will. And then, if the President doesn't like it, veto it, \nveto the bill.\n  I might say, and my friend from West Virginia will remember, we have \nhad a number of times in appropriations bills that we pass where the \nPresident really was against one particular point, and we sent it down, \nand he vetoed it. Then we entered into a process of negotiation and the \nbill gets passed again, and maybe that item, that one item he wanted \nout, was taken out. But he had to make that whole decision of thinking \nthey lost the whole bill in doing it, and we had to, too. It is a two-\nway street up and down Pennsylvania Avenue. Now we just send it to the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  I say to my friends here in the Senate, don't always jump to what is \npopular in the polls, especially if it hurts the country. The most \npopular part of the Contract With America, the most popular part, was \nterm limits. Now, that struck so close to the bone that those who would \nsign the Contract With America made darn sure no term-length-limit \nbills went through.\n  There were five or six different versions, so everybody could vote \nfor something, but no one version would pass. That struck close to home \nso that went through. Things that strike close to home like that are \npay raises and what not.\n  What I say is, think about the country itself. The line-item veto is \nnot a way in any democracy for a parliamentary party to give up its \npowers.\n  I thank my friend from West Virginia for raising the point. I yield \nthe floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10622-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10624-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10624]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EXPLANATION OF ABSENCE\n\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports \nthat for the week ending October 3, the United States imported \n9,492,000 barrels of oil each day, 1,607,000 barrels more than the \n7,885,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago.\n  Americans relied on foreign oil for 59.9 percent of their needs last \nweek, and there are no signs that the upward spiral will abate. Before \nthe Persian Gulf war, the United States obtained approximately 45 \npercent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab oil \nembargo in the 1970's, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Anybody else interested in restoring domestic production of oil by \nU.S. producers using American workers?\n  Politicians had better ponder the economic calamity sure to occur in \nAmerica if and when foreign producers shut off our supply--or double \nthe already enormous cost of imported oil flowing into the United \nStates--now 9,492,000 barrels a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10625-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10625-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10625]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:01 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hays, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 629.

A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to provide for \nenhanced intermodal transportation safety, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n            THE INTERMODAL TRANSPORTATION SAFETY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Intermodal \nTransportation Safety Act of 1997. I offer this measure as a starting \npoint for reauthorizing the many surface transportation safety programs \nlast considered in the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n[ISTEA] of 1991.\n  These programs, which are under the jurisdiction of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, include provisions \nto improve travel safety on our Nation's roads, promote the safe \nshipment of hazardous materials, advance pipeline transportation \nsafety, and ensure that our Nation's commercial motor vehicle fleet is \nwell maintained and safely operated.\n  Mr. President, transportation safety must be at the forefront of our \ndeliberations during the consideration of legislation to reauthorize \nISTEA. The ISTEA bill contains necessary funding and policy \nauthorizations to improve our transportation infrastructure and \nfacilitate the efficient and economical transportation of people and \ngoods. The legislation I am introducing is a vital component of that \neffort which is intended to meet our obligation to help ensure that \npeople and goods are transported safely.\n  The need for improvements in Federal transportation safety policy is \ncrystal clear. The National Transportation Safety Board [NTSB] recently \nreported that deaths from transportation accidents in the United States \ntotaled more than 44,000 for calendar year 1996. For example, highway-\nrelated deaths, which account for more than 90 percent of all \ntransportation fatalities, rose by 109, reaching a total of 41,907. The \nFederal Transit Administration reported 120 fatalities from accidents \nassociated with the operations of light and commuter rail companies, \ncompared to 98 in 1995. And, pipeline-related deaths totaled 20, \nagainst 21 in 1995.\n  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing addresses a wide range of \nissues and programs to promote and enhance surface transportation \nsafety in our Nation. Using the administration's reauthorization \nsubmissions as a primary guidepost, my legislation extends key safety \nprograms for 6 years. Many of the administration's safety proposals are \nincluded, but several new initiatives are added.\n  The primary differences between the administration's proposals and \nthe bill I am introducing are based on the budget agreement enacted in \nAugust. While I m sure a case can be made for additional funding in \nsome areas, the budget agreement simply does not allow for it. \nConsequently, the funding authorized under this measure fully complies \nwithin the budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, I would like to provide a broad overview of the \nvarious transportation safety provisions contained in this legislation. \nFirst, this bill addresses various programs under the National Highway \nTransportation Safety Administration [NHTSA]. The legislation \nreauthorizes various grant programs, administered by NHTSA, to improve \nsafety on America's roadways. Those grant programs would provide over \n$1.1 billion to the States during the next 6 years. This portion of the \nbill is the administration's request which I'm introducing without \nmodification as a starting point for discussion and debate. In regard \nto these grant programs, the legislation is identical to the \nadministration's proposal, with the exception that the funds authorized \nhave been scaled down to fit within the boundaries of the budget \nagreement.\n  Second, this bill reauthorizes funding for programs to ensure the \nsafe transportation of hazardous materials. It also includes a number \nof changes intended to strengthen and improve the hazardous materials \ntransportation program. For example, according to DOT s Research and \nSpecial Programs Administration [RSPA] statistics, there were hundreds \nof transportation related incidents involving undeclared or hidden \nhazardous materials. These incidents resulted in 110 deaths and 112 \ninjuries from January 1990 through October 1996. This legislation would \ngive DOT inspectors the authority to open and examine the contents of \npackages suspected of containing hazardous materials.\n  This provision would help ensure that packages containing undeclared \nhazardous materials shipments can be removed from transportation before \nthey harm individuals. In the event a package is opened under the bill \ns authorities, DOT inspectors would be required to mark the package \naccordingly and notify the shipper before the parcel could continue in \ntransport.\n  The legislation also expands hazardous materials training access by \nallowing States and Indian tribes to use a portion of their grants to \nhelp train small businesses in complying with hazardous materials \nshipment procedures. DOT has indicated that the majority of hazardous \nmaterials shipment and packaging mistakes occur at small businesses.\n  The legislation also authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to \nissue emergency orders when it is determined that an unsafe condition \nposes an imminent hazard. In such a situation, the Secretary is granted \nthe authority to issue recalls, restrictions, or out-of-service orders \nto lessen the dangerous condition.\n  Third, at the request of the majority leader, this bill incorporates \nS. 1115, the Comprehensive One-Call Notification Act, introduced by \nSenators Lott and Daschle on July 31, 1997. S. 1115 would encourage a \nnational effort to encourage States to strengthen their laws that \nprotect underground pipelines, telecommunication cables, and other \ninfrastructure from excavation damage.\n  Discussions are ongoing concerning this and several of the \nadministration's proposals and I m hopeful that we can reach agreement \non some of the remaining technical issues. Quick and timely resolution \non these outstanding matters will be necessary so we can address these \nissues as the Intermodal Transportation Safety Act of 1997 moves to the \nSenate Floor.\n  Fourth, this bill reauthorizes the Motor Carrier Safety Assistance \nProgram [MCSAP] which provides funding for commercial driver and \nvehicle safety inspections, traffic enforcement, compliance reviews, \nand safety data collection. It further authorizes a performance-based \napproach for the MCSAP, removing many of the prescriptive requirements \nof the program. Instead, States would be given greater flexibility to \nimplement safety activities and goals they design to evaluate and \nimprove truck safety programs. This new performance-based approach, to \nbe implemented by 2000, would enable States to spend their limited \nresources on those activities best able to address their unique motor \ncarrier problem areas.\n  This legislation also contains several other important truck and bus \nsafety enhancement provisions. It would strengthen safety enforcement \nby extending the Secretary s safety jurisdiction to intrastate trips \nmade by interstate carriers. The bill would also help ensure greater \nsafety oversight by permitting the Secretary to contract with private \nentities to conduct inspections and investigations to ensure compliance \nwith Federal motor carrier safety regulations. Similar contractual \nauthority is already afforded to the Department of Defense and the \nFederal Aviation Administration. The bill further strengthens safety \noversight by extending safety regulations such as commercial drivers \nlicensing and drug and alcohol testing requirements to for-hire \npassenger vans. It would also permit the Secretary to order any unsafe \ncarrier to cease operations. Currently this authority applies only to \nprevent unsafe operations of commercial passenger carriers and \nhazardous materials carriers.\n  I have also incorporated a number of provisions designed to promote \nthe timely and accurate exchange of important carrier and driver safety \nrecords. This bill authorizes comprehensive information systems and \nstrategic safety initiatives to support motor carrier regulatory and \nenforcement activities as requested by the administration.\n  It also establishes a pilot program to help facilitate the exchange \nof accurate driver records data history in an attempt to prevent such \nunacceptable tragedies as the one that occurred this\n\n[[Page S10633]]\n\nsummer on the streets of Washington DC, when an unfit driver of a dump \ntruck killed a young man. Further, this legislation would permit \ncarriers to provide safety records of former drivers to prospective \nemployers without the fear of a former employee taking legal action \nagainst the carrier, provided the data exchanged is accurate.\n  Mr. President, like every time Congress considers legislation \naffecting Federal motor carrier safety regulations, various segments of \nthe industry seek exemptions. Some are common sense, such as \nacknowledging the special transportation time constraints of farmers \nduring the planting and harvesting seasons, or, for example, \nrecognizing the need to permit road maintenance crews, such as for snow \nremoval, to operate during weather emergencies. Legislation should not \nbe needed to permit these and other exemptions. However, that is the \nprocess we go through today.\n  While the Secretary already has authority to grant waivers from some \nor all of the regulations, the authority is almost meaningless because \nprior to granting an exemption, it must first be proven the exemption \nwould not diminish safety. However, it is not possible to make such a \nfinding unless an exemption can first be tested on a limited basis. In \nan attempt to address this problem and recognize the Secretary should \nbe permitted to examine innovative approaches or alternatives to \ncertain rules, and in turn reduce unnecessary regulatory burdens that \ndo not produce a safety return. This legislation would authorize the \nSecretary to carry out pilot programs to test the affects of certain \nlimited regulatory exemptions.\n  However, safety must remain at the forefront of these pilot projects. \nThe bill language clearly states that the Secretary can only approve \npilot projects that are expected to meet or exceed the overall level of \nsafety that would be achieved with existing regulatory requirements.\n  Mr. President, there are other important provisions in the Intermodal \nTransportation Safety Act. While I will not list each and every \nprovision, there is another initiative I want to highlight.\n  Our transportation system is vulnerable to security threats. Almost 2 \nyears ago today, Arizonans and citizens throughout the country were \nsaddened to learn of an Amtrak derailment near Hyder, AZ, which claimed \nthe life of 1 individual and injured 78 others. Shortly after the \naccident, the sadness turned to shock as we learned that the derailment \ncould have been caused by someone who may have intentionally sabotaged \nthe track. The Arizona accident is not unique. There have been other \nexamples of acts against railroads. Therefore, as requested by the \nadministration, this legislation would create criminal sanctions for \nviolent attacks against railroads, their employees, and passengers. The \npenalties are similar to those which currently cover vessels, airlines, \nmotor carriers, and pipelines.\n  As chairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, I invite my colleagues to join me in determining \nwhether any refinements to this safety bill are warranted. I welcome my \ncolleagues input and plan to work with all members to incorporate this \ncomprehensive safety legislation during our work on legislation to \nreauthorize ISTEA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1267\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \ncorrect a wrong that has been done to an unknown number of Federal \nretirees in computing their annuities.\n  Through a letter from Mr. L. David Jones, I was informed that the \n1986 Civil Service amendments contained in the Consolidated Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act were being misapplied to penalize career \nFederal civil servants who had some part-time service at the end of \ntheir careers. Mr. Jones, and I'm sure many others, was encouraged to \ntransition to retirement by working part-time for several years rather \nthan just retiring after a 30-year career. Imagine Mr. Jones' surprise \nwhen he calculated his annuity after 30 years of full-time service and \nfive years of part-time service and realized that he would have been \nbetter off if he had just retired after 30 years.\n  At first I believed this problem was simply a matter of the Office of \nPersonnel Management misunderstanding the intent of Congress and that \nthe situation could be corrected through administrative action. The \nOffice of Personnel Management, however, has firmly stated that they \nare carrying out the letter of the law, and any change to the current \nannuity calculation will require congressional action.\n  That is why I am here today. Mr. Jones, and any others who are in a \nsimilar situation, deserve to have an annuity that accurately reflects \ntheir many years of service. This bill will allow those retirees to \nhave their annuities recalculated to ensure that they are not penalized \nfor not retiring outright. Realize also, however, that this bill does \nnot authorize back payments for any lost annuity--the legislation \nsimply tries to put things right for future payments to retirees \naffected by this previous error and to ensure that no future retirees \nare similarly penalized.\n  We must also look ahead and realize that any policy which discourages \npart-time service in these situations threatens to lead to a ``brain \ndrain'' as baby boomers begin to retire. Many agencies have already \nexpressed concern about their graying workforce and the difficulties \nthey will face as these experienced workers retire. One option often \nmentioned is to encourage part-time service, so that the experience \nremains and allows for a transition of responsibilities to younger \nworkers. As it stands now, a civil servant would be ill-advised to \nagree to that part-time transition to retirement.\n  For both of these reasons, I encourage all of my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation, and I will work with my colleagues on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee to see that this bill is considered as \nquickly as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 1273. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to expand the \nNational Mail Order Pharmacy Program of the Department of Defense to \ninclude covered beneficiaries under the military health care system who \nare also entitled to Medicare; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n     the national mail order pharmacy program expansion act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I stand before you to highlight an \ninjustice which has been done to the men and women who have served this \ncountry with selfless dedication. They have devoted themselves to the \nmission of protecting our country while promoting peace and democracy \naround the world. For this contribution to our country, we reward their \nperformance with a retirement package which includes health care. \nUnfortunately, through a series of independent laws, we have created a \ndisjointed health care benefits package which treats retirees \ndifferently depending on their age and where they happen to live.\n  I am introducing a bill to correct this disjointed health care \npolicy. There is clearly a double standard affecting our veterans. \nUnder the current provisions of the law, military retirees are eligible \nto receive health care under the CHAMPUS program until they become 65 \nyears old. After that time, their health care is provided by Medicare. \nUnder the CHAMPUS program, retirees have access to a program known as \nthe mail-order pharmacy program which allows military members and \nretirees to obtain prescription drugs through the mail. Retirees over \nthe age of 65 years old cannot be supported through the CHAMPUS program \nunder current legislative restrictions. Medicare has no such pharmacy \nbenefit. This means that once retirees become 65 years old, they lose \nthe benefit and convenience of a mail-order pharmacy program. This \ncomes at a time in their lives when they are more likely to need \nprescription drugs.\n  I commend the Department of Defense on their initiative to develop \nthe mail-order pharmacy program. This new program was established to \nprovide better service to the military community and to enable them to \nmaximize that level of service within their decreasing available \nresources.\n  Military retirees and their dependents are eligible to receive free \nmedical care from military installations on a space available basis. \nHowever, as the military continues to downsize their medical corps, \n``space available'' is becoming more and more elusive for retirees. \nPharmacy services are likewise available to retirees at military \ninstallations on a space available basis. For those retirees who were \nreceiving their medical care, including prescription services, from a \nmilitary installation which was closed by Base Realignment and Closure \n[BRAC] decisions, we have made an exception to the law which allows \nthese retirees to participate in the mail-order pharmacy program. We \nhave created a conglomeration of rules\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\nwhich apply to military retirees depending on their personal \ncircumstances.\n  My proposal is very simple. All military retirees, including their \ndependents, should have access to the same health care benefits. We \nshould not differentiate between medical benefits based only on a \nretiree's age or where a retiree happens to live. All retirees should \nbe allowed to use the mail-order pharmacy program.\n  The General Accounting Office estimates that this proposal will cost \napproximately $229 million. While I remain committed to reducing the \nbudget deficit and maintaining a balanced budget, I feel that the \ncurrent legislation has created an inequity in the retirement benefits \nprovided to our military personnel which must be corrected. It is the \nright thing to do.\n  This Nation owes a debt of gratitude to our military retirees. They \nhave endured many hardships during their careers, including separation \nfrom their families for extended periods of time and frequent moves to \nall corners of the globe. They have also risked their lives in the name \nof freedom and democracy.\n  Military retirees have given tirelessly of themselves throughout \ntheir careers, and this proposal is an opportunity to correct an unjust \nsituation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1273\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nprohibit the Internal Revenue Service from using the threat of audit to \ncompel agreement with the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment or the \nTip Rate Determination.\n\n\n       the citizens voluntary compliance partnership act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, last week the Senate passed the Treasury \nand general Government appropriations bill for fiscal year 1998. \nIncluded in the final conference report to that bill was language \nregarding the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment Program [TRAC].\n  TRAC is a voluntary agreement entered into by the Internal Revenue \nService and restaurant employers across the country. Under TRAC, \nemployers agree to better educate their employees on tip reporting and \nalso to monitor the tips received by employees. Developed just a few \nshort years ago, TRAC is seen as a way to combat the instances of \nunderreporting and nonreporting of tips.\n  However, it has come to the attention of many in Congress that the \nIRS may be using the threat of an audit to compel restaurant owners to \nenter into this agreement. While the IRS does have the authority to \nperform audits, I do not feel it is appropriate for this agency to be \nutilizing this right as a means of intimidation.\n  The report language pertaining to TRAC, which I ask unanimous consent \nbe printed in the Record, states that the IRS ``should ensure \ncompliance with tip reporting by stressing its customer service role \nwhile working with restaurant owners.'' The legislation I am \nintroducing today would simply put some teeth into this report \nlanguage.\n  All my bill does is prohibit the IRS from using the threat of making \nan examination or issuing a summons to compel a restaurant owner to \nenter into TRAC. It does not limit the IRS' authority to perform such \nfunctions. It simply prohibits the agency from using these tools as a \nmeans of forcing compliance.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1274\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment Agreement and \n     the tip Rate Determination Agreement are voluntary agreements \n     developed by the Internal Revenue Service and the restaurant \n     industry as a means of improving the reporting of tip income;\n       (2) there have been reports that the Internal Revenue \n     Service may be compelling members of the restaurant industry \n     to accept such voluntary agreement by using the possibility \n     of audit to intimidate; and\n       (3) the Internal Revenue Service has the authority to \n     perform audits to assure taxpayer compliance with the \n     internal revenue laws.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON USING THE THREAT OF AUDIT TO COMPEL \n                   AGREEMENT WITH THE TIP REPORTING ALTERNATIVE \n                   COMMITMENT.\n\n       Section 7602 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating \n     to examination of books and witnesses) is amended by adding \n     at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(d) No Threat of Summons or Examinations to Compel \n     Agreement With Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment or the \n     Tip Rate Determination Agreement.--The Secretary shall not \n     use the threat of making an examination or issuing a summons \n     under subsection (1) to compel a taxpayer to agree to or sign \n     the Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment Agreement (TRAC) or \n     the Tip Rate Determination Agreement (TRDA).''\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n              Tip Reporting Alternative Commitment Program\n\n       The conferees agree with the House position that the IRS \n     should work with taxpayers to ensure compliance with the Tip \n     Reporting Alternative Commitment Agreement (TRAC). In too \n     many instances, restaurant owners perceive that the IRS may \n     be overzealous in their pursuit of voluntary agreement with \n     TRAC by intimating that the business will be audited if there \n     is no agreement. The conferees agree that IRS should ensure \n     compliance with tip reporting by stressing its customer \n     service role while working with the restaurant owners.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1275. A bill to implement further the Act (Public Law 94-241) \napproving the Covenant to Establish a Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands in Political Union with the United States of America, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n       the northern mariana islands convenant implementation act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I send to the desk, for appropriate \nreference, legislation on behalf of myself and Senator Akaka that the \nadministration has provided me in response to my request for a drafting \nservice. This legislation represents the language that the \nadministration believes will implement its recommendations contained in \nthe most recent report on the Federal-CNMI Initiative on Labor, \nImmigration, and Law Enforcement in the Commonwealth of the Northern \nMariana Islands.\n  In 1994, Congress directed this Initiative in Public Law 103-332 and \nprovided $7 million for fiscal years 1995 and 1996 with an additional \n$3 million for fiscal year 1997. In testimony before the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources, the administration committed to provide \nan annual report on the progress of the Initiative.\n  Partially in response to concerns that had been raised about \nconditions in the Commonwealth, Senator Akaka and I visited Saipan in \nFebruary of last year. In addition to extensive briefings and meetings \nwith Commonwealth officials, we also met with Federal agency personnel \nand the U.S. attorney. We also visited a garment factory and talked \nwith some Bangladesh workers who had not been paid and who were living \nin appalling conditions. We were assured that corrective action would \nbe taken. I want to note that my concerns were not exclusively with the \nCommonwealth government, but also went to the willingness of the \nadministration to commit the needed resources to address the problems \nthat we saw. I specifically asked the Attorney General for the \nappointment of a full-time U.S.\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\nattorney for the Northern Marianas rather than having the U.S. attorney \nfor Guam also serve the Northern Marianas. The Attorney General \nresponded that there wasn't enough work to justify a U.S. attorney.\n  On June 26 of last year, I chaired a hearing that examined what \nprogress had been made. In addition to the administration, the acting \nAttorney General of the Commonwealth appeared and requested that the \ncommittee delay any action until the Commonwealth could complete a \nstudy on minimum wage and assured me that the study would be completed \nby January. I agreed to the delay. My intention was to revisit this \nissue in the April-May period after the administration had transmitted \nits annual report. While the CNMI study was not finally transmitted \nuntil April, the Administration did not transmit its annual report, \nwhich was due in April, until July. On May 30, 1997, the President \nwrote the Governor of the Northern Marianas that he was concerned over \nactivities in the Commonwealth and had concluded that Federal \nimmigration, naturalization, and minimum wage laws should apply. That \nletter provoked a flurry of statements, letters, articles, stories, and \nlegislation, most of which generated more heat than light.\n  It quickly became clear that unless there was some definition as to \nexactly what the problem was and what solution was being proposed, \nlittle would happen other than a series of bewildering and increasingly \nhostile statements. The atmosphere also made the possibility of a \nuseful oversight hearing increasingly remote. I must say that I have \nnot been particularly impressed by either the advocates of Federal \nlegislation or the opponents. One side responds to concerns over \nworkers living in barracks, abuse of domestics, prostitution, and other \nproblems by suggesting that the answer is to raise the minimum wage. \nThe response to allegations of abuse of workers, especially women, is \nnot to propose raising the minimum wage. Paying a person more does not \njustify abuse. The other side of the argument seems to me to also miss \nthe point. The last time we heard a justification that economic \nadvances would be jeopardized if workers were treated properly was \nshortly before Appomattox. Whatever economic benefits some may have \nrealized, that does not justify worker abuse, indentured servants, or \nthe conditions that I saw those Bangladesh workers living in.\n\n  There are certain issues that I believe need a full hearing and \ncareful review. The minimum wage study that the Commonwealth \ncommissioned noted at one point that the Marianas has used its control \nover immigration and minimum wage to import foreign workers who would \nbe paid more than they would receive in their home countries, but less \nthan the Federal minimum wage. These workers would produce garments \nthat would be subject to quotas if produced in their home country, but \nwhich could be imported duty free into the mainland United States since \nthe Marianas is outside the customs territory of the U.S. but subject \nto preferential treatment under General Note 3(a) of the Tariff \nSchedules. That is an issue that the Congress should review.\n  When we considered the Covenant for the Marianas, we were sensitive \nto the fact that the Marianas had been under the minimum wage \nprovisions of the Trust Territory and that immediate introduction of \nthe Federal minimum wage might have an adverse effect on a developing \neconomy that was still heavily dependent on annual Federal grants for \nbasic Government services. We also recognized the concern expressed by \nthe negotiators for the Northern Marianas that their small population \ncould be overrun easily by migration. In response, we permitted the \nMarianas to control the timing of minimum wage and to exercise control \nover immigration. We also provided restraints on land alienation to \nprotect the population. We did not consider that entrepreneurs would \ndiscover a loophole that would allow a lower minimum wage and \nimmigration to create a non-indigenous industry that is Marianas in \nname only. Congress should examine whether this is a situation that \nshould be permitted under the tariff schedules.\n  There are also legitimate questions concerning minimum wage and \nimmigration. We should now have sufficient experience to assess whether \nthe Marianas is capable of providing the pre-clearance for any persons \nwho attempt to enter the Marianas. The United States routinely does \nthis in foreign countries as part of our visa process. The situation \nthat I saw with the Bangladesh workers should never have happened. \nReports of other workers who arrive only to find no jobs should also \nnever happen. There should be no unemployment among the guest workers. \nThese are legitimate immigration related issues. They do not \nnecessarily lead to a Federal takeover, but they are legitimate issues \nand it serves no purpose to distort history and pretend that the \ncurrent situation was the goal of the Covenant negotiators.\n  Minimum wage is also a fairly straightforward issue. It does not \nappear that any U.S. citizens in the Northern Marianas are paid less \nthan the current Federal minimum wage. Is there a justification and a \nneed to pay foreign workers less and to what extent does the ability to \nimport skilled foreign labor at less than Federal minimum wages \ncontribute to the unemployment rate in the Marianas? Is there a reason \nto pay less than the minimum wage to attract skilled positions? There \nare issues that should be reviewed in a hearing.\n  Given the furor that followed the President's letter, I decided to \nask the administration to provide me with a drafting service of the \nlanguage that would implement whatever the recommendations were in \ntheir report. The report was finally submitted in July, and I received \nthe drafting service on October 6, 1997. On July 16, 1997, I wrote the \nGovernor of the Commonwealth to inform him that I had made the request \nand the schedule that I intended to follow. I want to reiterate my \nstatement. I am committed to holding hearings on this legislation. I am \nnot wedded to any particular provision in the legislation, but I am not \nhappy with the situation in the Commonwealth. I ask unanimous consent \nthat a copy of my letter be printed in the Record as well as a copy of \nthe transmittal letter from the administration, the text of the \nlegislation, and a section-by-section analysis.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that elections are only a few weeks away \nin the Marianas. I do not think that hearings prior to the elections \nwould be particularly productive. Our committee has tried to be \nnonpartisan in our approach to our responsibilities for the territories \nand we have tried to avoid local politics. Given the seriousness of \nthese issues, I think they should be raised after the elections. I want \nto make it clear, however, that whatever the results of the elections \nin the Marianas, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee intends to \nproceed impartially and expeditiously.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1275\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

(Section \n     1 of Proclamation No. 5564, dated November 3, 1986. 51 F.R. \n     40399).\n       Section 6, subsection (a) would provide that, effective on \n     the first day of the first full month commencing one year \n     after the enactment date of section 6, the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act, as amended (the ``INA''), would apply in \n     full to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands \n     (CNMI). At the same time, a transition program would become \n     effective for the orderly phasing out of the CNMI's current \n     temporary alien worker program. The Attorney General, in \n     consultation with the Secretaries of State, Labor, and \n     Interior, will be charged with establishing, administering, \n     and enforcing this transition program. To implement this \n     program, each agency having responsibilities under the \n     program will be required to promulgate appropriate \n     regulations. The details of this program are set forth in the \n     subsections below.\n       Section 6, subsection (b) would set forth the requirements \n     under the transition program for the admission of temporary \n     alien workers who would not otherwise be eligible for \n     nonimmigrant classification under the INA.\n       Paragraph (1) would provide that aliens who are admitted \n     under the transition program, like most nonimmigrants \n     admitted under the INA, will have the right to apply, if they \n     are otherwise eligible, for a change of status to a \n     nonimmigrant classification under the INA, or, if otherwise \n     eligible, for adjustment of status to lawful permanent \n     residence of the United States.\n       Paragraph (2)(A) would set out the responsibilities of the \n     United States Department of Labor under the transition \n     program. The Secretary of Labor would be charged with \n     establishing, administering, and enforcing a reasonable \n     system for the annual allocation of permits to be issued to \n     prospective employers of temporary alien workers who would \n     not be eligible for admission under the INA. This system \n     would provide for a reduction in the allocation of permits \n     for such workers on an annual basis, over a maximum period of \n     ten years, with no such permit to be valid beyond the \n     expiration of the transition period. The system would be \n     designed to promote the maximum use of, and to prevent \n     adverse effects on, United States labor and lawfully \n     admissible freely associated state citizen labor. In carrying \n     out its responsibilities under the subsection, the Department \n     of Labor would be authorized to collect appropriate user \n     fees. Paragraph (2)(B) would authorize the Secretary of Labor \n     to establish and collect appropriate user fees for the \n     purposes of this section.\n       Paragraph (3) would assign the Attorney General the \n     responsibility of setting the conditions for admission of \n     temporary alien workers under the transition program. In \n     addition, this subsection would assign to the Secretary of \n     State the responsibility for the issuance of nonimmigrant \n     visas, which would not be valid for admission to other parts \n     of the United States, to such persons. Aliens admitted to the \n     NMI as temporary workers under this program would be \n     permitted to engage in employment only as authorized in this \n     subsection. Such temporary workers, therefore, would not \n     engage open market employment in the NMI, but would be \n     required to work for an employer approved by the Attorney \n     General and the Secretary of Labor in accordance with this \n     subsection.\n       Paragraph (4) would provide for job transfer rights for \n     otherwise eligible temporary alien workers admitted under the \n     transition program pursuant to criteria established by the \n     Attorney General and the Secretary of Labor.\n       Section 6, subsection (c), would provide that, with the \n     exception of certain close family relatives, and except as \n     provided in section (6)(c)(1) and (2) aliens seeking to \n     immigrate to the NMI under the INA would not be granted \n     initial admission as a lawful permanent resident of the \n     United States at a port-of-entry in the NMI, or at a port-of-\n     entry in Guam for the purpose of immigration to the NMI.\n       Paragraph (1) would provide that, notwithstanding section \n     6(c) above, the Attorney General, based on the recommendation \n     of the CNMI Government, and after consultation with \n     appropriate federal agencies, may allow a specific number of \n     additional initial admissions to the NMI (or through Guam to \n     the NMI) as a family-sponsored immigrant under the INA.\n       Paragraph (2) would provide the Attorney General with the \n     authority to admit to the NMI, under exceptional \n     circumstances, a limited number of employment-based \n     immigrants, without regard to the normal numerical \n     limitations under the INA, during the transition program.\n       Subparagraph (a) would provide that the Secretary of Labor, \n     upon receipt of a joint recommendation of the Governor and \n     Legislature of the CNMI, may find that exceptional \n     circumstances exist which preclude employers in the NMI \n     from obtaining sufficient work-authorized labor. If the \n     Secretary of Labor makes such a finding, the Attorney \n     General may establish a specific number of employment-\n     based ``third preference'' immigrant visas to be made \n     available during the following fiscal year under the INA.\n       Subparagraph (B) would permit the Secretary of State to \n     allocate up to the number of visas requested by the Attorney \n     General without regard to the normal per-country or ``other \n     worker'' employment-based third preference numerical \n     limitations and visa issuance. These visas would be allocated \n     first from unused employment-based third preference visa \n     numbers, and then, if necessary, from unused alien \n     entrepreneur visa numbers.\n       Subparagraph (C) would allow persons granted employment-\n     based immigrant visas under the transition program to be \n     admitted initially at a port-of-entry in the NMI (or through \n     a port-of-entry in Guam to the NMI).\n       Subparagraph (D) would provide that any immigrant visa \n     issued pursuant to this paragraph shall be valid only for \n     application for initial admission to the NMI. Further, any \n     employment-based immigrant visas issued on the basis of the \n     above finding of ``exceptional circumstances'' would be valid \n     for admission for lawful permanent residence and employment \n     only in the NMI during the first five years after initial \n     admission. Such visas would not authorize permanent residence \n     or employment in any other part of the United States during \n     this five-year period. The subsection also would provide for \n     the issuance of appropriate documentation of such admission, \n     and, consistent with Chapter 7 of Title II of the INA, would \n     require an alien to register and report to the Attorney \n     General during the five-year period.\n       Subparagraph (E) would provide that an alien who is subject \n     to the five-year limitation under section 6(c) may, if \n     otherwise eligible, apply for an immigrant visa or admission \n     as a lawful permanent resident under the INA.\n       Subparagraph (F) would provide for the removal from the \n     United States of any alien subject to the five-year \n     limitation if the alien violates the provisions of section \n     6(c), or if the alien is found to be removable or \n     inadmissible under various provisions of the INA.\n       Subparagraph (G) would allow certain aliens who have \n     obtained lawful permanent resident status under the \n     transition program to apply for a waiver of the terms and \n     conditions of their status in certain extraordinary \n     situations where the Attorney General finds that the alien \n     would suffer exceptional and extremely unusual hardship were \n     such conditions not waived. An example of such an \n     extraordinary circumstance would be where the alien is a \n     labor organizer and can demonstrate that, as a result of the \n     alien's lawful labor activities, he or she has been \n     ``blacklisted'' by local employers, and is therefore unable \n     to find employment in the Northern Mariana Islands. The \n     benefits of this provision would be unavailable to a person \n     who has violated the terms and conditions of his or her \n     permanent resident status, such as an alien who has engaged \n     in the unauthorized employment.\n       Subparagrah (H) would provide that the limitations on the \n     terms and conditions of an alien's permanent residence \n     granted under section 6(c) shall expire at the end of five \n     years after the alien's admission to the NMI as a permanent \n     resident. Thereafter, such an alien would be fully subject to \n     the provisions of the INA, and may engage in any lawful \n     activity, including employment, anywhere in the United \n     States. In addition, such an alien, if otherwise eligible for \n     naturalization, may count the five-year period in the NMI \n     towards time in the United States for purposes of meeting the \n     residence requirements of Title III of the INA.\n\n[[Page S10654]]\n\n       Section 6, subsection (d), would permit, upon the meeting \n     certain requirements, that certain aliens who were admitted \n     to the NMI in long-term investor status under CNMI \n     immigration law on or before the effective date of this Act \n     to remain in the NMI after the effective date of the Act. In \n     order to enjoy the benefits of this subsection, such persons \n     would be required to have continuously maintained residence \n     in the NMI pursuant to such long-term investor status.\n       Paragraph (1) would provide that such long-term investors \n     may apply to the Attorney General or a consular officer for \n     nonimmigrant classification, to terminate no later than \n     December 31, 2008, under the transition program.\n       Paragraph (2) would provide that an alien granted \n     nonimmigrant status under this section may apply for \n     adjustment of status to lawful permanent resident of the \n     United States during the six-month period beginning January \n     1, 2008, and ending June 30, 2008. If otherwise admissible, \n     such an alien would be granted permanent resident status \n     effective on or after January 1, 2009. Each such adjustment \n     of status would be subject to the total per-country numerical \n     limitations on immigrant visa issuance, and therefore would \n     count against the total number of immigrant visas available \n     to natives of the country of the alien's chargeability.\n       Section 6, subsection (e) would permit persons who would \n     have been lawfully present in the NMI pursuant to local \n     immigration law as of the effective date of this subsection \n     to remain in the NMI for the completion of their period of \n     admission under such local law, as long as such period does \n     not extend beyond two years after such effective date.\n       Section 6, subsection (f) would impose travel restrictions \n     on asylum aliens admitted to the NMI pursuant to the laws of \n     the CNMI or as temporary workers or employment-based \n     immigrants under the transition program who apply for \n     asylum. Such persons will be required to remain the NMI \n     during the period of time the application is pending or \n     during any appeal period thereafter. An applicant for \n     asylum who during such period leaves the CNMI on his own \n     will without the prior permission of the Attorney General \n     thereby abandons the application.\n       Section 6, subsection (g) would provide that, effective on \n     the first day of the first full month commencing one year \n     after the enactment date of this section, this section and \n     the INA would supersede all laws, provisions, or programs of \n     the CNMI Government relating to the admission of aliens to \n     and the removal of aliens from the NMI.\n       Section 6, subsection (h) would provide that no time of \n     ``unlawful presence'' in the NMI would accrue for purposes of \n     the ground of inadmissibility in section 212(a)(9)(B) prior \n     to the date of enactment of section 6.\n       Section 2, subsection (b) would provide for three \n     ``Conforming Amendments.''\n       Paragraph (1)(A) would amend section 101(a)(36) of the INA, \n     which defines the term ``state'' for purposes of the INA, to \n     include the Northern Mariana Islands. This amendment would \n     become effective on the first day of the first full month \n     commencing one year after enactment date of section 2 of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation Act.\n       Paragraph (1)(B) would amend section 101(a)(38) of the INA, \n     which defines the term ``United States'' for purposes of the \n     INA, to include the Northern Mariana Islands. This amendment \n     would become effective on the first day of the first full \n     month commencing one year after the enactment date of section \n     2 of the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant Implementation \n     Act.\n       Paragraph (2) would amend section 212(l) of the INA to \n     extend the Guam Visa Waiver Program to the CNMI.\n       Section 2, subsection (c) would obligate the Secretaries of \n     Interior and Labor, in consultation with CNMI, to develop a \n     technical assistance program to aid NMI employers in \n     recruiting, training, and securing employees from among \n     United States labor or lawfully admissible freely associated \n     state citizen labor.\n       Section 2, subsection (d) would authorize the Attorney \n     General to establish and maintain Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service and Executive Office of Immigration \n     Review operations, and the Secretary of Labor to establish \n     and maintain operations in the NMI in order to perform their \n     respective responsibilities under the INA and the transition \n     program. Subsection (d) further provides for local \n     recruitment and hiring, where appropriate, by the Departments \n     of Justice and Labor.\n       Section 2, subsection (c) would provide that the President \n     report to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural \n     Resources, and the House Committee on Resources, evaluating \n     the overall effect of the transition program and the INA on \n     the CNMI.\n       Section 2, subsection (f) would provide that the CNMI may \n     not increase the total number of temporary alien workers who \n     may be present in the NMI during the one year period after \n     enactment of this section and before the effective date of \n     the transition program from the number present on the date of \n     enactment.\n       Section 2, subsection (g) would authorize the appropriation \n     of such sums as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of \n     this section and the INA with respect to the CNMI.\n       Section 3 would add a new section 7 to the Covenant Act \n     that would, beginning thirty days after enactment, raise the \n     minimum wage in the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana \n     Islands from the current CNMI rate of $3.05 per hour to the \n     Federal minimum wage rate (currently $5.15 per hour), in 30-\n     cent annual increments. This provision would be similar to \n     the minimum wage increase law enacted by the CNMI \n     legislature, but later repealed.\n       Section 4 would add a new section 8 to the Covenant Act \n     that would require that textile and apparel products produced \n     in the Northern Mariana Islands, which bear a ``Made in USA'' \n     or similar label, be produced in a factory certified by the \n     United States Department of Labor to use United States labor \n     (including citizens, nationals, lawful permanent residents, \n     refugees, or asylees) or freely associated state citizen \n     labor in the following qualified hours of full-time employee \n     equivalents--20 percent for the year beginning January 1, \n     1998, 35 percent for the year beginning January 1, 1999, and \n     50 percent beginning January 1, 2000, and thereafter. A \n     textile or apparel product bearing a ``Made in USA'' label \n     that is not produced in a certified factory would be deemed \n     to be misbranded for the purposes of the Textile Fiber \n     Products Identification Act, and sanctions would apply. \n     Additionally, a product would be misbranded if certification \n     by the United States Department of Labor were based on false \n     or incomplete information provided to the Department of \n     Labor.\n       Section 5 would amend General Note 3(a)(iv) of the \n     Harmonized Tariff Schedules of the United States to prohibit \n     a textile or apparel product produced in the Commonwealth of \n     the Northern Mariana Islands from being admitted duty-free \n     into the customs territory of the United States as a product \n     of an insular possession unless the product is produced in a \n     factory certified by the United States Department of Labor to \n     use United States labor (including citizens, nationals, \n     lawful permanent residents, refugees, or asylees) or freely \n     associated state citizen labor in the following qualified \n     hours of full-time employee equivalents--20 percent for the \n     year beginning January 1, 1998, 35 percent for the year \n     beginning January 1, 1999, and 50 percent beginning January \n     1, 2000, and thereafter.\n                                                                    ____\n\n           U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 16, 1997.\n     Hon. Froilan C. Tenorio,\n     Governor of the Northern Mariana Islands, Saipan, MP.\n       Dear Governor Tenorio: I am writing to you concerning the \n     continuing reports of conditions in the Commonwealth of the \n     Northern Mariana Islands and the various measures that have \n     been suggested to address those problems. In February of last \n     year, I had the opportunity to visit the Commonwealth with \n     Senator Akaka. While our visit was brief, we did see \n     conditions that simply should not be allowed to exist in any \n     area under the sovereignty of the United States. In meetings \n     with your staff, we were assured that your Administration was \n     committed to prompt and effective law enforcement, and that \n     we needed to give the joint Federal-CNMI initiative time to \n     work.\n       On June 26 of last year, the Committee conducted a hearing \n     that in part focused on oversight of the situation in the \n     Northern Marianas. I stated that unless the Commonwealth took \n     action to remedy the problems that existed, federal action \n     was all but inevitable. While I support local authority, that \n     authority must be responsibly exercised. At that hearing, \n     your representative asked that the Committee delay any action \n     until the Commonwealth could complete a report on minimum \n     wage and that the report would be available in January of \n     this year. I agreed. Although the report was not available \n     until April, that delay did not appear to be a major problem \n     since the Department of the Interior was due to submit its \n     report on the Federal-CNMI Initiative on Labor, Immigration, \n     and Law Enforcement in April.\n       Although the Administration's report has still not been \n     submitted, on May 30, 1997 the President wrote you that he \n     had concluded that federal immigration, naturalization, and \n     minimum wage laws should now be applied to the Commonwealth. \n     To date, although the Administration has not transmitted \n     legislation to implement the President's conclusion, \n     legislation extending those laws has been introduced in the \n     House and I am aware of several Members of the Senate who are \n     also considering similar measures.\n       I intend to schedule a hearing to consider what \n     legislation, if any, should be enacted shortly after the \n     Administration submits its report, which I understand is now \n     under final review by the Office of Management and Budget. I \n     have asked the Secretary of the Interior to draft legislation \n     to implement the final recommendations of the report. I \n     intend to introduce that draft in order to focus the \n     testimony at the hearing. In addition to the measures that \n     have been discussed, I also want the hearing to consider \n     whether changes should be made in the application of Headnote \n     3(A) and what needs to be done to strengthen enforcement of \n     federal and local laws.\n       Given the delay in transmittal of the Administration's \n     report, I do not expect that we will be able to schedule a \n     hearing prior to September. I want to be certain that you \n     have had sufficient time to review the Administration's \n     report and any legislation, but I also want to conduct the \n     hearing so that there is sufficient time to consider whatever \n     legislative measures appear warranted during this session of \n     the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Frank H. Murkoswki,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n         U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of the Secretary,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank H. Murkowski,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: This is in response to your letter of \n     July 16, 1997, requesting a drafting service that would \n     implement the Administration's recommendations for the \n     Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) contained \n     in the Administration's July 1997 report on the Federal-CNMI \n     Initiative on Labor, Immigration, and Law Enforcement. \n     Pursuant to your request, I have enclosed a legislative \n     proposal that addresses the recommendations in the \n     Administration's report. The Administration strongly supports \n     the enactment of this proposal.\n       While we are firm in our commitment to the proposals \n     outlined in the recommendations, the Administration is, \n     however, willing to consider amendments. A Federal policy \n     framework is needed to respond to the use of CNMI as a \n     platform for circumvention of United States' garment duties \n     and quotas, the CNMI's ineffective immigration control, and \n     the unhealthy and unsustainable dependence on temporary low-\n     paid foreign workers in the islands.\n       President Clinton, in his May 30, 1997 letter to CNMI \n     Governor Froilan Tenorio, stated that his Administration \n     would consult with the Governor and other representatives of \n     the Commonwealth regarding the application of laws to the \n     CNMI. Following through on the President's commitment, the \n     Departments of Labor, Justice (INS), State, Commerce, and \n     Interior sent senior representatives to the CNMI in August to \n     discuss legislative implementation of the recommendations \n     contained in the report. While the Governor did not meet with \n     this Federal delegation, it was able to convey to many local \n     government and business leaders the long-standing concerns of \n     the Federal government regarding the CNMI's garment and \n     foreign labor policies, discuss details of the \n     Administration's recommendations for addressing these \n     problems, and hear local concerns regarding the \n     recommendations. The information gained on the trip was \n     carefully considered. In closing, let me note that the \n     Administration looks forward to working with you and the CNMI \n     to enact legislation that will reconcile Federal \n     responsibilities with the CNMI's needs.\n       The Office of Management and Budget advises that there is \n     no objection to the presentation of this proposal to \n     Congress, and that its enactment would be in accord with the \n     Administration's program.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Allen P. Stayman,\n\n                                                         Director,\n                                        Office of Insular Affairs.\n\n  Mr AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Murkowski in \nintroducing the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Covenant \nImplementation Act, legislation to curb trade, immigration, wage, and \napparel labeling abuses in the CNMI.\n  On July 31, 1997, I introduced S. 1100, the CNMI Reform Act, S. 1100 \nextends the Immigration and Nationality Act to the Commonwealth, limits \nuse of the ``Made in USA'' label, and applies the U.S. minimum wage to \nthe CNMI. The measure we are introducing today is similar to S. 1100, \nbut also imposes duties on CNMI garments unless garment companies \nemploy a sufficient number of U.S. employees and establishes a \ncomprehensive regime for CNMI immigration and naturalization.\n  This is a bipartisan bill, drafted by the Clinton administration at \nthe request of the Republican chairman of the Senate Energy Committee. \nIt contains more comprehensive reforms than the measure I introduced \nearlier this year. Under the Murkowski-Akaka bill, the CNMI garment \nindustry will face severe restrictions because of continued abuses.\n  After a thorough analysis, the Commerce Department recently concluded \nthat the Commonwealth is an ``outpost for Chinese apparel production.'' \nThe Commerce Department found that apparel manufacturers from the \nPeople's Republic of China have transplanted their operations to the \nCNMI, employing bonded and indentured Chinese leaders to sew Chinese \nfabric into garments labeled ``Made in USA.'' By using the Commonwealth \nas an apparel manufacturing base, Chinese manufacturers avoid tariffs \nand escape United States quotas on finished goods.\n  Despite promises of the American dream if they work in the CNMI, \nlaborers must sign contracts with the People's Republic of China that \nwaive rights guaranteed to U.S. workers, forbid participation in \nreligious and political activities while in the United States, prohibit \nworkers from marrying, and subject employees to penalties in the PRC. \nWorking conditions in the CNMI garment industry hardly justify granting \n``Made in USA'' status and preferential duties to CNMI garments.\n  A recent investigative report by King World Productions-``Inside \nEdition'' is evidence of the abuses which garment workers suffer. \n``Inside Edition'' used hidden cameras to expose the overcrowded and \nsqualid buildings workers are forced to live in. Employees described \nbeing confined to barracks ringed by barbed wire and being treated more \nlike prisoners than employees.\n\n\n                          immigration concerns\n\n  I am sure many Senators will find it hard to believe that the \nImmigration and Nationality Act does not apply to all territories in \nthe United States. As surprising as it may be, the CNMI is exempt from \nU.S. immigration law and maintains its own policy on immigration.\n  After 20 years, CNMI immigration policy is a proven failure. In 1980, \nthe Commonwealth's population was 16,780. Of these, 12 percent were \nalien residents. Today, CNMI's has a population of 59,000, more than \nhalf of whom are aliens.\n  Rather than preventing an influx of immigrants, the CNMI has \nestablished an aggressive policy of recruiting low-wage, foreign guest \nworkers to operate an ever-expanding garment and tourism industry. \nAccording to the CNMI representative in Washington, local immigration \npolicy has ``no limit. It is wide open, unrestricted.''\n  The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service reports that CNMI \nauthorities have no reliable records of aliens who have entered the \nCNMI, how long they remain, and when, if ever, they depart. Ninety-one \npercent of the private sector work force are alien guest workers, and \nthese workers have overwhelmed the CNMI to the point where the \nunemployment rate among U.S. citizens living in the Commonwealth is 14 \npercent. There is no justification for an immigration policy that \nadmits foreign workers in such overwhelming numbers that it leads to \ndouble-digit unemployment.\n  Given these circumstances, the application of U.S. immigration law to \nthe CNMI is long overdue.\n\n\n                         ``made in usa'' abuse\n\n  The evidence that garments sewn in the CNMI directly and unfairly \ncompete with U.S. apparel manufacturers is very strong. According to \nthe Commerce Department, 85 percent of CNMI apparel is classified as \nimport sensitive. This classification means that CNMI garments compete \nwith segments of the U.S. apparel industry that are experiencing \nsignificant decline due to heavy import penetration.\n  Apparel manufacturers in the CNMI enjoy benefits that far exceed \nthose enjoyed by foreign or domestic manufacturers. CNMI garment \nfactories are not subject to the U.S. minimum wage and pay no duty on \nfabrics they import. Furthermore, quotas do not apply to either fabric \nimported into the Commonwealth, or to finished garments cut and sewn in \nthe CNMI using foreign labor. Yet these products are labeled ``Made in \nthe USA'' and compete unfairly with apparel employment elsewhere in the \nUnited States.\n\n\n                              labor abuse\n\n  The 1976 covenant exempts the CNMI from the Federal minimum wage. \nThis exemption was granted with the understanding that as its economy \ngrew and prospered, the CNMI would raise its minimum wage to the \nFederal level. Foreign workers typically enter the CNMI under 1-year \nwork permits and are paid a minimum wage of $3.05.\n  According to the July 1997 report by the Department of the Interior, \nthe lower minimum wage, combined with unlimited access to foreign \nlabor, creates an incentive for employers to hire foreign labor for all \njobs, including skilled and entry level jobs at or near the minimum \nwage. Employment statistics clearly supports the Interior Department's \nanalysis.\n  The minimum wage is sometimes a lightning-rod for Republicans. \nHowever, in a labor market where there is an unlimited supply of guest \nworkers, the low CNMI minimum wage means that low-wage alien laborers \nare displacing U.S. workers. Any policy that favors foreign workers \nover the interests of employed and unemployed U.S. citizens is \nindefensible.\n\n\n                     human rights and sexual abuse\n\n  The Commonwealth's immigration policy results in serious problems in \nother areas. The Justice Department\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\nhas documented numerous cases of women and girls being recruited from \nthe Philippines, China, and other Asian countries expressly for \ncriminal sexual activity. These abuses are a direct consequence the \nCommonwealth's unrestricted immigration policy.\n  Typically, these women are told they will work in the CNMI as \nwaitresses, but are forced into nude dancing and prostitution upon \ntheir arrival. The Justice Department described this situation as the \n``systematic trafficking of women and minors for prostitution,'' which \nmay also involve illegal smuggling, organized crime, immigration \ndocument fraud, and pornography. Cases of sexual servitude have also \nbeen identified.\n  The U.S. Justice Department also found cases of female guest workers \nand aliens living in the CNMI being forced into prostitution through \nintimidation or threats of physical harm. In some instances, women who \nresist are kidnapped, raped, and tortured.\n  I thank Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, for his efforts to reform these abuses in \nthe CNMI. I look toward to working with him on moving this bill through \nour committee so that it can be considered on the Senate floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 1276. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act, to facilitate the \ntransition to more competitive and efficient electric power markets, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n                the federal power act amendments of 1997\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Federal \nPower Act Amendments of 1997. This bill streamlines the Federal \nregulation of electric power and helps reduce costs for all factories, \nbusinesses, and homeowners. The changes in Federal regulation in this \nbill will also yield savings for consumers by providing new \nopportunities for competition in the wholesale market for electric \npower.\n  This bill improves the way the Federal Government regulates electric \npower to achieve three important goals. First, it will facilitate the \nongoing transition to more competitive and efficient markets. Second, \nit will assure the continued reliability of the transmission system \nthat carries the power in interstate commerce. And third, it will \nremove Federal regulatory ambiguities and barriers for those States \nthat elect to give customers a choice in selecting their energy \nprovider. Very importantly, my bill leaves for the States the issues \nthat are best dealt with at that level and provides for Federal \nauthority only over issues raising a clear national interest.\n  In the last 9 months the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has \nconducted seven workshops that helped bring forward many of the complex \nelectric power issues facing State and Federal regulators. The debate \ntoday remains centered on whether or not the Federal Government should \nrequire the utilities in every State to implement competition at the \nretail level. There are, however, other important issues that underlie \nthis central debate. These include the possible repeal of the Public \nUtilities Regulatory Policy Act, known as PURPA; changes in the Public \nUtility Holding Company Act, known to everyone here as PUHCA; and the \ntreatment of past investments in powerplants that may no longer be \neconomical, so called stranded costs, to name just a few.\n  Our electric power industry has a strong regional and local character \nwith over 3,000 individual utilities, including investor-owned, \nmunicipal, Federal, and rural cooperatives. Several comprehensive bills \nhave now been introduced in the House and Senate that promise to \nderegulate the Nation's electric power industry. Meanwhile, a number of \nindividual States are moving forward with retail competition.\n  However, in list of the vast difference in the circumstance of 3,000 \nindividual utility companies, it is going to be difficult to develop a \nconsensus on comprehensive Federal legislation. If comprehensive \nelectricity legislation does not move forward, I believe Congress must \nstill address a number of important issues that can only be dealt with \nat the Federal level. I'd like to take a moment to explain what these \nissues are and how my bill differs from proposals that require retail \ncompetition for all electric utility customers.\n  Madam President, our electric power industry is made up of three main \ncomponents: Powerplants that generate the power, high-voltage \ntransmission lines that carry the power over long distances, and the \nlocal distribution systems that bring the power into our homes and \nbusinesses. Most of the other bills would require States to deregulate \ntheir utilities and implement retail competition. Still, for all the \ntalk about deregulation, I hope everyone realizes they are talking \nabout deregulating, only the first piece: The powerplants that use \ncoal, natural gas, or other sources to generate the energy on which we \nall depend. The other two components of the industry, the transmission \nand local distribution systems, will remain regulated monopolies.\n\n  My bill takes a very different approach. It is not a restructuring \nbill. It will not overturn the established division between State and \nFederal regulation, and it does not require States to implement retail \ncompetition by a date certain. Rather, my bill forges new ground in the \ndebate by focusing on the middle piece of the electric utility \nindustry: The interstate transmission grid that is the critical link \nbetween generators and consumers. The transmission system clearly \ninvolves interstate commerce with a distinct national interest that can \nonly be addressed at the Federal level.\n  Let me explain why it is important that we streamline the Federal \nregulation of interstate transmission and how that can save consumers \nmoney. The Nation's transmission system serves, if you will, like an \ninterstate highway for electric power. We all know what can happen when \nthe highway on-ramps or off-ramps are closed or when bottlenecks or \nbreakdowns occur. The same is true of the electric transmission system. \nThe smooth flow of electric power depends on having sufficient \ntransmission capacity and on the system operating reliably and without \ndisruptions. Problems in the electricity transmission system, like \nproblems on interstate highways, can impede commerce. If some \nbusinesses are denied access, or if different highways operate under \ndifferent rules, competition will suffer.\n  Madam President, I believe an efficient and reliable electric \ntransmission system will be one of the most important factors in the \ndevelopment of robust regional and national markets for electric power. \nOver the last 100 years we have developed a complex grid of \ntransmission lines owned by private, government, and cooperative \nutilities. With the Energy Policy Act of 1992, Congress took the first \nsteps toward providing fair and open access to portions of the \ntransmission system. Today, Federal and State regulators are continuing \nto push for increased competition. These dramatic changes in regulation \nare placing new demands on the transmission system. We are asking it to \nfunction increasingly like the interstate highways. However, the system \nwe have was never planned to function in this more competitive \nenvironment.\n  Today we have a transmission system with many constraints and \nbottlenecks, with no uniform system of regulation, with some portions \nof the system closed to users, and without any assurance that all users \nof the system will follow the same rules. Clearly, we can't hope to \nrealize the full benefits of competition if buyers and sellers of power \ncan't deal equally in an open and fair market. Without fair \ncompetition, the cost of power is higher than it should be. My bill \nwill help correct this situation.\n  Currently, the regulation of power sales over the Nation's electric \npower grid is split between various State and Federal jurisdictions. \nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has authority over pricing of \ntransmission service. The States have authority to license and site new \ntransmission facilities. A growing portion of power transmission \nand sales is taking place on a regional and even a national scale. We \nare increasingly dependent on long-distance power transmission; \nsometimes from as far away as 1,000 miles. In the West, every single \nState from New Mexico to Montana and from California to Washington is \nelectrically interconnected. All of the Eastern States except parts of \nTexas are similarly interconnected. My bill seeks to\n\n[[Page S10657]]\n\nmaintain a careful balance of State and national interests that assures \nthe Nation's transmission system operates efficiently, all players are \ntreated equitably, and reliability is maintained.\n\n  Madam President, I'd like now to describe briefly some of the key \nprovisions in the bill.\n\n\n                     Federal and State Jurisdiction\n\n  One of the important goals of this bill is to resolve ambiguities in \nFederal and State jurisdiction that have arisen since 1992 with the \nimplementation of open transmission access. First, this bill removes \nonce and for all any ambiguity over whether States, indeed, have the \nauthority to implement retail competition. In addition, we used to have \na clear line between Federal and State jurisdiction. However, now that \nsome States are electing to implement retail competition, the bright \nline is increasingly blurred. If we don't clarify these ambiguities we \ncould well find ourselves swamped with litigation that frustrates State \nand Federal efforts to expand competition.\n\n\n                          Transmission Access\n\n  Another provision in the bill requires all transmission systems to be \noperated under the same regulatory policies. Under current law, FERC's \njurisdiction is primarily limited to transmission systems owned by \ninvestor-owned utilities. Only these utilities are required to provide \nopen access to anyone who requests it. The goal is to bring all \ntransmission systems, including those owned by Federal entities, \nmunicipalities, and rural electric co-ops, under the same system of \nregulation. My bill also extends fair and open access to transmission \nlines that cross the borders with Mexico and Canada. A uniform \nregulatory environment will promote the use of the transmission grid \nfor fair and equitable competition.\n\n\n                     Rural and Low-Income Consumers\n\n  Will all customers be able to benefit from competition? I have heard \nthis concern expressed often. My bill makes sure the States that choose \nto implement retail competition do not forget about low-income and \nretired citizens on fixed incomes, or about rural consumers who might \notherwise be left out because they are not as profitable to serve as \nurban consumers.\n\n\n                              Reciprocity\n\n  A provision of this bill deals with the situation where one State \nelects competition and a neighboring State does not. Utilities in the \nState without competition could cross the State line and steal \ncustomers without fear of losing their own customers. My bill would \nprevent this practice by allowing a State to protect its own utilities \nfrom unfair competition. It also encourages utilities to open up their \nsystems voluntarily so they can participate in the growing competition.\n\n\n                              Reliability\n\n  Finally, to assure fair and open competition on the Nation's \ninterstate transmission system, the bill gives the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission authority in several new areas. First, to enhance \nsystem reliability, we provide the commission with regulatory authority \nto back up the existing voluntary system with rules and regulations \nthat have the weight of Federal enforcement. The existing system under \nthe National Electric Reliability Council has worked effectively. \nHowever, competition is bringing many new players to the interstate \ntransmission grid, and effective enforcement of rules and standards \nrequires there by some teeth in the system.\n\n\n                          transmission siting\n\n  The bill provides a Federal role, in partnership with States, to \nassure that transmission lines that cross State boundaries are upgraded \nand expanded when needed. Any siting decision would be subject to all \napplicable State and Federal legislation, including the Environmental \nProtection Act. The interstate transmission system is one of the keys \nto maintaining system reliability and additional capacity will \nstimulate competition by allowing new players into the market.\n\n\n                      independent system operators\n\n  My bill also provides new authority to the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to assure the transmission system is managed and operated in \nan open and fair way that does not discriminate against any users. With \nthis new authority, the commission may require the formation of \nindependent operators for regional transmission systems. Having an \nindependent system operator provides greater efficiency in transmission \npricing, makes sure there is fair and open access for all users, and \nthat the owners of the transmission system do not use it to their own \nadvantage. In some cases, these independent systems are already \ndeveloping voluntary or under state mandates.\n  Madam President, I'd like to say a few words about an issue known as \n``stranded costs.'' Stranded costs are investments in powerplants made \nunder past regulatory practices that may no longer be economic in the \nnew competitive environment. Stranded costs are of critical concern to \nutility investors and to rural electric cooperatives. As I hope I have \nmade clear, my bill focuses on the regulation and use of the interstate \ntransmission system, a national issue that does not compel retail \ncompetition or the resulting stranded costs. I believe the States are \nthe proper forum to deal with retail competition and to resolve thorny \nissues like stranded costs that are not national in nature. We in \nCongress are monitoring how the States are handling stranded costs from \nretail competition. If in the future it appears that States are not \nequitably addressing stranded costs, then I believe Congress should \ntake a very serious look at the subject.\n  In putting forward the proposals in this bill I have listened to a \nnumber of suggestions and evaluated a variety of concepts. Not all of \nthe ideas could be incorporated into the framework of a single bill, \neven though many of the approaches clearly have merit. As the debate on \nelectricity regulation moves forward, I expect to refine and expand on \nthe proposals I am putting forward today.\n  In summary, Madam President, this bill will reduce costs for \nconsumers by encouraging the development of robust competition in the \ninterstate market for electric power. We do this by streamlining \nFederal regulation of the interstate transmission system and by \nassuring that all transmissions owners and users play by the same \nrules. In addition, the bill will remove Federal regulatory barriers \nfor those states that allow consumers to choose their source of \nelectric power. I hope all Senators will consider the important \nproposals in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1276\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1.

This section also extends FERC's jurisdiction \n     over the remaining 22% of interstate transmission systems not \n     currently covered.\n       (a)(1) Clarifies that transmission of electric energy in \n     interstate commerce, which is under FERC jurisdiction, \n     includes the unbundled transmission of electric energy sold \n     at retail. FERC has proceeded under the assumption it has \n     authority to order transmission necessary to implement state-\n     ordered retail competition, and utilities have filed \n     transmission tariffs required to implement retail \n     competition. Paragraph (2) reinforces existing state \n     jurisdiction over the bundled retail sale of electric energy \n     and the unbundled local distribution of electric energy.\n       (b) In Order No. 888, FERC took the position that the \n     transmission component of unbundled sales is subject to FERC \n     jurisdiction. Paragraph (1) establishes FERC's authority \n     under Part II of the Federal Power Act over the transmission \n     in interstate commerce of electric power as part of an \n     unbundled sale of energy sold at retail. Paragraph (2) \n     authorizes FERC, in consultation with state regulators, to \n     draw the line between interstate transmission, which is \n     subject to FERC authority, and local distribution, which is \n     subject to state jurisdiction. FERC's jurisdiction over \n     unbundled transmission necessitates a process for determining \n     where FERC jurisdiction ends and state jurisdiction over \n     unbundled distribution begins.\n       (c) Extends FERC's jurisdiction over transmission of \n     electric energy in interstate commerce if the energy will be \n     consumed in a foreign country. The ambiguity in existing law \n     was raised in FERC's October 4, 1996, order on complaint in \n     Docket No. EL96-74-000.\n       (d) Adds definitions to Part II for ``bundled retail sale \n     of electric energy,'' ``unbundled local distribution \n     service,'' and ``unbundled transmission of electric energy \n     sold at retail.''\n       (e) Redefines ``public utility'' so as to extend FERC's \n     authority to regulate transmission services (and only \n     transmission) of non-jurisdictional utilities, including TVA, \n     Power Marketing agencies, municipal utilities, and rural \n     electric cooperatives. Currently, FERC's FPA jurisdiction is \n     limited primarily to investor-owned utilities. Non-\n     jurisdictional utilities control a significant portion of the \n     nation's existing transmission capacity. The full benefits of \n     wholesale competition may not be realized unless all \n     transmitting utilities are subject to the same regulatory \n     policies.\n       (f) Continues exemption of TVA, PMAs, municipal utilities \n     and rural electric cooperatives from FERC jurisdiction under \n     Part II, except with respect to regulation of transmission. \n     This section leaves intact the exemption from FERC \n     jurisdiction for any wholesale sales of power made by non-\n     jurisdictional utilities.\n       (g) Redefines ``transmitting utility'' to cover all \n     transmission systems, including any electric utility, \n     qualifying cogeneration facility, qualifying small power \n     production facility, federal power marketing agency, public \n     utility (as redefined by subsection (e)) that owns or \n     operates transmission facilities used for the sale of \n     electric energy.\n\n          Section 3. Limitations on Federal Wheeling Authority\n\n       Sections 211 and 212 of the FPA currently prohibit FERC \n     from ordering retail wheeling. This section clarifies FERC's \n     authority to order interstate transmission service for \n     wholesale sales and as part of a retail sale, but the latter \n     only if authorized by state law.\n       (a) Clarifies FERC's authority to order transmission access \n     under sections 211 and 212 for transmission in interstate \n     commerce for both wholesale sales for resale and unbundled \n     transmission of electric energy sold at retail.\n       (b) Limits FERC's authority to order unbundled transmission \n     of electric energy sold at retail under sections 211 and 212 \n     only if such sales are permitted or required under applicable \n     state law.\n       (c) Conforming amendment that broadens the definition of \n     transmission services to include both wholesale transmission \n     and unbundled transmission of electric energy sold at retail.\n\n           Section 4. State Authority To Order Retail Access\n\n       Adds a new section 215 at the end of Part II to clarify and \n     extend state authority over access to retail customers.\n       New subsection (a) recognizes state authority to require an \n     electric utility to provide unbundled local distribution \n     service to any consumer. The Energy Policy Act of 1992 \n     included in the FPA a savings clause at the end of subsection \n     212(h) that preserves whatever state authority may exist to \n     order retail wheeling; however, it does not affirm \n     conclusively that the states do in fact have such authority. \n     Because retail wheeling is in interstate commerce, it could \n     be argued states lack authority to order retail wheeling. \n     This subsection removes the statutory ambiguity.\n       New subsection (b) requires states that authorize utilities \n     to provide unbundled local distribution service to assure the \n     utilities provide distribution service on a nondiscriminatory \n     basis. This subsection will help assure that local \n     distribution companies do not use state-regulated monopolies \n     to favor, for example, their un-regulated subsidiaries.\n       New subsection (c) provides for retail reciprocity. States \n     may bar an electric utility from selling power at retail in \n     the state unless the utility is itself providing unbundled \n     local distribution service. Currently, a state may not \n     condition access to its retail markets without facing a \n     challenge as an unlawful burden on interstate commerce. This \n     subsection eliminates the inequity of out-of-state utilities \n     competing for retail customers in states with open access \n     without having to provide similar access to their own \n     customers. This provision may also create an incentive for \n     utilities to open their markets to retail competition.\n       New subsection (d) assures state authority to impose a \n     nondiscriminatory charge on the unbundled local distribution \n     service, retail sale, or generation for consumption of \n     electric energy. Such a charge might be used to\n\n[[Page S10660]]\n\n     fund, for example, competitive transition costs, universal \n     and affordable service under section 216, demand side-\n     management programs, etc.\n\n              Section 5. Universal and Affordable Service\n\n       Adds a new section 216 at the end of Part II that puts \n     Congress on record that every consumer should have access to \n     electric power at reasonable and affordable rates and that \n     FERC and the states should assure that competition does not \n     result in the loss of service to rural, residential, or low-\n     income customers. Requires states that adopt retail \n     competition to consider adopting measures to assure universal \n     and affordable service and to report to FERC on the measures \n     adopted. Funds to cover the cost of such measures may be \n     assessed under new section 215(d).\n\n           Section 6. National Electric Reliability Standards\n\n       Adds a new section 217 at the end of Part II to establish \n     national electric reliability standards under FERC \n     jurisdiction. Competition is bringing many new players to the \n     interstate transmission grid. Such competition will place new \n     and conflicting requirements on NERC's existing voluntary \n     system, which lacks enforcement powers. There is a clear and \n     legitimate federal role in ensuring system reliability. This \n     section is consistent with the draft recommendations of the \n     Secretary of Energy Advisory Board Task Force on Electric-\n     System Reliability.\n       New subsection (a) authorizes FERC to establish and enforce \n     national electric reliability standards to ensure the \n     reliability of the electric transmission system.\n       New subsection (b) authorizes FERC to designate an \n     appropriate number of regional reliability councils composed \n     of electric utilities and transmitting utilities, and one \n     national electric reliability council composed of the \n     regional councils. The mission of the councils is to promote \n     the reliability of the electric transmission system. FERC \n     shall not designate a regional council unless the commission \n     determines the council permits open access to membership from \n     all electric utilities (IOUs, NUGs, power marketers, \n     municipal utilities or TVA) and transmitting utilities in the \n     region, provides fair representation in the selection of its \n     directors and management, and adopts and enforces appropriate \n     standards of operation.\n       New subsection (c) authorizes FERC to incorporate standards \n     of operation adopted by the councils into the standards \n     adopted under subsection (a).\n       New subsection (d) authorizes FERC, by rule or order, to \n     require any public utility (electric utility plus the PMAs) \n     or any transmitting utility to comply with the standards.\n\n        Section 7. Siting New Interstate Transmission Facilities\n\n       Adds a new section 218 at the end of Part II to authorize \n     FERC to work with the states on siting new interstate \n     transmission facilities. An integrated and well planned \n     national transmission grid is a critical element in the \n     development of open and fair competition, maintaining system \n     reliability, reducing market power, and mitigating stranded \n     costs. This section does not preempt the states' exclusive \n     authority over siting of transmission lines.\n       New subsection (a) gives FERC authority, after notice and \n     opportunity for hearing, to order a transmitting utility \n     to extend, enlarge or improve its facilities for the \n     interstate transmission of electric energy.\n       New subsection (b) defines when FERC may commence a \n     proceeding under subsection (a).\n       New subsection (c) requires FERC to comply with the \n     National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and all other \n     applicable state and federal laws.\n       New subsection (d) requires FERC to refer the matter to a \n     joint board appointed under subsection (a) of section 209 for \n     advice on the need for, design of, and location of the \n     proposed extension or improvement. The Commission shall \n     consider the advice and recommendations of the board before \n     ordering such extension or improvement.\n       New subsection (e) limits FERC's authority to compel a \n     transmitting utility to extend or improve its interstate \n     transmission facilities if it would impair the utility's \n     ability to serve its existing customers.\n\n            Section 8. Regional Independent System Operators\n\n       Adds a new section 219 at the end of Part II to allow for \n     the establishment of regional independent system operators. \n     Formation of ISOs could be a valuable tool in limiting market \n     power and maintaining reliability. FERC in order 888 strongly \n     encouraged the formation of ISOs, but did not address the \n     issue of its authority to compel participation. This section \n     authorizes FERC to require participation in an ISO to assure \n     non-discriminatory access to the transmission grid for all \n     parties. ISOs could also play a role in siting of new \n     transmission lines under Section 7.\n       New subsection (a) authorizes the commission to order the \n     formation of a regional independent transmission system and \n     to compel utilities in the region to participate. The FERC \n     may order the formation of an ISO if such action is necessary \n     or desirable in the public interest to ensure the fair and \n     non-discriminatory access to transmission services.\n       New subsection (b) authorizes FERC to appoint a regional \n     oversight board to oversee the operation of the regional \n     transmission system. The board shall have fair representation \n     of all utilities, consumers, and state regulators in the \n     region.\n       New subsection (c) authorizes the oversight board to \n     appoint an independent system operator to operate the \n     regional transmission system. The operator may not own \n     generating facilities, sell electric energy, or be subject to \n     the control, or have a financial interest in, any utility in \n     the region served by the independent system operator.\n       New subsection (d) authorizes FERC to establish rules \n     necessary to implement this section.\n\n                         Section 9. Enforcement\n\n       (a) Extends the exemption from general penalties (section \n     316) to sections 217, 218, and 219.\n       (b) Extends the enforcement provisions for violations and \n     civil penalties in section 316A to sections 217, 218, and \n     219.\n\n                     Section 10. Amendment to PURPA\n\n       Adds new subsection (m) at the end of section 210 of PURPA \n     to protect wholesale contracts entered into in accordance \n     with federal legislation. States may not bar a regulated \n     utility from recovering the cost of any PURPA contracts. Such \n     costs may be recovered, for example, through rates, charges \n     assessed under section 215(d), exit fees, etc.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This chapter may be cited as the ``Transportation \n     Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 1312. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) a well-developed system of transportation \n     infrastructure is critical to the economic well-being, \n     health, and welfare of the people of the United States;\n       (2) traditional public funding techniques such as grant \n     programs are unable to keep pace with the infrastructure \n     investment needs of the United States because of budgetary \n     constraints at the Federal, State, and local levels of \n     government;\n       (3) major transportation infrastructure facilities that \n     address critical national needs, such as intermodal \n     facilities, border crossings, and multistate trade corridors, \n     are of a scale that exceeds the capacity of Federal and State \n     assistance programs in effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (4) new investment capital can be attracted to \n     infrastructure projects that are capable of generating their \n     own revenue streams through user charges or other dedicated \n     funding sources; and\n       (5) a Federal credit program for projects of national \n     significance can complement existing funding resources by \n     filling market gaps, thereby leveraging substantial private \n     co-investment.\n\n     SEC. 1313.

Legislative Background\n\n     Highway Trust Fund Authorizations\n       S. 1173, the ``Intermodal Transportation Act of 1997,'' was \n     ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works on September 17, 1997, and the report was filed \n     on October 1, 1997 (S. Rept. 105-95). S. 1173 would extend \n     expenditure authorizations for the Highway Trust Fund (the \n     ``Highway Fund'') for 6 years, from October 1, 1997 through \n     September 30, 2003, and make various modifications to the \n     highway programs financed through the Highway Fund. The \n     Highway Fund is funded with amounts equivalent to revenues \n     from certain excise taxes on motor fuels and on heavy trucks \n     and tires. These excise taxes currently are scheduled to \n     expire after September 30, 1999. The provisions dedicating \n     revenues from these excise taxes to the Highway Fund, \n     relevant expenditure provisions governing the purposes for \n     which Highway Fund monies may be spent, and the period when \n     those expenditures may occur are contained in the Internal \n     Revenue Code (the ``Code''). The Highway Fund expenditure \n     authority expired after September 30, 1997.\n       The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \n     (``Banking'') and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation (``Commerce'') have been requested to approve \n     Highway Fund-related authorization provisions within their \n     respective jurisdictions. The Senate Banking Committee marked \n     up mass transit authorizations on September 25, 1997. \n     Provisions adopted by these Committees are expected to be \n     incorporated into S. 1173 when that bill is considered by the \n     Senate.\n     Revenue Provisions\n       The Committee on Finance has been requested to provide a \n     revenue title to S. 1173. The Committee on Finance was \n     requested to include provisions in the revenue title \n     extending the period when the highway excise taxes are \n     imposed and when Highway Fund monies can be spent, and \n     conforming the purposes for which Highway Fund monies can be \n     spent to those authorized under S. 1173.\n       On October 1, 1997, the Committee on Finance marked up a \n     revenue title to be offered as an amendment (``Committee \n     amendment'') to S. 1173. The Committee amendment was approved \n     by voice vote.\n\n                 II. Explanation of Committee Amendment\n\n\n                             A. Present Law\n\n     1. Highway Trust Fund Excise Taxes and Other Related Tax \n         Provisions\n     Highway transportation excise taxes\n       The current highway transportation excise taxes consist of:\n       (1) taxes on gasoline, diesel fuel, kerosene, and special \n     motor fuels;\n       (2) a retail sales tax imposed on trucks and trailers \n     having gross vehicle weights in excess of prescribed \n     thresholds;\n       (3) a tax on manufacturers of tires designed for use on \n     heavy highway vehicles; and\n       (4) an annual use tax imposed on trucks and tractors having \n     taxable gross weights in excess of prescribed thresholds.\n       Special motor fuels include liquefied natural gas \n     (``LNG''), benzol, naphtha, liquefied petroleum gas (e.g., \n     propane), natural gasoline, and any other liquid (e.g., \n     ethanol and methanol) other than gasoline or diesel fuel. \n     Compressed natural gas (``CNG'') also is subject to tax as a \n     special motor fuel, but at a lower rate than other special \n     motor fuels.\n       With the exception of 4.3 cents per gallon of the motor \n     fuels excise tax rates, these taxes are scheduled to expire \n     after September 30, 1999.\n       Highway motor fuels taxes\n       The current highway motor fuels excise tax rates are shown \n     in Table 1.\n\nTABLE 1.--FEDERAL HIGHWAY TRUST FUND MOTOR FUELS EXCISE TAX RATES, AS OF\n                             OCTOBER 1, 1997                            \n                    [Rates shown in cents per gallon]                   \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Tax  \n                          Highway Fuel                             Rate \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\\2\\--\nGasoline \\3\\...................................................     18.3\nDiesel fuel \\4\\................................................     24.3\nSpecial motor fuels generally..................................  \\5\\ 18.\n                                                                       3\nCNG............................................................  \\6\\ 4.3\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The rates shown include the 4.3-cents-per-gallon tax rate which is  \n  transferred to the Highway Fund beginning on October 1, 1997, pursuant\n  to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.                                   \n\\2\\ Effective on October 1, 1997, an additional 0.1-cent-per-gallon rate\n  is imposed on these motor fuels to finance the Leaking Underground    \n  Storage Tank Trust Fund.                                              \n\\3\\ Gasoline used in motorboats and in certain off-highway recreational \n  vehicles and small engines is subject to tax in the same manner and at\n  the same rates as gasoline used in highway vehicles. 6.8 cents per    \n  gallon of the revenues from the tax on gasoline used in these uses is \n  retained in the General Fund; the remaining 11.5 cents per gallon is  \n  deposited in the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund (motorboat and small    \n  engine gasoline), the Land and Water Conservation Fund ($1 million of \n  motorboat gasoline tax revenues), and the National Recreational Trails\n  Trust Fund (the ``Trails Trust Fund'') (off-highway recreational      \n  vehicles).                                                            \n\\4\\ Kerosene is taxed at the same rate as diesel fuel.                  \n\\5\\ The rate is 13.6 cents per gallon for propane, 11.9 cents per gallon\n  for liquefied natural gas, and 11.3 cents per gallon for methanol fuel\n  from natural gas, in each case based on the relative energy           \n  equivalence of the fuel to gasoline.                                  \n\\6\\ The statutory rate is 48.54 cents per thousand cubic feet (``MCF'').\n\n       Present law includes numerous exemptions (including partial \n     exemptions for specified uses of taxable fuels or for \n     specified fuels) typically for governments or for uses not \n     involving use of (and thereby change to) the highway system. \n     Because the gasoline and diesel fuel taxes generally are \n     imposed before the end use of the fuel is known, many of \n     these exemptions are realized through refunds to end users of \n     tax paid by a party that processed the fuel earlier in the \n     distribution chain. These exempt uses and fuels include:\n       (1) use in State and local government and nonprofit \n     educational organization vehicles;\n       (2) use in buses engaged in transporting students and \n     employees of schools;\n       (3) use in private local mass transit buses having a \n     seating capacity of at least 20 adults (not including the \n     driver) when the buses operate under contract with (or are \n     subsidized by) a State or local governmental unit;\n       (4) use in private intercity buses serving the general \n     public along scheduled routes (totally exempt from the \n     gasoline tax and exempt from 17 cents per gallon of the \n     diesel tax); and\n       (5) use in off-highway uses such as farming.\n       LNG, propane, CNG, and methanol derived from natural gas \n     are subject to reduced tax rates based on the energy \n     equivalence of these fuels to gasoline.\n       Ethanol and methanol derived from renewable sources (e.g., \n     biomass) are eligible for income tax benefits (the ``alcohol \n     fuels credit'') equal to 54 cents per gallon (ethanol) and 60 \n     cents per gallon (methanol). 1 In addition, small \n     ethanol producers are eligible for a separate 10-cents-per-\n     gallon credit. 2 The 54-cents-per-gallon ethanol \n     and 60-cents-per-gallon renewable source methanol tax credits \n     may be claimed through reduced excise taxes paid on gasoline \n     and special motor fuels as well as through credits against \n     income tax. 3\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ The alcohol fuels credit is scheduled to expire after \n     December 31, 2000, or earlier, if the Highway Fund excise \n     taxes actually expire before that date.\n     \\2\\ The small ethanol producer credit is available on up to \n     15 million gallons of ethanol produced by persons whose \n     annual production capacity does not exceed 30 million \n     gallons.\n     \\3\\ Authority to claim the ethanol and renewable source \n     methanol tax benefits through excise tax reductions is \n     scheduled to expire after September 30, 2000 (or earlier, if \n     the underlying excise taxes actually expire before September \n     30, 2000).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                   Non-fuel Highway Fund excise taxes\n\n       In addition to the highway motor fuels excise tax revenues, \n     the Highway Fund receives revenues produced by three excise \n     taxes imposed exclusively on heavy highway vehicles or tires. \n     These taxes are:\n       (1) A 12-percent excise tax imposed on the first retail \n     sale of highway vehicles, tractors, and trailers (generally, \n     trucks having a gross vehicle weight in excess of 33,000 \n     pounds and trailers having such a weight in excess of 26,000 \n     pounds);\n       (2) An excise tax imposed at graduated rates on highway \n     tires weighing more than 40 pounds; and\n       (3) An annual use tax imposed on highway vehicles having a \n     taxable gross weight of 55,000 pounds or more. (The maximum \n     rate for this tax is $550 per year, imposed on vehicles \n     having a taxable gross weight over 75,000 pounds.)\n     Excise tax on diesel fuel used in rail transportation\n       Diesel fuel used in trains is subject to a 5.65-cents-per-\n     gallon excise tax. Of this amount, 0.1 cent per gallon is \n     dedicated to the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund; \n     this rate is scheduled to expire after March 31, 2005. The \n     remaining 5.55 cents per gallon is a General Fund tax, with \n     4.3 cents per gallon being permanently imposed and 1.25 cents \n     per gallon being imposed through September 30, 1999.\n     Tax-exempt State or local government-bonds\n       Present law exempts interest on State or local government \n     bonds from the regular income tax if the proceeds of the \n     bonds are used to finance governmental activities of those \n     entities and the bonds are repaid with governmental revenues. \n     Interest on bonds issued by States or local governments \n     acting as conduits to provide financing for private persons \n     is taxable unless a specific exception is provided in the \n     Code. No such exception is provided for bonds issued to \n     provide conduit financing for privately constructed and/or \n     privately operated toll roads and similar highway \n     infrastructure projects.\n\n[[Page S10708]]\n\n     Exclusion from income for employer-provided transportation \n         benefits\n       Under present law, up to $170 per month of employer-\n     provided parking is excludable from gross income and wages \n     for employment tax purposes. Effective with respect to \n     taxable years beginning after December 31, 1997, no amount is \n     includible in income or wages merely because an employer \n     offers an employee a choice between cash and employer-\n     provided parking. The amount of cash offered is includible in \n     income only if the employee chooses the cash instead of \n     parking. If an employee chooses parking, the value of the \n     parking is excludable from income as under present law. \n     Employees may exclude a maximum of $65 per month from gross \n     income for the value of employer-provided transit passes or \n     vanpooling in an employer-provided vehicle. In order for the \n     exclusion to apply, the employer-provided transit passes and \n     vanpooling must be provided in addition to and not in lieu of \n     any compensation that is otherwise payable to the employee.\n     2. Highway Trust Fund Expenditure Provisions\n     In general\n       Dedication of excise tax revenues to the Highway Fund and \n     expenditures from the Highway Fund are governed by provisions \n     of the Code (sec. 9503). 4 Under present law, \n     revenues from the highway excise taxes, as imposed through \n     September 30, 1999, are dedicated to the Highway Fund. Also, \n     the Highway Fund earns interest on its cash balances each \n     year from investments in Treasury securities. Further, the \n     Code authorizes expenditures (subject to appropriations) from \n     the Fund through September 30, 1997, for the purposes \n     provided in authorizing legislation, as in effect on the date \n     of enactment of the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\4\\  The Highway Trust Fund statutory provisions were placed \n     in the Internal Revenue Code in 1982.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Highway Fund provisions also govern transfer of 11.5 cents \n     per gallon of the revenues from the tax imposed on gasoline \n     used in motorboats, small engines, and off-highway \n     recreational vehicles. Those revenues are transferred from \n     the Highway Fund (after being received from the General Fund) \n     to the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund, and the National Recreational Trails Trust \n     Fund, respectively, through September 30, 1997.\n     Present-law Highway Fund expenditure purposes\n       Overview\n       The Highway Fund is divided into two accounts, a Highway \n     Account and a Mass Transit Account, each of which is the \n     funding source for specific programs.\n       Highway and Mass Transit Account expenditure purposes have \n     been revised with passage of each authorization Act enacted \n     since establishment of the Highway Trust Fund in 1956. In \n     general, expenditures authorized under those Acts (as the \n     Acts were in effect on the date of enactment of the most \n     recent such authorizing Act) are approved Highway Fund \n     expenditure purposes. 5 Authority to make \n     expenditures from the Highway Fund expired after September \n     30, 1997. Thus, no Highway Fund monies may be spent for a \n     purpose not approved by the tax-writing committees of \n     Congress. Further, no Highway Fund expenditures may occur \n     after September 30, 1997, without such approval.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\5\\  The authorizing Acts which currently are referenced in \n     the Highway Trust Fund are the Highway Revenue Act of 1956, \n     Titles I and II of the Surface Transportation Assistance Act \n     of 1982, the Surface Transportation and Uniform Relocation \n     Act of 1987, and the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Highway Fund spending further is limited by two, internal \n     to the Highway Fund, anti- deficit provisions. The first of \n     these provisions limits the unfunded Highway Account \n     authorizations at the end of any fiscal year to amounts not \n     exceeding revenues projected to be collected for that Account \n     by the dedicated excise taxes during the two following fiscal \n     years. The second anti-deficit provision similarly limits \n     unfunded Mass Transit Account authorizations to the dedicated \n     excise taxes expected to be collected during the next fiscal \n     year. Because of these two provisions, the highway \n     transportation excise taxes typically are scheduled to expire \n     at least two years after current authorizing Acts. If either \n     of these provisions is violated, spending for specified \n     programs funded by the relevant Trust Fund Account is to be \n     reduced proportionately, in much the same manner as would \n     occur under a general Budget Act sequester.\n       Highway Account\n       The Highway Fund's Highway Account receives revenues from \n     all non-fuel highway transportation excise taxes and revenues \n     from all but 2.85 cents per gallon (2.0 cents prior to \n     October 1, 1997) of the highway motor fuels excise taxes. \n     Programs financed from the Highway Account include \n     expenditures for the following general purposes:\n       (1) Federal-aid highways, including the Interstate System, \n     National Highway System, parkways and park roads, forest and \n     public lands highways, Indian reservation roads, scenic \n     highways, and certain overseas highways (includes \n     construction and planning);\n       (2) Highway resurfacing and repair;\n       (3) Bridge replacement and repair;\n       (4) Surface transportation programs;\n       (5) Congestion mitigation and air quality improvement;\n       (6) Highway safety programs and research and development, \n     including a share of the cost of National Highway Traffic \n     Safety Administration (``NHTSA'') programs and university \n     research centers;\n       (7) Transportation research, technology, and training;\n       (8) Traffic control grants and traffic control signal \n     projects;\n       (9) Intermodal urban projects and mass transit (including \n     carpool and vanpool) grants;\n       (10) Magnetic levitation technology deployment;\n       (11) Intelligent transportation systems;\n       (12) Certain administrative costs of the Federal Highway \n     Administration and NHTSA;\n       (13) Grants to the Internal Revenue Service for motor fuels \n     tax and highway use tax enforcement activities;\n       (14) Wetlands and other habitat mitigation; and\n       (15) Certain other highway and transit-related programs \n     (including bicycle pathways and pedestrian walkways and \n     fringe and corridor parking facilities).\n       Mass Transit Account\n       The Highway Fund's Mass Transit Account receives revenues \n     equivalent to 2.85 cents per gallon (2.0 cents prior to \n     October 1, 1997) of the highway motor fuels excise taxes. \n     Mass Transit Account monies are available through September \n     30, 1997, for capital and capital-related expenditures under \n     sections 5338 (a)(1) and (b)(1) of Title 49, United States \n     Code, or the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act \n     of 1991.\n       The capital and capital-related mass transit programs \n     include new rail or busway facilities, rail rolling stock, \n     buses, improvement and maintenance of existing rail and other \n     fixed guideway systems, and upgrading of bus systems.\n     Transfers from Highway Fund to National Recreational Trails \n         Trust Fund\n       The National Recreational Trails Trust Fund (``Trails \n     Fund'') was established in the Intermodal Surface \n     Transportation Act of 1991 (``1991 Act''). Amounts are \n     authorized to be transferred from the Highway Fund into the \n     Trails Fund equivalent to revenues received from ``nonhighway \n     recreational fuel taxes'' (not to exceed $30 million per year \n     under an obligational ceiling set in the 1991 Act), subject \n     to amounts actually being appropriated to the Trails Fund. No \n     monies have been transferred to date, since no amounts have \n     been appropriated to the Trails Fund. The authority to \n     transfer revenues to the Trails Fund expired after September \n     30, 1997.\n       Nonhighway recreational fuels taxes are the taxes imposed \n     (to the extent attributable to the 11.5 cents per gallon \n     rate) on (1) fuel used in vehicles and equipment on \n     recreational trails or back country terrain, or (2) fuel used \n     in camp stoves and other outdoor recreational equipment. Such \n     revenues do not include small-engine gasoline tax revenues \n     which are transferred to the Aquatic Resources Trust Fund.\n       Expenditures are authorized from the Trails Fund, subject \n     to appropriations, for allocations to States for use on \n     trails and trail-related projects as set forth in the 1991 \n     Act. Authorized uses include (1) acquisition of new trails \n     and access areas, (2) maintenance and restoration of existing \n     trails, (3) State environmental protection education \n     programs, and (4) program administrative costs.\n\n\n            B. Summary of S. 1173 Trust Fund Authorizations\n\n       S. 1173 would extend authorizations for Highway Fund \n     expenditures for six years, fiscal years 1998-2003. S. 1173 \n     also would modify the expenditure purposes of the Highway \n     Fund as described below. As reported by the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works (``Environment and Public \n     Works''), S. 1173 contains no revenue provisions or other \n     Code amendments.\\6\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\6\\ See below for mention of authorization of amounts from \n     the Highway Account for grants to the Internal Revenue \n     Service for motor fuel tax evasion projects and motor fuel \n     tax reporting system.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     Highway Account Authorizations Under S. 1173\n       S. 1173, as reported by Environment and Public Works, would \n     provide Highway Trust Fund (Highway Account) authorizations \n     totaling $145.3 billion for the 6-year period, fiscal years \n     1998-2003.\n       New Highway Account expenditure programs under S. 1173 \n     include the following:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\7\\ A ``trail'' is a thoroughfare or track across land or \n     snow used for recreational purposes, such as pedestrian \n     activities, skating or skateboarding, equestrian activities, \n     skiing, bicycling, aquatic activities, and motorized \n     vehicular activities (including all-terrain vehicles, \n     motorcycles, snowmobiles, off-road vehicles). Eligible \n     expenses include costs of State administration of the program \n     and educational programs to promote trail safety and \n     environmental protection.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n                              6-year total\n\n\n                                                             (millions)\nRecreational trails program \\7\\..................................$119.0\nMotor fuel excise tax reporting system.............................20.0\nInternational border crossing planning incentive grants.............8.4\nInternational trade corridor planning incentive grants.............18.0\nInfrastructure financing (loans, loan guarantees, credit lines, \n  including State infrastructure banks)...........................470.0\nSafety grants for seat belt use...................................470.0\n\n[[Page S10709]]\n\nWetland restoration pilot program (where mitigation has not been \n  performed)......................................................100.0\nTransportation and community and system preservation pilot program \n  (research and planning regarding relationships between transportation \n  and community and environment preservation).....................120.0\n\n       The bill would extend for 6 years (at $5 million per year) \n     the current authorization from the Highway Account for funds \n     to the Internal Revenue Service and the States for highway \n     use tax evasion projects.\n       Other Highway Account safety program authorizations are to \n     be marked up by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation, and are expected to be offered as an \n     amendment to S. 1173 when the bill goes to the Senate Floor.\n     Mass Transit Account Authorizations Under S. 1173\n       The Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs \n     (``Banking'') marked up mass transit authorizations on \n     September 25, 1997. These provisions are expected to be added \n     to S. 1173, and include $31.6 billion authorized from the \n     Mass Transit Account of the Highway Fund and $4.1 billion \n     from the General Fund over the 6-year period, fiscal years \n     1998-2003.\n       The Banking Committee amendment would authorize a new clean \n     fuels grant program to be financed one-half from the Mass \n     Transit Account ($100 million per year) and one-half from the \n     General Fund ($100 million per year). The clean fuels program \n     includes grants to purchase or lease clean fuel vehicles or \n     hybrid transit vehicles, construction or leasing of clean \n     fuel vehicle fueling or electrical recharging facilities and \n     equipment, improvements of existing transit facilities to \n     accommodate clean fuel vehicles, incremental costs of \n     biodiesel fuel, and projects relating to clean fuel, \n     biodiesel, hybrid electric or zero emissions technology \n     vehicles that exhibit equivalent or superior emissions \n     reductions to existing clean fuel or hybrid electric \n     technologies.\n\n\n                      C. Explanation of Provisions\n\n     1. Highway Fund provisions\n       a. Extension of existing Highway Fund excise taxes\n       Under the Committee amendment, the scheduled expiration \n     date of the current Highway Fund excise taxes on motor fuels \n     and heavy highway vehicles and tires is extended for six \n     years, from September 30, 1999 through September 30, 2005.\n       b. Extension and modification of ethanol tax provisions\n       The current tax benefits for ethanol and renewable source \n     methanol are extended for seven years from their currently \n     scheduled expiration dates; the ethanol benefits are modified \n     to reduce the benefit levels during the extension period. The \n     modified ethanol benefit levels are as follows: 2001 and \n     2002--53 cents per gallon; 2003 and 2004--52 cents per \n     gallon; and, 2005 through 2007--51 cents per gallon. The \n     extension and the modifications apply to both the alcohol \n     fuels credit and the associated excise tax provisions.\n       c. Extension and modification of Highway Fund provisions \n           8\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\8\\ S. 1173 would authorize expenditures for a Congestion \n     Mitigation and Air Quality Program (``CMAQ'') pursuant to \n     which State transportation departments (or other project \n     sponsors) would be permitted to enter into agreements with \n     public and private entities to implement certain \n     environmental projects, including programs to promote the use \n     of alternative fuels by privately owned vehicles by \n     underwriting the costs of converting vehicles to alternative \n     fuels.\n     The Committee amendment provides that to the extent that \n     payments received under the program are not taxable under \n     present law when received, no credit or other deduction is \n     allowed, and a reduction in basis may be required, with \n     respect to property (or other expenditures) financed directly \n     or indirectly with the CMAQ monies. No inference is intended \n     from this provision as to the treatment of amounts received \n     under other Federal grant programs.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The current September 30, 1997 expiration date of authority \n     to spend monies from the Highway Fund is extended for six \n     years, from October 1, 1997 through September 30, 2003.\n       The Code provisions governing purposes for which monies in \n     the Highway Fund may be spent is updated to include the \n     purposes provided in S. 1173, as enacted.\n       The anti-deficit provisions of the Mass Transit Account are \n     conformed to those of the Highway Account so that permitted \n     obligations will be determined by reference to two years of \n     projected revenues.\n       Transfers of revenues on motorboat and small engine \n     gasoline from the Highway Fund to the Aquatic Resources Trust \n     Fund and the Land and Water Conservation Fund are extended \n     for six years, from September 30, 1997 through September 30, \n     2003.\n       The Code provisions establishing the National Recreational \n     Trails Trust Fund (``Trails Fund'') and providing for \n     transfer of revenues to the Trails Fund are repealed, \n     effective on the date of enactment.\n       Provisions are incorporated into the Highway Fund \n     clarifying that expenditures from the Highway Fund may occur \n     only as provided in the Code. Clarification is further \n     provided that the expiration date for expenditures allowed \n     from the Highway Fund does not preclude disbursements to \n     liquidate contracts which were validly entered into before \n     that date. Expenditures for contracts entered into or for \n     amounts otherwise obligated after that date (or for other \n     non-contract authority purposes permitted by non-Code \n     provisions) would not be permitted, notwithstanding the \n     provisions of any subsequently enacted authorization or \n     appropriations legislation. If any such subsequent non-tax \n     legislation provided for expenditures not provided for in the \n     Code, or if any executive agency authorized such expenditures \n     in contravention of the Code restrictions, excise tax \n     revenues otherwise to be deposited in the Highway Fund would \n     be retained in the General Fund beginning on the date of any \n     unauthorized expenditure (including an obligation of funds \n     under contract authority) pursuant to such legislation or the \n     date of such an action by an executive agency. 9 \n     Similar clarifications are incorporated into the Aquatic \n     Resources Trust Fund.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\9\\ The Committee does not intend that tax deposits terminate \n     as a result of inadvertent administrative errors provided \n     those errors are corrected within a reasonable period and do \n     not evidence a pattern of disregard of this provisions.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       A technical amendment of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 is \n     included clarifying that excise tax revenues attributable to \n     LNG, CNG, propane, and methanol from natural gas (all of \n     which are subject to reduced, energy equivalent rates, as \n     indicated in Table 1) are divided between the Highway and \n     Mass Transit Accounts of the Highway Fund in the same \n     proportions as gasoline tax revenues are divided between \n     those two accounts.\n       A technical correction to the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 \n     is included providing that, the amount of gasoline and diesel \n     fuel tax revenues deposited into the Mass Transit Account \n     would be 2.86 cents per gallon (rather than 2.85 cents per \n     gallon as provided in that 1997 Act).\n     2. Repeal 1.25 cents per gallon of tax rate on rail diesel \n         fuel\n       The Committee amendment repeals the 1.25-cents-per-gallon \n     rate on rail diesel fuel that is scheduled to expire after \n     September 30, 1999. The repeal is effective on May 16, 1999.\n     3. Authorize limited tax-exempt financing for toll road and \n         certain similar highway infrastructure projects\n       S. 1173 would authorize the construction of up to 15 \n     highway infrastructure projects, such as toll roads involving \n     private business participation. The Committee amendment \n     provides that these projects are to be eligible for tax-\n     exempt private activity bond financing. Bonds for these \n     projects generally are subject to all Code provisions \n     governing issuance of tax-exempt private activity bonds \n     except (1) the annual State volume limits (sec. 146) and (2) \n     no proceeds of these bonds may be used to finance land. In \n     lieu of the State volume limits, the aggregate amount of \n     bonds that could be issued under this pilot project is $15 \n     billion (as allocated by the Department of Transportation in \n     consultation with the Department of the Treasury).\n     4. Exclusion from income for employer-provided transportation \n         benefits\n       The Committee amendment permits employers to offer \n     employees the option of electing cash compensation in lieu of \n     any qualified transportation benefit, or a combination of any \n     of these benefits. Qualified transportation benefits include \n     employer-provided transit passes, parking and vanpooling. \n     Thus, no amount is includible in gross income or wages merely \n     because the employee is offered the choice of cash or such \n     benefits. The amount of cash offered is includible in income \n     and wages only to the extent the employee elects cash. In \n     addition, the Committee amendment increases the exclusion for \n     transit passes and vanpooling to $100 per month for taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 2002. The $100 amount is \n     indexed as under present law.\n\n             III. BUDGET EFFECTS OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT\n\n\n                         A. Committee Estimate\n\n       In compliance with paragraph 11(a) of Rule XXVI of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate, the following statement is made \n     concerning the estimated budget effects of the revenue \n     provisions of the Committee amendment.

Budget Authority and Tax Expenditures\n\n     Budget Authority\n       In compliance with section 308(a)(1) of the Budget Act, the \n     Committee states that the revenue provisions do not involve \n     new or increased budget authority.\n     Tax Expenditures\n       In compliance with section 308(a)(2) of the Budget Act, the \n     Committee states that the income tax reduction provisions \n     (tax-exempt bonds for private sector highway infrastructure \n     construction, allow employees to elect between cash \n     compensation and qualified transportation fringe benefits, \n     and increase employer-provided mass transit pass income \n     exclusion) will increase tax expenditures by the amounts \n     shown in the above table. The reduction in the income tax \n     credit for ethanol fuels will reduce tax expenditures by $2 \n     million. The excise tax provisions do not involve tax \n     expenditures under the current statutory definition of tax \n     expenditures.\n\n\n            C. Consultation With Congressional Budget Office\n\n       In accordance with section 403 of the Budget Act, the \n     Committee advises that the Congressional Budget Office has \n     submitted the following statement with respect to the \n     Committee amendment.\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional budget Office,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 1997.\n     Hon. William V. Roth, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office and the \n     Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) have reviewed the Committee \n     on Finance's amendment to S. 1173, the Intermodal \n     Transportation Act of 1997. The JCT estimate that this \n     amendment would decrease governmental receipts by $11 million \n     in fiscal year 1999 and have no net effect on receipts over \n     fiscal years 1998 through 2002. CBO concurs with this \n     estimate.\n       The revenue effect of the Committee's amendment to S. 1173 \n     are summarized in the table below. Please refer to the \n     enclosed table for a more detained estimate of the amendment.\n\n                                            REVENUE EFFECT OF THE COMMITTEE ON FINANCE'S AMENDMENT TO S. 1173                                           \n                                                        [By fiscal years in billions of dollars]                                                        \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007   1998-2000\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nProposed Changes:                                                                                                                                       \n    On-Budget......................................        0      -11       -2        5        7       13        6       12        8        5         45\n    Off-Budget.....................................        0        0        0        0        0       -2       -6       -9      -12      -14        -43\n                                                    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n      Total........................................        1      -11       -2        5        7       11        0        3       -4       -9          2\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       In accordance with the requirements of Public Law 104-4, \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, JCT has determined \n     that the Committee amendment contains no federal \n     intergovernmental mandates. States, local, and tribal \n     governments are exempt from income tax and from the motor \n     fuels excise tax.\n       In addition, JCT has determined that the amendment contains \n     one federal private sector mandate. The provision to reduce \n     the tax credit or exemption from gasoline excise tax for \n     ethanol users would impose direct costs on the private sector \n     of $208 million over fiscal years 2001 through 2007. Please \n     refer to the enclosed letter for a more detailed account of \n     the mandates in the amendment.\n\n                                                             FEDERAL PRIVATE SECTOR MANDATES                                                            \n                                                        [By fiscal years, in millions of dollars]                                                       \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       1998     1999     2000     2001     2002     2003     2004     2005     2006     2007   1998-2007\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal Mandate Cost.................................        0        0        0       10       14       25       29       40       45       45        208\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       Section 252 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 establishes pay-as-you-go procedures for \n     legislation affecting receipts or direct spending through \n     2007.

Regulatory Impact and Other Matters\n\n\n                          A. Regulatory Impact\n\n        Pursuant to paragraph 11(b) of Rule XXVI of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate, the Committee makes the following \n     statement concerning the regulatory impact that might be \n     incurred in carrying out the provisions of the Committee \n     amendment.\n     Impact on individuals and businesses\n        The Committee amendment extends the present-law Federal \n     Highway Trust Fund excises for 6 years, October 1, 1999-\n     September 30, 2005, in order to provide funding for the 6-\n     year extension of the Highway Fund authorizations in S. 1173. \n     This extension of existing Highway Fund excise taxes will not \n     change the tax burden on individual or business users of the \n     Federal-aid highway system.\n        The Committee amendment also extends the income tax \n     credits and partial excise tax exemptions for ethanol fuel, \n     at a reduced subsidy rate beginning in 2001. This will \n     increase the tax burden somewhat for individual and business \n     users of ethanol fuels. (See revenue table in Part IV.A., \n     above, for the estimated budget effects of this provision.)\n        The Committee amendment extends the authority to make \n     expenditures from the Highway Fund for 6 years, October 1, \n     1997-September 30, 2003, and updates the purposes for which \n     Highway Fund monies may be expended to include such purposes \n     as included in S. 1173.\n        The Committee amendment clarifies the income tax treatment \n     of certain environmental grant monies under a Congestion \n     Mitigation and Air Quality Program. No inference is intended \n     as to the treatment of amounts received under other Federal \n     grant programs.\n        The Committee amendment repeals the 1.25 cents per gallon \n     General Fund tax rate on rail diesel fuel, effective on May \n     16, 1999.\n        The Committee amendment provides that tax-exempt bonds may \n     be issued to finance up to $15 billion of highway \n     infrastructure projects, such as toll roads involving private \n     business participation.\n        The Committee amendment permits employers to offer \n     employees the option of electing cash compensation in lieu of \n     any qualified transportation benefit. The amount of cash \n     offered is includible in income and wages only to the extent \n     the employees elect cash. Further, the Committee amendment \n     increases the exclusion for transit passes and vanpooling to \n     $100 per month for taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2002.\n     Impact on personal privacy and paperwork\n        The Committee amendment will not affect personal privacy, \n     and should not involve any increase in paperwork above that \n     currently required of individual and business taxpayers.\n\n\n                     B. Unfunded Mandates Statement\n\n        This information is provided in accordance with section \n     423 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4).\n        The Committee on Finance has reviewed the provisions of \n     the revenue title to S. 1173 (``Committee amendment'') \n     approved by the Senate Committee on Finance on October 1, \n     1997. In accordance with the requirements of Public Law 104-\n     4, the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995, the Committee \n     has determined that the following provision of the Committee \n     amendment contains Federal private sector mandates: Extension \n     and reduction in ethanol tax credit/excise tax exemption\n        As indicated in the revenue table (Part IV.A., above), \n     this provision is estimated to increase tax revenue by $208 \n     million over fiscal years 2001-2007, which is the estimated \n     amount that the private sector will be required to spend in \n     order to comply with this Federal private sector mandate. \n     This provision will not impose a Federal intergovernmental \n     mandate on State, local, or tribal governments, as such \n     governmental entities are exempt from income tax and from the \n     motor fuels excise taxes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10661-3", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. CRAIG.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. \n1260, the Securities Litigation Uniform Standards Act of 1997 that was \nintroduced yesterday by Senator Gramm, Dodd, and myself. We were joined \nby a significant number of the Banking Committee members.\n  After an extensive series of hearings which established a pattern of \nwidespread abuse of the securities laws by class action lawyers, the \nCongress, in 1995, passed a major overhaul of the class action rules \nfor frivolous securities litigation. The law is also designed to \nincrease the flow of information to investors.\n  The Act will be 2 years old at the end of the year. With benefit of \nthese 2 years of experience there is evidence that plaintiffs' lawyers \nhave simply moved their frivolous cases to State court to avoid the new \nFederal reforms.\n  A study by Stanford Law School professors Joseph Grunfest and Michael \nPerino found that since the passage of the Federal reforms in 1995, \nabout 26 percent of class action litigation activity has moved from \nFederal courts to State courts--an unprecedented shift.\n  The Stanford study concluded that this shift to State court is \ncalculated to ``avoid the substantive or procedural provisions of the \n1995 reform act--the very provision that deter abusive lawsuits.''\n  Under State law, plaintiff's lawyers still can engage in practices \nthat were prohibited by Congress in 1995.\n  State courts still allow ``boilerplate'' complaints; fishing \nexpeditions in the name of discovery even before the plaintiffs' \nlawyers establish that they have the barest of facts to support their \ncase.\n  State courts still allow pet plaintiffs. This is the perverse \npractice by which the lawyer hires the client, not the more customary \narrangement under which a client hires the lawyer.\n  State courts still allow lawsuits simply if the price of the stock \ndrops. Congress decided in 1995 that stock volatility is not stock \nfraud.\n  State courts still allow lawsuits if a prediction about the future of \nthe company doesn't come true--even when the statement is accompanied \nwith appropriate warnings that the prediction may not come true and \nthat it is a prediction.\n  The lack of safe harbors for predictions about the company's future \nmuzzle CEO's and chill the flow of information.\n  Corporate disclosures reduce the volatility of share prices and \nincrease the liquidity of stock. Yet, State courts do not have safe \nharbors for predictions as a result, the information flow to investors \nis limited because State lawsuits are undermining the ``safe harbors'' \nthat were crafted in the 1995 Act.\n\n[[Page S10713]]\n\n  There is a tremendous value to corporate disclosures. Forward looking \ncorporate disclosures dramatically lower the cost of capital. Firms \nthat voluntarily disclose information increase their pool of potential \ninvestors, and those investors have a more accurate understanding of \nthe firms' likely future performance. There is an overwhelming \nconsensus in the academic, business and investor communities that these \nfactors greatly enhance a firm's ability to attract capital and \ntherefore contribute to economic growth.\n  The targets of these State-court securities class actions are the \nhigh-tech leaders of the future. These are the companies producing the \nexciting products, and creating excellent jobs.\n  One of these lawsuits can cripple a young high-tech company. During \nour first round of hearings, the general counsel for Intel stated that \nif Intel had been hit with one of these lawsuits in its early days, \nthere might not be an Intel today. One of these frivolous lawsuits \ncould have put them out of business.\n  These lawsuits are destructive, and the 1995 reforms were designed to \nprotect innocent companies and to provide more information to \ninvestors.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to make sure that the 1995 act \nworks the way that Congress intended.\n  The bill creates a very narrow preemption requiring that class action \nlaw suits involving nationally-traded securities be litigated in \nFederal court. This would ensure that remedies available to purchasers \nand sellers of these nationally-traded securities would be uniform and \nwould not vary depending upon the State in which the purchaser or \nseller lives.\n  Specifically, the bill only affects class actions in which damages \nare sought on behalf of more than 25 people.\n  The legislation only applies to cases involving nationally traded \nsecurities.\n  State regulators retain full authority to bring enforcement actions.\n  Private class actions involving nationally traded securities that are \nfiled in State court would be moved to Federal court.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to expeditiously consider and pass \nthis legislation.\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, occasionally there comes along an \nindividual who inspires everyone with his compassion, dedication, and \ndevotion. Alex English is such a person.\n  Mr. English was born in Columbia, S.C., amid great poverty. As a \nchild, he faced overt racism from many of the city's white residents; \nin his neighborhood, there were few role models he could emulate. It \nwould have been easy for Alex English to capitulate to the odds, to \nbecome a victim of the oppressive poverty and violence that surrounded \nhim. But he did not.\n  Instead, Alex English became a basketball player. Not just any \nbasketball player, but one of the greatest in the world. On Monday, \nSeptember 29, 1997, he was inducted into the Naismith Memorial \nBasketball Hall of Fame. The hall of fame recognized him for his 15-\nyear National Basketball Association career, during which he made the \nAll-Star Team eight times and the All-NBA second team three times. Mr. \nEnglish led the NBA in scoring in the 1985-86 season. Today, Alex \nEnglish is No. 9 on the NBA's all-time scoring list.\n  But Alex English's greatest attributes are not his feather-soft jump \nshot or his patented, smooth-as-silk drive to the basket. They are his \nqualities as a warm and generous person. Alex English was first and \nforemost a team player, in life and in basketball. At his induction on \nMonday, he said, ``Team play was the most important thing for me. I had \nplayers around me who knew their roles; there was no selfishness.'' \nThis unselfish attitude and self-effacing manner is rare among today's \nfamous athletes.\n  On and off the court, Alex English's grace and poise always have \nstood out. Lou Carnesecca, former St. John's coach and 1992 Hall of \nFame inductee, noted that Alex ``always comported himself so well--with \nclass.'' Dr. Jack Ramsay, another Hall of Fame coach, seconded \nCarnesecca's praise. These great coaches are telling us what we in \nSouth Carolina already know: as a player and person, Alex English is in \na league of his own.\n  We in South Carolina are proud to call Alex English our own. He has \nbeen inducted into the South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame and the \nUniversity of South Carolina Hall of Fame, as well as the Colorado Hall \nof Fame. Fortunately for us, Alex also has been quick to acknowledge \nhis South Carolina roots. ``I carry all of you with me,'' he said to \nthe people of Columbia after his induction on Monday. ``Columbia has \nbeen a very important part of my career; the people there have always \ntreated me very kindly.''\n  Alex English continues to reside in Columbia, preferring to live \nquietly among old friends rather than ostentatiously. He has not \nforgotten his old teammates at Dreher High School and the University of \nSouth Carolina. He is known to his neighbors and friends as a \nhumanitarian, philanthropist, businessman, and ambassador of goodwill. \nHe gives generously of his time and money. As George Glymph, Alex \nEnglish's high school coach said, ``When the good Lord wanted a role \nmodel for the ultimate professional, family man, warrior, he made \nAlex.'' Because of Alex English's contributions, his community--our \ncommunity--is a better place.\n  At his induction, Alex English told the press, ``I love the people of \nColumbia dearly.'' Alex, the feeling is mutual.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10712-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10713-S10714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE BOWMAN\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this year marks the culmination of a \ndistinguished career in health care for an individual whose name has \nbecome synonymous with the respect and appreciation accorded Missouri \nhospitals. Charles L. Bowman joined the Missouri Hospital Association \nstaff on October 1, 1975, as vice president of legislative services. He \nassumed the presidency in January 1986. During his 22 years of service, \nhis word has been his bond, and he has established a solid reputation \nof integrity in the legislative arena for himself, the association and \nthe hospital industry.\n  Charles Bowman helped shape activities of the Missouri Hospital \nAssociation at a time when the health care delivery system was \nundergoing dramatic changes and health policy was assuming a greater \nimportance on the country's public policy agenda. During this period, \nhe charted an advocacy course for Missouri's hospitals through \nupheavals in the State tort reform laws, massive changes in \nreimbursement for the Medicare Program, and complete redesign of \nMissouri's Medicaid Program.\n  His interest always has been in developing sound health care policy \nthat helps hospitals serve their communities more fully. He advanced \nlandmark legislation in Missouri that provided consent for emergency \nhealth care to be rendered to minors, and legislation that provided a \ndefinition of death. He also provided the impetus for a statewide \nvoluntary initiative among hospitals to release hospital charge data so \nthat consumers might become more familiar with the price of health care \nservices.\n  Charles Bowman has championed equity in reimbursement policy designed \nto preserve vital access to health care in rural and inner-city \ncommunities. And he has been a proponent of health system reform that \ngives hospitals and other providers the opportunity to organize local \ndelivery systems of coordinated care that will allow seniors and others \nto continue the relationships with health care providers they have \ntrusted over the years.\n  Charles Bowman has forged a remarkable partnership between Missouri \nhospitals and State agencies that led to expansions in health funding \nfor poor Missourians, development of an innovative scholarship program \nto help increase the number of health care providers in underserved \nareas of the State, and creation of a process for assessing and \nimproving community health that has become a model for other States.\n  Through his 22 years of leadership for Missouri hospitals and health \nsystems, Charles Bowman has kept the focus of association activities on \nimproving health care for all Missouri's citizens--by spearheading \nlegislative programs, forging collaborative partnerships and seeking \ninnovative solutions to problems of health delivery. He has been a\n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\ncredible voice for Missouri health and an advocate for a strong, \nunified health care community in Missouri.\n  His truly has been a distinguished career of health care \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10713-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO PATRICK CURTIS\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a dear \nfriend of mine, Patrick Curtis, who is being honored next week with the \n100th star on The Palm Springs Walk of Stars in Palm Springs, CA.\n  Patrick first set off on the road to stardom when he played Baby Beau \nWilkes in Gone with the Wind. As a young actor working his way through \nfilm school, he worked on dozens of westerns, the Ma and Pa Kettle \ncomedies, nearly every Tony Curtis film made in the 1950's, and even on \nthe Leave it to Beaver set.\n  Upon graduating from film school, Patrick received a naval ROTC \ncommission. He later served his country in Vietnam in 1967 and 1968.\n  Patrick has risen to become a highly successful film director and \nproducer. He has had the opportunity to work with many legends and \npersonal heroes of mine. Recently, he produced Meanwhile, Back at the \nRanch, a documentary western about John Wayne, Roy Rogers, Gene Autry, \nHoppy, and other six-gun legends.\n  Even with his busy film schedule, Patrick has found time to give back \nto his community. He was asked by President Ronald Reagan to serve as \npresident of the Vietnam Veterans Leadership Program, an organization \nof successful veterans with the purpose of helping veterans who have \nnot been able to mainstream. For his continued support of Vietnam \nveterans, Patrick has been awarded the prestigious Air Force \nAssociation Humanitarian Award. He has also been presented lifetime \nmembership in The Marine Corps League, The Navy League, and The Air \nForce League.\n  In addition to his work with veterans, Patrick has worked to gather \ntogether talent in the entertainment industry to create public service \nannouncements for groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving, DARE, \nand Activities for Retarded Children--all paid for by funds raised from \nthe entertainment industry.\n  Mr. President, I would like to honor Patrick Curtis for his \noutstanding and numerous contributions to the entertainment industry, \nto America's veterans, and to his community. Patrick's selfless service \nto his country and community are a great example of what it means to be \na great, patriotic American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10714-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RIGHT TO LIFE OF MICHIGAN BANQUET\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nMichigan Association of Non-public Schools (MANS) on their 25 years of \nservice to this special group of educators and students. Founded in \n1972, MANS has advocated on behalf of non-public schools, established \nan agenda for their advancement, and given witness to the communities \nin Michigan regarding their immense social, educational, and economic \nbenefit.\n  With the voluntary support of over 540 schools, nearly 7,000 \ninstructors and 140,000 students of Michigan's next generation are \naffected by the outreach and activities sponsored by MANS. Through the \nMichigan Non-public School Accrediting Association, its affiliated \nParent Network, and its organization of school resources, MANS works \ntoward school improvement, encourages greater parental participation, \nand provides a host of services vital to bringing non-public school \nstudents the best education they can receive.\n  Through the years, MANS has been instrumental in promoting equal \neducation benefits and services for all children. Regular conferences \nare held and have gained the enthusiastic support of teachers and \nadministrators, with as many as 6,000 participants having attended \nrecent gatherings. Finally, MANS maintains a role as a respected \npartner and resource for all levels of government whose actions impact \neducation in Michigan.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to express \nappreciation for the many individuals who have given of their time and \ntalent to bring about a better community through MANS.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the \nachievements of Italian-Americans as we join to commemorate the \naccomplishment of the first Italian-American, Christopher Columbus. \nItalian-Americans came to this country with little, but have left a \nlarge mark. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to celebrate with \nthem today, Columbus Day.\n  Mr. President, certainly everyone in this country is grateful for the \ncourage, dignity, and thrill for exploration given to this Nation by \nChristopher Columbus. As a grandson of Lebanese immigrants, I am \nconvinced that the various ethnic heritages people bring with them when \nthey come to the United States greatly benefit our country. Indeed, \nItalian-Americans have taken over where Columbus left off, building \nthis Nation into the great power that it is. Certainly, without the \nleadership, insight, and continued support of one of this Nation's most \nvalued resources, America would face a terrible emptiness.\n  Many Italian-Americans have given generously of their time and energy \nin preparation of this celebration, and they should be commended for \ntheir efforts.

Donald recently received the 1997 Shirley Ann \nMunroe Leadership Development Award, by the\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\nAmerican Hospital Association, a distinction given to the rural \nhospital administrator across the Nation who ``displayed outstanding \nleadership commitment to meet the challenges faced by small/rural \nhospitals.''\n  Donald was chosen to be the administrator by the first board of \ndirectors for the Citizens Memorial Hospital in Bolivar, MO, in the \nearly 1980's. With his experience in hospital administration and \nconstruction, Donald has taken what was once just a dream to new \nheights of reality. In the last 17 years he has built a huge rural \nfacility as executive director of the Citizens Memorial Health Care \nFoundation. This facility provides excellent health care to more than \n75,000 individuals in Bolivar and the surrounding areas. The Citizens \nMemorial Health Care Foundation now consists of an acute care hospital, \nthree long-term care facilities, a residential care facility, \nindependent living apartments, 12 physician clinics, including six \ncertified rural health clinics--the first created in Missouri--home \nhealth, hospice, home medical equipment, homemaker services, a wellness \nand counseling center, a statewide health maintenance organization, and \nan extensive outpatient rehabilitation program. Donald also always \nmakes time for his staff, patients, residents, and community members. \nHe meets individually with each new employee and makes regular rounds \nof all of his health care facilities in the area.\n  It is a privilege to honor Citizens Memorial Hospital Administrator, \nDonald J. Babb, on this well deserved award. I know the hospital will \ncontinue to improve and grow for years to come. The State of Missouri \nis lucky to have such a facility and I want to express my sincere \nappreciation to Donald Babb, who makes Citizens Memorial Hospital \nexcel.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10714-6", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SERGEANT ALVIN C. YORK\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, today is an historic day for it was \n79 years ago on this date, October 8, 1918, that Sgt. Alvin C. York \nfaced a battery of German soldiers alone in the Battle of the Argonne. \nSergeant York's bravery during World War I captured the imagination of \nthe world. Here at home, he was heralded as a true hero, complete with \nthe largest ticker tape parade New York City had ever seen. President \nWilson and General Pershing offered their personal thanks, and Sergeant \nYork received this Nation's Medal of Honor.\n  But home for Alvin York, despite his new found fame, was the hills of \nTennessee in Fentress County. The values instilled in him by his family \nremained with him throughout his life, and he used his platform as a \nhero of the Tennessee hills to better the lives of his neighbors and \nfriends. Sergeant York founded an industrial and agricultural school in \nFentress County, built a church and Bible school, and when money ran \nshort, he helped to pay the teachers' salaries himself.\n  Today, 79 years later, we salute the memory of Alvin C. York and his \nheroic deeds as a young soldier far from home on the battlefield in \nFrance. Despite his great fame, home and family were far more important \nto him. His heroism extends far beyond the battlefield. For the values \nthat he lived each and every day as a citizen of Fentress County, TN, \nare values for all of us to emulate in our daily lives.\n  Mr. President, the Sergeant York Historical Association, of which I \nam proud to serve on the board of directors, is committed to keeping \nthe memory of Sergeant York alive. I commend the association for its \nefforts to ensure that the York homeplace, his grist mill, his papers, \nand the history of World War I are not forgotten, but will live on for \ngenerations to visit, enjoy, and appreciate a piece of our Nation's \nfabric.\n  Sergeant York was a World War I hero, but in truth, he is a hero for \nall time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10715-1", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEDICARE BENEFICIARY FREEDOM TO CONTRACT ACT\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Medicare \nBeneficiary Freedom to Contract Act of 1997. This legislation protects \nthe right of the elderly to be treated by the physician of their \nchoice.\n  Great reform of Medicare was achieved during the 1997 Balanced Budget \nAct: regulations were streamlined, greater flexibility was given to \nrural health care, and, most important, the Medicare trust fund--on the \nverge of bankruptcy--was salvaged for an additional 10 years.\n  However, due to the administration's threat to veto the entire \nBalanced Budget act, the conference committee to the act added a \nrequirement clearly infringing on the rights of senior citizens. The \nPresident's provision prohibits providers who privately contract from \ntreating Medicare patients for a period of 2 years. Therefore, upon \nenactment of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, it is now unlawful for a \ndoctor to take a private payment from a Medicare-eligible patient if \nduring the previous 2 years he has billed Medicare for any service \nrendered to a patient over the age of 65.\n  What is the reality of the President's provision?\n  The reality is that it will be almost impossible for a senior citizen \nto contract privately for medical services because few or no physicians \nare going to be able to make ends meet if they can't accept Medicare \npatients for 2 years. The reality is that, unlike every other insured \nAmerican, senior citizens have no option but to receive the services \nthat their insurance carrier, Medicare, recognizes and is willing to \npay for. In essence, upon turning the age of 65, you have now lost a \nsignificant right--a right of choice in who provides your health care.\n  Mr. President, even in the socialized medical system of Great \nBritain, choice is offered to the elderly. In Great Britain, a senior \ncitizen has the choice to pay privately for his or her medical \nservices. Don't the elderly of America deserve that same choice?\n  To remedy this situation, I have sponsored legislation introduced by \nSenator Kyl of Arizona and Senator Nickles of Oklahoma. This \nlegislation explicitly provides that any Medicare beneficiary can enter \ninto an agreement with the physician or practitioner of their choice \nfor any health care service and for any length of time when they choose \nto pay for such services out of their own pocket. In brief, the bill \nwill ensure that Medicare-eligible beneficiaries who choose to pay out \nof pocket will have an unrestricted right to the health care provider \nof their choice. I cosponsored a similar bill two years ago.\n  The American Medical Association has strongly endorsed this \nlegislation. In a letter dated September 18, 1997, the AMA executive \nvice-president writes:\n\n       The AMA believes that it is essential that Medicare-\n     eligible seniors have the unfettered right to spend their own \n     money to buy health care if and as they so choose, \n     irrespective of coverage under the Medicare program. * * * \n     (this) bill is an urgently needed clarification of the law \n     and would greatly further the goal of providing Medicare \n     beneficiaries with more choices in their pursuit of health \n     care.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of this important \nlegislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/10/08/senate-section/article/S10715-2", "month": "10", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CHANGES TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATION\n\n Mr. DOMENICI.
