Under the previous order, there will now be an \nhour debate, equally divided between the Senator from Vermont and the \nSenator from Missouri or their designees, prior to the cloture vote on \nthe nomination of Dr. David Satcher of Tennessee to be Assistant \nSecretary of Health and Human Services and to be Surgeon General.\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nDr. David Satcher of Tennessee. I have listened to the debate. I have \ntalked to Dr. Satcher about the issues involved. I am convinced that \nthis is an outstanding appointment that the President has made. Whether \nyou look at Dr. Satcher's history in terms of his commitment to his \nfamily, whether you look in terms of his commitment to his community, \nor whether you look in terms of his commitment to his profession, I \nbelieve he is an outstanding individual. From everyone that I have \ntalked to, I have come away with that conclusion. Clearly there are \nsome policy issues on which we disagree. I think we have one in terms \nof the debate on partial-birth abortion. Frankly, in looking at the \nissues and listening to the debate, I think that that is at the crux of \nthe concern as far as Dr. Satcher's confirmation. I think a lot of \nthese other issues are collateral issues.\n  I have talked to him about this. I am a strong supporter of the ban \non partial-birth abortions. I think there is no justification \nwhatsoever for that onerous procedure. And, in response to questions on \nthis issue, Dr. Satcher has said:\n\n       While I support the concept of a ban on late-term \n     abortions, like the President I feel that if there are risks \n     of severe health consequences for the mother then that \n     decision should not be made by the Government, but by the \n     woman in conjunction with her family and her physician.\n\n  Again, he supports the concept of a ban on late-term abortions but he \nbelieves there should be more thought given to the situation of severe \nhealth consequences for the mother. I understand what he is talking \nabout. Personally, I have concerns about that exception and its \npotential for abuse. Without getting into that whole debate again, I \ncan simply say I disagree with the President's position on that issue. \nHowever I have discussed this issue with Dr. Satcher and I have read \nwhat he has written in response to questions on this issue. I am \nsatisfied he does not intend to use the position of Surgeon General to \nadvocate or promote abortion in any way. In fact, he said:\n\n       Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of \n     using the positions of Assistant Secretary for Health and \n     Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion. I \n     share no one's political agenda, and I want to use the power \n     of these positions to focus on issues that unite Americans \n     and not divide them.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If I am confirmed by the Senate I will strongly promote a \n     message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth which I \n     believe can help to reduce the number of abortions in our \n     country.\n\n  This is the commitment that he has made. Many of us have been \nconcerned in times past that this particular position of Surgeon \nGeneral would be used as a bully pulpit by individuals to promote \npolicies that are contrary to the best interests of this country. I \nthink it has been done in the past. I do not feel that Dr. Satcher will \ndo this. I think he has a good concept of the good that can be done in \nthis job. I think he understands the terrible problems that our young \npeople have. I think he sees an opportunity to do some good for these \nyoung people. Everything in his history indicates that that would be \nhis attitude in approaching this position, and I believe him when he \nsays that and I respect his position on that.\n  I believe that, generally speaking, a President has the right and \nshould have the right to appoint the kind of nominees, the kind of \npeople he wants to these positions. I believe that, whether the \nPresident is a Democrat or a Republican. There are some situations \nwhere the positions or the background is so out of the norm, out of the \nmainstream, that we as a confirming body have to take a contrary \nposition to that of the President. I think those situations ought to be \nrare. I have considered Dr. Satcher's record. I do not see anything in \nhis record where that particular result on our part should obtain.\n  Unfortunately, I think sometimes in these confirmation debates we \nhave a policy problem with the President, or we have a policy problem \nwith the individual who the President nominates. But, instead of \nconcentrating on that policy problem we begin to look for other things \nthat we perhaps could use against this nominee. I think we get into, \nthen, issues sometimes of credibility and veracity and character and \nthings like that that, frankly, I think is unfortunate. I think it has \nhappened on both sides of the aisle with regard to nominees from both \nsides of the aisle in times past.\n  I think we would be well served to keep our eye on the ball. Let's \nlook at the history of this particular individual. I don't think \nanybody can question his character or his veracity or his commitment to \nhis profession. We have a policy issue here. We need to address whether \nor not the fact that he supports the President, as all the President's \nnominees for any position that comes up are going to do--whether or not \nhis support for the President in this case is sufficient to disqualify \nhim for this position. I think the answer to that is no. I think he \nwill be a good Surgeon General.\n  He does happen to be a Tennessean. That does not disqualify him \neither, in my estimation. And therefore I respectfully submit this \ngentleman should be confirmed.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to speak this morning. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who seeks time? The Senator from \nMissouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent the time be allotted equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to speak against the confirmation \nof Dr. David Satcher, and I allocate myself so much time as I may \nconsume, but I ask that I be notified when 8 minutes have expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator at that \npoint.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, we live in an information age. We have come to a \nconclusion and an understanding of an important fact, which is that \nthose individuals who control information and have information are in a \nposition to make good decisions. And, as a matter of fact, the basis of \ngood decisions really determines the outcome of arguments and \ndetermines the strategy that will be developed, determines the course \nof a nation. No one is able to make good decisions without good \ninformation. In the computer world, it is put this way: Garbage in, \ngarbage out. If you don't have good information going in, you don't get \ngood information coming out. It is that simple and easy to understand.\n  It works with computers; it also works with the U.S. Senate. If we \ndon't get good information, we can't make good decisions. If we don't \nget accurate information, we can't make the kinds of decisions the \npeople expect us to make in this office.\n  There are a variety of issues which have characterized the debate as \nit relates to the potential confirmation of Dr. David Satcher: issues \nrelating to the New England Journal of Medicine's\n\n[[Page S533]]\n\nconclusion that the African AIDS studies were unethical and that they \nwere improper; issues relating to the study of newborns and the \ntransmission of AIDS from mothers to their children in the United \nStates; the maintenance of an experiment that left the identification \nof the children unknown long after we had therapy that would have been \navailable to them if we just identified the children by virtue of the \nblood samples.\n  We have had the issue of both of those AIDS studies. We have had the \nissue of partial-birth abortion. We have had the issue about needle \nexchanges. We have had issues raised in this Chamber about the Accident \nPrevention Center at the Centers for Disease Control, that center which \nis so focused, in some respects, on guns and their impact on the lives \nof Americans. It has been an issue because there has been a suggestion \nthat guns, in some respects, qualify as a disease and has become \nsomething that we should address in the Congress. I personally don't \nbelieve that the second amendment to the United States Constitution, \nwhich guarantees the opportunities of individuals to have guns, is a \ndisease. I think it is a valuable right for this country, and it is one \nwe ought to cherish.\n  But in all of these issues, the ability of the Congress to make good \ndecisions, the ability of the Senate, specifically, to make decisions \nabout a confirmation depends on the reliability and availability of the \ninformation.\n  There are some troubling aspects about the unavailability and the \nunreliability of information that have characterized the information \nflow in this confirmation proceeding. The Centers for Disease Control \nseems to have felt that it could selectively provide information \nregarding the controversial AIDS study in Africa, the study which the \nNew England Journal of Medicine criticized because people were given \nsugar pills, or placebos, at a time when there was a known therapy. And \nit is pretty clear that when there is a known therapy, medical ethics \nsay you are not allowed to give people just sugar pills and send them \non their way, watching them die.\n  The New England Journal of Medicine took the Centers for Disease \nControl to task over this. The Centers for Disease Control was asked \nabout it by my office and by others, and a meager stream of information \ncame out.\n  I hold in my hand today a report of May 22, 1997. This report has yet \nto be delivered to me by the Centers for Disease Control but came into \nmy possession from a third party who had gotten this report through a \nFreedom of Information Act demand last year. It seems to me that when \nwe ask for information like this, the Members of the Senate ought to be \naccorded at least the courtesy of the information being provided, but \nwhen we read the report, it may well be that it is the nature of the \nreport, it is the content of the report that makes it difficult for \nthem to want to share it with the Senate.\n  Paragraph No. 3 says:\n\n       Whether the use of a placebo in this study is ethical.\n\n  So they are still debating 3 or 4 years after the start of this study \nserious questions at CDC about whether what they are doing is ethical, \nthe way they are treating individuals in these African trials. I \npersonally agree with the New England Journal of Medicine that to treat \npeople as if they are laboratory subjects and not as human beings, to \ngive them placebos when it is known that the HIV virus ultimately is \nfatal is unethical.\n  But what is important here is, and I quote the language:\n\n       This concern is because a placebo-controlled trial in the \n     United States would be unethical.\n\n  Here you have a document from the Centers for Disease Control \nadmitting that for us to do this in the United States to the citizens \nof the United States would be unethical. I think that is substantial. \nFor me, human beings are indivisible. It says in our Declaration of \nIndependence, we are endowed by the Creator with certain inalienable \nrights. We don't have superior standing in terms of ethics and \nexpectation because we happen to live in the United States. This flat \nstatement by those in authority at the Centers for Disease Control \nreporting on this randomized placebo-controlled study in Africa flatly \nstates that a placebo-controlled trial in the United States would be \nunethical.\n  I find the unavailability of this kind of report to the U.S. Senate \nin a confirmation process to be troublesome. I think we have a right to \nbe asking for good information. I think absent good information we \nwon't make good decisions.\n  If this were the singular situation in which there had been the \nabsence of information in this confirmation hearing, I might say, \n``Well, gee, they have a lot of things and perhaps this is to be \noverlooked. This must have been an error.'' But early in the debate, \nneedle exchange programs and the support by Dr. Satcher of such \nprograms were raised. Several Senators came to the floor saying he has \nnever supported a needle exchange program; he would never support \nfederally funded needle exchange programs.\n  We asked for information from the CDC about that. We only got the \ninformation, frankly, after we had the leader intercede to give us \ninformation. When it came, it did show that there was a report from CDC \nthat said that they approved of and thought reasonable and appropriate \nsubstantial Federal funding for needle exchange programs.\n  But even--I thank the Chair for the 8-minute warning. I allocate \nmyself 5 minutes additional.\n  So there was a report that said the CDC itself supported substantial \nFederal funding for needle exchange programs. That is where you give \ndope addicts needles so that they can shoot up the dope and have less \nopportunity to be contaminated by a dirty needle.\n  But what was strangely missing, uniquely missing, was the fact that \nDr. Satcher had written a cover letter to the report endorsing the \nreport. When I asked for the information, it wasn't forthcoming. \nFinally, when we insisted, they sent the report, but they didn't send \nthe cover letter of Dr. Satcher. That had to come from collateral \nsources that we were able to generate.\n  Stonewalling is a problem in Washington, and it is inappropriate to \nthink that we can fail to tell the truth in this city and have the kind \nof Government that Americans deserve. It is a problem in a variety of \nsettings, but it is a problem as it relates to the U.S. Senate and to \nthis confirmation hearing.\n\n  Additionally, I asked in my exchanges with the CDC whether or not \nthey ever funded conferences that promoted clean needles, and they said \nno. They even sent documents showing that there were certain \nconferences devoted to clean needles which they declined to fund. But \nthen later we find that there are documents, as the agenda of \nconferences, that reveal the cosponsorship of the Centers for Disease \nControl and other so-called health agencies that are designed \nexclusively for the purpose of clean needles. The name of the \nconference was ``Getting the Point''--the needle point.\n  We can debate needle exchange programs. There are very serious \nethical problems in providing dope addicts with clean needles. What is \na young person to think when the junkie comes up and says, ``The \nGovernment provides us with these clean needles.'' Must be OK to use \ndope, to have tax dollars spent by Americans to provide clean needles \nto dope addicts so that they can focus their activities and operate \nsafely to inject drugs. The folks who pay taxes in those neighborhoods \nwhere the clean needles are distributed must wonder about the \ncommitment of their Government to protect them rather than to provide a \nsafe haven for drug users.\n  But this is a disturbing set of circumstances, where we simply have \nan absence of information as a result of a stonewall on the part of the \nadministration, and I believe that those who provide that approach are \nnot the kind of individuals who ought to be trusted with the \nresponsibilities of Government.\n  I believe an individual who supports needle exchange programs, who \nwould accommodate drug use instead of seeking to curtail drug use, who \nthinks that the problem is dirty needles instead of the addiction to \nheroin, is not the type of person who ought to be leading our culture \nas it relates to drug policy or health policy.\n  I believe that the absence of information and the willingness to \nstonewall and not provide information does not\n\n[[Page S534]]\n\ncharacterize the way in which we would want to deal with our own \ndoctors, our family doctors, and certainly would not characterize the \nway we would expect the family doctor of the United States of America \nto deal with us.\n  It is in that respect that I think we understand that the absence of \ninformation keeps us from making good decisions--garbage in, garbage \nout. And when the agency decides to provide to the U.S. Senate, \nselectively, information which reinforces what it wants us to know, but \nwithhold information about things that it hopes we do not find out, we \nshould not reward that kind of behavior, that stonewalling, if you \nwill, that absence of truth, that selective revelation of what they \nwant us to know but not what we need to know. We should not reward that \nwith confirmation.\n  There is an epidemic in Washington, DC, of bureaucracy that feels \nlike it can tell people only what they think the people want to know. \nIt is because there are those in the bureaucracy who feel they know so \nmuch better than the people. But that is contrary to the values of \nAmerica.\n  The real value of America is not that the values of Washington, DC, \nbe imposed on the people. The genius of this democratic republic is \nthat the values of the people would be imposed on Washington, DC. For \nthe values of the people to be understood, they have to be recognized \nand accorded dignity and respect, and they have to be formed in the \ncontext of information which is complete and thorough.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. How much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 18 minutes \nremaining. The Senator from Missouri has 10 minutes 41 seconds.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Dr. David Satcher for the positions of Surgeon General and Assistant \nSecretary for Health. Dr. Koop called the position of Surgeon General \n``a high calling, with an obligation to interpret health and medical \nfacts for the public.'' ``A high calling''--a high calling because one \nsubjects oneself to all sorts of accusations, in portraits painted that \nmay not quite be accurate. In fact, sometimes they may be false and \nsometimes misguided and certainly misleading. Therefore, I would like \nto focus my comments over the next several minutes on debunking some of \nthe accusations we have heard on the floor over the past week, one by \none.\n  No. 1, Dr. Satcher's position regarding abortion. Let me say at the \noutset that I strongly support the ban on partial-birth abortions \npassed by this Congress, vetoed by the President. I questioned Dr. \nSatcher about his agreement with the President's position. Let me say \nthat in talking with him, the issues of partial-birth abortion deeply \ntrouble Dr. Satcher. He has said both to me and in writing to this \ncommittee that he supports the ban of this procedure in concept, but he \nstops short of Federal legislation when the health of the mother is \ninvolved.\n  I do not agree with the President's position or Dr. Satcher's \nagreement with the President. In a letter of October 28, he wrote me \nthe following, which is reassuring to me. It says:\n\n       Let me state unequivocally that I have no intention of \n     using the positions of the Assistant Secretary for Health and \n     Surgeon General to promote issues related to abortion.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       I share no one's political agenda. And I want to use the \n     power of these positions to focus on issues that unite \n     Americans--not divide them.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       If I am confirmed by the Senate, I will strongly promote a \n     message of abstinence and responsibility to our youth, which \n     I believe can help to reduce the number of abortions in our \n     country.\n\n  If you look over Dr. Satcher's past--not an agenda we want to impose \non him, but his past--over the last 25 years, he has never made \nabortion a part of his agenda in promoting the public health. And, as \nyou look forward, using the words that I just quoted, he has made the \nstatement that abortion is not going to be a part of his agenda in the \nfuture.\n  No. 2, AZT trials in Africa and Asia. I have talked about this on the \nfloor, but let me just very briefly say that today, actually over the \ncourse of the day, 1,000 HIV-infected babies will be born in developing \ncountries. These babies will go ahead and, unfortunately, die.\n  The goal of the studies that have been carried out, proposed, and are \nunder discussion, was to find a way to stop transmission of that HIV \nvirus from HIV-infected pregnant women to their children. You do not do \nthat--you do not do that--by studying Western-style, prohibitively \nexpensive technology impractical in developing countries, Western-style \nmedicine that requires intravenous administration, repeated visits back \nto the physician or to the clinic, because there is absolutely no \nchance that that sort of therapy can be applied in the developing \ncountries where the goal is to prevent transmission.\n  That is the goal of the study--not to make us feel good, not to prove \nthat the therapy works for the United States or England or France--but \nto decrease transmission in those countries. And you do not do that by \neliminating an arm of the study that includes the current standard of \ncare. We are blessed in this country where the standard of care is not \na placebo or doing nothing. Unfortunately, in Africa--and I was just \nthere 3 weeks ago--the current standard of care is no therapy. That has \nto be an arm of the trial when you are looking at a new intervention.\n  I am absolutely convinced, as a physician, as a clinical researcher, \nthat the trials in Africa met the institutional, the national, and the \ninternational ethical standards as defined today.\n  These studies came in 1994. The World Health Organization recommended \nthat studies be done to test the safety and efficacy of this short-term \nAZT therapy which had the potential of helping developing countries. In \nfact, I would argue that it would be unethical to take a Western-style \ntherapy that can only be applied in countries that have the \ntechnological advances, that can have repeated visits, that have the \nmoney, it would be unethical to take that and experiment on a \npopulation that could not potentially benefit from that in the future.\n  Third issue. Federal funding of needle exchange programs and \neducational conferences has come up again and again and again. Dr. \nSatcher will very simply--talking about the man; no programs and \ndocuments coming from here and there; talking about the man--Dr. \nSatcher, the man nominated, has never advocated, has never supported \ntaxpayer-funded needle exchange programs for drug abusers. Let me \nrepeat, Dr. Satcher has never advocated or supported taxpayer-funded \nneedle exchange programs for drug abusers.\n  Dr. Satcher, furthermore, in both written and oral conversations, \nbelieves strongly that we should never do anything to advocate the use \nof illegal drugs.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. FRIST. Let me run through this in the interest of time.\n  No. 4, research on guns. The CDC National Center for Injury \nPrevention and Control has been criticized by some for supporting \ngrantees with an alleged bias against guns as we look at violence. \nThese studies have been carried out.\n  Again, I have talked to Dr. Satcher personally and discussed, in my \noffice, this issue. I brought up at that time the fact that raw data \nhad not been made available from a study published in the New England \nJournal of Medicine, that it should be made public. And I am actually \nvery pleased that the raw data is now available on the Internet for \neverybody to see. I appreciate his rapid response.\n  Fifth issue. Dr. Satcher has been accused of secretly conducting \nblind HIV studies on newborn babies and sending them home infected \nwithout treatment. Not true. Not true. It makes for great sound bites, \nand it catches the people's imagination, but it is simply not true.\n  Again, look at what happens. The big issue is what is the incidence \nat the time? What is the incidence? What is the prevalence of HIV \ninfection in your\n\n[[Page S535]]\n\ncommunity? How would you find that out today?\n  Well, the study that was actually carried out was that samples were \nobtained that had been discarded, set aside from clinics and from \nhospitals, all done once again with ethical standards of the time, and \ntests were done on that blood to see what the underlying incidence was. \nYes, they were not labeled. In fact, all of the personal labeling had \nbeen stripped from the discarded samples. Why? Because of the privacy \nof those individuals.\n  Another point that has not been mentioned is that each of these \nclinics, each of these hospitals who participated in this baseline \nstudy to see what the incidence of HIV infection is, had at the time \noffered voluntary HIV counseling and testing at every site where this \nstudy took place. Therefore, each and every woman did have the \nopportunity to learn her HIV status.\n  Those are the issues that have come forward. Let me just briefly say, \nin Dr. Satcher's own words, because we have tended to look at all these \nother issues--I think we need to look at his past, his principles, and \nhis agenda. What is his agenda? His agenda is--and I quote--\n\n       As Surgeon General, I would strive to provide our citizens \n     with cutting-edge technology in plain old-fashioned, straight \n     talk. Whether we are talking about smoking or poor diets, I \n     want to send the message of good health to the American \n     people.\n\n  He continued, as he looked forward in his vision:\n\n       My goals as Assistant Secretary for Health and Surgeon \n     General are to be an effective adviser to the Secretary by \n     providing sound medical, public health and scientific advice \n     as appropriate. I want to bring more attention, awareness and \n     clarity to the opportunities for disease prevention and \n     health promotion that are available to individuals, to \n     families, to communities in this country. I want to help make \n     the health of children and youth a greater priority for the \n     Nation and serve as a positive and inspirational role model \n     to them.\n\n  Personal responsibility and prevention, that is Dr. Satcher's agenda \nfor the future.\n  Dr. Satcher has dedicated his career to public health. He is well \nqualified to lead the U.S. Public Health Service and its commissioned \nofficers to meet these worthy goals. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe vote which will take place in a few minutes, the cloture vote, and \nto support Dr. Satcher as the next Surgeon General.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the position of Surgeon General was \ncreated in 1870 and played a vital role in fighting infectious diseases \nand other threats to public safety. Communicating with the American \npublic about the health of their families and communities is probably \nthe most important responsibility of a Surgeon General. This person \nserves as our nation's chief spokesperson for public health. This is \nthe bully pulpit from which we may be lead down the path to a strong, \nhealthy, and productive society.\n  After nearly eight years of dormancy, President Reagan recognized the \nimportance of a national health leader in 1981 and revived the position \nof Surgeon General with the nomination of Dr. C. Everett Koop. At the \ntime, this too was a very controversial nominee, but the Congress and \nnation grew to deeply respect his leadership. Dr. Koop and his \nsuccessors made tremendous strides in educating the public about the \nspread of AIDS, the prevalence of domestic violence, and the need to \ncontrol out-of-wedlock births. There should be no doubt that Dr. David \nSatcher will continue this legacy.\n  This critically important post has been vacant for three years and \nour nation does not have anymore time to spare. The longer the Senate \ndelays this appointment, the greater the lost opportunity to improve \npublic health. For example, there is a developing consensus across the \nnation about the need to reduce teen smoking. Three thousand children \nbecome permanent smokers every day. We need a Surgeon General in place \nto spearhead a national strategy to meet the challenge of teen smoking.\n  Mr. President, I have listened to a lot of the debate on this \nnomination. I want to offer my support to Dr. Satcher and highlight \nsome the experiences and qualities that make him the right person for \nthis position.\n  Dr. Satcher is a physician, a scholar, and a public health leader of \nnational stature. His almost uniform endorsement by the medical, \nbusiness, and education communities are a testament to the respect \nwhich Dr. Satcher's work has earned him. I ask unanimous consent that a \nlist of more than 120 of the nation's medical associations, allied \nhealth groups, businesses, and educational institutions that have also \nendorsed Dr. Satcher be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   Endorsements of Dr. David Satcher\n\n                       (as of November 24, 1997)\n\n\n                          medical associations\n\n       American Medical Association.\n       American Academy of Family Physicians.\n       National Medical Association.\n       National Hispanic Medical Association.\n       Tennessee Medical Association.\n       American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n       American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists.\n       American Association of Neurological Surgeons.\n       American Association of Public Health Physicians.\n       American College of Chest Physicians.\n       American College of Emergency Physicians.\n       American College of Gastroenterology.\n       American College of Nuclear Physicians.\n       American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.\n       American College of Occupational & Environmental Medicine.\n       American College of Physicians.\n       American College of Preventative Medicine.\n       American Dental Association.\n       American Gastroenterological Association.\n       American Medical Group Association.\n       American Medical Women's Association.\n       American Osteopathic Association.\n       American Psychiatric Association.\n       American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery.\n       American Society of Clinical Pathologists.\n       American Society of Internal Medicine.\n       American Society of Pediatric Nephrology.\n       American Society for Reproductive Medicine.\n       American Society for Transplant Physicians.\n       California Medical Association.\n       College of American Pathologists.\n       Congress of Neurological Surgeons.\n       Interamerican College of Physicians and Surgeons.\n       Mississippi State Medical Association.\n       Society of Nuclear Medicine.\n       Society of Thoracic Surgeons.\n\n\n                                 nurses\n\n       American Nurses Association.\n       American Association of Nurse Anesthetists.\n       National Black Nurses Association.\n       Emergency Nurses Association.\n\n\n                               hospitals\n\n       American Hospital Association.\n       InterHealth.\n       National Association of Public Hospital and Health Systems.\n       National Association of Children's Hospitals.\n       The Hospital and Health System Association of Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                        pharmaceutical companies\n\n       Merck.\n       Smith Kline Beecham Pharmaceuticals.\n       Zenecca Inc.\n       Wyeth-Lederle Vaccines and Pediatrics.\n\n\n                               businesses\n\n       American Airlines.\n       American Association of Health Plans.\n       American Greetings.\n       Avon.\n       Community Health Resources, Inc.\n       Ford.\n       National Pharmaceutical Association.\n       Phoenix Healthcare Corporation.\n\n\n                        academic health centers\n\n       Association of American Medical Colleges.\n       Charles R.

There can be no doubt that Dr. Satcher is \neminently qualified to be Surgeon General. He has spearheaded \nsuccessful public health improvements at each stage of his career. As \ndirector of the Centers for Disease Control, he lead four important \nadvancements in public health which distinguished his tenure there.\n  Under his leadership, childhood immunization rates have risen to a \nrecord 78 percent. Vaccines have become more affordable and vaccine-\npreventable childhood illnesses have fallen to the lowest level in \nhistory.\n  All states now participate in the special breast and cervical cancer \nscreening program due to Dr. Satcher's leadership. When he became CDC \ndirector in 1993, only 18 states were participating in this program. In \nalmost two-thirds of the nation, women were excluded from this early \noutreach and cancer detection program. Today, more than one million \nwomen are receiving cancer screening tests and 21,000 cases of \ntreatable cervical cancer have been identified. This is the result of \nDr. Satcher's leadership.\n  Further, he led the development of a comprehensive strategy to combat \ninfectious diseases. Recent outbreaks of e. coli and other bacterial \ninfections, as well as the reemergence of malaria and cholera, have \nraised national awareness. Dr. Satcher brought networks of physicians \nand clinics together to monitor emerging diseases and formed an \ninnovative seven-state surveillance program.\n  Finally, Dr. Satcher also developed an early warning system to \nrespond to outbreaks of food-borne illnesses. Food safety is clearly \none of our nation's most important issues, particularly so given the \nincreasing globalization of trade. As more imported foods products find \ntheir way to Americans' dinner tables, having a strong food safety \nsystems in place will be vital. Thankfully, the early warning system \nestablished by Dr. Satcher was in place last year to catch salmonella \ncontaminated alfalfa sprouts and e. coli contaminated lettuce and apple \ncider which might have caused a public health tragedy.\n  These are just four examples of improvements in public health Dr. \nSatcher has achieved during his tenure as CDC director. These are the \ntypes of results and initiatives that Dr. Satcher would continue to \nwork towards in his role as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary of \nHealth.\n  Concerns have been raised during this debate about Dr. Satcher's \nlimited involvement in controversial HIV/AIDS studies in Africa, Asia, \nand the Caribbean. I share many of these concerns and wrote to the \nPresident in this regard in April of last year. Subsequently, I \ndiscussed these concerns at length with Dr. Satcher and others in the \nscientific community. They advised me that, useful medical research and \nclinical trials in developing countries often pose special challenges. \nThe resources available to people of developing worlds are not \ncomparable to resources available to individuals in this country. Even \nthough I strongly disagree with their conclusions, I understand \nscientists' belief that we may need to balance our research standards \nin this country with the public health needs in developing nations.\n  This issue poses a debate concerning medical ethics which is yet \nunresolved in the scientific community. We can certainly not expect to \nresolve it with this nomination process. Dr. Satcher's position on \nthese studies is not central to whether he would serve the nation well \nas Surgeon General. We can have the professional disagreement over the \nmerits of the HIV studies, but the defining question should be whether \nthis individual, is qualified for the challenges of the position. I \nbelieve unequivocally, that Dr. Satcher has that ability, the \nexperience, and commitment to be an excellent Surgeon General.\n  It is reasonable for many of us to have various disagreements with \nnominees for executive branch posts. This ability to voice opposition \nand debate ideas is what makes our democracy great. At the end of the \nday, however, reason should prevail. The President has done the country \na service by nominating such an outstanding candidate. Dr. Satcher is \nqualified to be Surgeon General and would be the first family physician \nto hold the post. What better person to be the nation's doctor? I hope \nthat my colleagues will join me in supporting his confirmation.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I have observed the debate over the \nnomination of Dr. David Satcher over the past couple weeks. It has been \na very productive, yet intense, discussion which has raised some \ncritical questions.\n  Today, there is an unmistakable need for a capable individual to fill \nthe position of United States Surgeon General--a position which has \nbeen vacant for over three years. Marked increases in smoking and \nsubstance abuse by our nation's youth, combined with the continuing \nplague of disease such as heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and others, \nhave made it imperative for the nation to have access to advice that is \nboth scientifically accurate and trustworthy.\n  The person who occupies the Surgeon General's Office is our Nation's \nnumber one doctor and public health leader. Kids around the country \nwill seek and heed the advice of the Surgeon General, and for this \nreason alone, thorough scrutiny of Dr. Satcher's qualifications and \nviews is well-placed.\n\n[[Page S537]]\n\n  Dr. Satcher has proven that he is an effective leader. Under Dr. \nSatcher's direction of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \nchild immunization rates have increased from 52 percent to a record 78 \npercent. As a result, vaccine-preventable childhood diseases are at \nrecord lows. Dr. Satcher also has led CDC's efforts to strengthen our \nnation's defenses against infectious diseases and food-borne illnesses. \nThese are just a couple of significant results that have been achieved \nunder Dr. Satcher's guidance.\n  Despite Dr. Satcher's remarkable credentials and achievements, there \nhave been some questions raised by my colleagues concerning his \npositions on partial-birth abortion and gun control. I have known and \nworked with Dr. Satcher on numerous occasions, especially in the area \nof birth defects prevention. In fact, I just met with him last week to \ndiscuss these grave concerns that have arisen since his nomination. Dr. \nSatcher has personally assured me that he will rely on science, instead \nof politics, to influence his decisions--thereby preserving the \nindependence of the Office of the Surgeon General.\n  Let me make it clear. I will continue the battle to ban partial-birth \nabortion, and have consistently voted to prohibit federal funds for \nabortion. In addition, I have consistently fought efforts to restrict \nthe ability of law-abiding citizens to purchase and own firearms.\n  Dr. Satcher has exemplified the utmost dedication, ability, and \nprofessionalism throughout his distinguished career. I am satisfied \nthat he will continue to operate in this manner as Surgeon General of \nthe United States. We may not agree on all issues, but I have the \nutmost confidence in his character and ability to serve with \ndistinction. Dr. Satcher is a strong choice for this position, and I \nlook forward to witnessing Dr. Satcher's efforts to preserve the \nindependence of this office.\n  With an issue as important as our nation's health, which rises far \nabove partisan politics, I am confident that Dr. Satcher will serve \nAmerica well.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I do not doubt Dr. Satcher's competence as a \nphysician, scholar, and medical researcher. However, serious questions \non two important issues have arisen during Senate debate on his \nnomination to be U.S. Surgeon General.\n  I am concerned about Dr. Satcher's position on partial birth \nabortion. The vast majority of Americans (84 percent, according to a \n1996 Wirthlin poll), a majority of the Senate and U.S. House, and the \nAmerican Medical Association support banning partial birth abortion. \nFormer Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has said that there is ``no way \nto see partial birth abortion as a medical necessity * * *'' It is \nclear that Dr. Satcher's view on this controversial procedure is out of \nthe mainstream of public and medical opinion. Since Dr. Satcher is \napparently willing to subordinate mainstream medical judgment to \npolitics in this instance, I have concerns that he may do so on other \nimportant health issues as well.\n  I am also troubled that, as administrator of the Centers for Disease \nControl, Dr. Satcher approved a questionable medical research project \nin Africa and Asia. The researchers gave one group of HIV-infected \npregnant women placebos while another group received AZT, a drug known \nto decrease by 67 percent the probability that the unborn children \nwould be infected by the HIV virus. A September 18, 1997 editorial in \nthe New England Journal of Medicine concluded that this research was \n``unethical.''\n  The editorial explains that the reason the code of medical ethics is \nunambiguous with regard to the investigators' primary responsibility to \ncare for the human subjects of scientific testing ``is due to the \nstrong temptation to subordinate the subjects' welfare to the \nobjectives of the study.'' The editorial concludes that the ``research \ncommunity must redouble our commitment to the highest ethical \nstandards, no matter where the research is conducted.''\n  As the ``nation's doctor,'' the U.S. Surgeon General should embody \nthe highest professional and ethical standards. He or she should \nclearly reflect the views of a majority of Americans and the medical \ncommunity. Because Dr. Satcher's views on these two issues raise doubts \nin my mind--and because, after three years without a Surgeon General, \nit is unclear whether the position is necessary--I have decided to \nresolve my doubts against his confirmation. If the president strongly \nbelieves the country needs a Surgeon General, I am sure there are \nthousands of well-qualified candidates whose nominations would not \nraise these issues.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nexpress my frustration and concern with the opposition to the \nnomination of Dr. Satcher as the new Surgeon General and Assistant \nSecretary for Health. I will not reiterate what has been said here \ntoday about Dr. Satcher's outstanding credentials or his outstanding \nwork as head of the Centers for Disease Control. This has been well \ndocumented. I do not wish to lengthen the debate any more than \nnecessary. Dr. Satcher is an ideal candidate who should already be \nserving the American people as our Surgeon General.\n  I come here today to unmask some of my Colleagues who are attempting \nto further delay the nomination of Dr. Satcher to advance their own \npolitical agenda. They are not opposing him because his is not \nqualified, but rather because he stands with the President, and the \nSupreme Court in defense of a women's right to adequate medical care \nthat protects her life and health.\n  What my Colleagues on the other side are attempting to do is to ask a \nnominee for the position of Surgeon General to disregard the law and \nacceptable medical practice. This is what the debate is about.\n  I have heard and read other concerns expressed by opponents, but \ninterestingly enough these issues were not debated at any great length \nduring the Committee process. This would have been the opportunity to \nair these other issues or concerns. Instead they chose to block the \nnomination on the floor all because Dr. Satcher believes in protecting \nthe health and life of women. They are trying to do what they could not \nand would not do in the Labor and Human Resources Committee. They did \nnot have the votes.\n  I have listened to many of my Colleagues come to the floor as \nchampions of women's health care. I see bill after bill being \nintroduced in the Senate, all in the name of protecting or improving \nwomen's health. But, when it comes to really protecting women's health \nmany of these same Senators are silent or stand in direct conflict with \nwhat is good for women's health.\n  Women's health is not just about breast cancer or cardiovascular \ndisease. We all know that these are important women's health concerns \nand issues, but women's health also includes reproductive health. Dr. \nSatcher recognizes this fact and realizes the importance of standing \nfor women's health.\n  In addition to the reproductive health issues involved here today, I \nthink I should remind many of my Colleagues that we need a Surgeon \nGeneral and we need one now. The American people need someone who they \ncan trust and depend on as they try to negotiate through a more \ncomplicated and frustrating health care delivery system than any of us \never envisioned. We need someone who will talk to us about health care \nand access to health care, especially prevention services. While there \nis little consensus on what reforms or changes need to be made in the \nway our health care system currently delivers care, the one thing that \nwe all can agree on is consumers need more information that speaks to \ntheir needs and concerns. It is no wonder so many of my constituents \nare concerned about the increasing role of non medical personal in \nmaking their health care decisions. Who else is out there talking to \nconsumers, besides insurance companies?\n  For those of you so concerned about women's health, keep in mind that \nwomen are the true health care consumers in most American families. \nThey pick the family doctor; they take care of the sick child; they \nmake the doctors appointments for the aging parent; and they worry the \nmost about lack of information available to make informed decisions.\n  Let's end this debate and move to vote on the nomination of an \noutstanding doctor to be our new Surgeon General. We all know that \nthere will be another day to debate the issues surrounding late term \nabortions. This has become an annual event so we do not need to delay \nthe nomination of Dr. Satcher simply to have yet another debate on late \nterm abortion.\n\n[[Page S538]]\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of Dr. David Satcher to the position of Surgeon General of \nthe United States. In my view, Dr. Satcher represents many of the \nproblems undercutting the moral fabric of American life. Too many, \nincluding myself, Dr. Satcher is outside the mainstream of public \nopinion.\n  I understand that Dr. Satcher is a remarkable man, with many years of \ndistinguished service as a doctor. My position on his nomination does \nnot stem from his history of service or his qualifications. Rather, my \nopposition comes from the ideals that Dr. Satcher represents. It is \nunfortunate that the office of the Surgeon General, America's family \ndoctor, has become politicized. Due to this increasing political role, \nDr. Satcher remains unfit to fulfill the position of Surgeon General. \nAs head of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Satcher's \nactions and decisions have wandered into the political arena time and \nagain.\n  Dr. Satcher has publicly supported the President's position on \npartial-birth abortion. His position is completely at odds with over \n80% of the American public and the America Medical Association. The AMA \nhas said that there is never any medical circumstance where this \nparticular procedure should be used to terminate a babies life. I find \nthe elitism and arrogance of Dr. Satcher on this issue completely \nirresponsible. When asked by the Labor and Human Resources Committee \nabout his support of the President's position, Dr. Satcher re-affirmed \nhis support for this procedure. I need not remind my colleagues the \ndescription of this outrageous procedure. Even Senator Daniel Patrick \nMoynihan, an abortion rights supporter, has termed this procedure \n``infanticide.'' Continued support for this barbaric procedure borders \non the ridiculous.\n  Dr. Satcher also has apparently adopted the opinions of his \npredecessor, Dr. Jocelyn Elders, on many sensitive cultural issues as \nwell. As head of the CDC, Dr. Satcher has endorsed the distribution of \ncondoms to our children in public schools. This is Dr. Satcher's way of \nteaching our kids how to deal with problems like teen pregnancy and \nAIDS. Mr. President, I must say I am appalled at this blatant attempt \nat undermining the concept of abstinence as the best form of disease \nprevention and birth control. Are we truly teaching children \nresponsibility by providing them with condoms in their classrooms?\n  Dr. Satcher also supports using tax-payer dollars to promote this \ndangerous agenda. In 1994, Dr. Satcher began an $800,000 national \nadvertising campaign aimed at out nation's youth promoting condom \nusage. This was all done in the name of AIDS prevention. I find this \negregious use of precious resources disturbing. By promoting condom \nusage, we are simply encouraging our children to become sexually \nactive. I understand the issue of responsibility, however, I have never \nheard the word abstinence associated with Dr. Satcher. To me, \nabstinence is truly the responsible way to prevent unwanted pregnancies \nand AIDS.\n  It is interesting to that note Dr. Satcher's view of responsibility \nis convenienent when it conforms with his political beliefs, when in \nreality his actions often appear to be irresponsible from both a moral \nand scientific point of view. I say this because much has been made \nrecently of Dr. Satcher's morally questionable African HIV study. As we \nhave all become aware, as head of the CDC, Dr. Satcher approved of \nresearch conducted in Africa and Asia that called for a groups of HIV \npositive pregnant women to receive placebos (sugar pills), without \ntheir knowledge, while others knowingly received valuable lifesaving \nmedication (AZT). Those receiving the placebo served as the control \ngroup and those receiving the medication the study group. All this, \ndespite the fact that it was known that AZT decreased by \\2/3\\ the \nlikelihood that the disease would be transmitted from the mother to the \nchild.\n  This experiment is both repulsive and morally questionable. It \nviolates every know protocol from the Hippocratic Oath to the Nuremberg \nCode and the Declaration of Helsinki which requires doctors to provide \nany and all lifesaving measures. The Declaration of Helsinki states: \n``In a medical study every patient--including those in a control group, \nif any, should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic \nmethod.'' Apparently, Dr. Satcher viewed his research outside \nestablished international ethical protocols.\n  A September 1997 New England Medical Journal of Medicine editorial, \nour most recognized medical journal in the United States, declared Dr. \nSatcher's actions unethical and likened the study to the Tuskegee \nIncident, where medication with known benefits was withheld from a \ncontrol group. Truly, this represents a dark day in American history. \nHowever, sadly, one we chose not to learn a lesson from.\n  In responding to the criticism, Dr. Satcher admitted that this human \nexperiment would not have taken place in the United States because all \nparticipants in any clinical trial must be given at least small amounts \nof AZT. He argued, however, that cost and efficiency dictated that the \nexperiment be done in developing countries. Did he really mean to imply \nthat those childrens' lives are any less of value than our own? As a \ngrandfather, I feel for those grandparents who lost grandchildren and \npotential grandchildren because of Dr. Satcher's experimentation.\n  I wish that this was the first and only time Dr. Satcher had promoted \nblind testing in regard to HIV. Sadly, it is not. Dr. Satcher has also \nendorsed anonymous testing of domestic newborns.\n  In 1988, the CDC began collecting anonymous blood samples from \nnewborn children right here in the United States. The results of these \nblood tests were subsequently withheld from the parents of the \nchildren. Mothers of newborns with HIV were sent home without being \ntold that their child was carrying a fatal disease. Because the results \nwere withheld, important life-sustaining treatment was denied.\n  When this blind testing became public, Dr. Satcher defended the CDC's \npractices saying the mothers would panic and ultimately leave their \nhealth system. These were life and death decisions made by Dr. Satcher. \nApparently, he did not appreciate that fact as much as he should have.\n  With the public enraged over these unethical tests, Congress quickly \nsprang into action. Representative Gary Ackerman introduced legislation \nto prohibit the continuation of the studies. In response to this \nlegislation, Dr. Satcher personally lobbied Representative Ackerman to \nabandon the bill. Fortunately, Representative Ackerman refused. The CDC \nwas eventually forced to abandon the blind testing due to public \noutcry. Now just imagine for just a second if you will, what would have \nhappened if the public had not become aware of the CDC's activities? \nHow many countless children would have been denied access to health \ncare.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Satcher's conduct in these cases was not only \ndisturbing, but horrifying. Essentially, depending on which group you \nwere in, Dr. Satcher was playing God. If anything is unethical, this \nmust be. Surely, this sort of behavior cannot and should not be \noverlooked by this Senate today.\n  If Dr. Satcher's questionable ethical conduct were not enough, the \nCDC, under Dr. Satcher, has been attempting to subvert our right to \nkeep and bear arms as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United \nStates. The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control (NCIPC) \nhas begun tracking gun-related injuries and turning the research over \nto anti-gun liberals with a political agenda. Now, I'm not exactly sure \nhow the NCIPC developed this authority. However, these activities \nconstitute nothing less than an all out political assault on the Second \nAmendment paid for by the American taxpayer.\n  The director of the NCIPC, Dr. Rosenberg, is a known anti-gun \ncrusader. He is on record equating gun ownership to cigarette usage. \nApparently, Dr. Rosenberg's, and presumably Dr. Satcher's, copy of the \nConstitution differ greatly from mine. My copy of the Constitution \ntalks openly about the right and the freedom to keep and bear arms. Dr. \nRosenberg has openly and repeatedly said that firearms are ``dirty, \ndeadly, and [should be] banned.'' All of this is done with the tacit \napproval of Dr. Satcher and at taxpayer expense. In fact the very \nagency Dr. Satcher wishes to head, the\n\n[[Page S539]]\n\nU.S. Public Health Service, has had since 1979 one of its primary goal \n``to reduce the number of handguns in private ownership,'' starting \nwith a 25% reduction by the end of this century. Unfortunately, not \nenough taxpayers are aware of how their money is being used to promote \nthis activist liberal agenda.\n  In responding to questions about the relevancy of the CDC's work on \ngun issues, Dr. Satcher predictably defended the agency saying that \nthose who were upset by its work should be more upset about the \nrelationship between firearms and injury. I can assure Dr. Satcher \nunequivocally, no one is more concerned about gun safety than gun \nowners. In defending the CDC's practice, Dr. Satcher failed to comment \non why the data, collected at taxpayer expense, is not being released \nto the public. Once again, it is ironic that responsibility has been \nconfused with truthfulness.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I would like to reiterate my opposition to \nDr. Satcher's nomination. The position of Surgeon General should be \nsomeone the American people can trust to advise them on important \nhealth issues. However, through his deeds and words, Dr. Satcher has \ndemonstrated again and again that his ethics must be questioned and \nthat he carries a biased politically driven agenda into a position that \nrequires non-partisan action. Is Dr. Satcher the man for the position \nof America's family doctor? I cannot and do not come to this \nconclusion. I would urge my colleagues to evaluate their positions \ncarefully before elevating someone with such a blatant and aggressive \npolitical agenda to such an esteemed position.\n  Thank you Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the allocation of time that \nremains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 7 minutes 49 seconds \nremaining. The opponents have 10 minutes 41 seconds remaining.\n  If neither side yields time, time will be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time again do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The proponents have 7 minutes 19 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know Senator Daschle wants to speak in \nfavor of the nominee, and there are only 7 minutes left. I will take \njust 2 minutes, and then I hope that those who are opposed to the \nnominee will take what time they need, and then the time-honored \ntradition is that those who are in support of the nominee are generally \naccorded the courtesy of the last response.\n  Mr. President, as we approach the vote, I want to point out that the \nvarious questions, allegations and charges that have been made to try \nto disqualify Dr. Satcher have been responded to, and none more \neloquently than by our friend and colleague, the chairman of the Health \nSubcommittee of the Human Resources Committee, Senator Frist.\n  I hope that those Members who have some questions in their mind have \nlistened very carefully to those responses, because I think they \naccurately respond to the various allegations and charges.\n  Finally, I just want to say that Dr. Satcher is uniquely well \nqualified. His life has been a life of service. He was one of 3 out of \n70 students who graduated from his high school to go on to college. He \ngraduated magna cum laude from his college. He was at the top of his \nclass at Case Western Reserve University where he pursued a medical \ndegree and a Ph.D.\n  Dr. Satcher is a respected family doctor, researcher, teacher, and \nadministrator, affiliated with some of the great universities of this \ncountry. He is an individual who has looked out for fairness and \ndecency in the service to families in this country. Dr. Satcher has a \nunique background and it is due to this background that every single \nhealth organization, without exception, has endorsed Dr. Satcher. Every \nsingle one of them has endorsed him. The past Secretary of HEW, the \nvery distinguished Dr. Louis Sullivan, has endorsed him as well.\n  We are very fortunate to have Dr. Satcher as a nominee. I commend the \nPresident and look forward to a vote of cloture so we can get on with \nthe business of getting him in place to serve the American public.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of endorsement of \nDr. Satcher from the head of the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy, Barry McCaffrey, and the Director of the National Institutes of \nHealth, Dr. Harold Varmus, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Committee on Labor and Human Resources,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: Dr. David Satcher's written response \n     to a question for the record from his confirmation hearing \n     clearly indicates that he supports the Administration's \n     needle exchange position. We do not have clear scientific \n     evidence to conclude that needle exchange programs do not \n     encourage drug use. His statements is fully consistent with \n     federal law which requires the Secretary of HHS to make two \n     science-based findings before lifting the ban on use of \n     federal funds for needle exchange programs. Specifically, the \n     Secretary must demonstrate that: (1) needle exchange programs \n     reduce the transmission of the HIV virus and (2) do not \n     encourage drug use.\n       Dr. Satcher has a distinguished background as the President \n     of Meharry Medical College for eleven years, as a faculty \n     member of the UCLA School of Medicine and the King/Drew \n     Medical Center in Los Angeles, and outstanding service as the \n     Director of the Centers for Disease Control since 1993. He is \n     eminently qualified to serve as the nation's Surgeon General. \n     Dr. Satcher will bring enormous expertise to bear on our \n     efforts to reduce drug abuse and its consequences in America.\n       I fully support Dr. Satcher's nomination for Surgeon \n     General.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Barry R. McCaffrey,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         Department of Health & Human Services, National \n           Institutes of Health,\n                             Bethesda, Maryland, February 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to support the \n     nomination of David Satcher, M.D., Ph.D., currently the \n     Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, \n     to be Surgeon General of the United States and Assistant \n     Secretary for Health in the Department of Health and Human \n     Services. Dr. Satcher is a medical scientist of outstanding \n     ability, a leader of great energy and vision, and a public \n     servant of the highest integrity.\n       As Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, Dr. Satcher has led the Federal Government's \n     primary programs for promoting health and preventing disease, \n     injury, and premature death. He has directed a revamping of \n     Federal efforts in AIDS prevention and led Federal actions to \n     revitalize our attack on emerging infectious diseases. Dr. \n     Satcher's accomplishments in his medical career, which has \n     included work in sickle cell research and family medicine at \n     King-Drew Medical Center in Los Angeles, earned him election \n     to the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of \n     Sciences as well as selection to receive the 1978 Watts \n     Grassroots Award for Community Leadership. His academic \n     career has included positions on the faculty of the Morehouse \n     School of Medicine and the King-Drew Medical Center and UCLA \n     School of Medicine. During a distinguished tenure as \n     president of Meharry Medical College from 1982 through 1993, \n     Dr. Satcher's leadership and public service were recognized \n     with the National Conference of Christians and Jews Award in \n     1985 and the ``Nashvillian of the Year'' Award in 1992. His \n     expertise and background, as well as the outstanding personal \n     qualities obvious to anyone fortunate enough to work closely \n     with him--as I have--qualify Dr. Satcher exceptionally well \n     to serve as Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary for \n     Health and to be the single, clear voice in communicating to \n     the Nation on issues that affect public health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Harold Varmus, M.D.,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Let me commend the distinguished senior Senator from \nMassachusetts for his summary comments with regard to the Satcher \nnomination. I don't think anyone could have said it more persuasively \nor more succinctly. As he noted, every single organization in this \ncountry with any standing, with any credibility in regard to health \ncare, has said this is an extraordinary individual, a leader in health \ncare.\n  The Senate ought to confirm him today. Nothing else really needs to \nbe said.\n\n[[Page S540]]\n\n  I commend the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership and his \nadvocacy of Dr. Satcher. I, secondly, join with all of my colleagues in \nsupporting very strongly the nomination today. I hope that we can pass \nhis nomination on an overwhelming vote, Republicans and Democrats, \ngiven the circumstances that we have now faced over the last 3 years.\n  We ought to be saying to the country, unequivocally: ``We need \nleadership in health care. We can no longer tolerate a void in that \nleadership by not having a Surgeon General in the United States of \nAmerica.'' That is what this is about, acknowledging that void, \nrecognizing the need for leadership, recognizing the need for a strong \nagenda in health care, spearheading efforts to place greater emphasis \non children's health, to intensify the youth antismoking campaign and \nthe array of responsibilities that the Surgeon General takes on as the \nNation's top public health advocate.\n  There shouldn't be any doubt about what this is all about. It is at \nlong last acknowledging the need for leadership, acknowledging the \ntremendous contribution Dr. Satcher has made in an array of different \nroles, especially in the Centers for Disease Control, and acknowledging \nthe opportunity that we now have to ask him to take on the nation's \nmost important public health role. I believe Dr. Satcher's nomination \ndeserves broad-based Republican and Democratic support.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that the people will listen to the words of \nSenator Kennedy, Senator Frist and others as they have so eloquently \nargued for his nomination over the last several days.\n  Mr. President, I fully support the nomination of Dr. David Satcher \nfor the dual position of U.S. Surgeon General and Assistant Secretary \nof Health. This nation is fortunate that a man of Dr. Satcher's \ndedication, vision and deep commitment to public service has agreed to \ntake on this important role.\n  Dr. Satcher has served the American people as a family practice \nphysician, an educator and an established leader in the public health \narena. During his tenure as the Director of the Centers for Disease \nControl, Dr. Satcher worked to strengthen the critical prevention link \nin the nation's public health structure. He tackled the national \nproblem of lagging childhood immunization rates, increasing the number \nof children immunized by nearly 25 percent.\n  This is an exceptional accomplishment. Under Dr. Satcher's \nleadership, we reduced by one-fourth the number of children at risk for \nimmunization-preventable diseases, some of them permanently disabling \nor fatal.\n  Dr. Satcher also spearheaded a highly successful program to provide \nbreast and cervical cancer screening to women throughout the nation, \nand launched an early warning system to detect and prevent food-borne \nillnesses such as e-coli.\n  I have received an unprecedented number of letters and calls in \nsupport of Dr. Satcher's nomination: physicians, nurses, hospital \nadministrators, public health organizations, individuals from my state \nand others. Clearly, Dr. Satcher is already recognized as a guiding \nforce in our health care system. I believe the nation can only benefit \nfrom asking him to serve as the nation's leading voice for public \nhealth, science and medical education.\n  In a recent letter, Dr. Satcher wrote: ``If I am confirmed by the \nSenate, I will work to ensure that every child has a healthy start in \nlife. I will encourage the American people to adopt healthy lifestyles, \nincluding physical activity and diet. And I will try to help the \nAmerican people make sense of a changing health care system, so they \ncan maximize their access to--and quality of--the health care they \nreceive.''\n  I believe Dr. Satcher's goals are on target. The nation will be well \nserved by a public health leader who can help us foster healthy \nlifestyles, a consumer advocate who recognizes that strengthening our \nhealth care system means empowering individuals to make informed \ndecisions about the care they receive.\n  I am confident that Dr. Satcher, a man of experience, integrity and \ninsight, will help us make these goals a reality. I hope that my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in confirming his \nnomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter I received from the Director of \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy, Barry McCaffrey, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Dr. David Satcher's written response to a \n     question for the record from his confirmation hearing clearly \n     indicates that he supports the Administration's needle \n     exchange position. We do not have clear scientific evidence \n     to conclude that needle exchange programs do not encourage \n     drug use. His statement is fully consistent with federal law \n     which requires the Secretary of HHS to make two science-based \n     findings before lifting the ban on use of federal funds for \n     needle exchange programs. Specifically, the Secretary must \n     demonstrate that: (1) needle exchange programs reduce the \n     transmission of the HIV virus and (2) do not encourage drug \n     use.\n       Dr. Satcher has a distinguished background as the President \n     of Meharry Medical College for eleven years, as a faculty \n     member of the UCLA School of Medicine and the King/Drew \n     Medical Center in Los Angeles, and outstanding service as the \n     Director of the Centers for Disease Control since 1993. He is \n     eminently qualified to serve as the nation's Surgeon General. \n     Dr. Satcher will bring enormous expertise to bear on our \n     efforts to reduce drug abuse and its consequences in America.\n       I fully support Dr. Satcher's nomination for Surgeon \n     General.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Barry R. McCaffrey,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, time is charged \nequally to both sides.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, would you please inform the Chamber of \nthe remaining time for each side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the proponents has expired; the \ntime remaining for the opponents is 8 minutes and 21 seconds.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Would the Chair please notify me when 2 minutes remain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to say to the U.S. Senate that \nthis responsibility which we are considering today is a very important \nresponsibility. The Nation's doctor is a very important position. We \nshould be very careful about doing those things which can and need to \nbe done in making sure we confirm appropriately or deny confirmation \nappropriately to someone nominated for that responsibility.\n  It is in that regard that I have sought to raise issues that are, I \nthink, fundamental to the values of the American people and ask serious \nquestions about them. I want to review those at this time.\n  The first thing I mention is that Dr. Satcher transmitted to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services a report favorably saying that \nsubstantial Federal funds should be committed both to providing needle \nexchange services and to expanding research into these programs. Both \nrecommendations, according to the CDC's comment, are reasonable and \nappropriate. That transmission saying that needle exchanges should have \nsubstantial funding was made in a report under Dr. Satcher's signature \ngoing to the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  It is pretty clear to me that one of the leadership responsibilities \nof the Surgeon General is the responsibility to inform the President or \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services of policies that ought to be \nadopted. This nominee has said that needle exchange programs ought to \nhave substantial Federal funding and they ought to be studied \ncarefully.\n  Now, in my view, it doesn't make sense to give dope addicts needles \nwith which to conduct their poisonous activity and with which to \npropagate bad habits of intravenous drug use. What are we saying to \nyoung people if the junkie comes along and says, ``Don't worry about \nthis, we have clean needles. The Government approves it. They give us \nthe needles to use.'' What are we saying to the families when the \nneedles from the junkies are left by the hundreds around the \nneighborhoods so that young children will find them? As soon as you \nprovide free needles--a\n\n[[Page S541]]\n\ntown that tried this found 300 discarded needles by junkies in one \nweek.\n  No. 2, this nominee for Surgeon General conducted studies on \nindividuals in Africa when the studies would have been unethical in the \nUnited States. The regulations provide that you are not allowed to do \nto other people what you won't and can't do to yourself. The New \nEngland Journal of Medicine made clear the absence of ethics in this \nsituation.\n  No. 3, David Satcher persisted in conducting blind HIV studies of \nnewborns in the United States, ignoring the need to identify the blood \nsamples and notify parents of HIV infections in children, even after \ntherapies were developed which could help those children in those \nsettings. When the Congress got upset about it and decided to \ndiscontinue the program altogether, Dr. Satcher said, ``No, we want to \ncontinue it without telling parents and without identifying which of \nthe children is HIV infected,'' and came and lobbied the Congress in \nthat respect.\n  I don't think that calls us to our highest and best. I think that \naccommodates America at something far less. So you have this pattern.\n  In addition, we have tried to get information from the Centers for \nDisease Control and Dr. Satcher. They have given us partial bits of \ninformation. The report in which the CDC commended the idea of Federal \nfunding for needle exchange was sent to us but it didn't have Dr. \nSatcher's cover letter on it--conveniently didn't. The denial of needle \nexchange support by Dr. Satcher conveniently didn't indicate that \nFederal funds, provided through the CDC, had the sole purpose of \npromoting needle exchange programs.\n\n  When we asked about the ethics of the African trials we simply didn't \nget all the information from the CDC. We were not given memos internal \nto the agency which we have received from other sources that have \nraised the very ethical issues in CDC by medical personnel there that \nwe have been raising on this floor.\n  Now if trust is a fundamental component of the relationship between \nthe doctor of a nation and the people of the Nation, there has been in \nsome substantial measure a breach of the necessary trust in the absence \nof candor and the absence of providing information in this setting.\n  Last but not least, let me say that Dr. Satcher has said that he \nsupports the President's position on partial-birth abortion. The \nPresident's position has been that he is going to continue to make it \navailable in this country and refuse to have a reasonable law which \nwould prevent it. In my judgment, it is time for us to say that we \nexpect the leadership on health in this country to comport with the \nunderstanding of the health community that partial-birth abortions are \nnot indicated, they are not necessary, and that to endorse the \npolitical agenda of the President rather than the health agenda of \nAmerica is inappropriate. This is about whether someone who is \nindifferent to infanticide can care for our children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that he has 2 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the time \nremaining be yielded to the chairman of the Senate Labor and Human \nResources Committee so that he has the custom of concluding the remarks \nin the Chamber in a way that is favorable to the nominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The chairman of the committee, the Senator \nfrom Vermont, is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first I want to thank my good friend for \nallowing me to do this.\n  Mr. President, this is one of the relatively few times in the Senate \nwhen we have had a cloture motion on a nomination.\n  I want to remind everyone of the fine, fine man that we are voting on \nhere today. I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture, and then to \nconfirm Dr. Satcher.\n  When we opened this debate last week, I stated that Dr. Satcher's \nrecord of service to the people of the United States was exemplary. I \nnoted that his character and integrity were absolutely without blemish. \nNothing has been said over the past two days that has challenged these \nassertions. Not even Dr. Satcher's critics question his professional \nqualifications to serve in the positions for which he has been \nnominated.\n  Senators Frist and Thompson, and others, have already spoken \neloquently about Dr. Satcher's commitment and integrity. They described \nthe unprecedented support Dr. Satcher enjoys within the medical \ncommunity, the public health community, and the research community. \nThey have also described firsthand their own experiences working with \nthe nominee to address public health issues in the State of Tennessee.\n  I wish to associate myself with their remarks and to urge my \ncolleagues to support Dr. Satcher's nomination. I know of no reason why \nwe should not vote for cloture, and then support Dr. Satcher.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time, if any.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S532-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLOTURE MOTION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, since the convening of this session of \nCongress 2 weeks ago today, I have spoken on the Senate Floor numerous \ntimes to convey the urgency of prompt action on the highway bill. We \nwere told that it would be among the first pieces of legislation \nconsidered this year, and yet the bill is still not before us. This \ninactivity is unjustified and, I think, it is inexcusable. The deadline \nfor passing highway reauthorization legislation is May 1--May 1 of this \nyear.\n  That deadline is set forth in the short-term highway bill that was \npassed last November before the Congress adjourned sine die. It is very \nclearly set forth in that legislation. After May 1, States will be \nprohibited from obligating any Federal highway or transit funds.\n  After that date, states will be prohibited from obligating any \nFederal highway or transit funds. As a result, many states will be \nforced to delay road and bridge projects and thousands of highway \nconstruction workers, as well as those in related industries, such as \ngravel and asphalt manufacturers, highway equipment manufacturers, and \nsteel suppliers, may begin to be laid off. At the height of the highway \nconstruction season, thousands of highway, bridge, and safety projects \nwill be stopped cold--dead in their tracks--and those who are employed \nin relation to these projects could begin to be sent home and lose \ntheir paychecks, while they await further action by Congress to enact \nhighway reauthorization legislation.\n\n  So the Senate has just 44 session days remaining, including today. \nThose are days we have been told that the Senate will be in session. So \nthere are just 44 session days, including today, remaining in which to \navert this impending crisis. When the hour strikes midnight on May 1, \nthe time is up.\n  I want to take a few minutes to explain exactly what this May 1 \ndeadline means to a number of the States.\n  The Road Information Program, TRIP, recently surveyed the State \ntransportation departments throughout the country to ascertain what \nwill happen after May 1 if a new highway bill has not been signed into \nlaw by the President by that time. To date, TRIP has received responses \nfrom 15 State transportation departments, and additional responses are \nexpected soon. Even with preliminary results, however, it is clear that \nbillions of dollars worth of highway projects and transit projects are \nin danger of being postponed, and will be postponed until new Federal \nfunding is available. These are critical transportation projects--\ncritical transportation projects--projects designed to improve road \nsafety and reduce the number and severity of highway crashes, to smooth \nthe flow of traffic so we can improve air quality and lower the \npollution that Americans breathe every day and every hour and every \nminute, and to reduce congestion so that Americans can spend more time \nat work and more time at home caring for their children, more time with \ntheir families and less time trapped in gridlock.\n  It may be edifying to my colleagues to hear some of the specific \nprojects in their States that will be delayed, according to their own \nState transportation departments, if new Federal highway funding is not \navailable beyond May 1. Remember, these are just the 15 States that \nhave responded already to the TRIP survey.\n  The Road Information Program asked each State to list some of the \nmost critical transportation projects that would have to be postponed \nduring the 12-month period beginning May 1, 1998, if no new Federal \nfunding is available.\n  And so let us go down the list. The very first State that is on the \nlist is the State of Georgia.\n  In Georgia, the State transportation department will have to delay: \nImprovements to I-475 from I-75 in Bibb County to I-75 in Monroe \nCounty; improvements to the Harry S. Truman Parkway in Chatham County; \nwork on the Jefferson Bypass in Jefferson County; and improvements to \nPeachtree Industrial Boulevard in Gwinnett County.\n  The Indiana transportation department will have to postpone: \nrehabilitating I-69 in Dekalb County; road and bridge rehabilitation on \nI-465 in Marion County; and bridge rehabilitation on US 20 in St. \nJoseph County.\n  In Kentucky, funds will dry up after May 1 for projects to: widen US \n27 to four lanes from Lexington to Paris; reconstruct the Donaldson \nRoad interchange on I-75 in Boone County; and replace the Cumberland \nRiver Bridge in Somerset.\n  Now, the Senators from these respective States, I am sure, are \ntalking with their highway departments. Those Senators will probably \nhave more complete lists than these that I am reading. But these are \njust the first 15 that have been supplied to me by TRIP.\n\n[[Page S543]]\n\n  In Maine, delays will occur on: The rehabilitation of the Carlton \nBridge on US Route 1 in Bath; the reconstruction of 4 miles of Route 9 \nin Devereaux; and the replacement of the Penobscot River Bridge on \nRoute 11 in Medway.\n  The Missouri transportation department will have to postpone, I am \ntold: the replacement or rehabilitation of seven bridges on I-70 in the \nSt. Louis area; plans to add left turn lanes on Route 61 at Lemay Woods \nin St. Louis to improve traffic safety; the widening and resurfacing of \nRoute 39 in Barry County; and the replacement of two bridges over the \nNorth Fabius River on Route 136 in Scotland County.\n  In Nevada, they will have to delay plans to: widen I-15 from two to \nthree lanes in West Las Vegas; remove and replace pavement on I-80 in \nReno; and widen US 95 to four lanes in Las Vegas.\n  In New Hampshire, our failure to enact a highway bill by May 1 will \nmean the transportation department has to postpone: reconstructing exit \n20 on I-93 in Tilton; safety improvements planned for I-93 in \nManchester; and replacing a bridge over North Branch River in Stoddard.\n  In North Dakota, congressional inaction will mean the postponement of \nplans to: reconstruct South Washington Street in Grand Forks; improve \nI-94 from Eagles Nest to Geck; and widen US 52 from Drake to Harvey.\n  The Oklahoma transportation department will have to shelve plans for: \ninterchange reconstruction and resurfacing on I-35 in Oklahoma City, a \nproject designed to relieve congestion; widening 50 miles of US 183 \nfrom Cordell to Snyder in western Oklahoma to provide four lane access \nto I-40, designed to foster economic development in the region; and \nbuilding shoulders and a passing lane on US 283 in Beckham County to \nimprove highway safety.\n  In South Dakota, failure to meet the May 1 funding deadline will mean \nthe delay of plans to: reconstruct I-29 in Minnehaha and Moody \nCounties; improve Benson Road in Sioux Falls to provide access to the \nJoe Ross Field Airport; and improve the interchange at the Haines \nAvenue exit on I-90 in Rapids City.\n  The Texas Department of Transportation reports that the following \nprojects scheduled for Spring 1999--all designed to relieve \ncongestion--would be delayed without new Federal funding beyond May 1: \nwidening to eight lanes a 4.3 mile section of Route 1960 in Harris \nCounty; widening to eight lanes a 3.9 mile section in Fort Bend County; \nand widening to four lanes a 6 mile section of US 67 in Johnson County.\n  In Utah, the following projects--all related to preparations for the \n2002 Winter Olympic Games--would be delayed: The reconstruction of the \nKimball and Silver Creek Junctions on I-80; the construction of the 1.5 \nmile Winter Sports Road; and the reconstruction of the interchange at \nI-84 and US 89.\n  In Vermont, our inaction will mean delay in the planned resurfacing \nof 200 miles of State highways; the rehabilitation or replacement of \nthree State highway system bridges and five local highway system \nbridges; as well as the reconstruction of four miles of US 7 in \nShelburne and South Burlington to increase capacity and improve traffic \nflow.\n  In my State of West Virginia, the lack of new Federal highway funds \nafter May 1 would mean postponement of the renovation of the \nShepherdstown Bridge on West Virginia 480 in Jefferson County; the \nwidening of a segment of West Virginia 2 in Ohio County to improve \ntraffic flow--by the way, it was on Route 2 that my former colleague in \nthe Senate, Senator Jennings Randolph, and I had an accident in 1957--\n1957 or 1958. We had an accident in that county. We ran head on into \nanother automobile, killing the driver of the other automobile. That \nwas Route 2. So we are talking here about the widening of the segment \nof West Virginia 2 in Ohio County to improve traffic flow, and the \nreplacement of the Easley Bridge in Princeton, Mercer County. Mercer \nCounty, that is where I first started school in a little two-room \nschoolhouse over 70 years ago.\n  And finally, in Wyoming, the Senate's failure to act by May 1 would \nmean delaying reconstruction and bridge work on I-80 in Rock Springs, \nRawlins, and Laramie Marginalal; as well as widening and rehabilitation \nprojects on I-90 from Buffalo to Gillette and from Moorcroft to \nSundance.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge Senators to call their transportation \ndepartments, if they have not already, and find out what a prolonged \ndelay in Federal highway funds would mean for their States. The list I \nhave just read is, obviously, not exhaustive; but it is indicative of \nthe serious problems every State, or almost every State certainly will \nface if Congress does not act before midnight May 1. When Senators \nstart to realize what this May 1 deadline means for their States, and \nhow few days we have left to move a highway bill through the Senate, it \nshould become obvious that we will have no choice but to bring up the \nhighway reauthorization bill.\n  We have just 44 days, 44 session days. That does not count days like \nSaturdays and Sundays or other days when the Senate is not expected to \nbe in session. Only 44 session days, including today, remain through \nthe hour of midnight May 1. After that hour of midnight, then those \nStates can obligate Federal aid highway program funds for any Federal \nhighway project, after the hour of midnight on May 1. Now, that is by \nlaw. That was a part of the law that Congress passed last November when \nit enacted the short-term highway bill. It is in there. Bridge \nreplacements, traffic decongestion projects, and road widening efforts \nall mean safety, time, money and jobs to our people. Further delay \nmakes no sense. A commitment was made to bring up the highway bill \nafter the President's State of the Union speech. The State of the Union \nspeech has come and gone and there is still no highway bill here in the \nSenate. Further delay makes no sense and the Senate should consider the \nhighway bill promptly.\n\n  How much time remains, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 13 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield that remaining time to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts. I thank the Chair, I thank all \nSenators, and again thank the leader for making possible the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent notwithstanding \nthe previous order for the Senate to stand in recess at the hour of \n12:30, that I may be permitted to speak for up to 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S542-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S543-S546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CURRENT SITUATION IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concerns about \nUnited States policy with regard to Iraq. Through the national and \ninternational news media and in consultations with members of Congress, \nwe have been told time and again in the past several weeks that the \nUnited States is on the brink of waging a limited but significant \nmilitary strike against Iraq and Saddam Hussein.\n  At the same time, Administration officials and President Clinton have \nalso repeatedly stated they are hopeful for a diplomatic solution.\n  It would appear, however, that Saddam Hussein despite almost frantic \nrevolving-door diplomatic efforts from Russia, China, France, Turkey \nand others, will not agree to the resumption of full and open U.N. \ninspections. So, we have a standoff.\n  Mr. President, in regard to this latest crisis in the Gulf, I commend \nto the attention of my colleagues the remarks made yesterday by the \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel. His remarks are both \nthoughtful and thought provoking and they come from a man who is a \nveteran with a most distinguished record.\n\n  Senator Hagel said this:\n       This dilemma must be approached from the framework of both \n     our short-term and long-term foreign policy objectives. We \n     cannot allow Saddam Hussein to stampede us into precipitous \n     action.\n       What chain of events will we unleash with any action we \n     take? What is the Administration's long-term objective in \n     Iraq? Do we have one? Or, are we crafting a long term policy \n     to justify short-term actions?\n\n  Senator Hagel went on to say he was disturbed about reports over the \nweekend quoting high ranking Administration officials and Congressional \nleaders saying such things as:\n\n[[Page S544]]\n\n  ``We may have to face the reality that we will not get U.N. \ninspection teams back into Iraq;\n  ``Any military action would be to just slow Saddam Hussein down;\n  ``We have to keep going back to bomb him again;\n  ``Our allies support of us in Iraq may be tied to our future \ncommitment to NATO'' and other such disconcerting remarks.\n  Senator Hagel concluded by saying we owe it to our country and the \nmen and women in uniform who will be called upon to fight a war to do \nbetter than just bomb Saddam Hussein.\n  He said:\n\n       That is not good enough. There is something surreal about \n     all of the war talk, and war preparation played out in this \n     `matter of fact' tone on international TV with every talk \n     show host panelist presenting his or her theories and options \n     when most of them have never been to war, prepared for war or \n     understand the first thing about the horrors of war.\n       There are no good options. Saddam Hussein has and is intent \n     on building the most vile weapons in the history of man, \n     weapons outlawed by nearly every country in the world. He \n     cannot go unchallenged.\n       But, the American people and the Congress must have a more \n     solid basis for our support. Whatever action is taken, it \n     must meet a clear and immediate objective. We cannot continue \n     to ricochet from crisis to crisis and call that foreign \n     policy.\n\n  Mr. President, that is straight talk and I commend Senator Hagel for \nhis candor and forthrightness.\n  And, Senator Hagel is right. The policy discussions regarding Iraq \nhave indeed been unique, if not bizarre. We have seen more policy \ndeclarations, more redefined policy declarations, and more mixed \nsignals than a coach signaling his quarterback with the time clock \nrunning out. That may well be part of diplomatic carrot and stick \nefforts but it certainly does not improve public understanding or \nprovide confidence for a well defined and successful military mission.\n\n  The latest comments by Administration officials indicate the attack \nis now only weeks away although there has been considerable speculation \nthat the U.S. would not attack while the Winter Olympics are being \nheld. The United States is a signatory to a U.N. resolution that calls \non all countries to honor a cease fire during the Olympic Games. \nInternational Olympic Games President, Juan Antonio Samaranch has made \na public appeal to the United States.\n  I do not mean to be disrespectful but it occurs to me that a previous \nU.S. President canceled U.S. participation in the Olympics in response \nto one country invading another. This time we apparently will attack, \nbut not while the Olympics are being held.\n  In addition, while our strongest Arab ally in the Gulf War, Saudi \nArabia, has refused the use of their country from which to base an \nattack, they have expressed strongly that any military strike should be \nwell over before the beginning of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and \nMedina that is the high point of the Islamic year. The Olympics are \nover February 23 and the pilgrimage begins March 20.\n  Such are the rather unique things that military planners must factor \ninto their planning in this modern world of limited and political \nmilitary strikes.\n  Saddam Hussein doubtlessly can pretty much figure out when the strike \nis coming: all he has to do is read the latest Time magazine for the \nlatest target and battle plan information and the London Times for the \nIraqi sites at risk not to mention many other press reports.\n  It goes without saying, this will be no surprise attack.\n  Nevertheless, additional time will at least afford us the opportunity \nto take a hard look at what is being proposed, especially as Senator \nHagel has stressed in regard to how a limited strike will fit into long \nterm foreign policy goals and the law of unintended consequences.\n  First, I recommend to my colleagues and the American public the \ncomments made by the Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Richard Russell of Georgia almost 30 years ago to the date. The \nSenator made his remarks in the midst of the Vietnam war and during the \nmonth in which the United States suffered over 2,000 casualties. He \nsaid this:\n  ``I for one am not afraid of the old fashioned term, victory. We hear \na great deal about limited wars, but I would point out that there is no \nsuch thing as a limit on actual combat in which our men are engaged. \nWhile it is a sound policy to have limited objectives, we should not \nexpose our men to unnecessary hazards to life and limb in pursuing \nthem.\n  The Senator went on to make the following pledge:\n\n       As for me, my fellow Americans, I shall never knowingly \n     support a policy of sending even a single American boy \n     overseas to risk his life in combat unless the entire \n     civilian population and wealth of our country--all that we \n     have and all that we are--is to bear a commensurate \n     responsibility in giving him the fullest support and \n     protection of which we are capable.\n       It is inconsistent with our history, traditions and \n     fundamental principles to commit American boys on far-flung \n     battlefields if we are to follow policies that deny them full \n     support because we are afraid of increasing the risk of those \n     who stay at home.\n       It is a confession of moral weakness on the part of this \n     country not to take any steps that are necessary to fully \n     diminish the fighting power of our enemies.\n\n  I submit, Mr. President, that is a most powerful statement of truth \nthat has direct application to the challenges we face today in the \nPersian Gulf. The only thing that has changed is that today we refer to \nAmerican men and American women.\n  The question must be asked, just where are we in regard to specific \ngoals regarding Iraq? Last week, in a press conference with Prime \nMinister Blair of Great Britain, President Clinton ``clarified'' \nAdministration policy. He said the goal of the proposed attack on Iraq \nwould be to, ``substantially reduce or delay Iraq's ability to develop \nand use weapons of mass destruction.''\n  The President also ruled out the removal of Saddam Hussein from power \nor action designed to compel him to halt obstruction of disarmament \ninspectors from the U.N.\n  The President went on to say, ``I don't believe we need to get into a \ndirect war with Iraq over the leadership of the country. Do I think the \ncountry would be better served if it had a different leader? Of course \nI do. That's not the issue.''\n  In making this statement, the President has clearly narrowed the \ngoals of the proposed air strike. In fact, in my opinion, he has \nnarrowed them from the goals articulated in previous speeches by key \nadministration officials and from the goals outlined in consultation \nwith Members of Congress.\n  Secretary of State Albright, in a speech given last year emphasized \nthe American strategy was to continue the sanctions until there was a \nsuccessor regime. The President stated sanctions would continue ``until \nthe end of time or as long as he lasts.'' That strategy was changed \nhowever to one of trying to accommodate Saddam with what was described \nas ``small carrots.'' It was the ``small carrot'' strategy that many \nobservers now say led to the current crisis.\n  Just last week, members of Congress were told there were two specific \ngoals:\n  First, to set back Saddam Hussein's ability to deploy and deliver \nweapons of mass destruction and,\n  Second, to preserve the ability of the U.N. Security Council to \nrespond to the threat of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \nby enforcing the disarmament resolutions that ended the 199l Persian \nGulf war, specifically in regard to unrestricted access for weapons \ninspectors.\n  Now, with all due respect to the President and his national security \nadvisers, I am concerned the first mission may have a very limited \nsuccess at considerable risk to our men and women in uniform and for \nall intent and purpose, end whatever possibility there is for achieving \nthe second mission. The bombing may not destroy Saddam's capacity to \ndeploy and deliver weapons of mass destruction but it is almost a sure \nbet bombing Saddam will NOT bring about open inspections.\n  This is especially significant in that the current resolution of \nsupport being crafted by our Senate leadership has been premised on \nU.N. Security Council Resolution 687 and four subsequent resolutions \ndemanding open inspections by the U.N. inspection team. The language \nmirrors the statement of the distinguished Democratic Leader, Senator \nDaschle who stated last week:\n\n       The end game is simply to allow access by U.N. inspectors \n     into all locations suspected to be the manufacturing \n     facilities for biological weapons. I don't know what could be \n     more clear than that.\n\n\n[[Page S545]]\n\n\n  The Democratic Leader's statement is, in fact, clear and direct. The \nproblem, however, is that there is a follow on goal articulated in the \nresolution draft and it says:\n  We urge the President, in consultation with the Congress, and \nconsistent with the U.S. Constitution and existing laws, to take all \nnecessary and appropriate action to respond effectively to the threat \nposed by Iraq's refusal to allow inspection.\n  The question is will the bombing be effective? It may set back \nSaddam's capability to deploy and deliver biological weapons and it may \nnot. But one thing for sure, after a week of bombing, there will be no \nwelcome mats for U.N. inspectors.\n  In addition the resolution draft urges the president to work with \nCongress to further a long-term policy.\n  My colleagues it has not taken long to discover that we do not have \nthe support of our allies, that we do not have a long-term strategy and \nthat if we go ahead with the limited military strike we will \neffectively end chances for open inspection, which is precisely the \noriginal stated goal of the administration and the stated goal of the \ndraft resolution of support.\n  Now, in making these remarks, I realize the current challenge posed \nby Saddam Hussein is both difficult and complex and that the situation \nin the Gulf and our relations with the members of the Gulf Coalition \nallies has dramatically changed.\n  The President stated, ``I don't believe we need to re-fight the Gulf \nwar. It's history. It happened. That's the way it is.''\n  The President is right. The way it was is not the way it is and we \nhave been frantically trying to play catch up in efforts to formulate a \nsuccessful response to Saddam's latest threat.\n  Nevertheless, Administration officials state today we have Saddam in \na box. To the contrary, after repeated efforts to ``lead'' and convince \nour allies in supporting the planned military action, I do not see much \n``following'' and I wonder who has whom in a box.\n  It seems to me there are several obvious disconnects:\n  First, other than Saddam simply behaving like the international thug \nthat he is, we are told his primary reason for closing down the \ninspections is to somehow force an end to the economic sanctions now in \nplace, that the deprivation now experienced in his country is such that \nhis continued rule is threatened.\n  It is true that most of his 22 million people are going through \nsevere deprivation. But, this is the man who has a 90,000 strong \nsecurity force made up of well trained, dedicated, fanatical \nprofessional units that have maintained a climate of terror. To the \nextent one can be, he is both bomb and assassination proof and simply \ngets rid of his opposition even to the extent of using weapons of mass \ndestruction upon his own people.\n  The argument is also being posed that with France, Russia and China \nall opposing military action, and his Arab neighbors sitting on the \nfence, the United States might then be willing to lift the sanctions or \nat least increase the oil for food and medicine program. But, the \nUnited States already proposed increasing the oil for food program and \nSaddam refused it. And, he has used oil revenue to further construct \nthe many palaces that now house his weapons. In any case, this \nexplanation of his reasoning, if true, represents a good argument \nagainst a military strike.\n  In a paradox of enormous irony, it could be argued that by \nwithstanding and suffering through the attack and exploiting the \nobvious propaganda opportunity, Saddam may actually gain sympathy and \nsupport for ending the sanctions from the very nations we are asking \nfor help!\n  Second, what if Saddam's primary reason for shutting the door to U.N. \ninspectors was simply self preservation, not from within but from Iran? \nIn fact, it was the attack from Iran several months ago that \nprecipitated the crisis. Saddam, without his weapons of mass \ndestruction and Iran with that capability and with a growing army \nrepresents a self preservation crisis for Saddam.\n\n  A military strike against Saddam further weakens Iraq in relation to \ntheir long standing enemy. Have we thought through what the Mideast \nwill look like when Iran has the balance of power?\n  Third, in proposing military action, we do not have the support of \nthe members of the Security Council whose credibility and effectiveness \nin enforcing open inspection we are trying to protect! We do not even \nhave Security Council or allied support for the continuation of \nsanctions.\n  So much for a rational prospective U.N. policy with reference to \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  France wants to sell Iraqi oil, China wants to buy it and Russia \ndesperately needs the money that Iraq owes to Russia. All three do not \nsupport military action and have warned of dire consequences should \nmilitary action be taken.\n  While trying to broker a diplomatic solution (Lets see, how about \neight palaces open for inspection for 60 days with x number of \ninspectors from this country and y number of diplomats from that \ncountry and on and on) France is worried that American bombs plus Iraqi \ncasualties will only consolidate domestic support for Saddam and that \nthe bombing does not represent a long term answer. They have a point.\n  The Chinese foreign minister, speaking on television, said China is \nextremely and definitely opposed to the use of military force because \nit will result in a tremendous amount of human casualties and create \nmore turmoil in the region and could even cause more conflict.\n  However, the winner of the Coalition Cross Current Sweepstakes has to \nbe Russia. Foreign Minister Primakov has seized an opportunity to climb \nback on the world stage as the self declared pro Muslim broker while \nBoris Yeltsin's comment that bombing could mean ``world war'' could \nwell have been made while pounding his shoe on a lectern. But, the Iraq \nissue did not stop there. Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader stated \nthe Russian Duma should not ratify the START II treaty and said \nAmericans ``act like drunk cowboys.'' The ultra nationalist Vladmir \nZhirinovsky called for Yeltsin to put Russian troops in Southwest \nRussia on alert. Moderate members of the Russian Duma have argued the \nUnited States must get U.N. authorization before any attack. We cannot \nsimply dismiss this sorry state of affairs as just Russian bluff and \nbluster.\n  To say that these landmark changes in policy amongst our former \ncoalition allies will have grave consequences is an understatement to \nsay the least.\n  Fourth, we do not have the support of the Arab nations whose \nsovereignty and freedom were are allegedly trying to protect! With the \nexception of Kuwait, no Arab nation has endorsed American threats of \nmilitary action.\n  Saudi Arabia, our closest Arab ally and a major regional power \nprovided a crucial base for 500,000 American and allied troops that \nrouted Iraqi forces back in 199l. Today, Saudi Arabia has refused to \nsupport a military strike upon Saddam Hussein and Secretary of Defense \nCohen and the Commander of U.S. Forces in the Middle East, General \nAnthony Zinni have been forced to change battle plans.\n  The Saudi's stance also undercuts political support throughout the \nArab world sensitive to the view that the United States has already \nexcessively punished the Iraqi people and that the limited attack will \nnot rid the Gulf region of Saddam and that he will remain as vengeful \nas ever.\n\n  In proposing limited strikes, the United States is in the position \ncomparable to local law enforcement asking a witness to testify against \nthe Mafia with no promise of incarceration or protection. Those chances \nare slim and none.\n  Like other staunch allies during the Gulf war, Turkey is now putting \nits own interests first regarding any confrontation with Saddam. Their \nforeign minister has also been one of the revolving door diplomats \ntrying to broker a solution. Seen in the rest of the Muslim world as a \npawn of the United States, having suffered economic losses as a result \nof the Gulf war, and having to fight Kurdish rebels, the Turks have \nalso refused the use of air bases.\n  There is no doubt that most leaders in the Muslim world would like to \nbe rid of Saddam Hussein. They view him as a menace. But, the political \nreality is that limited bombing with no plan for getting rid of the \nmenace will lead\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\nto the perception of the United States conducting a military exercise \nwith innocent civilians being killed on world wide television with \nominous repercussions throughout the Muslim world . . . including the \ntrouble spots of Bosnia and in Indonesia.\n  Our policy has also made Israel more than a little nervous. Israeli \nleaders have stated they reserve the right for self protection and will \nact in accordance with their defense interests. Once again, we are \ntrying to convince Israel to forgo its right to self defense and \nretaliation. A retaliatory attack upon Israel in response to U.S. \nbombing may be unlikely but it cannot be ruled out. Such a missile \nexchange would have devastating consequences.\n  Fifth, as a result of Arab denial to use our bases in their \ncountries, the United States must now launch any attack from aircraft \nlocated in neighboring gulf states, from aircraft carriers and from an \nIndian ocean island. The USS Independence was supposed to be \ndecommissioned this coming September but now, the oldest ship in the \nfleet, is in the Gulf.\n  This renewed buildup of sea and air forces in the Gulf and the \ncorresponding manpower and equipment gaps in Europe and the Pacific is \nanother example of just how stressed and stretched our U.S. military \nhas become, all in the wake of substantial troop cuts and rising \ncommitments to various peacemaking and nation-building missions such as \nBosnia. We are already experiencing serious problems in regard to \nreadiness, modernization, procurement and military quality of life.\n  If we sustain a three carrier force in the Gulf, it will mean zero \npresence somewhere else. Yet, Navy command has mapped out plans for two \ncarrier presence through 1999. Our Air Force is not structured as a \nmobile expeditionary force. Accustomed to operating out of large bases, \nthe new operations and personnel tempo has caused serious retention \nproblems.\n  The obvious budget, military readiness, national security and foreign \npolicy repercussions will be far reaching. Without question we cannot \nfund this current buildup and prospective military strike from within \nthe current defense budget. If this is, in fact, an emergency requiring \na military strike, then it should be funded by an emergency \nsupplemental bill.\n  I must ask, has enough consideration been given to the collective \nrisks that could well outweigh whatever benefit a limited military \nstrike might bring?\n  Can we really ascertain the extent of Saddam's air and missile \ndefense?\n  Can we, with any degree of certainty effectively target and destroy \nhis most deadly weapons and eliminate the threat?\n  Do we have adequate protection for the men and women who will conduct \nthe operation? Personnel recovery? POW recovery?\n  Can this strike destroy most of Saddam's deployment and delivery \ncapability?\n  Will this action end all chances of further inspection? If this is \ntrue, what happens next when his capability is restored?\n  Will this strike hurt or improve his support within and without his \ncountry?\n  Will the strike prevent Saddam from counter-attacking and using \nweapons of mass destruction?\n  Will Iran attack a weakened Iraq?\n  What will be the response of the Muslim nations throughout the world?\n  How will the attack change Saddam's conduct?\n  Are our forces adequately equipped and protected against biological \nand chemical agents?\n  Have we considered the possibility of terrorist activities both in \nthe Mideast and in the United States?\n  There is almost no end to these kind of questions and there is no \nquestion that the President's national security team and Pentagon \nplanners have studied all of these questions and more with great care \nand purpose. `\n  I can say as a member of the Armed Services and Intelligence \nCommittees, I have great faith and a sense of personal pride and trust \nin our military and in our intelligence community. But, I also know \nthat too often in the past military action has been rooted in misguided \npolicy and our military has suffered the consequences.\n  The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shelton, has \nalready found it necessary to refute allegations that the battle plan \nand targets in Iran have been drafted and selected by the executive as \nopposed to warfighters, a charge that harkens back to the limited and \npolitical decision making in the Vietnam war. There is no question that \nour military will obey their Commander in Chief and will do an \nexemplary job, no matter what the mission. That is how it should be and \nis. Nevertheless, I would be less than candid if I did not say judging \nfrom the private commentary from many within the military and public \nquestions from those with expertise in military tactics and national \nsecurity that this proposed strike may well be flawed and \ncounterproductive.\n  Administration spokesmen have stated that this strike will attempt to \ndestroy as much of Saddam Hussein's capability to deploy and deliver \nchemical and biological weapons as possible: not the actual material \nmind you, but the delivery means. But, we will not be able to destroy \nall of that delivery means.\n  So, at the end of the attack, at the end of the day, when all is said \nand done, with civilian and military casualties, Saddam will still be \nin power, his scientists will still be at work, his military and the \nRepublican Guard still deployed, some of his weapons of mass \ndestruction and their delivery means will still be intact. It strains \ncredibility that there will be any chance of inspections. In a year or \ntwo we may have to do it all over again.\n  In the meantime, we will have a continued erosion of faith and \nconfidence with our allies, anti-American sentiment throughout the \nMuslim world, and the horrors of war on international television \ncourtesy of Saddam Hussein. If our bombing does not kill innocent \ncivilians, then Saddam will.\n  This is not some kind of impersonal therapy to correct Saddam's \nbehavior we are contemplating. Too often we refuse to recognize the \nreality and horrors of war. In this regard, there is a pretty good \ntest.

Mr. President, I serve on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee and I note, last night an attempt was made on the life of \nPresident Eduard Shevardnadze of The Republic of Georgia by assailants \nwho have yet to be identified. President Shevardnadze survived the \nattack without injury. Unfortunately several members of his personal \nsecurity detail were killed, and number of others were wounded.\n\n  The Republic of Georgia is one of the key linchpins of the new \nEurasia. It is the most democratic of all of the states that succeeded \nthe Soviet Union. Under President Shevardnadze's inspired leadership a \ncivil war has been put to rest, criminals have been jailed, private \narmies have been disarmed, and economic decline has been reversed. In \n1997, Georgia's economy grew by nearly 8 percent, inflation was held in \ncheck and the Georgian currency remained rock solid. Democracy has \nflourished. Indeed, if democracy is allowed to fail in Georgia, it is \nunlikely to succeed anywhere in the region.\n  Any attempt to kill Shevardnadze must be seen in those context. It is \nan attempt to derail a successful democratic process, and an effort to \ncompromise the growing number of U.S. economic and strategic interests \nin Georgia and the region.\n  According to Georgian authorities, the attempted assassination was \nwell-planned and well-executed by as many as 30 well-trained \nassailants. They were armed with rocket propelled grenades and \nautomatic weapons. The Georgians are asking, as we must ask: How could \na group this size operate undetected in the capital of Georgia? Where \ndid they receive arms and ammunition? Who trained them? Where did they \ndisappear to in the aftermath? And most importantly: Whose interests do \nthey represent?\n  Georgian authorities make it clear that they suspect outside powers \nof this attempt on the life of their president. They are not alone. \nAzerbaijan's president Aliyev was also the object of an assassination \nattempt in recent days, which Azerbaijani authorities believe was \nplanned and executed by outsiders. We should be mindful that these two \ncowardly acts may be part of a plan to destabilize the Caucasus with \nthe intention of scaring off American and other investors who seek to \nbring the Caspian's great energy wealth west to international markets.\n  Who benefits from promoting instability in the Southern Caucasus at \nthis time? Russia is everyone's leading candidate as the outside power \nwith the most to gain. Russia has long raged and conspired to thwart \nCaspian energy from flowing any direction but north through Russia. \nMost parts of Russia's political elite still view Caspian wealth as \ntheir own. The suspected perpetrator of an earlier assassination \nattempt on Shevardnadze remains under Russian care despite vociferous \ndemands from Georgia that he be extradited. Russia still has bases in \nGeorgia from which yesterday's attack could be planned and staged. None \nof this is proof of Russian complicity, but the strong suspicion of \nRussian involvement will not go away quickly.\n  The U.S. Government should make every effort to learn the truth. More \nthan this, we must articulate in clear and forceful terms to those \noutside powers who might be tempted to destabilize the Caucasus some \nsimple truths:\n  First, the United States has vital interests in the Caucasus which \nthese attacks threaten.\n  Second, our support for President Shevardnadze and the other \nCaucasian leaders is unbending.\n  Third, we will do everything we can to facilitate democracy and free \nmarkets in the region.\n  Fourth, oil and gas will flow west.\n  And finally, we must make it painfully evident that outside states \nthat seek to destabilize America's friends in the Caucasus are not \nstates we will favor with political and economic aid and other forms of \nassistance.\n  The attempt to kill President Shevardnadze, one of America's most \nvalued friends, is intolerable and will have consequences.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, lately, there has been a lot of talk \nabout Chief Justice Rehnquist's ``Year End Report on the Federal \nJudiciary.'' As chairman of the Sucommittee on Administrative Oversight \nand the Courts, I have an added interest in what the Chief Justice has \nto say. According to some, the Chief Justice's report indicates that \nthe federal judiciary suffers from a partisan produced ``vacancy \ncrisis.'' Indeed, some critics have gone so far as to feverishly \nconclude that the Senate's Constitutionally mandated confirmation \nprocess has become an ``obstruction of justice.'' Caught up in this \nfrenzy, some Democrats have come to the Senate Floor blaming many, if \nnot all, of the judiciary's problems on vacancies. Vacancies, however, \nare not the source of the problem.\n  Despite assertions to the contrary, the Chief Justice could not have \nbeen more clear on this point: Vacancies are the consequence of what he \nperceives to be an overburdened judiciary. In fact, the Chief Justice \npointed out that it is the judiciary's increased size and expanded \njurisdiction that is the major threat to justice in the United States. \nIn his Report, Chief Justice Rehnquist warned that the federal \njudiciary had become ``so large'' that it was losing ``its traditional \ncharacter as a distinctive judicial forum of limited jurisdiction.''\n  Mr. President, in addition to what the Chief Justice said about the \nsize of the judiciary has become ``so large'' that it was losing ``its \ntraditional character as a distinctive judicial forum of limited \njurisdiction,'' I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article by Chief Judge Harvie Wilkinson III of our Circuit Court of \nAppeals entitled ``We Don't Need More Federal Judges.''\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 9, 1998]\n\n                   We Don't Need More Federal Judges\n\n                      (By J. Harvie Wilkinson III)\n\n       The tune is so familiar that most federal court watchers \n     can whistle it in their sleep. Add more and more judges to \n     the federal bench, goes the refrain, and all will be well.\n       Well, Congress has been adding judges for years now, and \n     somehow each new addition never seems to be enough. The trend \n     has been dramatic. At midcentury, the number of authorized \n     federal judgeships stood at approximately 280. Today, the \n     number of authorized judgeships is 846. And the process shows \n     no signs of abating. The Judicial Conference of the U.S. has \n     asked Congress for 17 additional judgeships for the 13 \n     circuits on the U.S. Court of Appeals--12 permanent \n     judgeships and five ``temporaries.'' Under the conference's \n     proposal, the Ninth Circuit alone would increase to 37 \n     judgeships from the already unwieldy 28.\n       The federal judiciary is caught in a spiral of expansion \n     that must stop. With growth in judgeships comes growth in \n     federal jurisdiction. And with the expansion of federal \n     jurisdiction comes the need for additional federal judges to \n     keep pace. Whether the growth in judges precedes the growth \n     in jurisdiction or vice versa is anybody's guess. The one \n     follows the other as the night follows the day.\n       The process of growth has not been a carefully examined \n     one. Rather, it is fueled by a mechanical formula that \n     presupposes that every increase in case filings must be met \n     not with judicial efficiencies or jurisdictional restrictions \n     but with additional battalions of judges. The Judicial \n     Conference has come up with a benchmark of 500 filings per \n     three-judge panel for requesting an additional judgeship on \n     the appellate courts.\n       Nobody knows precisely what is the basis for the 500 figure \n     except that it is a nice round number; not so long ago the \n     magic unit was 255. While the figure is intended to be used \n     in conjunction with other assessments, it remains the major \n     factor and the one on which a request for additional \n     judgeships is presumptively justified.\n       To be sure, there are some hard-pressed courts where the \n     workload makes it imperative that new judges come on board. \n     But adding judges to the federal courts is no long-range \n     answer. In fact, the consequences of this silent revolution \n     in the size of the judiciary could not be more serious.\n       Growth in the federal judiciary has three main costs. The \n     first is that of simple inefficiency. Large circuit courts of \n     appeals present problems that small ones don't have. There \n     are more internal conflicts in circuit law. These must be \n     resolved by more en banc hearings of the full court. If the \n     en banc court consists, for example, of 20 judges as opposed \n     to 12 it takes twice the time even to get the decision out. \n     Judges on a large court\n\n[[Page S548]]\n\n     must also spend more time simply keeping abreast of the work \n     of other panels--time that cannot be spent resolving their \n     own cases.\n       The second cost is that of litigiousness. With a smaller \n     court of appeals, the possible panel combinations of three \n     judges are less numerous and the law is more coherent. Legal \n     principles are discernible and judicial outcomes are \n     predictable. As a court grows, so do the possible panel \n     combinations, and the law becomes fuzzier and less distinct. \n     Litigation takes on the properties of a game of chance and \n     litigants are encouraged to come to court for their roll of \n     the dice. When legal outcomes are uncertain, cases are \n     brought for their settlement value and parties lack clear \n     guideposts for their conduct out of court.\n       The third cost of judicial growth is that of intrusiveness. \n     The number of life-tenured federal judges now exceeds the \n     membership of Congress. The outpouring of federal law from \n     this expanding establishment touches every local issue and \n     affects every public official. Local disputes are tossed into \n     federal court on the assumption that there will always be \n     plenty of federal judges around to resolve them. In the end, \n     unrestricted growth in the federal judiciary threatens to \n     upset the federal-state balance just as much as uncontrolled \n     growth in the federal budget would. With more federal judges \n     will come more federal rulings, and with more federal rulings \n     will come more opportunities for federal judicial \n     intervention into even the smallest of controversies in our \n     classrooms, our workplaces, our prisons, our zoning boards, \n     our city council chambers and the like.\n       Congress must preserve an independent judiciary without \n     sanctioning an intrusive one. It can strike this balance by \n     imposing a ceiling on judicial growth and setting limits \n     beyond which the size of the federal judiciary may not \n     expand. A numerical cap would strike a historical blow for \n     limited government. But it would have other advantages also. \n     It would allow each party to fill judicial vacancies but only \n     up to the point of the numerical limit. A cap would force \n     Congress to think about what is, and what is not, the proper \n     business of the federal courts.\n       As for the judiciary, a cap would force courts to adopt \n     innovative management techniques. In the Fourth Circuit, we \n     have established a sophisticated tracking system that \n     requires straightforward appeals to be resolved promptly and \n     inexpensively. This step would not have been taken if we had \n     assumed that the addition of new judges was the solution to \n     our problems.\n       The alternative to a cap is a federal judiciary that, at \n     the current pace of growth, will number more than 2,000 well \n     before the middle of the next century. Judge Jon Newman, a \n     Carter appointee to the Second Circuit, and Judge Robert \n     Parker, a Clinton appointee to the Fifth Circuit, have spoken \n     eloquently of the threat that judicial growth poses to the \n     collegial functioning of appellate courts, to the stability \n     of legal precedent and to the historic regional \n     characteristics of the federal judicial system. Indeed, if \n     the courts of appeals become much larger, the temptation will \n     be to break them up into smaller and more parochial units. \n     With this development, we shall have surrendered a national \n     and regional perspective on American law.\n       I have heard it said that those who favor a cap on growth \n     are nothing more than elitists supporting a small and \n     exclusive club. The truth is just the opposite. The real \n     elitists are those who would deprive the American people of \n     the right to determine their own destiny and would lodge \n     their collective fate in an overgrown federal judicial \n     establishment. Federal courts play an important role in the \n     protection of a uniform law and our fundamental liberties. \n     But with unrestricted growth it will become an all-important \n     role. I cannot imagine a more unhealthy development for our \n     society.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in order to reverse this trend, the \nreport resoundly concluded that Congress needed to reduce the \njurisdiction of the federal courts.\n  In the last Congress, the Republican leadership wisely pushed for \nmeasures designed to reduce the federal workload. Both the \nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act and the Prison Litigation \nReform Act ``streamlined'' procedures so as to decrease the number of \npotential federal court filings. These measures were praised by the \nChief Justice as ``promising examples of how Congress can reduce the \ndisparity between resources and workload in the federal judiciary \nwithout endangering its distinctive character.''\n  Similarly, a bill I sponsored, The Federal Courts Improvement Act of \n1996, included a provision that raised the threshold for diversity \njurisdiction cases. It's estimated this provision alone reduced the \nfederal workload by as many as 10,000 filings per year.\n  In addition to what had been a continually expanding jurisdiction, \nthe judiciary's increasing case filings was also a result, in large \nmeasure, from the policies and practices of the current Administration. \nOver the last year, the Executive Branch alone increased its number of \ncivil filings by 23%. This increase, in addition to the increase \nresulting from expanded federal jurisdiction, accounted for the total \noverall increase in the number of civil filings in 1997.\n  The policies and practices of the President have also crippled the \ncriminal justice system. President Clinton has yet to present even a \nsingle nominee to fill the six vacancies on the seven seat Sentencing \nCommission. As a result, the Commission is ``seriously hindered'' in \npursuing its important statutory functions, making it more likely that \ncriminals may ``beat the system.''\n  The Ninth Circuit probably suffers the most from President Clinton's \nindifference to the judiciary's plight. The President sent up only six \nnominees to fill 10 vacant seats on the Ninth Circuit. One nominee has \nalready withdrawn from consideration, leaving only four nominees to \nfill over one-third of the Circuit's total seats. To our credit, the \nSenate also just confirmed one of these nominees to this court a few \ndays ago who had only been pending for a few months. Having solid \nqualifications and bi-partisan support, the Senate confirmation of \nBarry Silverman illustrates what we Republicans have long maintained. \nWhenever nominees can demonstrate that they follow the law as stated by \nthe Constitution or enacted by Congress, rather than making up laws as \nthey see fit, the Senate is prepared to expedite their nominations.\n  By the latest count, there are around 83 vacant seats on the federal \njudiciary. When Democratic Senators controlled the confirmation process \nin 1991 and 1992, there were 148 and 118 vacancies respectively. Why \nwasn't the other side talking about a judicial crisis then? No one \nblamed the shortcomings of the judiciary on vacancies then, but now \nthat Republicans control the confirmation process, 83 vacancies have \nall of a sudden become a ``judicial crisis.'' Taking into consideration \nthe fact that there are 42 more judges sitting on the bench today than \nfive years ago, 83 vacancies is not such an ominous figure as some \nwould have us believe.\n  Today, the Senate is working hard to confirm qualified nominees, but \nremains hard-pressed to fill those 83 judgeships when President Clinton \nhas so far made only 42 nominations, which is just slightly over half \nof the number needed. The difficulty is only exacerbated by the \nPresident's refusal to offer new candidates after his nominees have \nbeen properly rejected by the Senate.\n  The case of a nominee from Texas provides an excellent example. Both \nTexas Senators steadfastly rejected his nomination. Traditionally, and \nunder Senator Biden's former chairmanship, when even one Home State \nSenator disapproves of a nomination, the nomination is effectively \nrejected. President Clinton, however, continues to press for this \nflawed nominee, despite the fact that other more qualified nominees \ncould immediately replace him.\n  These examples illustrate how some are trying to manipulate the \nvacancy issue in order to steer the public away from the real problems \nfacing the federal judiciary. Put simply, the Chief Justice believes \nthe judiciary's expanded jurisdiction and consequent workload is too \nlarge and needs to be cut back. Why aren't the demagogues who keep \nrepeating the Chief Justice's point about vacancies also talking about \nhis points of reducing jurisdiction as well as the overall number of \njudges? It's simple. They are being selective, because they don't agree \nwith the Chief Justice's major arguments. They want to continually \nexpand federal jurisdiction, and continually expand the number of \njudges.\n  I agree with the Chief Justice that we should attempt to process \nqualified nominees in a timely manner and then have a vote. Of course \nsome of the nominees we have been getting are not qualified or are \nflawed in some way.\n  But, at the same time, Congress should refrain from expanding the \noverall size of the federal judiciary. As chairman of the Subcommittee \non Administrative Oversight and the Courts, I have been conducting a \nreview of the nation's judgeship needs. I hope to have this review \ncompleted by this summer. Although it may be true that additional \njudges are needed in some areas, it is also the case that judgeships \nshould be reduced or at least not filled in other jurisdictions.\n\n[[Page S549]]\n\n  A number of these 83 judgeships are not even needed. For instance, in \nthe Judiciary Committee we have already made the case that the 12th \nseat in the D.C. Circuit should not be filled. We have had chief judges \nin other courts testify that they don't need seats in their courts \nfilled. This further undermines the argument that there is some kind of \na vacancy crisis. As a matter of fact, three of these vacant seats were \ncreated in 1990 and have never been filled. If they were so necessary, \nwhy didn't a Democrat-controlled Senate fill them in the four years it \nhad to do it? I think the answer is self-explanatory, Mr. President. \nThose who charge that Republicans are practicing partisan politics \nagainst Clinton nominees are the same crowd that brought partisan \npolitics to an art form against Reagan and Bush nominees.\n  Mr. President, I intend to speak on this matter more as we continue \nto consider nominees and debate the issue of judicial vacancies \nfurther.

MASSIAH-JACKSON, OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO BE \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Frederica A. Massiah-\nJackson, of Pennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong concerns \nwith respect to President Clinton's nominee to be a U.S. district court \njudge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania--Judge Frederica \nMassiah-Jackson. I voted for this nominee in committee, but on the \nbasis of information that has been presented to the committee since \nJudge Massiah-Jackson's hearing, I now have serious reservations about \nher nomination.\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson, who currently serves as a State court trial \njudge in Philadelphia, was nominated by President Clinton on July 31, \n1997, to serve in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The Judiciary \nCommittee received her completed paperwork on August 15 and began \nprocessing her nomination around mid-September. The committee began, in \nbipartisan fashion, to review what available information there was on \nher background, her qualifications, and her experience.\n  The committee's assessment of that information was directed from the \noutset to serious allegations that were leveled against Judge Massiah-\nJackson. In particular, the committee's bipartisan investigative team \nfollowed up on allegations that Judge Massiah-Jackson was biased \nagainst law enforcement, that she was unduly lenient in sentencing \ncareer criminal offenders, and that she lacks proper judicial \ntemperament, as shown with her use of profanity while sitting on the \nbench.\n  Despite attempts to investigate seriously these allegations, no one \nwas willing to come forward publicly during the initial investigation \nwith specific and credible evidence or information showing a general \nbias against law enforcement. In fact, Judge Massiah-Jackson, when \nconfronted with this allegation, had denied having such a bias.\n  I was particularly troubled by a newspaper account reporting that \nJudge Massiah-Jackson had identified two undercover officers in open \ncourt and warned the spectators to watch out for them. No one, however, \ncame forward to substantiate those charges.\n  But the committee's investigation did unearth some very troubling \ninformation. Judge Massiah-Jackson herself admitted to using profanity \nat least once while sitting as a judge--she admitted to cursing at a \nprosecutor in open court; it was not pleasant, and the profanity was \nnot incidental profanity--but she expressed contrition about that \nevent. Indeed, she promised the committee that, if confirmed, she would \nact appropriately as a Federal district judge.\n  Now, I take charges of intemperance from the bench seriously. Judges, \nby their very position, must remain above the fray. They must, by their \ndemeanor and comportment, preside with dignity over their courtrooms \nand set an example for the attorneys and witnesses to follow. \nNevertheless, as a former litigator, I know that in the rough and \ntumble world of courtroom advocacy that sometimes things can get a bit \nout of hand. That at least places such untoward remarks in some kind of \ncontext. Judge Massiah-Jackson assured the committee that she would \nconduct herself in an appropriate manner in the future, and that such \nmistakes as had occurred were early in her tenure on the bench and that \nshe would never allow that to happen again.\n\n  The committee's investigation also confirmed that Judge Massiah-\nJackson's sentences, while not grossly out of line with those imposed \nby other State judges, were indeed very lenient on average.\n  By the time the committee held a hearing on Judge Massiah-Jackson, it \nwas clear to me that she had exercised questionable judgment in a \nnumber of cases, that she was softer on crime than I would wish a \nFederal judge to be, and that there were some serious questions about \nher ability to preside over a courtroom with the level of decorum that \nour citizens have the right to expect.\n  It was clear to me, in a word, that Judge Massiah-Jackson would never \nbe my nominee to the Federal bench. But the Constitution does not vest \njudicial appointment authority in the Senate. She is President \nClinton's nominee. I have never viewed my advise-and-consent \nresponsibilities as an opportunity to second-guess whoever is the \nPresident--so long as he sends us nominees who are well qualified to \nserve and whose views, while perhaps not my own, reflect a commitment \nto uphold the Constitution and abide by the rule of law.\n  For that reason, I anticipated that the nominee's responses during \nher hearing would be extremely important to my own vote. To my mind, \nthose responses would determine whether there was reason to expect that \nJudge Massiah-Jackson could yet be a credit to the Federal bench.\n  During her hearing, Judge Massiah-Jackson was questioned extensively \nabout her sentencing record in various cases, she was asked about \ncharges she was antiprosecution, and she was asked to explain the \nincident in which she had cursed at prosecutors.\n  After the hearing, members of the committee posed further questions \nin writing, to which she responded.\n  In a nutshell, Judge Massiah-Jackson again apologized for her use of \nprofanity in the courtroom and she made every effort to persuade us she \nhas the highest respect for law enforcement and for the difficult job \nthat police officers have to do in our country.\n  Of particular significance to me, Judge Massiah-Jackson expressly \ndisputed the published press report that indicated she had used her job \nas a State judge to expose the identities of undercover police \nofficers--in open court, I might add--and to warn the spectators \nagainst them. In response to a written question from Senator Thurmond, \nshe flatly denied that such an event had occurred.\n  On the faith of those assurances and the assurances of those who knew \nher and know her, and while reviewing the issue very closely, I voted \nwith a majority of my colleagues to report her nomination favorably out \nof the committee.\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\n  I am disappointed to say that with the benefit of hindsight, \ninformation has emerged since the Judiciary Committee held its hearings \non this particular nominee of President Clinton that strongly suggests \nto me that she was somewhat less than candid with the committee.\n  In addition, since the committee's vote, the committee has been \nvirtually deluged with letters from prosecutors and law enforcement \nagencies in Pennsylvania that document a disturbing pattern of open \nhostility toward the law enforcement communities. These condemnations \nhave been bipartisan and, in some respects, overwhelming. The \nPennsylvania District Attorney's Association, as well as the \nPhiladelphia District Attorney, have come out in opposition to Massiah-\nJackson, as have the Pennsylvania Attorney General, the Fraternal Order \nof Police and the National Association of Police Officers. That is \npretty extraordinary. I don't know of any other case where that really \nhas happened, although there may be one or more, even in my experience, \nbut I don't remember any. Moreover, the committee has now received more \ndetails about particular rulings by Judge Massiah-Jackson that evidence \nan inability to deal with law enforcement issues fairly.\n  First, let me address Judge Massiah-Jackson's possible lack of candor \nwith the Judiciary Committee. During the committee's bipartisan \ninvestigation, Judge Massiah-Jackson was questioned about an article \nthat appeared in the local Philadelphia newspaper in 1988 which stated \nthat she had told spectators in the courtroom to take a good look at \nthe undercover officers who are witnesses in the case and to watch \nthemselves. She was asked whether the circumstances described in the \narticle were true. Judge Massiah-Jackson told committee staff she does \nnot recall the incident, but that she did not understand the concern \nabout ``outing'' the officers if they had already testified. \nThereafter, the committee faxed a copy of the article to Judge Massiah-\nJackson and asked her to write a letter and comment about the \nallegations mentioned within the article. Later, the committee received \na letter from the nominee that failed to make mention of the incident \nwith the undercover police officers.\n  Later, at her hearing before the committee, Judge Massiah-Jackson was \nquestioned again about her alleged comments about the undercover police \nofficers. Unfortunately, Judge Massiah-Jackson failed to answer the \nquestions directly and instead she indicated that she respected the \nrole of law enforcement officers.\n  Dissatisfied by her answers both to the written questions and to the \nquestions at the hearing, Senator Thurmond sent the nominee a follow-up \nquestion directly asking her to explain her statement to courtroom \nspectators to ``take a good look at the undercover officers and watch \nyourselves.'' In her written response, the nominee categorically denied \never having made the statement. Her written answer back to the \ncommittee was as follows: ``I have read the 1988 article and it is \ninaccurate. I would not and did not make any such statement to the \nspectators. I have great respect for law enforcement officers who have \nvery difficult jobs and work in dangerous situations.''\n\n  In the wake of recent developments, however, committee staff, in a \nbipartisan investigation, was able to interview the two police officers \nwho were mentioned in the news article. Those officers provided written \nstatements to the committee that refute Judge Massiah-Jackson's \nrepresentations and corroborate the newspaper story. Both Sergeant \nRodriguez and his partner, Detective Terrace Jones, an African \nAmerican, felt that the judge's statement jeopardized their lives if \nany of the people in the courtroom were friends, family or associates \nof persons with whom they might negotiate drug buys in the course of \ntheir undercover work.\n  Although I was more than willing to credit Judge Massiah-Jackson's \ndenial of the newspaper account, in the face of statements by the two \nofficers and the newspaper story, her denial now appears to be somewhat \nless credible.\n  I would also point out that Judge Massiah-Jackson unequivocally \ninformed the committee during her hearing and during questioning by \nSenator Specter she had never been reversed on a sentencing issue. This \nfact was important because of concerns that Judge Massiah-Jackson was \nparticularly bent on leniency in sentencing. In fact, nominees are \nroutinely asked, if they are presently judges, to provide the committee \nall of the cases on which they were reversed.\n  In response to the committee's request, Judge Massiah-Jackson \nidentified 14 cases in which she had been reversed. None involved a \nsentencing issue. When asked a second time in writing whether there \nwere any other cases in which she was reversed, Judge Massiah-Jackson \nreported one additional case. Once again, this case did not involve a \nsentencing issue.\n  Since her hearing, however, the committee itself discovered that \nJudge Massiah-Jackson's statement that she has never been reversed on a \nsentencing issue is inaccurate. In fact, to date, the committee has \nfound she has been reversed in at least two sentencing cases: \nCommonwealth v. Easterling and Commonwealth v. Williams. In both cases, \nJudge Massiah-Jackson imposed a sentence found to be too lenient by the \nappellate court.\n  In Easterling, the defendant pled guilty to burglary and criminal \nconspiracy. Despite a serious prior criminal history, including nine \nprior adult property convictions and two adult armed robbery \nconvictions, Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced the defendant to \nconcurrent terms of 11\\1/2\\ to 23 months imprisonment. Her sentence was \n3 years below the standard guidelines and 1 year below even the \nmitigated guidelines. The Supreme Court found that the downward \ndeparture was unreasonable and vacated the sentence.\n  In Williams, the defendant pled guilty to robbery and possession of \nan instrument of a crime. The defendant, in attempting to take the \nvictim's purse, viciously slashed the victim with a razor. Despite \nhaving a prior criminal history, Judge Massiah-Jackson again sentenced \nthe defendant to only 11\\1/2\\ to 23 months' imprisonment and then \nimmediately paroled him. The superior court again held that this \nsentence was unreasonable--it was substantially below the minimum \nsentencing guidelines which required a minimum of 4 to 7 years' \nimprisonment for robbery with a deadly weapon. In addition to finding \nthat Judge Massiah-Jackson had improperly lowered the defendant's \noffense gravity score, the superior court also found her refusal to \napply a deadly weapon enhancement to the razor was clearly erroneous. \nThe court vacated Judge Massiah-Jackson's unreasonable low sentence.\n  In addition to these reversals for illegal sentences, I would like to \nprovide an example of why I am so concerned about Judge Massiah-\nJackson's ability to weigh the facts fairly. Recently, the committee \nhas received numerous cases that were not previously provided by the \ncommittee. One of these cases, Commonwealth v. Smith, appears to be a \nparticularly egregious case, and I want to tell you about it so you may \nassess for yourself why this nominee is perceived as being unalterably \nhostile to crime fighting.\n  In the early evening of September 28, 1990, a 13-year-old boy was \ndragged into the bushes on the grounds of a Philadelphia hospital. The \nassailant raped and sodomized the boy, threatening to kill him. Despite \nthe fact that his face was slashed with a box cutter, the boy managed \nto escape from his assailant's clutches. Naked and bleeding, he told \ntwo female hospital employees who were passing by what had just \nhappened and that his attacker, a man, was still in the bushes. Shortly \nthereafter, hospital guards arrived and took the boy to the emergency \nroom for treatment.\n\n  The two women then saw a man crawling out of the bushes where the boy \nhad told them the attack had occurred. They made eye contact with the \nman from only 2 feet away. The man jumped to his feet and turned to \nwalk away from the crowd of security guards and bystanders.\n  One of the women informed the guards of the man's appearance. \nRemember, the two women, according to the court of appeals' decision, \nnever lost sight of the man until after he was apprehended by police \njust 2 minutes after they spotted him crawling out of the bushes where \nthe young boy said he was.\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\n  A Philadelphia police officer arrived on the scene within seconds of \nreceiving a police radio call of a ``rape in progress.'' The officer \nstopped the man and told him he was investigating a radio call of a \nrape. The man said that he had not raped anyone. When the security \nguards and witnesses told the officer that the man had just raped a \nyoung boy, the officer handcuffed him and put him in the back of his \npatrol car.\n  Moments later, another officer conducted a safety search of the man \nbefore placing him in a patrol wagon. He found a box-cutter knife like \nthe one used to cut the boy's face and a rag still wet with blood. The \ndefendant later confessed. Despite the overwhelming evidence in the \ncase, Judge Massiah-Jackson held that the police officer had no \nprobable cause to arrest the man. She suppressed the defendant's \nstatement, the box-cutting knife, the bloody rag and the out-of-court \nidentifications as the fruits of an illegal arrest. I am thankful to \nsay her ruling was appealed and reversed, but I am somewhat surprised \nPresident Clinton would still nominate this judge if he was aware of \nthis decision.\n  It has been noted that by some that, after the case was reversed, the \ncase was assigned to a new judge and the defendant was, I am told, \nacquitted. This is why it would be advisable to consider holding a \nhearing at which the nominee can explain her decision in this case. \nFrankly, notwithstanding the eventual verdict, I fail to see how one \ncould conclude that probable cause to arrest the defendant did not \nexist.\n  In recent weeks, the Judiciary Committee has received letters from \nvirtually every law enforcement office in the State of Pennsylvania and \nseveral national organizations voicing their opposition to President \nClinton's nominee. To date, we have received letters from the Attorney \nGeneral of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia National Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the National Association of Police Organizations, the \nPennsylvania District Attorneys Association, and letters by numerous \ndistrict attorneys around the State, including one from Lynn Abraham, \ndistrict attorney for Philadelphia, who I understand is a Democrat \nherself. All of these letters express opposition to this nominee's \nappointment because of her record of hostility to prosecutors, law \nenforcement and victims of crime.\n  Now, although it certainly would have been beneficial to the \ncommittee if we had this information before Judge Massiah-Jackson's \nhearing, we certainly cannot turn a blind eye to the facts. We ought to \njust make it clear that this committee, in a bipartisan way, takes \nthese judgeship nominations very seriously. We continue to investigate \nright up to the time of confirmation. We are not going to fail to look \nat matters when we think there may be some legitimacy to them, as may \nbe the case here.\n  Make no mistake, I take my floor vote on Judge Massiah-Jackson very \nseriously. When her candidacy was in the committee, I resolved my \nserious misgivings about her nomination in her favor, as I often do, if \nwe don't have people who are willing to appear before the committee, \nwilling to give statements that are substantiated rather than \nunsubstantiated and if the FBI matters also are unsubstantiated, \nregardless of the accusations. We see in the FBI reports all kinds of \naccusations from everybody, from responsible citizens to crazies, and \nwe have to look at those things in a bipartisan, decent, honorable way, \nsift through them, and do the best we can to arrive at the facts and to \nbe fair to the nominees.\n\n  While her candidacy was in the committee, like I say, I resolved \nthese serious misgivings I had in her favor because we do not--most of \nthe accusations, all of the accusations, by and large, were \nunsubstantiated. People were unwilling to come forward and to speak on \nthe record. I am not about to oppose a nominee and cast a shadow over \nhis or her career when all the Committee has to act on are anonymous \nsources. But now we have people who have been willing to come forward. \nI wish they had done so before. It would have helped the Committee \nstraighten out this matter.\n  My decision on the committee was based in large measure on the \nrepresentations made by the nominee herself, both in answer to the \nwritten questions and at her hearing. To the extent that these recent \ndevelopments called the nominee's statements before the committee under \nquestion--and they do--I am obliged to reconsider my vote. After \nreviewing and considering the information that has recently been \nprovided to the committee by law enforcement officers about her conduct \non the bench, her alleged bias against law enforcement, her flawed \njudicial rulings, and above all, her apparent lack of candor with the \ncommittee, I can't in good conscience, based on what is available to me \nnow, continue to give her the benefit of the doubt.\n  I have the highest personal regard for Senator Specter, who has ably \npromoted her candidacy, I believe, with the same understandings that I \nhave had up until now, but I have serious questions whether Judge \nMassiah-Jackson is fit for the Federal bench. Senators Specter and \nSantorum have suggested that she be given an opportunity to publicly \nrespond to these recent developments. As chairman of the committee, I \nhope that the Senate can accommodate their request. I am not sure that \nwe will at this point. But I hope that we will. I hope we can give her \na hearing. If we decide to have a hearing, I can hold a hearing. And I \nthink I would have the cooperation on the part of the minority in doing \nso.\n\n  Having said that, I also believe that some of my colleagues, who will \nspeak in opposition to the nominee, have a legitimate argument in \nurging the Senate to vote on this.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Clinton challenged the \nSenate to ``vote on the highly qualified nominees before you, up or \ndown.'' Since President Clinton's challenge, the Senate has voted to \nconfirm five judicial nominees. One judicial nominee has chosen to \nwithdraw. And Judge Massiah-Jackson's nomination is in serious question \ndue to concerns from the law enforcement community. Today, some of my \ncolleagues are eager to comply with President Clinton's request. And I \nhope that this year we will be a bit more expeditious in bringing \njudges up for votes on the floor. If Senators have objections to them, \nlet them raise them here. This is an appropriate place to do it. Above \nall, it is appropriate to raise them during the hearings that we hold \nin the Judiciary Committee. But they can also be raised here, and we \nface those objections if we are for or against these nominees as they \ncome up for a vote.\n  Mr. President, if I could just have one more sentence, I don't know \nwhether we will have another hearing or not. But I am certainly going \nto keep my options open on the subject and work with my colleagues from \nPennsylvania. I can't believe that all of these people who have \nsuddenly come forth as law enforcement people are not telling the \ntruth. Yet, I do have some information that Judge Massiah-Jackson may \nhave massaged some of the facts herself. And I am very concerned about \nthis. Frankly, I am going to look for guidance here on the floor from a \nwide variety of people. And let's just hope that we can do what is \nappropriate here under the circumstances.\n  I yield the floor at this time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from Utah will \nstay on the floor for a moment on this, I know there are a number of \nSenators, especially the two distinguished Senators from Pennsylvania, \nand others who wish to speak. I advise Senators that I am only going to \nhold the floor for a moment.\n  I would like to underscore something that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Utah said, which is that if this matter does not come to a vote in \nthe next couple of days and stays on the calendar during that time, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has the authority to \nhold further hearings, if he wishes to, even though the matter is here \npending on the calendar. It is something that can be done without the \ndirection one way or the other from the Senate as a body.\n  I would also note that the distinguished chairman and I have a long \npractice of discussing first privately issues of this nature that may \ncome up so that we can then report back to the individual Members on \nour side of the aisle where we are going. I know that the distinguished \nSenator from Utah would do that. I mention this only to say that I do \nnot want in any way to limit anyone's right to speak, but I will \nreserve any comments that I might make until after the time I have \ndiscussed this matter privately with\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\nthe Senator from Utah. I will certainly listen to the things that are \nsaid by other Senators on the floor. I want to note an agreement with \nwhat the Senator from Utah has said, which is, of course, that the \ncommittee has the right to hold further hearings while this matter is \npending before the Senate. It is not often done. But certainly it could \nbe.\n  Mr. President, I am about to suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nwill assure Senators that I will have no objection to having it called \noff in about 1 minute. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I see other Senators, including the \ndistinguished senior Senator from Pennsylvania, on the floor. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I think that there may well be an \nagreement on the basic course in this matter; that is, to have another \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee after we have reviewed all of the \ncases presented by the district attorneys, and after we have given \nJudge Massiah-Jackson an opportunity to reply. Before commenting about \nthe background and history of the case and the actions which have been \ntaken up until now, I would ask for the attention of our distinguished \nchairman, Senator Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Senator Hatch has cited the case of Commonwealth v. \nSmith, and noted Judge Massiah-Jackson's judgments in the matter. And I \njust wanted to inquire of my distinguished colleague, if I could have \nSenator Hatch's attention, does my distinguished colleague know that \nwhen the case came up on retrial before a different judge that the \ndefendant Smith was found not guilty?\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand this to be the case. As I noted, the record \nas of today is unclear on a number of these issues. The Department of \nJustice is still reviewing some of these cases. But the fact that the \ndefendant was eventually acquitted does not excuse the fact that she \nwas reversed on appeal, that we only learned of this case last week, \nand that there certainly appeared to be probable cause to arrest him.\n  Mr. SPECTER. The Senator from Utah has commented about two cases \nwhere there were sentences below the guidelines. I ask my colleague \nfrom Utah if he knew in the case of Commonwealth v. Earnest Smith, \nJanuary term, 1986, 0144-0146 that Judge Massiah-Jackson was reversed \nfor handing out a sentence which was too tough or long under the \nsentencing guidelines? I would be interested to know if the Senator \nknew as opposed to the staff knowing, if it please.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am aware that she may have handed down some tough \nsentences as well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I raise those two points on specific matters cited by \nthe distinguished chairman because there is a great deal which has to \nbe analyzed. I am in total agreement with Senator Hatch when he says \nthat there has to be review in a bipartisan manner to take a close look \nat Judge Massiah-Jackson's qualifications. I consider myself as a juror \non the matter to look at the facts and make an impartial, unbiased \ndetermination. That is the conclusion which I came to in conjunction \nwith my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Santorum, \nwhen we had the district attorneys in my office on January 23rd at the \ninvitation of Senator Santorum and myself to hear the specifics of \ntheir complaints. They said at that time that they had some 50 cases to \npresent on Judge Massiah-Jackson's record, and we responded that we \nwanted to hear them to see what they were. We hoped that they could be \nfiled within a week, although whatever information they give us at any \ntime, including today, is going to be considered.\n  This is a very important matter when you have a lifetime Federal \ncourt appointment. In fact, 49 cases were submitted on Monday, February \n2nd, a week ago yesterday. Those cases are currently under review. I am \ntold that some 15 people are reviewing the cases in the Department of \nJustice and at the White House to make an analysis of those cases. \nJudge Massiah-Jackson is now in the process of reviewing those matters \nto present her views as to why she did what she did in those cases. \nOnce that is concluded, I think that we would have to make an analysis. \nAnd the probabilities are high that another hearing will be required, \nalthough even that cannot be determined until we take a look at the \ncases to see what those cases say.\n\n  When Senator Hatch outlined the history of this matter, he pointed \nout that the President submitted the nomination of Judge Massiah-\nJackson to the Senate on July 31st of 1997, and that the papers were \nsent over on August 15th of 1997.\n  I think it is worth noting, Mr. President, that an arrangement which \nhas been worked out between Senator Santorum and myself as the Senators \nfrom Pennsylvania and the White House has been that for every three \nnominees submitted by the President's party, Senator Santorum and I \nwould be able to make recommendations as to one judge from the \nRepublican Party. Pennsylvania is the only State which has that \narrangement, with the exception of New York which has had that \narrangement going back to the 1970's when Senator Javits was the \nSenator from New York. Our recommendation was for the Eastern District \nand for former Pennsylvania State Supreme Court Justice Bruce Kauffman \nand that was our suggestion. There was no connection with any other \nnominee. But that arrangement has been carried out, and we expect it to \nbe carried out in the Western District and the Middle District as well.\n  As Senator Hatch pointed out, when we sought to have information \nabout Judge Massiah-Jackson, none was forthcoming, and there was a \nreluctance on the part of the Judiciary Committee until further \ninvestigation was done.\n  So Senator Santorum and I convened a hearing which was attended by \nSenator Biden, former chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in \nPhiladelphia in early October. We asked all parties to come forward at \nthat time, if they had any information adverse to Judge Massiah-\nJackson. Among the witnesses who testified that day, one was a \nrepresentative of the mayor. And Mayor Rendell has been very forceful \nin his support of Judge Massiah-Jackson. Mayor Rendell told me that \nJudge Massiah-Jackson had only one appeal taken and had been sustained \non that. Senator Hatch pointed out that apparently is not the case with \ntwo other cases having been reviewed here. Mayor Rendell had been \nDistrict Attorney in Philadelphia, and had subsequently been the Mayor \nof Philadelphia, been the interim District Attorney until 1985, and \nthen elected Mayor in 1991. So he had some substantial familiarity with \nJudge Massiah-Jackson's record and was very forceful in his support of \nJudge Massiah-Jackson.\n  In any event, after the hearing in Philadelphia in early October, the \nJudiciary Committee hearing was scheduled in late October. And at that \ntime there was a review of Judge Massiah-Jackson's record at that time. \nSenator Kyl presided. Senator Sessions was present, and I was present. \nOthers were present when we went into her record. Subsequent to that \nhearing, information has come forward from the Pennsylvania District \nAttorneys Association challenging Judge Massiah-Jackson on a variety of \ngrounds.\n  When I heard about that, I asked them to come in. January 19 was an \ninconvenient date, but we did meet on January 23 and then the sequence \nfollowed with their having presented their cases which we have in hand \nas of a week ago yesterday, February 2.\n  It seems to me that what we need to do is to take a look at those \ncases. There have been citations against Judge Massiah-Jackson in some \ncases--and I am not going to go into them at this time--where Judge \nMassiah-Jackson's judgments were later upheld by the appellate court. \nThe information which has been provided to me is that in 95 cases which \nwere taken on appeal from Judge Massiah-Jackson, she was reversed in 14 \ncases. Some of those cases were civil as well as criminal.\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\n And I think it important to note that Judge Massiah-Jackson has not \nsat in criminal cases since 1991.\n  I think there is agreement by all people who have taken a look at \nthis nomination that a lifetime appointment is a matter of great \nconcern, and I might add that there is a special concern among the \ndistrict attorneys which has been expressed to me as the result of the \ndecision by Judge Dalzell of the same court, the United States District \nCourt for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, in a case of \nCommonwealth v. Lambert in Lancaster County, a very serious homicide \nmatter where Judge Dalzell suppressed evidence and said there could not \nbe a retrial. Judge Dalzell has since been reversed by the Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit because the defendant did not exhaust \nState remedies, and Congressman Pitts and Congressman Gekas and I have \nfiled legislation which would deny jurisdiction to a Federal judge to \norder no retrial. Federal judges have the authority to suppress \nevidence, but I do not think they have the authority to deny retrial. \nThat is a matter for the District Attorney of Lancaster County, \nsomething I have some familiarity with, having been DA for 8 years and \nAssistant District Attorney for 4 years before that. But I think a \nretrial is a matter for the local District Attorney and the local \ncourt. But there is quite a concern among the District Attorneys of \nPennsylvania about that action by a Federal judge and a concern as to \nthis nomination, and as citizens, as District Attorneys, they obviously \nhave every right to provide information to the Judiciary Committee on \nthis nominee. I think we have to consider what they have to say. I \nthink we have to consider Judge Massiah-Jackson's responses and then \nmake a determination of the judgment as to whether she should be \nconfirmed or not.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to support what seems to be a \ngrowing notion on the floor that we not vote on this nominee today, \nthat we take an opportunity for the sake of fairness to give Judge \nMassiah-Jackson the opportunity to respond to the new information \nprovided by the district attorneys association.\n  I had to leave the floor for the past few minutes, and I missed most \nof the remarks of my colleague from Pennsylvania. There were some folks \nfrom Core State who wanted to talk about the Core State-First Union \nmerger which is a very important issue in my state. I have been \ninformed that Senator Specter went through some of the history of how \nthis nomination came to this point, and I think it serves us well to \nunderstand that this information has come out late, that the \nopportunity was made available to anyone to not only testify in \nPhiladelphia--Senator Specter and myself and Senator Biden held a \nhearing in Philadelphia to seek information, as well as the Judiciary \nCommittee held its hearing. Information could have been provided.\n  I must admit that for a period of several months prior to the nominee \ncoming up before the committee I was provided a whole bunch of \ninformation slid under the door, thrown over the transom, but not \ninformation that was in fact stood behind by anybody willing to come \nforward and say this is what the record indicates and go on the record. \nIt led me to have some very serious concerns about the nominee, but, as \nSenator Hatch said, I am not going to make a decision on a judge based \non information that someone is not willing to stand up in the public \nlight and testify to. Senator Specter and I have a joint committee that \nreviews nominees to be district court judges in Pennsylvania. We both \nhave an equal number of representations--a bipartisan committee. They \nreview the qualifications of a judge, basically resume and other kinds \nof information. In fact, we ask several questions of the judge, but the \njudge provides us with the information, and we make a decision based on \nthat information we receive. Judge Massiah-Jackson was approved by that \ncommission. As a result, my policy is to support anybody who gets \napproved by the commission and then subsequently nominated by the \nPresident, to support that nominee's right to come out of committee and \ncome to the floor of the Senate. I have on occasion not too long ago \nactually held judges and objected to judges being considered by the \ncommittee and coming to the floor of the Senate from the State of \nPennsylvania because the commission that Senator Specter and I have did \nnot find that individual to be qualified. They did find Judge Massiah-\nJackson to be qualified. Therefore, I agreed to support her through \nthis process until it reached the floor.\n\n  I always left open the opportunity, and still do, to judge as to \nwhether I believe that person should be finally approved by the Senate. \nIn the case of Judge Massiah-Jackson I have very serious concerns that \nshe is in fact going to be a good judge on the Eastern District in \nPennsylvania. The charges that have been put forward by the district \nattorneys association and others I think are very serious. The cases \nyou have heard from Senator Hatch and I know others will be talking \nabout today raise very serious concerns about her respect for law \nenforcement and her treatment of criminals on both her record as far as \na finder of fact in nonjury trials as well as her sentencing as a \nresult of being the finder of fact.\n  So those things I have very grave concerns about, but having said all \nthat I don't think it is fair for the Senate to move forward and vote \non a nominee who has not had the opportunity to respond. I just think \nthat would be unprecedented. These allegations, unfortunately, came in \nat the last minute, came in almost after the last minute. Judge \nMassiah-Jackson actually almost was approved before we left at the end \nof last year but an objection was raised by two Senators for that \napproval. Otherwise, she would have been approved by unanimous consent \nhere. Two Senators objected to that approval. It was only after that--\nin fact not immediately after that because that happened in November. \nIt was 2 months later that this information came out--not 2 months but \nalmost 2 months later that this information came out in a letter from \nthe district attorney of Philadelphia and the neighborhood who voiced \nher concern and her opposition and obviously the district attorneys \nassociation followed suit, or I guess about the same time came forward \nand said they objected. Subsequently, the fraternal order of police in \nPhiladelphia objected, then the State and then the national. So we had \nthis sort of drip, drip, drip of opposition come out, and I am not \nquestioning whether it is legitimate or not.\n  These are, obviously, very important substantive issues, but I must \nadmit I am a bit concerned and bothered by the fact it came out at such \na late time and in such a, I think, unprofessional fashion. We needed \nto have this information before the committee when the committee \nbrought her nomination up for confirmation. It was only fair to the \njudge to do that. And I think these allegations coming out at the time \nthey are have not been fair to her, so I think for the Senate to move \nforward at this point would be an additional unfairness to this \ncandidate. And so I would encourage my colleague, the Senator from \nUtah, as well as the Senator from Vermont, Senator Leahy, to \ncoordinate, whether we have to do it by some formal action in the \nSenate or preferably by some informal action, that we delay this \nnominee today, give her the opportunity to come before the Judiciary \nCommittee and have an opportunity to be heard and to respond to these \nallegations, and they are serious, but I frankly think the more serious \nthe more I feel compelled to give her the opportunity to respond. If \nthey were not so serious, then I would say, well, let's just move \nforward. But the fact they are serious I think fairness requires her to \ncome before the committee and give her accounting of these fact \nsituations.\n\n  And what are they? Well, 50 cases have been brought to our attention \nhere in the last few weeks, 50 cases that have been delivered to us for \nthe last year in which she was a judge. I believe she was a criminal \ncourt judge about 7 years. I could be wrong by a half year or so. The \nlast year they went through her records and of 400 some cases, they \npulled 50 to show what they believe is conduct that shows a disrespect \nfor the rule of law and a very soft approach on crime.\n  I must admit I have read the summaries of all 50 of those cases and I \nam troubled by not all of them but certainly most of them. I also \nunderstand that is the synopsis of the district attorneys association \nas to what the\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\nfacts were in the cases, and I would think it is only fair that we hear \nwhat the judge's perspective is as to what the facts at least alleged \nin these summaries are before we make the decision in the Senate.\n  And so again I think on that count the judge deserves an opportunity. \nOther information has been brought forward as to her sentencing record. \nAgain, that was somewhat reviewed by the committee. They are taking a \nlittle different angle. But these are nuances that I think are \nimportant, when it comes to sentencing, she have an opportunity to \nprovide at least some light on the subject.\n  There is the issue of her acquittal rate. According to the district \nattorneys association, her acquittal rate is much higher than the \naverage judge. When I say acquittal rate, acquittal when she sits as \nfinder of fact in a nonjury trial--that her rate of acquittal is higher \nthan the average rate of acquittal, on all charges I might add, on all \ncharges of the average judge in Philadelphia. In fact, in the last 4 \nyears it is three times the rate of the average judge in Philadelphia. \nAgain, I am not an expert in the way the court system functions in \nPhiladelphia. I don't know what division of the court she was sitting \nin. I don't know what that means. Is it maybe as the result of the kind \nof cases she was hearing? I think those are important questions we have \nto ask her and, frankly, ask the district attorneys association or the \ndistrict attorney of Philadelphia at a hearing so we can understand in \na little broader picture what the facts are with respect to her \nacquittal rate.\n  So those are just some of the things that while on the face of it I \nmust admit are troubling and may continue to be troubling if the \nresponse, Judge Massiah-Jackson's responses are not satisfactory, I \nthink the opportunity to respond is imperative.\n  So I rise to support what hopefully will be the order of the day here \nwhich is to give everyone an opportunity to be heard but hopefully then \ngive Judge Massiah-Jackson the opportunity to be heard.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise today to speak out in opposition \nto the nomination of Judge Frederica Massiah-Jackson to be United \nStates District Judge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  We have heard in recent weeks about the so-called vacancy crisis in \nFederal courts and that the Senate needs to move more quickly in \nputting the Clinton nominees on the bench.\n  Well, I for one am more concerned about the quality of nominees than \nI am about the quantity of nominees. And I am quite sure that we should \nnot respond to a perceived vacancy crisis by giving a lifetime \nappointment to Frederica Massiah-Jackson.\n  Before putting this nomination into the context of judges in \nWashington, and the battles over judges, it is worth emphasizing the \nremarkably strong and unified opposition of local law enforcement to \nthis nomination. I have not had a long history of appointments and \nconfirmations here in the Senate--3 years. We have confirmed scores of \njudges over the course of 3 years. When I was Governor, I had the \nopportunity to appoint a couple of hundred judges. I appointed all \nseven members of the supreme court of the State of Missouri. It was a \nprivilege for which I was deeply grateful and I took it very seriously. \nI thought it very important that we appoint individuals of high \nquality.\n  Never in my experience with judicial appointees here in the U.S. \nSenate or in my time as a Governor, when I appointed several hundred \njudges in my home State, did I ever see a community of prosecutors step \nforward and say, ``Don't do this.'' Never before have officers of the \ncourt--and prosecutors are officers of the court--felt the necessity to \nstand up and say, whatever you do, don't confirm this one. Don't \nappoint this individual.\n  At noon today I participated in a press conference with national and \nlocal law enforcement officials. Other participants included John \nMorganelli, the district attorney from Northampton County in \nPennsylvania, and Ralph Germak, the district attorney in Juniata County \nof Pennsylvania, and Richard Costello, the president of the \nPhiladelphia Fraternal Order of Police.\n  I thank them for their willingness to come forward. They came to the \nnews conference to express their opposition to Judge Massiah-Jackson. \nInterestingly enough, these are not individuals that you would normally \nexpect to publicly express their opposition. District Attorney \nMorganelli is a Democrat. The nomination of this Democrat judge from \nPhiladelphia was made by a Democrat President. It takes courage to put \none's country and the judicial system above one's party. But District \nAttorney Morganelli chose to do so.\n  Not only did District Attorney Morganelli come forward, but he also \nmade us aware of District Attorney Lynne Abraham, a Democrat district \nattorney for Philadelphia. At great political cost to her, Ms. Abraham \nsaid this nominee is simply unacceptable. She wrote in a letter \naddressed to Senator Arlen Specter on January 8 of this year, referring \nto Judge Massiah-Jackson:\n\n       This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances \n     of demonstrated leniency toward criminals, an adversarial \n     attitude toward police, and a disrespect toward prosecutors \n     unmatched by any other present or former jurist with whom I \n     am familiar.\n\n  The severity of that statement is matched only by its candor and its \ncourage. It is not easy for a district attorney who has the \nresponsibility of sending prosecutors into that courtroom to come \nforward with that kind of testimony about a nominee. Most of us would \nnot want to tell the truth about a judge that we were going to have to \nface over and over and over again. When District Attorney Morganelli \nand District Attorney Lynne Abraham come forward, speaking at great \npersonal risk, I do not take that lightly.\n  When Richard Costello spoke, as the president of the Philadelphia \nFraternal Order of Police, he mentioned casually a fact that sent a \nchill down my spine. He said, ``I have been shot twice.'' And then he \nrelated the story of how Judge Massiah-Jackson had ordered undercover \npolicemen to stand up and be recognized in court so that any drug \ndealers that were there would recognize them if they saw them on the \nstreets. You can imagine what happens to an undercover policeman who is \ntrying to make a drug buy in a case and the drug dealer recognizes the \npoliceman. It could well be that that individual's life would not be \nworth that much.\n  I think these individuals who have come forward have a unique blend \nof personal experience and an unparalleled amount of courage to provide \nthis important information to the U.S. Senate. Nomination fights are \ndifficult. I wish we didn't have all these fights stacked at once. But \nthere is a level of quality that we must expect from individuals who \nare appointed for life to the Federal bench. If that level of quality \ndoes not exist, we must find it elsewhere.\n\n  I do not believe that the talent pool of individuals available to be \nFederal judges in America is shallow. I do not believe that we cannot \nfind moral people who are decent, who have an ability to stay in the \nmiddle of a controversy instead of joining one side or the other. I do \nnot believe that the number of trained, skilled lawyers in the \nPhiladelphia, PA community is so low that we have to accept individuals \nwho, according to the district attorney, have an adversarial attitude \ntoward police and disrespect prosecutors. The prosecutors are a part of \nthe court and judicial system. They are entitled to respect. But this \nnominee is so far below the minimum quality we should expect from a \nFederal judge that it is tragic. The local law enforcement community is \nhorrified. They are about to be saddled with a judge that they say is \nthe worst.\n  There is a principle, I think they call it ``the Peter Principle,'' \nwhere they kick people upstairs. They keep promoting them because they \nwant to get rid of them. These officials who came forward in this case \nare not even willing to do that. They understand that this would be a \nmistake of unparalleled proportions. Washington may seem willing to \nrubberstamp nominees no matter how unqualified, but these courageous \nindividuals from Philadelphia--and, I might add, the prosecutors \nassociation from the State of Pennsylvania, which voted unanimously \nagainst this nominee--are not.\n  I began a minute ago to address the idea of the talent pool, the idea \nthat there are people talented enough and capable enough, and who have \nthe requisite integrity to do a good job. I am\n\n[[Page S555]]\n\nfirmly convinced of that. What really troubles me is that the Senate \nhere, now, is talking about maybe we can try and allow this individual \nto have another hearing, in spite of the fact that the written \nresponses were inadequate, in spite of the fact that the oral responses \nof this judge, when heard previously, were inadequate, that somehow we \ncould explain away everything. It is as if there is no other option.\n  I do not think we should try to find a way to make the worst nominee \nthat these folks have ever seen somehow marginally acceptable. We \nshould not be seeking the lowest quality possible in the Federal \njudiciary. We should be seeking the highest quality possible.\n  Let me go through some of the objections that the local officials \noutlined. These happen to be the basis for my own opposition. They are \nfourfold.\n  This nominee has shown disrespect for the court by using the English \nlanguage's most offensive profanity in open court. This is not a \nsubject of debate. This is the subject of court records. You see, there \nwere certain times when this judge's personal court reporter wasn't \nthere to take down the testimony and so a reporter unaccustomed to the \nlanguage of this judge just filed the report with the offensive \nlanguage in it, instead of scrubbing the report.\n  I think for us to say that a judge who uses the crudest profanity \nthat we know in America in a way that demeans the prosecutor in a \ncourtroom is someone that we should not reward by elevating to a \nlifetime appointment as a Federal judge. It is just that simple. There \nare some who said there have been apologies and it did not happen very \noften. I know that there are several cases in court records which show \nthe kind of language that was used. They don't happen to occur in \nrecords that were kept by the regular reporter. But, in my judgment, \nwhen we have a deep talent pool, why should we say to those who are \nboth in the system and hoping someday to be made Federal judges, or \notherwise, that ``it doesn't matter what kind of language you use. You \njust can come up and say you are not going to do it anymore and next \ntime make sure that the reporter scrubs it out of the record.'' We \nreally need to make a statement that people who disrespect the \nparticipants in the judicial system do not belong as Federal judges \nwith lifetime appointments, accountable to no one.\n  Second, I already mentioned the eloquent testimony of \nRichard Costello, the president of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of \nPolice, and how this judge so favoring dope dealers asked undercover \npolice officers to stand up and be identified in court. You know any \ndope dealer in the court wouldn't have been identified to the police \nofficers, only the police officers to the dope dealers. Here is a judge \nwho recklessly and without regard to the lives of police officials, \nputs those lives at risk. Officer Costello indicated that he attended \nthe funerals of seven police officers who had been killed in the line \nof duty, and he didn't appreciate in the least a judge jeopardizing his \nfellow officers and his own ability to survive.\n\n  Third, this judge demonstrated hostility to prosecutors by \nsuppressing evidence and dismissing charges against criminals. I think \nthe statement by the chairman of the committee with regard to the young \nman who was raped and the assailant who was captured, identified \ncrawling out of the bushes, was eloquent and powerful. We need judges \nwho will be fair and impartial.\n  Last but not least, this judge has shown leniency to criminals in \nsentencing violent criminals to probation only, even when they have \nbeen involved in violent crimes on a repeated basis. The judge has used \na technique to get to a place for lower sentences. When a person would \nbe charged with a crime and the evidence would come in and show \nunequivocally that they are guilty of the crime, the judge would find \nguilt of a lesser included offense so that she could avoid having to \nimpose the minimum sentence and could give a lesser sentence.\n  There has been a great deal of talk about how there have not been \nvery many appeals. Some have asked, ``How many times has she been \nreversed on appeals?'' Let me say this, if you are a criminal you are \nnot going to appeal when the judge turns you loose. You are not going \nto appeal when the sentence is low. It's very difficult for the \nprosecutor to appeal.\n  The Senate cannot confirm this nominee in the face of the strong \nopposition of the local law enforcement community and on the basis of \nthese four fundamental facts, which are established clearly in the \nrecord and which require no additional committee meetings to examine. \nThis judge has been a profane judge, disrespecting prosecutors in the \ncourtroom by referring to them with the lowest level of profanity known \nin the English language. This judge has recklessly risked the lives of \nlaw enforcement officers by making undercover agents reveal who they \nare to the drug-running community. This judge has demonstrated a \nhostility toward prosecutors by suppressing evidence unnecessarily and \nimproperly on a repeated basis. And this judge has shown leniency \ntoward criminals by sentencing violent criminals only to probation when \nthe record clearly shows that not only are they violent criminals, but \nthey are violent repeat offenders.\n  For us to confirm this nominee of this President would be to betray \nour oath of office to provide advice and consent. For us to confirm \nthis nominee would be the height of arrogance and another example of \n``Washington knows best,'' when the folks at the local level know what \nis right and they have come forward with great courage and inordinate \ncandor to share with the Senate their sentiments about this nominee.\n  As I mentioned earlier, never in my experiences with the appointment \nof hundreds of judges have I ever heard from prosecutors like we have \nin this matter. I've never seen so many stand up, be willing to call a \nnews conference and say, ``This kind of candidate is totally \nunacceptable.''\n  We have heard a great deal in recent weeks about the vacancy crisis \nin the Federal courts, and we heard it said that Republicans are \ndelaying for the sake of delay. In the case of Massiah-Jackson, I have \nasked that we debate this issue for the sake of the country and for its \ncourts.\n  I must confess that this issue is here in the U.S. Senate because of \nme, because at the close of the last session, I was contacted by no \nless than a half a dozen different Senators who urged me to let this \nnomination go through in the dark of night as a matter of unanimous \nconsent. They said, ``Let's get it over with; let's just get this \ndone.''\n  Well, that would have been an unfortunate mistake. It would not have \nallowed these prosecutors and local officials to assemble their briefs. \nIt would not have allowed us to hear the evidence. It would not have \nallowed us to make good decisions as Members of the U.S. Senate. I \nresisted those efforts because I felt the nomination raised serious \nquestions, it had serious defects that needed to be examined in the \nlight of day.\n  When the President comes and asks us to work hard to make sure we do \na good job on nominees, I think that is a sincere request, but we \nshould take him at face value. I think these nominees are important \nenough for us to debate, I think they are important enough for us to \ndecide, and I think we should debate them and decide them in the light \nof day. There is no need for us to rush this particular item back into \na committee room somewhere so something can be done absent the light of \nday and the scrutiny of the public. It is time for the U.S. Senate to \nstand up and to say that there are times when the President simply \nsends us individuals who are unacceptable.\n  I placed a hold on this nomination and refused to lift it, despite \nthe insistence of a number of Senators, including Senator Specter. Some \nwould point to this as unnecessary delay, but we will create an actual \ncrisis, not an imagined one, if we send individuals of this caliber \ninto America's courtrooms.\n  The Senate has a constitutional obligation to give its advice to the \nPresident with respect to judicial nominees, and, in this case, I think \nwe should withhold our consent. I think that the President should have \nwithdrawn this nominee. I can't imagine the President understands the \ncharacter and nature of this nominee's conduct and wants the Senate to \nratify that conduct by sending this nominee into a lifetime \nappointment. Surely the President is familiar with the litany of \ndisrespect assembled by this nominee in her prior service.\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\n  One has to wonder about the vetting process that raises no objections \nto a nominee like this one. You wonder what kind of job the American \nBar Association did. They purport to be the ``Good Housekeeping Seal of \nApproval.'' I maybe ought to apologize to Good Housekeeping for saying \nthat, because never has a product with the ``Good Housekeeping Seal of \nApproval'' fallen so short of its advertised billing.\n  The truth of the matter is this: The Constitution does not give the \nAmerican Bar Association or the Justice Department or the White House \ncounsel's office the screening responsibility for Federal judges. The \nresponsibility to screen Federal judges is resident in the U.S. Senate.\n  Some have said, ``Well, we ought to have another committee hearing; \nwe ought to have this; we ought to have that.'' The U.S. Senate acts as \na committee of the whole. When the nomination comes, we are each \neligible to evaluate the evidence. We are each charged with the \nresponsibility, duty and opportunity to help make sure that the \njudicial branch of this country is properly staffed.\n  The President should withdraw this nomination. The American people \ndeserve better. This nomination sends the wrong message to criminals, \nsuggesting that you can find a friendly judge whose predisposition is \nadversarial to the prosecutors. That is not my conclusion, that is the \nconclusion of the prosecution community in Pennsylvania. It sends the \nwrong message to young people that it doesn't matter what kind of \nlanguage or respect you accord to the judicial system, you can still be \nmoving up the ladder. Finally, this nomination sends the wrong message \nto law enforcement that the U.S. Senate doesn't mind promoting someone \nwho puts the lives of law enforcement officials in jeopardy.\n  I call on the President to withdraw this nomination. If the President \nrefuses to withdraw this nominee, the Senate should vote to reject the \nnominee now. There is no need for additional proceedings. The President \nhimself says we should have up-or-down votes. He says that there is a \nbacklog. Well, if there is a backlog, why slow the system down with a \nreexamination of an individual who is unqualified to serve, who will \nnot take this responsibility of the American judiciary to its highest \nand best, but who, unfortunately, will be found as reinforcing it at \nits lowest and least?\n  Nothing will be gained by further delay or sending the nominee back \nto committee. We know more than enough now, and we know more than \nenough about the talent pool of lawyers in Philadelphia, PA, to know at \nleast there are some lawyers there that could have a far superior \npropensity for public service than this nominee who has already soiled \na reputation while serving in a public position of responsibility.\n  We are constantly being told that if there are problems with \nnominees, we should bring them up and vote them down. Now is the time \nto dispose of this nomination. Now is the time to say America deserves \nbetter. We deserve better than someone who would profanely abuse the \ncourtroom and the participants in the judicial system.\n  We deserve someone who would do better than to jeopardize the lives \nof law enforcement officials.\n  We deserve a judge who would be fairer than to arbitrarily dismiss \nevidence so that criminals could go loose unjustifiably.\n  We deserve someone who knows better than to avoid tough sentences \nwhen there are repeat violent offenders against the people of our \ncities and States.\n  I believe we have the votes, and after a debate in which people can \nsee the kind of nominees that the President is sending to the Senate, \nwe should vote this nominee down.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let me take strong offense to what the \nSenator from Missouri has said in a number of particulars, if I could \nhave his attention. If I could have the attention of the Senator from \nMissouri. When he makes a comment about betraying the oath of office, I \nconsider that insulting. I have been in this body a little longer than \nthe Senator from Missouri has, and I know what my oath of office is. If \nthe Senator from Missouri thinks that he knows enough, that can be his \nconclusion. He may be willing to make a judgment without hearing from \nJudge Massiah-Jackson, but I don't think that is the fair or the \nappropriate thing to do.\n  When he talks about why send it back to the Committee, let's debate \nand decide this in the light of day, he is not only insulting this \nSenator, he is insulting the Committee--why send it back to the \nCommittee without the scrutiny of the public? If the matter goes back \nto the Committee, there will be an open hearing, and the Senator from \nMissouri is on the Committee, although he wasn't present when Judge \nMassiah-Jackson's hearing came up. The Senator from Missouri has made a \ngood political speech, but I don't think a speech becoming of the \nUnited States Senate's decision to hear both sides of the case.\n\n  When the Senator from Missouri says that there has been offensive \nlanguage, that is true, and that was taken up with the Committee and \nthe Committee voted 12 to 6 to report Judge Massiah-Jackson out, \nnotwithstanding that language which was, in fact, offensive, and she \napologized for it. I don't know of any Senator on this floor or in this \nbody--maybe there is one, the Senator from Missouri--who has never made \noffensive comments. But I don't think you would find people in many \noffices, if any, who would be disqualified from office because they \nmade two offensive comments.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, I won't. When I finish--no, go ahead, I will yield.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I wondered if the Senator had a question of me. You \nasked that I stay, and I wonder if you had a question. If you do, I \nwill be pleased to answer it.\n  Mr. SPECTER. No, I do not have a question of you. I would like you to \nlisten to this. If you don't want to listen to Judge Massiah-Jackson, I \nhope you will listen to a colleague who has something to say about what \nyou just said.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have thoroughly reviewed the record of Judge Massiah-\nJackson.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Are you aware that the case you referred to involving \nthe rape of a young man was sent back to another judge for trial and \nthat defendant was acquitted?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have thoroughly reviewed the record of Judge Massiah-\nJackson.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, that's an interesting answer to some other \nquestion, but the question I just posed to you, are you aware of the \nfact that defendant was acquitted when he went back for another trial--\nyou talked about the defendant being guilty, are you aware of the fact \nthat he was acquitted?\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I am aware of the record of Judge Massiah-Jackson. It \nwas clearly stated by the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Well, then I would suggest----\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President,----\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, regular order. I have the floor.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. I have the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania has the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when I make that comment about the \nSenator from Missouri saying that he knows the facts, knows the case, \nhe raises four points, and one of them is the rape of this young man, a \nvictim, but he doesn't know that the defendant was acquitted. That does \nhave some bearing. If the scrutiny and the thoroughness of the Senator \nfrom Missouri on the balance of the record is as thorough as it was on \nthis case, some may question the basis for his judgments, wanting to \ncome to a vote without having heard the other side of the case.\n  When the Senator from Missouri comments about endangering police \nofficers, I wonder if the Senator from Missouri knows that those \nofficers were identified because they testified in open court?\n  And when the Senator from Missouri talks about attending the funerals \nof seven police officers, this Senator has attended the funerals of a \nlot more police officers than seven in 4 years as an Assistant District \nAttorney and 8 years as District Attorney of Philadelphia. It\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\nmay be in that capacity that I have some greater knowledge of criminal \nprocedure in that city and what goes on in the courtroom and what \nhappens and whether somebody is entitled to make a reply. Not only \nattended the funerals of seven police officers, but prosecuted on many \noccasions their murderers.\n  When the Senator from Missouri makes a comment about lower sentences, \nlesser included offenses, he may have a point on that, but that \nrequires an analysis of what was in the case.\n  I agree with the Senator from Missouri when he talks about the need \nfor a quality evaluation of judges, and I do not believe that we ought \nto appoint judges for the Federal courts for lifetime appointments \nwithout very thorough scrutiny, but I do not think that it advances the \ncause to vilify or joke about the American Bar Association and the \n``Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval.'' The Philadelphia Bar \nAssociation is making an analysis and stands behind Judge Massiah-\nJackson as her advocate.\n  When the Senator from Missouri says that Arlen Specter is the \nsponsoring Senator, again, he doesn't know what he is talking about. \nThis is a nominee by the President. This is a nominee by the President, \nand I have said that Judge Massiah-Jackson is entitled to a fair \nhearing and to have her side of the matter presented. That is, as a \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, as a United States Senator and as a \njuror, who has to make a decision.\n  I am well aware of my oath of office. And I am well aware of my \nresponsibilities to make an impartial judgment in this case. I said to \nthe district attorneys who came to my office on January 23--and I \nrepeated it earlier today--that I was interested in hearing what they \nhad to say, but I will not make a judgment until I hear the reply of \nJudge Massiah-Jackson as a matter of basic fundamental fairness.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the process of advise and consent in the \nU.S. Senate for judicial nominees is indeed an important one. We have \nhad some tremendous debate already this afternoon. And we have had it \non other nominees. The Senators that have spoken earlier today are \noutstanding Senators who deeply care about their work. And I respect \nthem all.\n  I think it unfortunate that we may have crossed over into some \npersonal matters that would not be normally displayed on this floor. \nBut I think it is important what we are doing. I think it is \ncommendable that people speak with passion about what they believe in.\n  A Federal judicial lifetime appointment is an important office. I \nserved as an assistant U.S. attorney, a Federal prosecutor, for 2\\1/2\\ \nyears. I served as a U.S. attorney, a Federal prosecutor, for almost 12 \nyears. I practiced every day, full time, before Federal judges.\n  I respect and believe in Federal judges with great passion. I believe \nwe ought to have the finest quality of people we can possibly have on \nthe federal bench. I have tried, as I have participated in the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, as a member, to conduct myself in that committee \nwith the highest levels of professionalism.\n  When this nominee came up, I had some concerns as a professional \nprosecutor. I had a feeling, an intuition, that there was something \nunhealthy about this nominee, that there was perhaps an unstated bias \nagainst prosecutors and law enforcement. We had a number of matters \nthat indicated such a bias.\n  She testified well and gave some explanations. I concluded that we \nought to vote no on the nominee. A number of other people, a majority, \ndid not oppose the nominee. Her nomination came to the floor.\n  I think it is true, as Senator Ashcroft has suggested, had he not put \na hold on that nominee, she would be a Federal judge today. That was \nthe direction we were heading. The vote was coming up. The committee \nhad voted 2 to 1 in favor of that nominee.\n  The President has asked that his judges be voted on. I think he has a \nright to ask that, as it is a fair thing for the President to ask. But \nI think the President also recognizes that sometimes giving a little \ninsight into it is important; otherwise we become nothing more than a \nrubber stamp or a potted plant. And I do not intend to do that. I have \na responsibility. I serve on that committee. I care about the Federal \njudiciary, and I want good quality judges on the bench.\n  So that is where we are. I think one thing is important and \ninstructive out of this entire process. Senator Specter and Senator \nSantorum and Senator Biden had a hearing in Philadelphia. They sought \nout comments. They did not receive any substantial negative comments. \nIn defense of Senator Specter, at the hearing he volunteered to allow \nme to continue my questioning of Judge Massiah-Jackson beyond the \nnormal time limit that I would have been given. I do not think there \nhas been an attempt to suppress the truth.\n  What happens in situations like this, however, is that people hate to \nspeak out against a person who has been nominated for a high position. \nThey just do not like to do it. There is no fun in it. There is no \npleasure to it. It is not a nice thing to have to do.\n  So what really happened was, after the hearing in which I questioned \nMs. Massiah-Jackson, as did Senator Specter and Senator Kyl and others, \nit was reported in the Philadelphia papers, apparently, that law \nenforcement officers, line prosecutors, who had been in the courtroom \nday after day in Philadelphia, the Philadelphia district attorney and \nothers began to think about this, the prospect of this nominee being a \nfull time, lifetime appointed Federal judge.\n  As a result of that, they made some decisions. They decided to come \nforward and express their true beliefs. Those opinions ought to be \nrespected. I would say, in accord with Senator Ashcroft, in my \nexperience I have never seen the kind of unanimity of opinion in \nopposition to a nominee by a group of professional people who have \nassociated with that nominee on a daily basis as I have seen in the \ncase of this nominee.\n  The objections are bipartisan--Republicans and Democrats. The \ndistrict attorney in Philadelphia is a democrat and is nationally \nknown, Lynne Abraham. She is a true professional, a leader in a number \nof different activities for law enforcement, and has substantial \ncredibility.\n  She wrote the Judiciary Committee, after our hearing, this letter. I \nwill quote from it. You can listen because it is very carefully \nexplained. She chooses her words very carefully. It is a significant \nopinion by a prosecutor in Philadelphia whose assistants practiced \nunder this judge on a regular basis, who personally served as a judge \nwith her on the bench at another point in time, a fellow colleague with \nher.\n  This is what she said. She first said she had never taken a position \non a judge. She did not want to take a position on a judge, but she \nfelt she had to. She said:\n\n       My position on this nomination goes well beyond mere \n     differences of opinion or judicial philosophy. Instead, this \n     nominee's record presents multiple instances of a deeply \n     ingrained and pervasive bias against prosecutors and law \n     enforcement officers and, by extension, an insensitivity to \n     victims of crime. Moreover, the nominee's judicial demeanor \n     and courtroom conduct, in my judgment, undermines respect for \n     the rule of law and, instead, tends to bring the law into \n     disrepute.\n\n  Ms. Abraham, a Democratic district attorney in Philadelphia, goes on \nto write:\n\n       This nominee's judicial service is replete with instances \n     of demonstrated leniency toward criminals, an adversarial \n     attitude toward police, and disrespect and a hostile attitude \n     toward prosecutors unmatched by any other present or former \n     jurist with whom I am familiar.\n\n  I say, Mr. President, that is a serious comment by a serious person \nabout a nominee that they felt very deeply about. It was important that \nwe hear it. Had that nominee not been held up over Christmas, and had \nit not been they had an opportunity to discuss it, we would not have \nheard that.\n  I submit this, too, that I have been a prosecutor that supervised a \nstaff of attorneys. They talk about judges. You know who the judges are \nthat are just a terror to work before. You know who the ones are that \nare always looking to undermine the case, to rule for the defendant.\n  A prosecutor, see, does not get to appeal most rulings on evidence. A \nmotion of judgment of acquittal on a case is a final judgment. The \nprosecutor has no right to appeal. But a judge can rule\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\nagainst the defendant, and the defendant has the right to appeal. So if \na judge is not willing to give the prosecutor a fair trial, there are \nmany times there is no recourse. A granting, for example, of a judgment \nof acquittal by a judge is an unreviewable order. They can take a case \nfrom the jury, declare there is not enough evidence there, and it is \nthe same as if a jury had acquitted them. Double jeopardy applies and \nthat sort of thing. So this is a problem. It is particularly a problem \nwith a lifetime Federal appointment.\n  Other law enforcement officials share Ms. Abraham's concern. District \nAttorney John Morganelli of Northhampton County, PA, also opposes the \nnomination of Judge Massiah-Jackson. Mr. Morganelli, who is also a \nDemocrat, wrote last month that Judge Jackson's conduct is \n``unjudicial, improper, and illustrates a disdain for police and \nprosecutors.'' Those are his words, not mine.\n\n  Another district attorney from Pennsylvania, Bob Buehner of Montour \nCounty, also opposes the nomination. He wrote that Judge Jackson's \n``actions as a common pleas judge in Philadelphia have, at times, \nbordered on the outrageous. She has used profanity in her courtroom. \nWhat is even worse is her consistent, demonstrated exceedingly adverse \nattitude toward prosecutors and members of the law enforcement \ncommunity.\n  That is what troubled me to begin with about this matter when it came \nup before the committee. We had the circumstance in which Judge Jackson \nin the courtroom, on the record, said to a female assistant U.S. \ndistrict attorney: ``Shut your `F'-ing mouth.''\n  Well, some may say people slip. They say things they ought not to \nsay. But from what was said about that, it troubled me, from some of \nthe other circumstances involved, that it indicates a lack of respect \nfor the prosecutor, a lack of understanding that the prosecutor is a \nlitigant, too, who represents the people of Pennsylvania and is \nentitled to the same protections of the law as is the defendant. That \nis what concerned me about it.\n  Now we have these letters from these professional law enforcement \npeople in Philadelphia. They have seen this judge handle hundreds of \ncases, thousands of cases perhaps. Their assistants have been \nprosecuting there on a daily basis. They talk about what it is like to \nbe in that courtroom. That is where we are today.\n  Let me say this. These are not just isolated comments of one or two \nprosecutors. In fact, on January 8 of this year, the Pennsylvania \nDistrict Attorneys' Association officially and unanimously voted to \noppose the confirmation of Judge Massiah-Jackson. The association found \nthat Judge Jackson's record ``indicates an attitude which is unusually \nadversarial toward police and prosecutors. Her record also indicates a \ntendency to be lenient with respect to criminal defendants.''\n  In addition to the prosecutors, many police officers oppose the \nnomination of Judge Jackson. For example, the Philadelphia lodge of the \nFraternal Order of Police announced their opposition to Judge Jackson \nlast month. The Philadelphia lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police \nstated that:\n\n       Judge Jackson has an established record of being extremely \n     lenient to criminals; insensitive to the victims of crime; \n     and has posed a direct threat against police. Judge Jackson's \n     bizarre rulings, coupled with her challenging and adversarial \n     attitude toward police and prosecutors, make it appear she is \n     on a crusade against public safety.\n\n  That is the Fraternal Order of Police there.\n  Now, even in a great city the size of Philadelphia, judges have \nreputations. Police officers know them. They know what kind of \nexperience it is to appear before them. They know how a hostile judge \ncan leave them hanging out to dry--and it can be a very tough day \nindeed--and what it is like to be before a fair and objective judge. I \ndo not think that is a flippant comment. I think that represents a \nconsidered opinion of the police department, the police officers, the \nline police officers in Philadelphia.\n  Judge Jackson's nomination is so controversial that even the National \nFraternal Order of Police has taken a stand and formally opposed her \nconfirmation.\n  I would like to share with my fellow Senators some examples that \ndemonstrate why these law enforcement people oppose Judge Jackson's \nnomination. While these are just a few of her decisions--many of which \nI firmly disagree with--I think they indicate some of the reasons why \nthey would reach these conclusions and why she should not be confirmed \nas a judge.\n  In Commonwealth v. Ruiz, Judge Jackson acquitted a man accused of \npossessing $400,000 worth of cocaine because she did not believe the \ntestimony of the two undercover officers. In this case, Judge Jackson \npointed out in the courtroom the two undercover officers, telling the \nonlookers ``to take a good look at the undercover officers and watch \nyourself.''\n  Well, some say, ``Well, you know, maybe they shouldn't have been \ntestifying. Maybe they would have been identified anyway. What harm did \nthat do?''\n  I will tell you what troubled me about it, in addition to just the \nplain fact that it may have jeopardized the lives of line police \nofficers. What went through my mind was, what would make her do that? \nWhy would she do that? What kind of hostility or bias against police \nand law enforcement would cause her to go out of her way to identify \npolice officers and tell others to watch out because they might come \nout to arrest you or catch you. That is what concerned me from the \nbeginning about this case.\n  Detective-Sergeant Daniel Rodriguez, one of the undercover officers \nexposed by Judge Jackson, had this to say: ``I hope I don't ever have \nto make buys from anyone in this courtroom. They would know me but I \nwouldn't know them. What the judge said jeopardized our ability to make \nbuys. And it put us in physical danger.''\n  Now, the reason that is significant is in every sizable police \ndepartment there are a number of police officers who, for a period of \ntime, work in an undercover capacity. It is the best way to make a drug \ncase because the one guy who sells drugs today is going to sell them \ntomorrow. You simply send somebody out pretending to be a drug dealer \nand put a tape recorder under his coat. He goes out to buy drugs from \nhim and records it so it is not one person's word against another one. \nIt is actually the drug dealer's recorded word and you can play that in \ncourt and the jury who hears it can feel like they are right there, \nknow whether or not there was any entrapment. They will know everything \nthat was said and they can make a decision whether this was a person \nwho committed a crime.\n  These officers were undercover police officers. This was their \nresponsibility--to go out on a regular basis to make cases. I don't \nknow, maybe they are witnesses in other courtrooms there. Maybe there \nwere other drug defendants there, maybe families of drug dealers who \nalso dealt in drugs, who may have been of a violent nature. It made the \npolice officer unhappy and it also made him afraid. He knew that if he \never tried to make an undercover buy from any of those individuals they \nwould not deal with him and may even harm him.\n  Again, why would she do that? Why? What would make a judge do that--\nsomething I have never seen in my entire lifetime or practice of law as \na prosecutor. By the way, we did ask about this matter and some of the \nothers at the hearing, and she did have a chance to answer to them.\n  In addition, Judge Jackson made some very offensive comments to \nprosecutors in court. In Commonwealth v. Willie Hannibal she told an \nassistant United States attorney, as I said, ``Will you shut your `f-\ning' mouth.'' When asked about this comment by the Philadelphia \nInquirer, Jackson said, ``Maybe I would suggest it offended [Ms. \nMcDermott], but I can't imagine the defendant was offended.''\n  Now, later, when the Judicial Inquiry Commission, the disciplinary \ncommission of the Pennsylvania judicial system, disciplined her in some \nfashion she said she was sorry and she shouldn't have done it and she \nsaid that before our committee. But to the newspaper, her comments \ndidn't reflect remorse to me, and in fact she said it may have made the \nprosecutor mad but it made the defendant happy.\n  It is the kind of odd approach to judging that I think is unhealthy. \nI believe it shows an insight into her attitude about law enforcement \nand criminal law that is very instructive.\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\n  She is also on record as using profanity in another instance in the \ncourtroom.\n  Now, you would expect, perhaps, if my intuition is correct, that this \nis an anti-law enforcement judge, a person who is more concerned about \nthe rights of criminals than about the rights of the victims, that it \nwould show up in the sentencing tendencies of the judge. In this case \nit really does. In Commonwealth v. Norman Nesmith, the defendant was \nconvicted of striking a pedestrian with his car, leaving her seriously \ninjured in a gutter, fleeing the scene of the crime and beating into \nunconsciousness one of the woman's relatives who tried to thwart his \nescape. As usual, the defendant waived a trial.\n\n  You have a right to waive a trial by jury and be tried by the judge. \nApparently, many people waive their jury trial early on in the system \nin Philadelphia and they don't know what judge is actually going to \nhear it and they are tried before a judge and not before a jury. They \nhave a right to be tried by a jury if they demand it.\n  At any rate, this individual waived a trial by jury and asked to be \ntried by the judge herself. She sentenced him to 2 years probation for \nall seven convictions. The defendant had a long prior record for that \noffense.\n  In Commonwealth v. Jerome Gray, the defendant severely beat his \ngirlfriend. The victim had cracked ribs, a collapsed lung, a ruptured \nspleen that had to be removed. After being released from the hospital \nthe defendant threatened to kill her.\n  As usual, the defendant waived jury trial and was tried by Judge \nJackson. He was found guilty of recklessly endangering another person, \naggravated assault, second-degree and simple assault, and was sentenced \nto only 24 months probation.\n  In Commonwealth v. Freeman, the defendant shot and wounded another \nman in the chest because the defendant laughed at him. Judge Jackson \nconvicted the defendant of a misdemeanor instead of a felony offense \nand sentenced him to 23 months, but then immediately paroled him so he \ndid not have to serve any prison time.\n  In Commonwealth v. Jenkins, the police arrived at the scene of an \narmed robbery within minutes. They were given detailed descriptions of \nthe robbers and told that the suspects had run north along the street. \nThe descriptions were broadcast over the radio. Soon thereafter, other \npolice officers arrested an individual matching the description 1\\1/2\\ \nblocks from the crime scene. When approached by the police, the suspect \ntook a roll of cash from his pocket and threw it on the ground.\n  Amazingly, the judge ruled that probable cause did not exist to make \nthe arrest or stop, and suppressed the stolen cash. She also suppressed \nthe in-court and out-of-court identifications.\n  Now, police have a responsibility and a duty to be on the streets to \ntry to protect us from crime. The Supreme Court is clear, in my \nopinion, that these kind of stops by police officers when they have \nthis kind of probable cause are constitutional. Here, the police saw \nthe defendant throwing down a roll of money, he meets the description \nof a defendant, he is running a block and a half away--that is the kind \nof basis to make a stop. If we eliminate the ability of police to make \nthat kind of good, heads-up police work because some judge says it \nviolates the search and seizure law, we are in real trouble. The law \ndoes not say that is illegal. In fact, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, and I am sure the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, holds \nregularly that those kind of searches with probable cause are \nlegitimate and constitutional\n  In Commonwealth v. Hicks, the defendant was charged with robbery, \ntheft, receiving stolen property, aggravated assault and simple \nassault. The defense made a motion for continuance because a police \nofficer that the defense had called did not show up to testify, even \nthough he had been subpoenaed. Judge Jackson ruled that the officer was \nunder the State's control and forced the prosecution to dismiss or \nnolle pros the case. When the prosecution refused to nolle pros the \ncase, she dismissed the charges.\n  Judge Jackson's order dismissing that case was reversed by the \nappellate court and the charges were reinstated. The appellate court \nnoted that the prosecution was ready to try the case, the prosecutor \nwas ready to try the case. What wrong had he or she done? The only \nmotion before the court was a defense request to continue the case \nuntil he got his witness there. Judge Jackson could simply have granted \nthe motion by the defendant to continue the case instead of dismissing \nthe charges.\n  Prosecutors don't like to resist judges. They have to practice before \nthem on a regular basis. It is something that they have to do. I say, \nfrom my reading of those facts, that that prosecutor was probably a \nyoung person not long out of law school, hustling to handle a whole \nbunch of cases, and just would not knuckle under. He was not going to \nnolle pros that case because there was no basis for it. Why would she \ndismiss it and cause the State to go to the incredible expense of \nappeal is not rational to me. It does not suggest that we have an \nevenhanded justice in Judge Jackson's courtroom. In fact, just the \nopposite.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of other things that we could say \nabout this with regard to sentences. I asked Judge Jackson about this \nat the Judiciary Committee hearing. The State of Pennsylvania has some \nsentencing guidelines. They are pretty broad. They are not as strong \nand not as tight as the Federal guidelines but they are significant. \nYou carry a gun during the commission of a crime, you have another 5 \nyears you have to serve. It has to be 5 years for that gun, regardless. \nIf you are convicted of aggravated assault, felony-one, then you are \nlooking at 10 to 20 years in jail.\n  Under the sentencing guidelines, according to her own numbers \npresented by Judge Jackson, she departed from the sentencing guidelines \ntwice as much as other judges in Philadelphia. What I don't think those \nnumbers show and what would make them even more dramatic, they don't \nshow the instances that appear to be so regular in which she convicted \nthe defendant of a lesser offense than which he was charged.\n  The District Attorney's Association have provided some 50 cases that \nshow, time and time and time again, that this judge convicted the \ndefendant on a lesser offense than what they were charged when it would \nseem it was almost impossible for the defendant not to be convicted on \na higher and more serious offense.\n  For example, Commonwealth v. Sprewall, the defendant ordered a friend \nto shoot the victim but the friend refused. The defendant took the gun \nfrom the other defendant's hand. The defendant's brother then tried to \nstop the defendant, but he pushed away his brother and fired over five \nshots at the fleeing victim, hitting him in the stomach, thigh, \nbuttocks and leg. The victim slipped in and out of consciousness when \nhe was admitted to the hospital where he spent 3 weeks. One of his toes \nhad to be amputated and he had to use a colostomy bag for 10 months \nfollowing surgery. Despite this plain evidence of serious bodily \ninjury, in Philadelphia if you commit an aggravated assault that causes \nor attempts to cause serious bodily injury then you have been convicted \nof felony 1, 10 to 20 years.\n  An injury is defined as serious if it causes the protracted \nimpairment or loss of a bodily member, organ, serious or permanent \ndisfigurement, or a substantial risk of injury. The classic example of \naggravated assault in a first-degree felony is the shooting of a gun at \na person. You don't even have to hit him. If you were trying to then \nyou are attempting to cause serious bodily injury. This person was hit \na number of times.\n  Despite this plain evidence of serious bodily injury, the judge \nconvicted the defendant of only felony 2, aggravated assault, causing \nnonserious injury, on the dubious theory that there might have been \nmore than one shooter and that the defendant's intent to cause serious \ninjury was somehow in doubt. Thus, the court aborted having to impose \nthe 5-year mandatory minimum sentence for felony 1 aggravated assault. \nThe judge then sentenced the defendant from 15 to 30 months, one-\nquarter of the minimum required sentence that he would have faced had \nhe been convicted under the more serious offense.\n  According to the report, it goes on to say that had this defendant \nbeen sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 5\n\n[[Page S560]]\n\nyears imprisonment, using a gun, that he would still have been serving \nhis sentence in 1993 when he was at that time arrested again for \ngunpoint robbery, and he would have been in jail in 1994 when he was, \nagain, on two occasions, arrested for gunpoint robbery.\n  In another case, the defendant shot the victim, hitting him in the \nchest and back. The victim had to undergo emergency surgery and spent \n2\\1/2\\ weeks in the hospital with the first 3 days in intensive care. \nDespite this clear evidence of a felony-one aggravated assault, the \ncourt found the defendant guilty of only second-degree aggravated \nassault. The defendant was then sentenced to 2\\1/2\\ to 5 years instead \nof at least the minimum sentence of 5 to 10 years.\n  I think I misspoke. I believe the minimum sentence under a felony-one \nsentence would be 5 to 10 years, instead of 10 to 20.\n  I will not continue to discuss those cases, but there are many of \nthem. There are some 50. They are replete with just these kinds of \ncircumstances in which serious cases are reduced and the defendant is \nfound guilty on a lesser charge. For the most part, a judge's decision \nto do this is unreviewable; that is, there is no way the prosecutor can \nappeal because the failure to convict on the more serious charge is an \nacquittal on that charge. And the judge being the finder of fact, \njeopardy attaches. That is a final judgment.\n  Under the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution, \nand I am sure the Pennsylvania Constitution, criminal defendants can't \nbe tried again for that same offense. So it is over. That is a final \ndecision. So the judge has this unreviewable power. Some people do not \nrealize what the power of a judge has. They have this unreviewable \npower to make certain findings of fact that can never be reviewed. And \nthe prosecutor and the victims in separate and subsequent offenses have \nto live with that. There is nothing they can do. You can't sue a judge. \nThey have immunity. Judge Learned Hand said this about Federal judges: \n``There is nothing they can do to us. They can't fire us, and they \ncan't even dock our pay.''\n  So we are considering this nominee who has a lot of good friends and \nhas been actively involved in her community. I am not saying anything \nabout that. I am just saying that I am confident, based upon my review \nof this record, that this nominee has an unhealthy bias against law \nenforcement. It is the kind of bias that I must say is disqualifying. \nIt suggests that she ought not to be confirmed to a lifetime \nappointment. At least in Philadelphia she has to come up for election \nor review and can be removed from office if she continues to act in a \nway that is arbitrary and capricious and unjustified. But when we \nappoint somebody as a Federal judge, then they have it for life.\n  Let me say this: It is a difficult task. It is an honor to be \nnominated. I know this is not a pleasant thing for Judge Massiah-\nJackson to go through. She is still a State judge, and will be able to \ncontinue as that. And perhaps this will cause her to reevaluate whether \nor not she has been objective in this process of handling criminal \ncases. If so, then some good will come out of that.\n  I respect the Senators from Pennsylvania. This is not their nominee. \nThis is the President's nominees. He chose this nominee. He had \nbackground checks done on this nominee. He is the one that submitted \nthis name to the U.S. Senate. He asked us to vote on it. I am ready to \nvote. If people feel like we need another hearing to talk some more \nabout it, so be it. I am ready to vote. The President asked us to vote. \nI am prepared to vote, and I am prepared to vote no.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, let me congratulate the Senator from \nAlabama for his professional discussion of today, and I think that the \nSenator from Alabama has raised questions which require an answer. I \nthink that we will give Judge Massiah-Jackson an opportunity to respond \nto the questions which the distinguished Senator from Alabama has \nraised.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would like to say that whereas I concluded at the \nhearings that this nominee had these kind of tendencies based on what I \nsaw, a majority of the committee did not agree with that, and we did \nnot have the overwhelming amount of evidence that we have now. I say \nthat in all due respect to the Senator from Pennsylvania. He had a \nhearing in Pennsylvania. These things did not come up at that time. I \nunderstand. I don't criticize the district attorneys and the police. \nThey don't like to be involved in this. But I think they had to. They \nfelt they had to come forward, and they did. I think it is time now for \nus to do our job. I wanted to say that in respect to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I understand that the Senator from \nAlabama voted against Judge Massiah-Jackson at the committee level and \nhad raised questions about Judge Massiah-Jackson so that he felt those \nquestions were sufficient at that time for him to make his judgment. I \nrespect his judgment. He has raised quite a number of additional \nquestions today. And when he cites these cases about making a finding \nof a lesser included offense, he accurately states the law that those \nmatters are not reviewable, that is the conclusion of the case.\n  On a number of other matters which he has raised, those matters are \nreviewable; that where Judge Massiah-Jackson has made the decision to \nsuppress evidence, that is a reviewable matter. So when she makes that \njudgment, her decision can be overturned. And where she made the \njudgment to order a nolle pros of a case, that was subject to review as \nwell.\n  When the Senator from Alabama was present at the hearing, we \ndiscussed a number of those cases. We have both been prosecutors. We \nknow the evidentiary rules, and some matters may be reviewed. Judge \nMassiah-Jackson made quite a number of judgments which were subject to \nreview, and on a good many of them she was upheld.\n  When the Senator from Alabama raises questions about what the police \ncommunity has stated, I understand that and respect that.\n  We received one letter from the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice citing a case where Judge Massiah-Jackson did some things that \nthey write to disagree with. On that particular case, it went for \nappellate review, and the Appellate Court of Pennsylvania upheld Judge \nMassiah-Jackson. So the issue would be that these police officers and \npolice officials will have an opportunity to testify about the \nspecifics as to their judgment or whether their judgment might differ \nif they knew what had happened on appeal in the case.\n  When the Senator from Alabama talks about ``why will the judge \nidentify police officers in court,'' that is the case referred to by \nSenator Hatch earlier where those officers have already testified in \ncourt.\n  In raising questions about why Judge Massiah-Jackson would take \naction in a variety of contexts, I think those are fair and appropriate \nquestions. I think those questions are appropriate for Judge Massiah-\nJackson to have an opportunity in which to respond. To the credit of \nthe Senator from Alabama, when we had the hearing, he was there and he \nwas asking those questions.\n  I think it is not irrelevant to comment that there have been a number \nof convictions of police officers in the Federal court in Philadelphia \nrecently for falsifying evidence in drug cases. Several hundred cases \nhave been dismissed by the District Attorney of Philadelphia. The city \nof Philadelphia has paid out some $11 million in damages where you deal \nin a certain context and certain sections of a big city like \nPhiladelphia. It may differ from some other communities. I came to \nPhiladelphia from Russell, KS, and the differences were absolutely \ngigantic.\n  When I was District Attorney in Philadelphia for 8 years after being \nassistant DA for some 4 years, I had many very strong disagreements \nwith the judges. In one case, I was held in contempt of court in my \nbattle on a sentence on a narcotics case, Commonwealth v. Arnold Marks. \nI still remember it. It only happened 28 years ago--4 ounces of pure, \nuncut heroin. And I thought the sentence was insufficient. I battled \nwith the judge.\n  The judges in Philadelphia when I became DA used to come to court \nlate and leave early. I sent my detectives\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\ninto court to write down the time they arrived and the time they left \nfor lunch and the time they got back and the time they quit. Very \nfrequently, court was supposed to run 10 to 12:30 and 2 to 4--4\\1/2\\ \nhours on the bench, not a straining schedule. But they had jobs to do \nin chambers. But the common practice was to arrive a few minutes before \n11, work to about 12:10, come back at 2:50 and leave about 3:20. So I \nsent detectives in to court to write down the times.\n  Soon thereafter, one of my detectives was held in contempt. I went \ndown to the court. I said to the judge, ``You can't hold him in \ncontempt. I did the order.'' I was the District Attorney. ``If you are \ngoing to hold anybody in contempt, you have to hold me in contempt. You \ncan't hold me in contempt because anybody can come in open court and \nwrite down the times you come and go.''\n  Later, I got the Chief Justice of Pennsylvania to issue an order that \njudges had to sit from 9:30 to 5. We petitioned for reconsideration of \nsentences.\n  This business about battling with the judge is something a District \nAttorney has to do. That is the appropriate role of a public \nprosecutor. When the District Attorneys have raised questions, I think \nthat is within their rights. The police officers have raised questions. \nI think that is within their rights.\n  But let's hear what Judge Massiah-Jackson has to say. The Senator \nfrom Alabama raised a number of questions. He can't understand why a \njudge would do that. And it is a little different milieu. Let us hear \nwhat she has to say. When we have all the facts, I consider myself, as \nI said earlier, a juror. I have taken an oath as a U.S. Senator and as \na juror. I am prepared to hear both sides and to make a judgment. I \nthink the hearings will be held in the light of day. There will be full \ndisclosure. There is ample opportunity for public scrutiny, as there \nshould be, and we will make the determination on the facts and on the \nmerits as to whether this nominee should or should not be confirmed.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SANTORUM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I want to associate myself with the \nremarks of my colleague from Pennsylvania. I too feel that we here in \nthe Senate, when it comes to justice, really should be jurors, and that \nwe should get all the information. The information shared, I think, as \ncorrectly stated by my colleague from Pennsylvania and by the Senator \nfrom Alabama, was well presented. But that is information that we \nreceived from the District Attorneys Association opposed to her \nnomination, without any rebuttal or explanation from Judge Massiah-\nJackson. I will admit that some of those cases I find it hard to find \nout what a good explanation would be. But that is not for me to \nprejudge, nor as a juror should you prejudge those things.\n  So I am willing to listen. I think she needs to be given an \nopportunity.\n  The leader has not been on the floor since we brought up this \nnomination. I am not too sure that we are going to get a resolution \ntoday as to how to proceed with her nomination. But I am hopeful that \neither this evening or sometime tomorrow we will be able to come up \nwith a plan on how we are going to proceed with her nomination and have \nher nomination received in a fair fashion.\n  Again, I respect her. I think Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy \nmentioned that a hearing by the Judiciary Committee would accord the \njudge an opportunity to face this new information and respond to it, \nand give the police and the prosecutorial community an opportunity to \npresent such evidence and such testimony to the committee that they \nbelieve is important for us to consider.\n  So I hope that a full committee hearing goes through, if necessary. I \nam not on the committee. So I can charge them with whatever I please \nbecause I don't have to sit through it; but at least take a number of \nthese cases as a representative sampling of these cases and go through \nthem one by one and make a determination as to the justification that \nJudge Massiah-Jackson had in making these decisions.\n  So I am hopeful that that is the next order of business, that somehow \nor other we can come to some accommodation with the leader, who I know \nwants to vote on this nominee as quickly as possible in response to the \nPresident's urgings of up-or-down votes on his judges. I know that many \nhere, as you heard, would like to vote on this judge today. We are not \ngoing to vote on this judge today. Senator Specter and I don't want to \nvote on this judge today, and I believe there are many Members on the \nother side of the aisle who don't want to vote on this judge today. But \nwe would like the judge to be given a chance and then to have a vote. \nLet's let the string run out, if you will, give her an opportunity to \nrespond, have a vote somewhat promptly thereafter, and then let the \nSenate act as the jury, which we know it is very good at doing.\n  Mr. President, with that I will yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S549-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S561-S564]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CLOTURE VOTE ON MOTION TO PROCEED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF S. 1601\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will cast one of the \nmost important votes on health care in this Congress, and perhaps of \nthis decade. That vote will determine whether one of the most promising \navenues of research against a host of serious diseases will continue, \nor whether Congress will act to ban it--and condemn millions of \nAmericans to unnecessary death and disability.\n  The vote that will occur is on a cloture motion to take up S. 1601. \nThe authors of S. 1601 say that it is a bill to ban the production of \nhuman beings by cloning--an attempt to stop Dr. Seed and other \nunscrupulous scientists in their tracks.\n  But that claim cannot pass the truth in advertising test. S. 1601 \ngoes far beyond a ban on the cloning of human beings, which we all \nsupport. This legislation also bans the use of the technology for any \npurpose, even though the research would be used to create cures for \ncancer, diabetes, spinal cord injuries, arthritis-damaged joints, birth \ndefects, and a host of tragic diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, \nParkinson's disease, Lou Gehrig's Disease, multiple sclerosis, and many \nother serious illnesses. It is not necessary to ban all of this \nimportant life-saving research in order to achieve our goal of banning \nthe cloning of a human being.\n  Every scientist in America understands the threat this legislation \nposes to critical medical research.\n  Every American should understand it, too. A vote against this bill is \na vote for medical research. It is a vote for millions of Americans \nsuffering from serious diseases for whom this cutting-edge technology \noffers hope of new and miraculous cures.\n  A vote against this bill is certainly not a vote in favor of cloning \nhuman beings. Congress can and should act to ban the cloning of human \nbeings. But we should not pass legislation that goes far beyond what \nthe American people want or what the scientific and medical community \nsays is necessary and appropriate.\n  It should also be clear to everyone that there is absolutely no need \nto act tomorrow to prevent cloning of a human being.\n  No reputable scientist wants to clone human beings. Scientifically, \nit cannot be done yet. And the FDA, which has jurisdiction over this \narea, has made it clear that it has both the authority and intention to \nprevent any human cloning until further research is done. I ask \nunanimous consent that a letter from FDA making this point be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\n\n\n\n                                 Food and Drug Administration,\n\n                                 Rockville, MD, February 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Labor and Human \n         Resources, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: This is in response to your inquiry \n     concerning the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA or the agency) over creating a human \n     being using cloning technology. FDA already has jurisdiction \n     over such experiments and is prepared to exercise that \n     jurisdiction. While FDA's authority does not address the \n     larger question of whether or not creating a human being \n     using cloning technology should be altogether prohibited, \n     this authority will ensure that such experimentation does not \n     proceed until basic questions about safety are answered.\n       Creating a human being using cloning technology is subject \n     to FDA regulation under the Public Health Service Act and the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Under these statutes \n     and implementing FDA regulations, clinical research on the \n     creation of a human being using cloning technology may \n     proceed only when an investigational new drug application \n     (IND) is in effect. Before such research may begin, the \n     sponsor of the research is required to submit to FDA an IND \n     describing the proposed research plan, to obtain \n     authorization from an independent institutional review board, \n     and to obtain the informed consent of all participating \n     individuals. FDA may prohibit a sponsor from conducting the \n     study (often referred to as placing the study on ``clinical \n     hold'') for a variety of reasons, including if the Agency \n     finds that ``human subjects are or would be exposed to an \n     unreasonable and significant risk of illness or injury,'' \n     ``the IND does not contain sufficient information required . \n     . . to assess the risks to subjects of the proposed \n     studies,'' or ``the clinical investigators . . . are not \n     qualified by reason of their scientific training and \n     experience to conduct the investigation.'' At a minimum, the \n     sponsor must wait at least 30 days after submitting its \n     proposal to FDA before beginning any study.\n       In the case of attempts to create a human being using \n     cloning technology, there are major unresolved safety \n     questions. Until those questions are appropriately addressed, \n     the Agency would not permit any such investigation to \n     proceed.\n       We hope this information is useful to you in your \n     deliberations. If we may be of any further assistance, please \n     let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                         Sharon Smith Holston,\n\n                                               Deputy Commissioner\n                                             for External Affairs.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Senator Feinstein and I strongly support a ban on the \ncloning of human beings. We have introduced legislation to accomplish \nthat goal. We hope that it can be reviewed through the normal committee \nprocess of hearings and mark-up. Responsible legislation to ban the \ncloning of human beings can and should be enacted. But S. 1601 is not \nsuch legislation.\n  It is an attempt to capitalize on public concern to rush through a \nsweeping and unacceptable ban on a wide array of medical research.\n  Every day, the concern about this legislation and the opposition to \nit grows.\n  President Clinton and the Administration strongly support responsible \nlegislation to ban human cloning. The President called for a ban on \ncreation of a human being by cloning in the State of the Union message. \nIf S. 1601 were simply a ban on creation of a human being by cloning, \nit would receive the Administration's wholehearted support.\n  But that is not what S. 1601 does, and that is why the Administration \nsays in its letter:\n\n       The Administration . . . believes S. 1601, as introduced, \n     is too far-reaching because it would prohibit important \n     biomedical research aimed at preventing and treating serious \n     and life-threatening disease. Therefore, the Administration \n     does not support passage of the bill in its current form.\n\n  As the scientific and medical community learns more about this \nlegislation, almost universal opposition is developing. The American \nAssociation of Medical Colleges has circulated a letter to other \nscientific and medical organizations asking that this legislation not \ngo forward.\n  The letter is signed by 71 distinguished organizations, from the \nAmerican Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, to the Association \nof American Cancer Institutes to the Parkinson's Action Network--and \nthe list continues to grow.\n  The letter states:\n\n       The current opportunities in biomedical research are \n     unparalleled in our nation's history. To ensure that these \n     continue, the scientific and organized medicine communities \n     urge you to oppose legislation that would prohibit the use of \n     somatic cell nuclear transfer due to the grave implications \n     it may have for future advances in biomedical research in \n     human healing.\n\n  The letter goes on to compare S. 1601's attempts to ban not just \ncloning of human beings but use of the technique itself to the ill-\nconsidered attempts to ban recombinant DNA techniques in the early \n1970's. They state:\n\n       Like the recombinant DNA debate, the scientific techniques \n     involved in cloning research hold great promise for our \n     ability to treat and manage myriad diseases and disorders--\n     from cancer and heart disease, to Parkinson's and \n     Alzheimer's, to infertility and HIV/AIDS.\n\n  Just yesterday, Alan Holmer, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturer's \nAssociation's President sent up a letter to members of the Senate on \nbehalf of our nation's research pharmaceutical industry members urging \na ``no'' vote on cloture on S. 1601.\n  He said:\n\n       Pharmaceutical companies and their researchers are not, nor \n     do they support, cloning entire human beings. However, \n     without more deliberation and a meaningful opportunity for \n     comment by the scientific and patient communities, we fear \n     that passage of this bill also will foreclose a promising \n     line of research.\n       The research involves stem cells which, unlike most other \n     cells of the human body, retain the ability to renew \n     themselves and to differentiate into specialized cells. Based \n     upon a better understanding of the differentiation process, \n     scientists may be able to take the cell of a patient \n     paralyzed by an accident, induce that cell to return to a \n     primary state, and then coax it to differentiate into the \n     spinal cord nerve cell needed by that patient. Such cells \n     than could be transplanted back into the patient, whose body \n     would not reject those perfect genetic matches. This \n     procedure could help not only victims of traumatic injuries, \n     but also patients suffering from diabetes, cancer, \n     Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, cystic fibrosis, muscular \n     dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, and other dread diseases that \n     cause suffering and death, reduce the quality of life for \n     both patients and their families, and cost our economy \n     hundreds of billions of dollars annually.\n       Any hope for such cell-based therapies would be stymied if \n     this avenue of research were foreclosed.\n\n  These are our great research pharmaceutical companies speaking, the \ncompanies we depend upon to turn basic research in the laboratory into \nmedical miracles at the patient's bedside. And they are saying, ``Stop \nthis bill, because it could destroy our hope to find cures for these \ndread diseases.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed \nin the Record.\n       There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Pharmaceutical Research and\n\n\n                                     Manufacturers of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1998.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the research-based \n     pharmaceutical industry, I urge you to vote against the \n     motion for cloture on S. 1601 on Tuesday, February 10. More \n     time is required to ensure that a goal of the sponsors is \n     indeed achieved; the protection of biomedical research that \n     benefits patients.\n       S. 1601 aims to ban the cloning of a ``human individual.'' \n     Pharmaceutical companies and their researchers are not, nor \n     do they support, cloning entire human beings. However, \n     without more deliberation and a meaningful opportunity for \n     comment by the scientific and patient communities, we fear \n     that passage of this bill also will foreclose a promising \n     line of research.\n       The research involves stem cells which, unlike most other \n     cells of the human body, retain the ability to renew \n     themselves and to differentiate into specialized cells. Based \n     upon a better understanding of the differentiation process, \n     scientists may be able to take the cell of a patient \n     paralyzed by an accident, induce that cell to return to a \n     primary state, and then coax it to differentiate into the \n     spinal cord nerve cell needed by that patient. Such cells \n     then could be transplanted back into the patient, whose body \n     would not reject these perfect genetic matches. This \n     procedure could help not only victims of traumatic injuries, \n     but also patients suffering from diabetes, cancer, \n     Alzheimer's Parkinson's cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy, \n     multiple sclerosis, and other dread diseases that cause \n     suffering and death, reduce the quality of life for both \n     patients and their families, and cost our economy hundreds of \n     billions of dollars annually.\n       Any hope for such cell-based therapies would be stymied if \n     this avenue of research were foreclosed. We, therefore, urge \n     you to seek and consider carefully the views of scientists in \n     the government, academia and industry, as well as patients \n     with unmet medical needs.\n       We believe legislation is unnecessary since the Food and \n     Drug Administration has announced it will prevent the cloning \n     of an entire human being by regulation. But since legislation \n     now appears likely, it should: Prohibit the act of cloning an \n     entire human being rather than prohibit a biomedical research \n     or use of a particular technology or\n\n[[Page S563]]\n\n     focus on a researcher's intent; contain a savings clause that \n     protects biomedical research (including that described \n     above); preempt state legislation to ensure uniform \n     implementation; establish civil money penalties as the \n     enforcement mechanism; bar a private right of action (private \n     lawsuits); a reasonable sunset (Perhaps five years, as \n     recommended by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission) to \n     ensure a deliberate review of the ethical and safety issues.\n       None of the current legislative proposals meet these \n     criteria.\n       Human beings are not being cloned today, but millions and \n     millions of patients are being helped by biomedical \n     researchers using state-of-the art technologies to clone \n     individual human genes and cells. We hope you will consider \n     the dreams of patients and their families, and vote ``no'' on \n     the motion for cloture tomorrow.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan F. Holmer.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Also yesterday, twenty-seven Nobel prize-winners \nsubmitted a letter opposing cloning legislation that would choke off \ncritical medical research. The more the research community understands \nwhat the Lott-Bond bill will do, the more alarmed they become.\n  An editorial in the New York Times this morning represents a growing \nsense of concern in newspapers around the country. The editorial is \nentitled, ``A Slapdash Approach to Cloning.'' It states:\n\n       Senate Republicans are now rushing to enact a bill that \n     would outlaw cloning a human embryo and, in the process, ban \n     a valuable technique that could potentially cure a wide range \n     of diseases. No wonder a slew of scientific associations and \n     high-tech industry groups are urging more carefully \n     constructed legislation. The sensitive scientific and moral \n     issues involved here require careful handling, not \n     grandstanding by politicians more interested in pandering \n     than in reaching a reasoned solution.\n\n  The editorial concludes:\n\n       When the matter comes up for a floor vote this week, the \n     Senate should postpone action and demand more considered \n     deliberation. It would be a shame if the rush to ban cloning \n     of people ended up crippling biomedical research.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the editorial be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Feb. 10, 1998]\n\n                     A Slapdash Proposal on Cloning\n\n       The shock caused by the physicist Richard Seed's grandiose \n     intention to clone human beings may be about to cause more \n     damage than anything Dr. Seed could do in the laboratory. \n     Senator Republicans are now rushing to enact a bill that \n     would outlaw cloning a human embryo and, in the process, ban \n     a valuable technique that could potentially cure a wide range \n     of diseases. No wonder a slew of scientific associations and \n     high-tech industry groups are urging more carefully \n     constructed legislation. The sensitive scientific and moral \n     issues involved here require careful handling, not \n     grandstanding by politicians more interested in pandering \n     than in reaching a reasoned solution.\n       Congress may ultimately want to impose limits on cloning, a \n     technique that has arrived sooner than expected with the \n     announcement last year that Scottish scientists had cloned a \n     lamb from the cell of an adult sheep. That achievement, if it \n     proves practical in humans, would make it possible to take a \n     cell from an adult and use it to produce a genetically \n     identical twin many years younger than the parent. A national \n     bioethics commission, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical \n     industries and many scientific groups have all called for a \n     moratorium on actually cloning a person until society has \n     time to grapple with the ethical and moral issues.\n       But the bill sponsored by the Republican Senators \n     Christopher Bond, William Frist and Judd Gregg does not \n     simply prohibit the use of cloning to produce a human embryo \n     for implantation in the womb. It would also prohibit use of \n     the technique to produce genetically identical tissues in the \n     laboratory to treat diseases or injuries where a person's \n     existing cells are damaged or insufficient. Such ailments \n     include leukemia, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord \n     injury, heart attacks and severe burns, among others.\n       The Republicans contend that even these approaches require \n     creating what amounts to an embryo in the laboratory and then \n     experimenting on it to produce the desired tissues. But that \n     is a complex matter of definitions and techniques that \n     requires careful evaluation. The Republican bill and others \n     on the subject have not even gone through committee hearings. \n     When the matter comes up for a floor vote this week, the \n     Senate should postpone action and demand more considered \n     deliberation. It would be a shame if the rush to ban cloning \n     of people ended up crippling biomedical research.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. A letter from Dr. Gerald R. Fink, the Director of the \nWhitehead Institute of the American Cancer Society--one of the pre-\neminent cancer research institutes in the country--explains very \nclearly what is at stake.\n  Dr. Fink says:\n\n       I am very concerned about efforts to bring the Bond bill to \n     an immediate vote. While I agree that there should be a \n     national ban on human cloning, it is essential that any such \n     law protects areas of critical research that can benefit \n     human health. The Bond bill's generic ban on the use of \n     `human somatic cell transfer technology,' would in fact be \n     quite damaging to medical research progress in the United \n     States.\n       The Bond bill would seriously limit our ability to develop \n     new cell-based strategies to fight cancer, diabetes, and \n     Alzheimer's disease. It would also prevent vital research on \n     the repair of spinal cord injuries and severe burns.\n       I urge you to convey to your colleagues that the Bond bill \n     would cause us to lose ground in the battle against deadly \n     and disabling human diseases.\n\n  Surely, what the Senate and the American people do not want to lose \nground in the battle against deadly and disabling human diseases.\n  More than 120 scientific and medical organizations have expressed \nopposition to the Lott-Bond bill or concerns about prohibition on \nlegitimate cloning research as the result of ill-conceived or over-\nbroad legislation.\n  An immense array of scientific and medical societies and patient \ngroups is opposing S. 1601. They urge us to use caution and not rush \nahead without adequate consideration. Supporters of this bill say that \nit won't impede necessary research. If this is true, where is their \nsupport from people who know. I challenge them to cite mainstream \nscientific or medical organizations supporting their legislation. At \nthe very least, we should not rush ahead without committee hearings, \nadequate definitions, or even a semblance of careful consideration. The \nscientific and medical and patients' communities know that such \nexcessive legislation is wrong.\n  The substance of this bill is objectionable, and so is the procedure \nby which it is being considered. To pass this bill tomorrow would be a \ntravesty of the Senate's role as a deliberative body.\n  This is one of the most important scientific and ethical issues of \nthe 21st century.\n  It was introduced on Tuesday of last week.\n  It was put directly on the Senate calendar on Wednesday, with no \nreferral to a committee.\n  The Majority Leader tried to bring it to the floor last Thursday and \nfiled an immediate cloture motion when he was unsuccessful.\n  The Senate was not in session Friday--and few of our colleagues were \npresent on Monday.\n  This legislation has not received one day--not one hour of committee \nhearings here in the Senate.\n  It has not received one minute of committee discussion and markup.\n  The telephones in many of our offices are ringing off the hooks from \nscientists and physicians and patients across the country who are \ndeeply concerned about the impact of this legislation. But he have had \nno opportunity for their voices to be heard.\n  This is an important issue. It warrants Senate consideration. But it \ndoes not warrant consideration under this accelerated and indefensible \nprocedure.\n  The authors of this legislation know that it cannot stand up to \npublic scrutiny, and they should not be making this extraordinary \nattempt to rush this legislation through the Senate.\n  The Bond bill does not just ban cloning of human beings, it bans \nvital medical research related to cloning--research which has the \npotential to find new cures for cancer, diabetes, birth defects and \ngenetic diseases of all kinds, blindness, Parkinson's disease, \nAlzheimer's disease, paralysis due to spinal cord injury, arthritis, \nliver disease, life-threatening burns, and many other illnesses and \ninjuries.\n  Here is what the bill says--page 2, line 13, paragraph 301 is \nentitled, ``Prohibition on cloning.'' It is the heart of the bill. It \nstates, ``It shall be unlawful for any person or entity, public or \nprivate, in or affecting interstate commerce, to use human somatic cell \nnuclear transfer technology.'' That is the end of the statement. It \ndoes not just ban the technology for use of human cloning. It bans if \nfor any purpose at all.\n  That means scientists can't use the technology to try to grow cells \nto aid\n\n[[Page S564]]\n\nmen and women dying of leukemia. They can't use it to grow new eye \ntissue to help those going blind from certain types of cell \ndegeneration. They can't use it to grow new pancreas cells to cure \ndiabetes. They can't use it to regenerate brain tissue to cure those \nwith Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease. They can't use it to \ngrow spinal cord tissue to cure those who have been paralyzed in \naccidents or by war wounds.\n  Congress should ban the production of human being by cloning. But we \nshould not ban scientific research that has so much potential to bring \nhelp and hope to millions of citizens. As J. Benjamin Younger, \nExecutive Director of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, \nhas said:\n\n       We must work together to ensure that in our effort to make \n     human cloning illegal, we do not sentence millions of people \n     to needless suffering because research and progress into \n     their illness cannot proceed.\n\n  Let us work together. Let us stop this unnecessarily destructive \nknow-nothing bill. Let us vote against cloture tomorrow and send this \nbill to committee, where it can receive the careful consideration it \ndeserves. Together, we can develop legislation that will ban the \ncloning of human beings, without banning needed medical research that \ncan bring the blessings of good health to so many millions of our \nfellow citizens.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to join in this effort with my friend \nand colleague and our leader in this whole effort, the Senator from \nCalifornia, Senator Feinstein.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. May I inquire as to the state of business in the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order is the nomination of \nFrederica A. Massiah-Jackson.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S561-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S564-S566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF FREDERICA A. MASSIAH-JACKSON, OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO BE \n UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The Senate continued with consideration of the nomination.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise to continue my argument and my \ndebate in regard to this candidate for Federal judgeship nominated by \nPresident Clinton.\n  Earlier in the day, I had raised several objections to this \nparticular nomination, and in response to my objections, a number of \nanswers were developed on the part of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nwant to return to my objections. I think they are well-founded, I think \nthey are important, and I think they should be observed and understood \nby the Senate.\n  I raised the objection today that the absence of judicial temperament \non the part of this judicial nominee was an infirmity which should be \nconsidered by the Senate. In particular, I said that she had used the \nfoulest of profanities known to the English language in open court and \nin reference to a prosecutor.\n  In explaining that, a proponent of this nomination indicated, ``Well, \neveryone has used profanity at one time or another.'' Let me just point \nout that I think the use of profanity in open court by the judge \npresiding over the court is different than the fellow who hits his \nfinger with a nail while fixing the fence in the backyard. As a matter \nof fact, I think it would be important for me to just outline just what \nhappened in this instance.\n  In the case of Commonwealth v. Hannibal, in response to a \nprosecutor's attempt to be afforded an opportunity to be heard--the \nprosecutor was asking for the judge's attention--the following exchange \ntook place on the record:\n\n       The Court [judge]: Please keep quiet, Ms. McDermott.\n       Ms. McDermott [for the Commonwealth]: Will I be afforded--\n     --\n       The Court: Ms. McDermott, will you shut your [blanking] \n     mouth?\n\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson was formally admonished by the Judicial Inquiry \nand Review Board for using intemperate language in the courtroom.\n  I realize she has apologized in this respect for having done so, but \nI think it tells us something about the temperament of the individual \ninvolved. I don't think it is very instructive just to concede that \nother people may have used profanity at some place or on the ball field \nor in the cloakroom. The use of profanity in this Chamber would be a \nserious affront to this Chamber, as would any personal attack or other \nindiscretion or discourtesy in this Chamber. But let me go to a second \nexample that relates to the judicial temperament displayed by this \nindividual.\n  The case of Commonwealth v. Burgos and Commonwealth v. Rivera. During \na sentencing proceeding, the prosecutor told Judge Massiah-Jackson that \nshe had forgotten to inform one of the defendants of the consequences \nof failing to file a timely appeal. Such a failure would prejudice the \nCommonwealth on appeal. Judge Massiah-Jackson responded to this legal \nargument with profanity, stating: ``I don't give a [blank],'' and the \nword is probably imaginable.\n  A district attorney, John Morganelli, the Democratic District \nAttorney of Northampton County, Pennsylvania, has suggested that the \nreason there are not more instances of this foul language on the record \nis that Judge Massiah-Jackson's principal court reporter routinely \n``sanitized the record,'' and the instances I have referred to here \noccurred in settings where, according to District Attorney Morganelli, \nthere was not the regular court reporter.\n  Now, I know that people lose their temper and that people use \nprofanity, but I think these incidents reflect the absence of the \nrequisite judicial temperament, but I think it reflects more than that. \nWhen you indicate to officers of the court that you are disparaging \ntheir character, when you describe someone's mouth with foul language, \nyou are not just using foul language, you are attributing a character \ndeficit to an officer of the court, a prosecutor. I think that is \nunacceptable.\n  Perhaps those would be the kinds of things to be ignored or \noverlooked or to pass by, but I find it disconcerting. I find it \ndisconcerting that it would be suggested that, well, since everybody \nuses profanity, it's OK for judges to use profanity in open court.\n  I raised the issue earlier today of the contempt for prosecutors and \npolice officers on the part of Judge Massiah-Jackson. It was suggested \nthat the fact that she revealed two undercover police officers and \npointed them out to be observed in the courtroom was a way of \nthreatening their safety, because drug dealers would have an extra \nchance to look at them and know who they are and to be cognizant of the \nfact that they might be persons from whom a drug buy might be made \nsometime and, be careful, these people would be part of a prosecution \neffort.\n  The Senator defending the judicial nominee of the President \nindicated, ``Well, these people had already testified in court, so it \nperhaps didn't matter.'' Well, it may not have. It may have been that \nduring the testimony, they were seen by the other people. But let's \nlook exactly at what Judge Massiah-Jackson said about these individuals \nand see if it tells us something about whether or not we would want \nthis kind of person to be a Federal judge appointed for life, a Federal \njudge endowed with the authority of the United States of America, \nanswerable to no one.\n  As the officers were leaving the courtroom, the judge told spectators \nin the court:\n\n       Take a good look at these guys and be careful out there.\n\n  I submit to you that for a judge to say, take a good look at these \npolice officers and basically say, ``Watch out for them, they're the \nguys who might apprehend you in your nefarious activities,'' tells us \nsomething about the judge.\n  I quoted earlier the president of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of \nPolice, who said that the officers involved felt like this was a threat \nto them, that it would expose them additionally to bodily harm.\n  It was suggested by a Senator defending the nomination that that was \nunreasonable, and it may not be as big a threat as some might think it \nto be,\n\n[[Page S565]]\n\nbut Detective Sergeant Daniel Rodriquez confirmed the outrageous \ncourtroom incident in a signed letter to the Senate. The detective \nsergeant had the following comments regarding this incident:\n\n       I thought ``I hope I don't ever have to make buys from \n     anyone in this courtroom.'' They would know me, but I \n     wouldn't know them. What the judge said jeopardized our \n     ability to make buys and put us in physical danger.\n\n  It may well be that there are arguments that could be expressed in \nthe Senate a couple hundred miles away that it really didn't put these \nofficers in danger. I can't really say whether it would or it wouldn't, \nbut I am prepared to take the word of the police officer involved, and \nI am prepared to consider his statement to be honest, and I am prepared \nto understand that he feels restrained now as a police officer in a way \nthat he wouldn't have felt restrained previously.\n  It appears to me that Judge Massiah-Jackson was willing to make \nstatements which would impair the capacity of police officers to \nfunction. Detective Sergeant Daniel Rodriquez felt strongly enough \nabout it to make such a comment in writing.\n\n  Detective Terrance Jones, the other undercover officer that was \nidentified and disclosed and about whom the warning was issued to the \npeople in the courtroom by Judge Massiah-Jackson, also confirmed the \nfacts of the situation in a signed statement to the committee staff. He \nstated that the ``comments jeopardized our lives.''\n  It may be that there are those on the floor of the Senate who don't \ntake the comments that seriously. I really think that Judge Massiah-\nJackson must not have taken seriously the threat to the integrity of \nthese officers; she must not have believed them. Maybe some Senators \ndon't believe them either. But Detective Jones said that the comments \nof the judge jeopardized the lives of police officers. Maybe not, but I \nwould tend to think if I were an undercover police officer, that kind \nof exposure and identification, even if you had already testified, they \nmust have felt that there was something there that was substantially \nthreatening.\n  He wrote in his letter:\n\n       As a law enforcement officer who happens to be an African-\n     American, I am appalled that self-interest groups and the \n     media are trying to make the Massiah-Jackson controversy into \n     a racial issue. This is not about race, this is about the \n     best candidate for the position of Federal judge.\n\n  And it is obvious he doesn't think the best candidate is Judge \nMassiah-Jackson after she, in fact, jeopardized his life, according to \nhim.\n  Earlier today, I also raised the point about contempt for prosecutors \nand police officers, and that seemed to be construed as some sort of \ninappropriate attack.\n  In this case, let me talk about another example, Commonwealth v. \nHicks. In an action that led to a reversal by the appellate court, \nJudge Massiah-Jackson dismissed charges against the defendant on her \nown motion.\n  Although the prosecution was prepared to proceed, the defense was not \nready because the defense was missing a witness. A police officer who \nwas scheduled to testify for the defense apparently had not received \nhis subpoena. The defense requested a continuance, saying, ``OK, we'll \ntry this later. We'll clear up this mixup concerning the subpoena.'' \nThe Commonwealth stated it had issued the subpoena.\n  The defense did not allege any wrongdoing or failure to act on the \npart of the Commonwealth. It did not say the Commonwealth failed to \nissue the subpoena, that they fouled this up, that the case was fouled \nup as a result of misdeeds on the part of the State or the \nCommonwealth.\n  Nevertheless, without any evidence or prompting from the defense \ncounsel, Judge Massiah-Jackson simply did not believe that the \nCommonwealth's attorney subpoenaed the necessary witness. So here you \nhave the defense unprepared to go forward, and the judge held the \nCommonwealth liable for the defense's unpreparedness, and on the \ncourt's own motion dismissed the case.\n  Here is a judge that expresses her contempt for the court and the \nprosecutors, profaning the court and profaning the prosecutors. Here is \na judge who expresses her contempt for police officers by \ninappropriately identifying them and warning the community against \npolice officers. You have a judge who is willing to dismiss cases on \nher own motion even when the defense is willing to just take a \ncontinuance to clear the matter up and to bring the witnesses to court.\n  What it turns out to be in the case is that the missing defense \nwitness had been on vacation. The subpoena had been issued by the \nCommonwealth. The officer had not received it, but the Commonwealth had \ndone everything it possibly could to issue the subpoena to help assist \nthe defense in the preparation of the trial by providing the necessary \nwitness. And Judge Massiah-Jackson's decision obviously was reversed on \nappeal as an abuse of discretion. But it tells us something. It tells \nus something about this judge and this judge's attitude toward police \nofficers and prosecutors.\n  The appellate court concluded, having carefully reviewed the record:\n\n       We are unable to determine the basis for the trial court's \n     decision to discharge the defendant. Indeed, the trial court \n     was unable to justify its decision by citation to rule or \n     law.\n\n  When a judge does something and cannot cite any rule or any law to \nsupport it, the judge is just imposing her own preference, her own \npersonal preference in the matter.\n  The imposition of judges' personal preferences is one of the real \nchallenges we face in this country in a crisis of what I call \n``judicial activism.''\n  One of the other issues I raised regarding Judge Massiah-Jackson is \nthe issue of leniency in sentencing.\n  Here is an example. Commonwealth vs. Nesmith. The defendant had a \ncriminal history of 3 prior juvenile arrests and 1 adjudication, 19 \nprior adult arrests, 8 convictions, 3 commitments, 3 violations and 2 \nrevocations. If we were at the right season of the year we could then \nend with ``and a partridge in a pear tree.'' Nineteen prior arrests, 8 \nconvictions.\n  He was tried and convicted of striking a pedestrian with his car, \nleaving her seriously injured--broken legs, pelvis, four bones of the \nback--by the side of the road, fleeing the scene of the crime, and then \nbeating into unconsciousness one of the woman's relatives who tried to \nthwart his escape. Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced him to 2 years' \nprobation--probation. This is an individual with eight previous \nconvictions. Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced him to 2 years' probation, \na sentence that deviated more than 3 years below the lowest point of \nthe standard range of the guidelines and more than 2 years below even \nthe lowest point of the mitigated range.\n  The defendant committed these crimes while on parole, having just \nbeen released from prison for an assault conviction. Over the \nCommonwealth's strenuous objection, Judge Massiah-Jackson sentenced him \nto 2 years' probation. Judge Massiah-Jackson, however, explained that \nthe defendant's actions were ``not really criminal. He had merely been \ninvolved in a car accident.''\n\n  You wonder about a judge who can look at an individual who hits a \npedestrian, flees the scene of the crime, beats into unconsciousness \none of the women's relatives who tried to thwart his escape, and then \ncharacterizes the activity as merely being the activity of one who has \nbeen involved in a car accident.\n  Here is another instance of leniency in sentencing.\n  Commonwealth vs. Freeman. The defendant shot and wounded Mr. Fuller \nin the chest because Mr. Fuller had laughed at him. I don't know how \nyou know someone is laughing at you or whether they are laughing \nbecause they just have a thought of something funny. In any event, the \ndefendant shot and wounded Fuller in the chest because Fuller had \nlaughed at him.\n  Judge Massiah-Jackson convicted the defendant of a misdemeanor \ninstead of felony aggravated assault. She sentenced him to 2 to 23 \nmonths--not 2 to 23 years--2 to 23 months, and then immediately paroled \nhim so that he did not have to serve jail time. The felony charge would \nhave had a mandatory 5- to 10-year prison term. Judge Massiah-Jackson \nexplained her decision, stating that ``the victim had been drinking \nbefore being shot''--the victim had been drinking before he was shot--\n``and that (the defendant) had not been involved in any other crime \nsince the incident.''\n\n[[Page S566]]\n\n  I think the people of the United States of America deserve a judge \nwho will say that an individual who shoots someone, perhaps for smiling \nor laughing, is an individual who deserves a serious sentence.\n  Here is yet another example of lenient sentencing, Commonwealth vs. \nBurgos. During a raid on the defendant's house, police seized more than \n2 pounds of cocaine, along with evidence that the house was a \ndistribution center--2 pounds of cocaine. The street value of 2 pounds \nof cocaine is astronomical.\n  The defendant, Mouin Burgos, was convicted. Judge Massiah-Jackson \nsentenced the defendant only to 1 year's probation. Then-District \nAttorney Ron Castille criticized Judge Massiah-Jackson's sentence as \n``defying logic'' and being ``totally bizarre.'' He commented:\n\n       This judge just sits in her ivory tower . . .. She ought to \n     walk along the streets some night and get a dose of what is \n     really going on out there. She should have sentenced these \n     people to what they deserve.\n\n  Well, earlier this afternoon I had the privilege of relating the fact \nthat virtually the entire law enforcement community of Pennsylvania has \nnoticed this predisposition to be antagonistic to law enforcement.\n  The Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania District Attorneys' \nAssociation voted unanimously to voice their objection to the \nappointment of this individual to the Federal bench. The Fraternal \nOrder of Police, both locally and nationally, has expressed its \nopposition to this nominee. And frankly, the Democrat district attorney \nin Philadelphia sent a letter saying this is the worst judge that she \nhad ever seen. The letter also states her opinion that whoever is \nappointed to the Federal district court for that district should be a \nblack woman--that they need to have a black woman on the bench there--\nbut also stating that Judge Massiah-Jackson cannot be the one.\n  It takes real courage for a district attorney to say that about a \njudge who will stay in her current role if the Senate heeds the warning \nof the district attorney. And the district attorney will have to \ncontinue to send prosecutors into that court and be involved in that \nlegal environment. But not only did District Attorney Abraham from \nPhiladelphia, who is a Democrat, make such a contention, District \nAttorney Morganelli also made the same kind of statements, saying that \nwe really have no business confirming an individual whose record is so \nreplete with this kind of abuse.\n  These points are points that I believe are easily understood. It \ntakes a substantial amount of effort to obscure these points. But these \npoints are understood--and they are painfully understood by those who \nare closest to this situation and involved in the courts on a daily \nbasis: the police officers and prosecutors. Obviously, we would not \nexpect defense attorneys to be here objecting to this nominee.\n  This nominee lacks the fundamental commitment to the judicial system, \nto respect it, and to respect the participants of it. She has \ndemonstrated that on many occasions. And profanity in the courtroom is \nimportant. It reflects a disregard for the court. But when it is \nprofanity directed to officers of the court, it is a disregard for the \nsystem itself. And I do not think it is appropriate to minimize that. \nIt makes a difference to me. I think it makes a difference to the \nAmerican people whether or not we have judges who respect the \ninstitution over which they preside.\n  I raise the issues about the antagonism to the police. It is pretty \nclear that when you warn the community to be careful of the police, to \n``watch out,'' that you reveal a disrespect for this system that we do \nnot need to institutionalize on the Federal bench. And when you use \nvirtually every contrivance that you could possibly imagine, and even \nthen when the appellate court says there is no basis in law, no basis \nin rule that would support the kind of leniency that you find in some \nof these cases, I think it is pretty clear that we have an individual \nwhose predisposition is so favorable to the violators of the law that \nthose who would enforce the law and the need for the culture to enforce \nthe law are at a serious disadvantage in a courtroom like that.\n  It is clear to me--very clear to me--that this is a nominee whose \nresume does not merit reward, whose recommendation by the President \nshould be withdrawn rather than confirmed.\n  During the closing hours of the session last year, prior to the break \nfor the year-end recess, the Judiciary Committee was meeting. There was \na debate over whether to send this nominee to the floor. And among \nthose who are now saying that we have to have more meetings and more \ntime in the committee were those who carried me to one of the anterooms \noff the committee room, and begged me, ``Let's send this to the floor \nso it can be debated on the floor.'' I said, ``I don't think this is \nappropriate to send to the floor.'' And they said, ``You don't have to \nsupport her on the floor, but do not stop the committee from acting to \nsend her to the floor at this time.''\n  Frankly, the rules of the committee would have made it possible for \nme at that time to have stopped this individual from coming to the \nfloor. It just strikes me as ironic that those who prevailed on me to \nsend this nominee to the floor, and to allow her to come to the floor, \nare now arguing that somehow those of us who want to vote on this \ncandidate on the floor or a withdrawal by the President are doing an \ninjustice--that somehow by accommodating them and providing a basis \nwhich would allow the candidate to make it to the floor, that we were \nnow wanting to act on that candidate and somehow wanting to act \ninappropriately.\n  I think all of that is just so much process--whether you had the \ncommittee hearings, and how many you had. The key to this whole \nsituation is, what kind of information do you have? And do you have the \ncapacity to make a good judgment about whether or not to confirm a \nnominee of the President of the United States?\n  This nominee who disrespects the system, disrespects the \nparticipants, disrespects law enforcement, this nominee who has done \nvirtually everything within her power to make it easy on those who have \nviolated the law and tough on those who would enforce the law, does not \nmerit our confirmation. The President ought to withdraw her nomination, \nand, absent that, the Senate should vote to reject this nomination for \nthe Federal bench.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to depart from \nthe regular order and enter a period of morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask to be recognized to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S564-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S566-S580]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HUMAN CLONING PROHIBITION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I will follow on the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts, since the Senate is scheduled \ntomorrow to vote on a cloture motion, whether to move Senate bill 1601, \na bill that prohibits the cloning of human beings. I will clarify where \nwe are and what the issues really are.\n  Let me be clear at the outset: I support a ban on the cloning of \nhuman beings. There is widespread agreement that the cloning of a human \nbeing should be prohibited. That agreement, I believe, exists in the \nCongress. It clearly exists in the scientific community. It exists in \nthe medical community, in the religious community, and it exists in \nvirtually every patient and health group that I know of.\n  I submit, Mr. President, that the cloning of human beings is \nscientifically unsafe; it is dangerous; it is morally unacceptable; and \nit is ethically flawed. We should enact a ban. We should pass a law \nthat establishes the illegality of human cloning and sets forth \nappropriate penalties.\n  The argument I make today is not the ban, but how the bill before the \nSenate tomorrow, the Bond-Frist bill, would affect scientific research. \nI introduced identical bills with Senator Kennedy, Senate bills 1602 \nand 1611 which would protect research that someday, we believe, is \nlikely to provide cures for many of the most dreaded diseases.\n\n[[Page S567]]\n\n  Some examples are treatments for damaged nerve cells, for spinal cord \ninjuries, blood cell therapies for leukemia and sickle cell anemia, \nliver cell transplants for liver damage, cartilage cells for \nreconstruction of joints damaged by arthritis or injuries, the creation \nof stem cells to treat burn victims, and the creation of cells to treat \nsome 5,000 different genetic diseases.\n  The bill that the leadership is trying to rush through the Senate, \nSenate bills 1599 and 1601, would make it a crime with up to 10 years \nin prison to conduct that kind of research--research that someday will \nsave lives and suffering.\n  Those bills, because they don't have clear scientific terms, they \ndon't have definitions of critical words which are part of somatic cell \nnuclear transfer technology, would submit scientists to prison terms \nfor treatments using this technique. These penalties would have a \nserious, chilling effect on promising scientific research.\n  Somatic cell nuclear transfer--and I am a newcomer to this so I have \nhad a crash course, and I still have an awful lot to learn--this \ntransfer process is its own science. It has a lexicon all of its own. \nScientists tell us that the traditional definitions of reproductive \nhealth--the traditional definitions of reproductive health--do not fit \nsomatic cell nuclear transfer. There is the rub.\n  S. 1601 uses these terms but doesn't define them. The bill doesn't \ndefine somatic cell, for example. Now, what I know a somatic cell to be \nis a cell in your body. You can take a cell from a mammary gland. In \nDolly's case, the cell was taken from the udder.\n\n  Additionally, the bill does not define embryo or preimplantation \nembryo. It does not define oocyte. Without clear, scientifically \naccurate definitions, we don't know what we are talking about and \nscientists will be reluctant to conduct research that might save lives \nand alleviate human suffering.\n  That is the bottom line of asking for a delay, of asking that the \nSenate's proper procedures be employed so that the scientific community \ncan come forward, provide their definitions, explain them, we can \ndebate them and clearly understand what we are doing.\n  My father used to tell me that the first tenet of medicine is ``Do no \nharm.'' We can do great harm by proceeding without a full understanding \nof what this is all about.\n  According to the Biotechnology Industry Association, Senate bill 1601 \nwould go beyond the issue of human cloning and would outlaw research to \ncreate stem cells. It would make it a crime for doctors to use a \ncurrently effective treatment for mitochondrial disease. The \nBiotechnology Industry Association says, ``In this treatment, women who \nhave this disease have an extreme and tragic form of infertility. The \ndisease is a disease of the mitochondria an essential element of any \negg. The treatment for this disease involves the use of a fertilized \nnucleus which is transferred through the use of somatic cell nuclear \ntransfer to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed. The new egg \nis a fresh, endocyst egg. The current Bond bill would make it a crime \nto provide this treatment even though the nucleus which is transferred \nis the product of fertilization and not cloning.''\n  So there is no need to rush. The bill we are asked to vote on is one \nweek old--one week. It was introduced February 3, brought to the full \nSenate 48 hours later, on February 5. Now we are asked to vote on \nwhether to continue consideration and have a vote of the bill. It has \nnot been referred to committee. There have been no hearings. It has not \ngone through the normal deliberative process.\n  We should not be ramrodding a bill with this potential for harm \nthrough the Senate. It is one of the most profound issues of our time. \nThis is a difficult area of science. It involves terminology and \ntechnologies few Americans have ever studied, let alone fully \nunderstand, terminology and technologies that few Senators understand. \nIt poses very serious and fundamental moral, ethical and scientific \nquestions.\n  We need not rush a bill to the floor without committee consideration. \nThat is the other point. The scientific community has imposed a \nvoluntary moratorium. The Food and Drug Administration has said they \nwill assert jurisdiction. Many organizations have written urging \ncaution.\n  Let me go into some of them right now. Let me begin with the American \nCancer Society, in a letter dated February 9, and I ask unanimous \nconsent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      American Cancer Society,\n\n                                                 February 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Cancer Society has \n     called for your commitment for a renewed war on cancer \n     through a national investment in biomedical research and \n     cancer prevention and control programs. The sustained \n     downturn in cancer mortality and incidence--for the first \n     time ever--is evidence that our investment in this war is \n     beginning to make a difference.\n       The current opportunities in cancer research, including our \n     understanding of the molecular nature of the disease, are \n     bringing us closer to the answers we need to prevent and cure \n     cancer. Congress and the Administration are calling for \n     unprecedented increases in funding for biomedical and cancer \n     research which will allow us to exploit scientific knowledge \n     and bring answers more quickly to the American people.\n       The American Cancer Society urges you to oppose S. 1601, \n     legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer. The American Cancer Society agrees with the \n     public that human cloning should not proceed at this time. \n     However, the legislation as drafted would have the perhaps \n     unintended effect of restricting critical, legal scientific \n     research. The ability to create therapeutically valuable stem \n     cell lines from oocytes, therefore promoting genetic \n     reprogramming of cells to prevent and cure cancer exemplifies \n     the type of research that could be hindered with overly \n     restrictive regulations. The current language in S. 1601 \n     could hamper or punish scientists who contribute to our \n     growing knowledge about cancer.\n       We urge you to carefully consider all aspects of this \n     legislation to ensure the continued support for all legal and \n     ethical modalities of cancer research.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           David S. Rosenthal, MD,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me quote one part:\n\n       The American Cancer Society urges you to oppose S. 1601, \n     legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer. . . . The legislation as drafted would have \n     the unintended effect of restricting critical legal \n     scientific research. The ability to create therapeutically \n     valuable stem cell lines from oocytes, therefore promoting \n     genetic reprogramming of cells to prevent and cure cancer \n     exemplifies the type of research that could be hindered with \n     overly restrictive regulations. The current language in S. \n     1601 could hamper or punish scientists who contribute to our \n     growing knowledge about cancer.''\n\n  The American Heart Association--I ask unanimous consent their letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Heart Association, Office of Communications and \n           Advocacy,\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On Tuesday, February 10th, the \n     Senate is expected to initiate a cloture vote regarding a \n     motion to consider S. 1601, the Prohibition on Cloning of \n     Human Beings Act of 1998. The American Heart Association \n     urges you to vote against the cloture petition.\n       The American Heart Association wishes to make it clear that \n     we do not support any legislation allowing the cloning of a \n     human being. However, we fear that this legislation may place \n     biomedical research at risk and might negatively impact the \n     use of cloning techniques on human cells, genes and tissue \n     critical to identifying cures for a host of diseases, \n     including cardiovascular diseases. The American Heart \n     Association is concerned that a rush to passage of S. 1601 \n     may inadvertently threaten to restrict critical biomedical \n     research, which promises to have great impact on disease \n     prevention and treatment for the American people.\n       For example, we are concerned that this legislation may \n     effectively ban research using the generation of stem cells \n     for treating heart attack victims, as well as blood vessel \n     endothelial cells for treating atherosclerosis.\n       The American Heart Association urges the Senate to engage \n     in a more deliberate debate on this important issue. Please \n     vote ``no'' on cloture for S. 1601 and allow a more extensive \n     debate on these complex issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Martha N. Hill, RN, Ph.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. ``The American Heart Association urges the Senate to \nengage in a more deliberate debate on this important issue.''\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\n  The Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, I ask unanimous consent their letter \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   Cystic Fibrosis Foundation,\n\n                                                 February 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The current frenzied atmosphere on \n     Capitol Hill surrounding the issue of human cloning instills \n     great fear in the scientific community. On behalf of cystic \n     fibrosis (CF) scientists, researchers, caregivers, and most \n     importantly patients, the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) \n     asks all members of Congress to take the time to study the \n     potentially harmful ramifications of prohibitive human \n     cloning legislation. As America's governing body, Congress \n     has an unequivocal responsibility to hold public hearings on \n     this issue in order to fully understand the scope of this \n     debate. The CFF agrees that the cloning of a complete human \n     being should not be done. However, we have grave concerns \n     over current legislation that is crafted in such a way to \n     restrict the advancement of lifesaving biomedical research.\n       A voluntary moratorium on human cloning should suffice to \n     prevent scientists from attempting to clone a complete human \n     being in the laboratory. Nevertheless, if it is decided that \n     legislation must be drafted, extreme care should be taken not \n     to restrict the capacity to pursue cutting edge technologies \n     which hold great promise. For example, the strategy that may \n     ultimately be needed to achieve a cure for CF through gene \n     therapy techniques is called somatic cell/stem cell gene \n     transfer therapy.\n       Enactment of the Bond/Frist Cloning Prohibition Act in its \n     current form and other existing pieces of legislation would \n     prevent the use of this kind of technology. This would be a \n     critical set-back in our ability to develop new therapies to \n     treat individuals with CF and other life-threatening \n     diseases. To consider the passage of legislation without \n     appropriate debate from the scientific community, as well as \n     a public airing of the consequences on future biomedical \n     research, will do irreparable damage.\n       For the 30,000 children and young adults with CF in this \n     country, the message is clear. Do not allow hasty and \n     capricious action to impede our ability to impact on this \n     disease. It is equally important to note that until essential \n     scientific debate has reached completion, the cloning of a \n     complete human being cannot occur, as the regulatory \n     safeguards of the FDA already in place prevent such an act.\n       Your attention to this critical matter is appreciated.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                           Robert J.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Medical research, conducted in the \n     United States over the last 20 years, has opened up \n     tremendous opportunities to make progress against many \n     devastating diseases. The scientific community does not \n     desire to make human beings, or modify or genetically mark \n     any portion of our population. However, to deny the \n     application of molecular biology, made possible through the \n     use of cloning technologies, to patients who could be \n     benefitted would be a great injustice.\n       A litany of beneficial applications of cloning technology \n     was enumerated in this weeks TIME Magazine. Several of these \n     applications are at the core of cutting-edge cancer research, \n     and there are many more potential benefits that are unknown \n     at this time. These applications, as well as any future \n     progress, would be eliminated by broad legislation setting \n     back progress and potential in our conquest to develop \n     effective approaches to the prevention, detection, and \n     treatment of cancer.\n       The American Association for Cancer Research (AACR), with \n     over 14,000 members, is the largest professional organization \n     of basic and clinical cancer researchers in the world. \n     Founded in 1907, its mission is to prevent, treat, and cure \n     cancer through research, scientific programs, and education. \n     To accomplish these important goals it is essential that \n     scientists vigorously pursue all promising lines of \n     investigations against cancer.\n       The AACR feels strongly that an ethical and just compromise \n     can be reached that will protect the public and the \n     scientific community from the irresponsible application of \n     cloning technology while permitting meaningful and ethical \n     research to move forward. The medical and cancer research \n     community feels that the present rush to enact legislation \n     without proper consideration or deliberation is a serious \n     mistake, and the unfortunate result would be irresponsible \n     legislation.\n       As scientists we clearly see the tremendous advantages of \n     cloning technology as well as its potential problems, which \n     we, also, have reason to fear if it is applied in an \n     unreasonable manner.\n       The AACR, therefore, appeals to all Members of Congress to \n     establish and honor a moratorium of at least 45 days on \n     enacting any legislation until definitions and implications \n     of legislation can be determined in a more reasonable and \n     thoughtful manner, and in an open and public process. This \n     would be a service to humanity, science, and millions of \n     individuals who are now suffering, or will suffer in the \n     future, from catastrophic and crippling diseases such as \n     cancer. We appeal to all members of Congress to give this \n     important moral and scientific issue very careful \n     consideration and deliberation. Clearly a rush to judgment on \n     this complex issue could be a major setback for cancer and \n     medical research.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Donald S. Coffey, Ph.D.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. They say, ``The medical and cancer research community \nfeels that the present rush to enact legislation without proper \nconsideration or deliberation is a serious mistake and the unfortunate \nresult would be irresponsible legislation.''\n  The Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, the Diabetes Research \nFoundation, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International,\n\n\n                             The Diabetes Research Foundation,\n\n                                                 February 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Juvenile Diabetes \n     Foundation International (JDFI), we urge you to vote ``no'' \n     on a motion to invoke cloture and proceed to consider S. \n     1601, a bill to ban human cloning. This vote is scheduled to \n     come before the Senate on Tuesday, February 10.\n       We want to be clear: there is no acceptable moral or \n     ethical justification for making a replica of another human \n     being. As currently drafted, however, S. 1601 threatens to \n     restrict future promising stem cell research which could lead \n     to improved treatments or even a cure for diabetes and many \n     other serious, chronic illnesses.\n       Diabetes affects approximately 16 million Americans and is \n     a leading chronic disease in children. In addition to its \n     severe human impact, diabetes costs about $137 billion per \n     year in direct and indirect expenses. Therefore, it is \n     critical that any federal policies affecting medical research \n     are crafted so that they do not unnecessarily restrict the \n     potential for promising future advances in diabetes research.\n       In the case of type 1, or juvenile, diabetes, the beta \n     cells of the pancreas which produce insulin are destroyed. \n     Promising stem cell research could make it possible to \n     produce pancreatic beta cells that could then be transplanted \n     into a person with diabetes. As a consequence, a person with \n     type 1 diabetes would be free of the up to eight daily blood \n     tests and up to six daily insulin injections that so \n     significantly reduce the quality of life. More importantly, \n     this type of cell transplantation could eliminate the \n     horrible complications of the disease which include: kidney \n     failure; blindness; amputation; increased risk of heart \n     disease and stroke; and premature death.\n       For these reasons, JDFI urges you to vote ``no'' on the \n     cloture motion for S. 1601, thereby allowing the Senate to \n     conduct a more thorough debate on this issue. We need to \n     better understand the impact that legislation in this area \n     could have on research critical to improving the lives of \n     people with devastating illness. In order to ensure medical \n     progress and the attainment of future opportunities, we urge \n     you to proceed cautiously.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert Levine, MD,\n       Chairman, Government Relations Committee.\n     James E. Mulvihill, DMD,\n       President and CEO, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation \n     International.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Senator Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: RESOLVE expresses its strong \n     support for the cloning bill being co-sponsored by you and \n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy. This bill, consistent with \n     RESOLVE's position, includes an important provision \n     specifying that research using somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     technology should not be banned while recommending a \n     moratorium on the cloning of a human being until further \n     review.\n       RESOLVE is pleased to note that the proposed legislation \n     does not ban embryo research. Embryo research has been \n     instrumental in the development of procedures that allow many \n     couples to overcome the difficulties they experience as they \n     strive to build families. The emotional and physical \n     consequences of this struggle can be overwhelming. In vitro \n     fertilization is an amazing technology which would not have \n     been possible without the knowledge gained through embryo \n     research. This effective treatment has brought about the \n     birth of thousands of much-wanted babies. Continued embryo \n     research has the potential to further the understanding of \n     the causes of infertility, including the tragedy of \n     miscarriage, as well as provide information which can lead to \n     new breakthroughs.\n       As a national organization which provides support, advocacy \n     and education to those experiencing infertility, RESOLVE is \n     contacted by thousands of people from all walks of life who \n     are struggling with this disease. The stories about their \n     struggles can be heart-wrenching. The success stories about \n     the joy and overwhelming appreciation of the children that \n     are brought into this world are enormously heart-warming.\n       Avenues for further research to help couples must not be \n     halted. RESOLVE joins with many other organizations across \n     the country in expressing its opposition to any attempts to \n     ban embryo research. We applaud your efforts to develop \n     carefully-constructed legislation which will not impact the \n     potential for medical advances that will help the many \n     couples struggling to build much-wanted families.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Diane D.

We see no \n     ethical or medical justification for anyone in the public or \n     private sector, whether in a research or clinical setting, to \n     create a human child using somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     technology. However, we are concerned that legislation which \n     would expedite a ban on cloning would also effectively \n     eliminate research on ``customized'' stem cell research which \n     one day could lead to cures for many diseases.\n       Congress needs to be extremely cautious in drafting \n     legislation too quickly on this very complex issue. We are \n     concerned that Congress will not take the time to analyze the \n     effects on stem cell research already underway or consider \n     the future benefits of such research. It is our hope that \n     with input from the scientific community Congress will come \n     to a consensus which will address the public's concern about \n     human cloning and yet allow the scientific community to do \n     their work.\n       Again, we urge you to protect stem cell research which can \n     generate cells for the treatment of numerous diseases \n     including osteoporosis and related bone diseases.

The Alliance for Aging Research strongly supports our \nbill, the Feinstein-Kennedy bill. They urge a no vote on cloture. They \nsay this is not a vote for cloning but rather for reasoned debate that \ndraws upon the wisdom of scientists and medical experts:\n\n       Senators should also take time to hear from patients and \n     their families who yearn for cures and treatments for life-\n     threatening diseases. A rush to legislate in this area could \n     have serious consequences for research that could benefit the \n     lives of millions of Americans.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  Alliance for Aging Research,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein, The Alliance for Aging Research \n     strongly supports your efforts and those of Senator Kennedy \n     to legislate responsibly in the area of somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer technology. You and Senator Kennedy and others have \n     proposed a ban on human cloning without threatening vital \n     research efforts into cellular technologies that could \n     produce cures and valuable therapies for Alzheimers Disease, \n     Parkinsons, would healing, age-related blindness and many \n     other medical problems of the elderly. The not-for-profit \n     Alliance applauds your efforts on behalf of research, and we \n     urge you to vote ``no'' when a motion to cut off debate on S. \n     1601 comes to the Senate this week.\n       The Alliance for Aging Research strongly opposes the \n     cloning of a human being on moral grounds, as does every \n     responsible health advocacy organization we know. However, \n     the Lott-Bond-Frist bill is written so broadly as to halt \n     cellular technology that could be a significant tool in \n     developing therapies for scores of age-related diseases and \n     disabilities.\n       The Alliance is also concerned there has not been \n     sufficient discussion and debate to allow reasoned \n     consideration of this highly technical and complicated issue. \n     A ``no'' vote on cloture is not a vote for cloning, but \n     rather for a reasoned debate that draws upon the wisdom of \n     scientists and medical experts. Senators should also take \n     time to hear from patients and their families who yearn for \n     cures and treatments for life-threatening diseases. A rush to \n     legislate in this area could have serious consequences for \n     research that could benefit the lives of millions of \n     Americans.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                     Daniel Perry,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Early this week the Senate will \n     decide whether to begin debate on legislation to ban the \n     cloning of a human being. The National Health Council, which \n     represents the Nation's leading patient organizations, agrees \n     with the American public that the cloning of a human being \n     should be prohibited. However, we urge careful consideration \n     of the issue and a vote against cloture, so a more thorough \n     debate can occur within the committees of jurisdiction before \n     consideration by the full Senate.\n       Current advances in medical research are, for the first \n     time, holding true promise of curing some of the most well-\n     known diseases: cancer, diabetes, and paralysis. In the past, \n     scientific gains have provided patients with novel \n     treatments, allowing us to manage disease more effectively. \n     But cures have eluded us.\n       Cloning, the duplication of scientific material, such as \n     cells or genes, has allowed scientists to more efficiently \n     study biological processes, and has led to many recent \n     medical advances. The technique which created the sheep Dolly \n     was a new approach to producing duplicate material. This \n     novel process, called somatic cell nuclear transfer, may hold \n     the key not only to understanding the function of all human \n     cells but also to identifying new avenues to repair damaged \n     cells.\n       By gaining a greater understanding of how cells develop and \n     differentiate we may be able to replace damaged pancreatic \n     cells with healthy cells, therefore curing diabetes. Combined \n     with gene therapy, cloning may also make it possible to \n     eliminate the transmission of such inherited diseases as \n     Huntington's Disease.\n       We appreciate your concerns regarding the issues relating \n     to cloning, but it is critical\n\n[[Page S570]]\n\n     that we have a better understanding of all the implications \n     of the various approaches aimed at banning the cloning of \n     human beings. I am certain that you share our interest that \n     important medical research is protected. In order to ensure \n     medical progress and the attainment of future opportunities, \n     we urge you to proceed cautiously.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Myrl Weinberg, CAE,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

A vote ``no'' is \n     a vote to protect biomedical research. It would also call for \n     more deliberate debate on this complicated scientific issue.\n       As an organization that continues to seek insurance \n     reimbursement for cancer therapies, therapeutic devices and \n     agents that hold promise of improved quality of life after a \n     cancer diagnosis, life extension and improvement in \n     preventing cancer, bio-medical research presents significant \n     hope for improvement in preventing, detecting and treating \n     cancer. We have been involved with this issue since early \n     last summer when the anti-cloning discussion first emerged \n     when the Ehler's bills was introduced. Our position then and \n     now is the same. Though we are in full support of no cloning \n     of human beings, we value the progress being made in bio-\n     medical research and can not support any initiative that \n     threatens continued research in this area. Zygotes, diploid \n     cells and somatic cell nuclear transfer are issues that are \n     complicated and present myriad opportunities for \n     misinterpretation without thorough discussions relative to \n     the impact on bio-medical research that this anti-cloning \n     legislation poses. We urge your no vote on cloture February \n     tenth, so that this matter may be addressed in detail in \n     hearings.\n       There is no need to rush to legislate. The Food and Drug \n     Administration has full jurisdiction to ensure that no one \n     will clone human beings at this time. We urge careful and \n     deliberate consideration of this legislation to ban cloning. \n     It should be carefully reviewed by key Committees, which has \n     not occurred. S. 1601 raises serious questions about its \n     scope and impact on critical biomedical research seeking \n     cures for deadly and disabling diseases.\n       This bill is not confined to``cloning'', which is the \n     creation of a child genetically identical to another \n     individual.\n       It would halt research to develop ``customized'' stem cells \n     which promise potential new treatments for many diseases and \n     conditions.\n       It would outlaw a current medical procedure to treat \n     infertility which uses eggs which are fertilized and contain \n     the genetic traits of two individuals, not the clone of one \n     individual.\n       Again, we urge you to vote ``no'' on Tuesday's cloture vote \n     on S. 1601 to protect biomedical research.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Nancy Davenport-Ennis,\n                                      Founding Executive Director.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

The AIDS Action Council, the Allergy and Asthma \nNetwork, the Alliance for Aging Research, the Alzheimers Aid Society, \nthe American Academy of Optometry and the American Academy of \nPediatrics urges that we ``proceed with extreme caution and adhere to \nthe ethical standards for physicians, `first do no harm'.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 January 26, 1998.\n     Re legislation to ban cloning of human beings.\n\n       Dear Member: We are writing to express our concern about \n     legislation pending in the Congress to ban the cloning of \n     entire human beings.\n       Let us be clear. We oppose the cloning of a human being. We \n     see no ethical or medical justification for the cloning of a \n     human being and agree with the conclusions of the National \n     Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) that it is unacceptable \n     at this time for anyone in the public or private sector, \n     whether in a research or clinical setting, to create a human \n     child using somatic cell nuclear transfer technology. We \n     recognize that this application of the technology raises \n     fundamental ethical and social issues. This technology is not \n     currently safe to use in humans.\n       The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the \n     Biotechnology Industry Organization, and the Federation of \n     American Societies of Experimental Biology have all stated \n     that their members will not seek to clone a human being. \n     These three associations include essentially every researcher \n     or practitioner in the United States who has the scientific \n     capability to clone a human being.\n       We agree with NBAC in its report on cloning that: ``It is \n     notoriously difficult to draft legislation at any particular \n     moment that can serve to both exploit and govern the rapid \n     and unpredictable advances of science.'' Poorly crafted \n     legislation to ban the cloning of human beings may put at \n     risk biomedical research, such as the use of cloning \n     techniques on human cells, genes and tissues, which is vital \n     to finding the cures to the diseases and ailments which our \n     organizations champion. Cancer, diabetes, allergies, asthma, \n     HIV/AIDS, eye diseases, spinal cord injuries, Guillain-Barre \n     syndrome, Gaucher disease, stroke, cystic fibrosis, kidney \n     cancer, Alzheimer's disease, tuberous sclerosis, tourette \n     syndrome, alcoholism, autoimmune diseases, osteoporosis, \n     Parkinson's disease, infertility, diseases of aging, ataxia \n     telangiectasia and many other types of research will benefit \n     from the advances achieved by biomedical researchers.\n       We urge the Congress to proceed with extreme caution and \n     adhere to the ethical standard for physicians, ``first do no \n     harm.'' We believe that there are two distinct issues here, \n     cloning of a human being and the healing which comes from \n     biomedical research.\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\n     Congress must be sure that any legislation which it considers \n     does no harm to biomedical research which can heal those with \n     deadly and debilitating diseases.\n       Please keep patients' concerns in mind as you proceed in \n     analyzing this very complicated issue.\n           Sincerely,\n       AIDS Action Council.\n       Allergy and Asthma Network/Mothers of Asthmatics, Inc.\n       Alliance for Aging Research.\n       Alzheimer Aid Society.\n       American Academy of Optometry.\n       American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Biotechnology Industry Organization, which \nrepresents literally hundreds of biotech organizations, says, ``We are \nvery concerned about the rushed process to pass legislation on this \ncomplex subject and the possibilities for unintended consequences.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) Regarding \n              Legislation Introduced to Ban Human Cloning\n\n       The Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) believes that \n     it is both unsafe and unethical to even attempt to clone a \n     human being. BIO strongly supported the review of this issue \n     by the National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) and the \n     moratorium on cloning imposed by President Clinton. We \n     believe that the FDA has clear authority and jurisdiction and \n     will, as they have stated, prohibit any attempt to clone a \n     human being.\n       BIO is concerned about the scope and impact of legislation \n     introduced to make it a crime with a ten year prison sentence \n     to conduct biomedical research which may or may not have any \n     relevance to the cloning of a human being. We are very \n     concerned about the rushed process to pass legislation on \n     this complex subject and the possibilities for unintended \n     consequences. The scientific and legal issues with respect to \n     any legislation regarding biomedical research are exceedingly \n     technical, and a hastily drafted bill could advertently and \n     inadvertently damage biomedical research on deadly and \n     disabling diseases.\n       The Senate needs to adhere to the standard for doctors, \n     ``first, do no harm.'' Biomedical research into deadly and \n     disabling diseases is far too important to rush to enact \n     legislation which would unequivocally undermine promising \n     research and therapies. The Senate should be extremely \n     cautious before it starts sending scientists to jail when the \n     purpose of their research meets the highest moral and ethical \n     standards and holds such promise for relieving human \n     suffering.\n\n\n           analysis of pending bills and the science at risk\n\n       Several bills have been introduced in the Senate regarding \n     human cloning. They vary widely in focus and precision. The \n     three principal bills are S. 368, S. 1599, and S. 1602 and we \n     have analyzed each of them here.\n       The first bill introduced by Senator Bond last year, S. \n     368, is one of the better drafted bills introduced in either \n     body. It uses reasonably accurate terms to describe the \n     applicable science and limits Federal funding for the cloning \n     of a human being.\n       The new bill introduced by Senator Bond, S. 1599, would \n     impose a ten year prison sentence for any individual for the \n     act of ``producing an embryo (including a preimplantation \n     embryo)'' through the use of a specified technology, \n     ``somatic cell nuclear transfer,'' even if the production of \n     such an embryo is for purposes unrelated to the cloning of a \n     human being and even if the embryo does not contain nuclear \n     DNA which is identical to that of an existing or previously \n     existing human being (cloning). The bill goes beyond the \n     issue of cloning to make it a crime to use somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer of a nucleus derived from normal sexual \n     union of an egg and sperm, which is obviously not cloning. It \n     would also make it a crime to conduct some research seeking \n     to generate stem cells to treat a wide range of deadly and \n     disabling diseases, treatments which have nothing whatever to \n     do with human cloning.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ An identical bill has been introduced by Senator Lott as \n     S. 1601 and this may be the bill which is called up for the \n     Senate debate.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       The third bill, introduced by Senator Feinstein, S. 1602, \n     would impose heavy civil fines for any entity that would \n     ``implant or attempt to implant the product of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer into a woman's uterus . . .'' This sharply \n     focuses the bill on an attempt to clone a human being and \n     would not imperil biomedical research.\n\n\n                 impact of bills on stem cell research\n\n       The current bill introduced by Senator Bond would, because \n     it goes well beyond the issue of human cloning, imperil \n     promising biomedical research, including research to generate \n     stem cells. Instead of focusing on cloning, it makes it a \n     crime to create a zygote or embryo through the use of a new \n     technology, somatic cell nuclear transfer, even if the use of \n     this technology is essential for the generation of stem cells \n     to treat disease and where there is no intention of attempts \n     through use of this technology to clone a human being. \n     Basically the current bill would make it a crime to conduct \n     research if it could possibly be related to the cloning of a \n     human being even if it is not, in fact, conducted for that \n     purpose.\n       This approach in S. 1599 goes beyond the issue of human \n     cloning and would outlaw some research to create stem cells, \n     including stem cells for the following types of treatments: \n     cardiac muscle cells to treat heart attack victims and \n     degenerative heart disease;; skin cells to treat burn \n     victims; spinal cord neuron cells for treatment of spinal \n     cord trauma and paralysis; neural cells for treating those \n     suffering from neurodegenerative diseases; pancreas cells to \n     treat diabetics; blood cells to treat cancer anemia, and \n     immunodeficiencies; neural cells to treat Parkinson's, \n     Huntington's and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS); cells \n     for use in genetic therapy to treat 5,000 genetic \n     diseases, including Cystic Fibrosis, Tay-Sachs Disease, \n     schizophrenia, depression, and other diseases; blood \n     vessel endothelial cells for treating atherosclerosis; \n     liver cells for liver diseases including hepatitis and \n     cirrhosis; cartilage cells for treatment of \n     osteoarthritis; bone cells for treatment of osteoporosis; \n     myoblast cells for the treatment of Muscular Dystrophy; \n     respiratory epithelial cells for the treatment of Cystic \n     Fibrosis and lung cancer; adrenal cortex cells for the \n     treatment of Addison's disease; retinal pigment epithelial \n     cells for age-related macular degeneration; modified cells \n     for treatment of various genetic diseases; and other cells \n     for use in the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of \n     other deadly or disabling diseases or other medical \n     conditions.\n       To be precise, the current bill introduced by Senator Bond, \n     S. 1599, would make it a crime to generate stem cells, for \n     the above uses, where somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     technology is used. It would not ban stem cell research where \n     the stem cell is generated without the use of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer. It is not possible to say how much of this \n     promising research will or might involve the use of somatic \n     cell nuclear transfer. As described below, the bill would \n     clearly ban the generation of any stem cells ``customized'' \n     to an individual where somatic cell nuclear transfer must be \n     used.\n       This stem cell technology is exciting and potentially \n     revolutionary. Scientists are developing a new approach for \n     treating human diseases that doesn't depend on drugs like \n     antibiotics, but on living cells that can differentiate into \n     blood, skin, heart, or brain cells and can potentially treat \n     various cancers, spinal cord injuries, and heart disease. For \n     example, this stem cell research has the potential to develop \n     and improve cancer treatments by gaining a more complete \n     understanding of cell division and growth and the process of \n     metastasis. This could also lead to a variety of cancer \n     treatment advances.\n       The types of cells that make up most of the human body are \n     differentiated, meaning that they have already achieved some \n     sort of specialized function such as blood, skin, heart or \n     brain cells. The precursor cells that led to differentiated \n     cells come from an embryo. The cells are called stem cells \n     because functions stem from them like the growth of a plant. \n     Stem cells have the capacity for self-renewal, meaning that \n     they can reproduce more of themselves, and differentiation, \n     meaning that they can specialize into a variety of cell types \n     with different functions. In the last decade, scientists \n     studying mice and other laboratory animals have discovered \n     new power approaches involving cultured stem cells. Studies \n     of these cells obtained from a mouse's stem cells show that \n     they are capable of differentiating, in vitro or in vivo into \n     a wide variety of specialized cell types. Stem cells have \n     been derived by culturing cells of non-human primates. \n     Promising efforts to obtain human stem cells have also \n     recently been reported.\n       Stem cell research has been hailed as the ``[most] \n     tantalizing of all'' research in this field, because adults \n     do not have many stem cells. Most adults cells are fully \n     differentiated into their proper functions. When \n     differentiated cells are damaged, such as damage to cardiac \n     muscle from a heart attack, the adult cells do not have the \n     ability to regenerate. If stem cells could be derived from \n     human sources and induced to differentiated in vitro, they \n     could potentially be used for transplantation and tissue \n     repair.\n       Using heart attacks as an example, we might be able to \n     replace damaged cardiac cells, with healthy stem cells, that \n     could differentiate into cardiac muscle. Research using these \n     stem cells could lead to the development of ''universal donor \n     cells,'' and could be an invaluable benefit to patients. Stem \n     cell therapy could also make it possible to store tissue \n     reserves that would give health care providers a new and \n     virtually endless supply of the cells listed above. The use \n     of stem cells to create these therapies would lead to great \n     medical advances. We have to be sure that this legislation \n     concerning human cloning would not in any way obstruct this \n     vital research.\n\n\n             Bond Bill Application to Non-Identical Nucleus\n\n       The purpose of a bill to ban human cloning is supposedly to \n     ban the cloning of an individual and the essence of this is \n     the duplication of the DNA of one individual in another. The \n     term ``somatic cell,'' however, is not limited in the current \n     Bond bill to somatic cells with DNA which is the same as that \n     of an existing or previously existing human being. If it is \n     not limited to cases where the\n\n[[Page S572]]\n\n     DNA is identical, human cloning is--by definition--not \n     involved.\n       The current Bond bill goes beyond cloning because it does \n     not define the term ``somatic cell'' or limit to cases where \n     the DNA is identical. It only defines the term ``somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer,'' but it does not define the term ``somatic \n     cell.'' We need a brief glossary of terms to define what \n     constitutes a ``somatic cell.''\n       ``Zygote'' means a single celled egg with two sets (a \n     diploid set) of chromosomes as normally derived by \n     fertilization;\n       ``Egg'' and ``oocyte'' mean the female gamete;\n       ``Gamete'' means a mature male or female reproductive cell \n     with one set (a haploid) set of chromosomes;\n       ``Sperm'' means the male gamete;\n       ``Somatic cell'' means a cell of the body, other than a \n     cell that is a gamete, having two sets (a diploid set) or \n     chromosomes;\n       So a ``somatic cell'' is any cell of the body other than a \n     gamete, and it includes a fertilized egg. This means that the \n     current Bond bill would make it a crime to use somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer even in cases where the somatic cell \n     contains a nucleus derived from sexual reproduction, which is \n     obviously not cloning. This means that even though the \n     nucleus is not a clone, the current Bond bill makes it a \n     Federal crime to create it. This means that the current Bond \n     bill goes beyond the issue of cloning.\n       Because of this coverage of all ``somatic cells'' the \n     current Bond bill would make it a crime for doctors to use a \n     currently effective treatment for mitochondrial disease. \n     In this treatment women who have the disease have an \n     extreme and tragic form of infertility. The disease is a \n     disease of the mitochondria, which is an essential element \n     of any egg. The treatment for this disease involves the \n     use of a fertilized nucleus which is transferred through \n     the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to an egg from \n     which the nucleus has been removed. The new egg is a \n     fresh, undiseased egg. The current Bond bill would make it \n     a crime to provide this treatment even though the nucleus \n     which is transferred is the product of fertilization, not \n     cloning.\n\n\n                         customized stem cells\n\n       If the current Bond bill was limited to somatic cells with \n     nuclear DNA identical to that of an existing or previously \n     existing human being, i.e. to a cloned nucleus, it would make \n     it a Federal crime to conduct one especially promising type \n     of stem cell research, research into generating \n     ``customized'' stem cells.\n       A researcher or doctor might want to create a human zygote \n     with DNA identical to that of an existing or previously \n     existing person through the use of somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer, the act prohibited in the bill, in order to create \n     a customized stem cell line to treat the individual from whom \n     the DNA was extracted. By using the same DNA, the stem cell \n     therapy would more likely be compatible with, and not be \n     rejected by, the person for whom the therapy is created. By \n     starting with the patient's own nuclear DNA, the therapy is, \n     in effect, custom made for that person. It is like taking the \n     patients blood prior to surgery so that it can be infused \n     into the patient during surgery (avoiding the possibility of \n     contamination by the use of blood of another person).\n       Because the current Bond bill makes it a crime to use the \n     technology--somatic cell nuclear transfer--if would make it a \n     crime to develop a therapy with the equivalent of the \n     patient's personal monogram on it, a customized treatment \n     based on their own nuclear DNA.\n       Because the bill introduced by Senator Feinstein requires \n     the implantation of an embryo, it does not curtail stem cell \n     research, and the bill provides that the transferred nucleus \n     must be that of an ``existing or previously existing human \n     child or adult,'' precisely the limitation not present in the \n     current Bond bill. None of the issues we have raised \n     regarding the current Bond bill apply to the Feinstein bill, \n     which is narrowly focused on the act of cloning, or \n     attempting to clone an individual.\n\n\n                     protecting biomedical research\n\n       The current Bond bill and the Feinstein bill both contain \n     clauses for the protection of biomedical research. There is a \n     critical difference between them.\n       At the press conference announcing introduction of his bill \n     Senator Bond distributed a document entitled ``Current \n     Research Untouched by the Bond/Frist/Gregg Legislation.'' The \n     title of this document was followed by a list of such \n     research, including ``In Vitro Fertilization,'' ``Stem Cell \n     Research,'' ``Gene Therapy,'' ``Cloning of Cells, Tissues, \n     Animals and Plants,'' ``Cancer,'' ``Diabetes,'' ``Birth \n     Defects,'' ``Arthritis,'' ``Organ Failure,'' ``Genetic \n     Disease,'' ``Severe Skin Burns,'' ``Multiple Sclerosis,'' \n     ``Muscular Dystrophy,'' ``Spinal Cord Injuries,'' \n     ``Alzheimer's Disease,'' ``Parkinson's Disease,'' and ``Lou \n     Gehrig's Disease.'' Unfortunately, the title is followed by a \n     critical qualification, an asterisk. The asterisk \n     qualification states, ``The current Bond bill would not \n     prohibit any of this research, even embryo research, as long \n     as it did not involve the use of a very specific technique \n     (somatic cell nuclear transfer) to create a live cloned human \n     embryo.''\n       In the ways described above this asterisk qualification \n     acknowledges that the bill would, in fact, make it a crime to \n     conduct some types of stem cell research and other research. \n     Given the importance of the asterisk, the document's title \n     and the list of supposedly protected research could be \n     considered misleading. The document should more accurately \n     have been entitled ``Only Some Research Regarding the \n     Following Diseases Is Outlawed.''\n       The current Bond bill contains a Section 5 entitled \n     ``Unrestricted Scientific Research.'' This section provides \n     that ``Nothing in this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) \n     shall be construed to restrict areas of scientific research \n     that are not specifically prohibited by this Act (or \n     amendments).'' This provision is circular. It states that the \n     bill does what it does and does not do what it does not do. \n     The provision does nothing to modify the prohibitions on \n     research and does nothing to protect ``scientific research.''\n       In contrast the Feinstein bill includes a provision \n     regarding ``Protected Research and Practices'' which provides \n     that ``Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict \n     ares of biomedical and agriculture research or practices not \n     expressly prohibited in this section, including research or \n     practices that involve the use of--(1) somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer or other cloning technologies to clone molecules, \n     DNA, cells, and tissues; (2) mitochondrial, cytoplasmic or \n     gene therapy; or (3) somatic cell nuclear transfer techniques \n     to create nonhuman animals.'' This is a ``savings'' clause \n     with meaning and content. Its reference to the cloning of \n     ``cells'' and to ``mitochondrial'' therapy are laudatory and \n     meaningful.\n\n\n          nbac recommendation and clinton administration bill\n\n       The National Bioethics Advisory Commission (NBAC) cautioned \n     that poorly crafted legislation to ban human cloning may put \n     at risk biomedical research on the following types of \n     diseases and conditions: ``regeneration and repair of disease \n     or damaged human tissues and organs'' (NBAC report at 29); \n     ``assisted reproduction'' (NBAC report at 29); ``leukemia, \n     liver failure, heart and kidney disease'' (NBAC report at \n     30); and ``bone marrow stem cells, liver cells, or pancreatic \n     beta-cells (which produce insulin) for transplantation'' \n     (NBAC report at 30). The Clinton Administration proposed law, \n     like the Feinstein bill, avoids the peril identified by NBAC \n     and focuses only on the issue of human cloning and does not \n     imperil biomedical research.\n\n\n                         Sunset and Preemption\n\n       NBAC proposed that any law include both sunset review and \n     preemption provisions.\n       Regarding a sunset review provision, NBAC stated in its \n     report: ``It is notoriously difficult to draft legislation at \n     any particular moment that can serve to both exploit and \n     govern the rapid and unpredictable advances of science. Some \n     mechanism, therefore, such as a sunset provision, is \n     absolutely needed to ensure an opportunity to re-examine any \n     judgment made today about the implications of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer cloning of human beings. As scientific \n     information accumulates and public discussion continues, a \n     new judgment may develop and we, as a society, need to retain \n     the flexibility to adjust our course in this manner. A sunset \n     provision. . .ensures that the question of cloning will be \n     revisited by the legislature in the future, when scientific \n     and medical questions have been clarified, possible uses have \n     been identified, and public discussion of the deeper moral \n     concerns about this practice have matured.'' NBAC report at \n     101. President Clinton has proposed a five year sunset in his \n     bill. The Feinstein bill includes a ten year sunset and the \n     current Bond bill includes no sunset review.\n       BIO supports inclusion of a sunset review provision, but \n     the most important issue is whether the terms of the \n     prohibition in any law focuses only on the issue of human \n     cloning. A sunset review provision will not undo the damaged \n     which a poorly crafted, over broad law would do to biomedical \n     research prior to the sunset date.\n       The Feinstein bill, but not the current Bond bill, includes \n     a clause which preempts inconsistent state laws. NBAC \n     strongly supported a preemption of state laws: ``The \n     advantage to federal legislation--as opposed to state-by-\n     state laws--lies primarily in its comprehensive coverage and \n     clarity. . . . Besides ensuring interstate uniformity, a \n     federal law would relieve the need to rely on the cooperation \n     of diverse medical and scientific societies, or the actions \n     of diverse IRBs, to achieve the policy objective. As an \n     additional benefit, federal legislation could displace the \n     varied state legislative efforts now ongoing, some of which \n     suffer from ambiguous drafting that could inadvertently \n     prohibit the important cellular and molecular cloning \n     research described . . . in this report.'' NBAC report at \n     100. Numerous bills introduced in state legislatures, some of \n     which are very poorly crafted and over broad.\n       BIO supports inclusion of a preemption clause. Again, the \n     key issue is whether the prohibition in any law focuses only \n     on the issue of human cloning and does not imperil biomedical \n     research. A poorly drafted, over broad Federal law which \n     preempts state laws might do even more damage.\n\n\n                        NBAC Role and Commission\n\n       NBAC performed a public service with its quick and \n     thoughtful analysis of the human cloning issue. the current \n     Bond bill would set up an entirely new body to review the \n     human cloning issue rather than rerefer the issue back to \n     NBAC for further review. NBAC is well qualified and \n     positioned to perform this function and it may be wasteful \n     and expensive to establish another body to\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\n     perform this ongoing review. The Feinstein bill calls on NBAC \n     to conduct the reviews.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Finally, there are hospitals and universities, the \nUniversity of California Medical Center in San Francisco, the \nReproductive Genetics Unit, also sent a letter.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have that printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     University of California,\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, February 4, 1998.\n     Hon. Senator Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express my deep \n     concern about the negative impact of impending legislation \n     introduced by Senators Bond, Frist et al. (S. 1599) intended \n     to regulate cloning of a human being. As an active researcher \n     in the scientific field of the discovery leading to Dolly, I \n     understand its implications for basic science and human \n     health. Dolly's existence proves for the first time that the \n     genetic material of an adult body cell can be completely \n     reprogrammed by the egg, thus totally restoring the genetic \n     potential for specializing into all possible cell types. This \n     discovery that genetic reprogramming is possible in mammals \n     is as important to human health as the discovery of \n     penicillin. Basic research on genetic reprogramming will \n     likely lead to novel transplantation therapies for numerous \n     human disease, including heart disease, diabetes, \n     neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson disease), \n     genetic diseases and birth defects. I believe that imprecise, \n     hastily-written legislation against human cloning, such as S. \n     1599, will hinder these important research opportunities for \n     understanding genetic reprogramming of adult cells. Excessive \n     regulation as specified by S. 1599, including civil penalties \n     and criminalization, in the areas of this new discovery is \n     likely to thwart the momentum of basic research on genetic \n     reprogramming and deter the enthusiasm and ability of \n     researchers poised to make new contributions in applying \n     their findings to human health problems.\n       In no conceivable instance would research on genetic \n     reprogramming involve cloning of human beings. Indeed, \n     active, credible researchers and clinicians overwhelmingly \n     regard cloning a human being as an unethical and \n     reprehensible act. Last year, working through the Society for \n     Developmental Biology, I spearheaded a voluntary moratorium \n     on cloning human beings. This moratorium unequivocally states \n     that we have no intention to clone human beings, where this \n     is defined as ``duplication of an existing or previously \n     existing human being by transferring the nucleus of a \n     differentiated, somatic cell into an enucleated human oocyte, \n     and implanting the resulting product for intrauterine \n     gestation and subsequent birth.'' To date, 15 additional \n     scientific and medical societies, including the Federation of \n     American Societies for Experimental Biology, the American \n     Society for Reproductive Medicine, and the Society for the \n     Study of Reproduction, together representing more than 60,000 \n     reproductive, developmental, cell and molecular biologists, \n     have endorsed this moratorium. Historical precedent (with \n     recombinant DNA technology) indicates that a voluntary \n     moratorium can deter activities that are potentially unsafe \n     for humans. It is evident from recent events that anyone who \n     advocates cloning human beings for any purpose will be \n     subjected to ostracism and discredited scientifically. \n     Therefore, I believe that the existing voluntary moratorium \n     against cloning human beings is an effective means of \n     regulating the behavior of U.S. scientists and physicians.\n       Presently, the fields of developmental biology and human \n     genetics are at an exciting juncture, where many novel genes \n     are being identified through the Human Genome Project and \n     their functions during normal development are being \n     understood for the first time. In addition, an understanding \n     of how these genes interact with the internal and external \n     environment of the cell is emerging for studies such as those \n     giving rise to Dolly. Deriving the full benefits of these new \n     insights for human health will require a dedicated and \n     cooperative research effort by many scientists, including \n     those who conduct research on human cells and tissues.\n       In conclusion, there is a great risk that anti-cloning \n     legislation would deprive the American people of \n     unprecedented human health benefits. I thus urge extreme \n     caution in any legal sanctions, such as those included in S. \n     1599, which would have lasting detrimental effects on our \n     ability to alleviate human diseases, and would also undermine \n     the competitive abilities of U.S. scientists in our field.\n           Respectfully yours,\n\n                                     Roger A. Pedersen, Ph.D.,\n\n         Professor and Research Director, Reproductive Genetics \n           Unit,\n            Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive \n                                                          Science.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Let me move for a moment to think tanks. I must say, \nMr. President, that one of the most interesting letters to me is one \nfrom the CATO Institute, dated February 6.\n  They attach to their letter a very interesting article from Science \nmagazine which really casts major doubts on the conclusions drawn from \nthe Dolly experiment.\n  The letter says that the new information indicates that there is no \nneed to rush legislation, and it can be accorded the time and \ndeliberation appropriate to legislate that can have a lasting impact on \nbiological research in this country.\n  The article from Science magazine questions whether Dolly originated \nfrom adult cell DNA. Interesting. And it suggests that she might have \nresulted from the cloning of an embryonic cell. ``Scientists have \ncloned embryonic cells for years, and those activities have raised no \npublic concern. The last sentence in the first paragraph of the Science \nnews article sums up the significance of the new information. If Dolly \nisn't the product of DNA from a mature cell, `it would mean that human \ncloning, which for most conceivable purposes would start with adult \ncells, is not the immediate threat some worry about.' ''\n  And CATO goes on and says:\n\n       With this new information in hand, there appears to be no \n     need to rush legislation, and at a minimum there is ample \n     time for hearings with knowledgeable and respected \n     scientists, ethicists, theologians, and others testifying \n     about the proposed legislation and its ramifications.\n\n  The CATO letter continues,\n\n       Many scientists, including the Director of the NIH, worry \n     that hastily drafted and loosely drawn legislation directed \n     against cloning will foreclose research that promises new \n     drugs and the capacity to replace or repair nerves, skin, and \n     muscle lost to injury or disease. The information from \n     Science indicates that legislative haste is not necessary.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the CATO letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Cato Institute,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: As you are well aware, the uproar \n     over Dolly and the perils that many people see in the \n     possibility of human cloning have resulted in the \n     introduction of legislation to prohibit research into human \n     cloning. A letter and news article from this week's Science \n     magazine (enclosed) cast doubt on the conclusions drawn from \n     Dolly. The new information indicates that there is no need to \n     rush legislation and that it can be accorded the time and \n     deliberation appropriate to legislation that can have a \n     lasting impact on biological research in this country.\n       Few biological results have excited as much attention as \n     the announcement of Dolly's birth eleven months ago. Dolly \n     was important and surprising because, it was claimed, she was \n     produced from the DNA of an adult sheep.\n       Mammalian life begins with a ``totipotent'' fertilized egg \n     that can multiply and differentiate into all the diverse \n     types of cells--skin, nerves, bones, muscle, etc.--that make \n     up a mature animal. As cells differentiate into specialized \n     cells, they lose the capacity to carry out the functions of \n     other cell types; they are no longer totipotent. A skin cell \n     cannot produce a nerve, bone, or muscle cell, for example.\n       Dolly was a surprise because she was, apparently, the \n     product of DNA from a differentiated, specialized cell from \n     the udder of a mature sheep. The DNA was introduced into a \n     DNA-less egg, and the egg was implanted into the uterus of a \n     sheep where it developed into Dolly.\n       Dolly, at the time the experiment was announced last year, \n     appeared to open up the possibility of human cloning. In \n     theory, DNA could be taken from a woman or man and inserted \n     into a DNA-less egg, and the egg, which now contained the \n     genetic information from the donor, could be introduced into \n     the uterus of a woman. If a child resulted from the process, \n     she or he would be genetically identical to the woman or man \n     from whom the DNA came.\n       The enclosed letter from Science questions whether Dolly \n     originated from adult cell DNA, and it suggests that she \n     might have resulted from the cloning of an embryonic cell. \n     Scientists have clonsed embryonic cells for years, and those \n     activities have raised no public concerns. The last sentence \n     of the first paragraph of the Science news article sums up \n     the significance of the new information. If Dolly isn't the \n     product of DNA from a mature cell, ``it would mean that human \n     cloning, which for most conceivable purposes would start with \n     adult cells, is not the immediate threat some worry about.''\n       With this new information in hand, there appears to be no \n     need to rush legislation. At a minimum, there is ample time \n     for hearings with knowledgeable and respected scientists, \n     ethicists, theologians, and others testifying about the \n     proposed legislation and its ramifications.\n       Human cloning, if it is ever accomplished, will offer the \n     promise of a child to love and cherish to couples who \n     otherwise would be childless. Although cloning has been \n     greeted very negatively, it is also true that negative\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\n     reactions met almost every advance in human reproduction \n     technologies--artificial insemination, in vitro \n     fertilization, ``fertility drugs,'' prenatal diagnoses. Those \n     technologies became accepted when they gave healthy children \n     to couples that otherwise would have been childless.\n       Many scientists, including the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health, worry that hastily drafted and loosely \n     drawn legislation directed against cloning will foreclose \n     research that promises new drugs and the capacity to replace \n     or repair nerves, skin, and muscle lost to injury or disease. \n     The information from Science indicates that legislative haste \n     is not necessary.\n       I will be happy to talk with you or your staff and to \n     provide additional information.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Michael Gough, Ph.D.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, there are also brand new letters that \nI did not enter into the Record my last time on the floor speaking \nabout this issue. They are from the American Society for Biochemistry \nand Molecular Biology, from the professor and chairman of the \nDepartment of Developmental Biology at Stanford University School of \nMedicine, the American Society for Cell Biology, which interestingly \nenough is signed by more Nobel laureates than I have ever seen signing \none letter. And this is truly amazing. There are 27 Nobel laureates on \nthis letter.\n  What they say, in summing up, is:\n\n       If legislation is deemed to be necessary, we respectfully \n     urge you to be sure that it be limited to the cloning of \n     human beings and not include language that impedes critical, \n     ongoing, and potential new research.\n\n  And I have letters from the American Society for Cell Biology, the \nAmerican Society for Human Genetics, the National Association for \nBiomedical Research, a telegram from the Federation of American \nSocieties for Experimental Biology. I ask unanimous consent that these \nletters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,\n                                  Bethesda, MD, February 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Christopher Bond,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bond: We are writing to express a number of \n     concerns regarding your bill, S. 1601, the Human Cloning \n     Prohibition Act, which would prohibit the use of ``Somatic \n     cell nuclear transfer technology for purposes of human \n     cloning.'' Our main concern is that harm not be done to \n     biomedical research through your well-intentioned effort to \n     prevent disreputable individuals or companies from attempting \n     to clone a human being. We recognize it is not your intent to \n     harm biomedical research. However, we respectfully point out \n     that this would be the likely result if the bill were to \n     become law in its current form.\n       Our first concern is that few of the scientific terms used \n     in the bill are defined. The bill defines the broad term \n     ``human somatic cell nuclear transfer technology,'' but the \n     definition is flawed in several ways. The use of the word \n     ``technology'', for example, implies that it is the physical \n     tools needed to carry out human somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     that are banned, not the process itself. The technology \n     needed to carry out such a nuclear transfer is readily \n     available in any modern biological laboratory dealing with \n     reproductive biology; surely it is not your intention to ban \n     these tools.\n       The definition also includes as banned the production of \n     ``an embryo (including a preimplantation embryo)''. This \n     inclusion would clearly interfere with work needed to develop \n     a variety of therapies described below for burn victims, \n     diabetes sufferers, and others suffering from more rate \n     genetic diseases.\n       The bill also does not define the term ``oocyte,'' which \n     many members of the Senate may not understand. It would be \n     useful to define term so these senators know what is being \n     discussed. The same could be said for the terms ``nuclear'', \n     ``nuclear transfer,'' ``cell,'' ``somatic cell,'' and \n     ``cloning.'' The point of this discussion of definitions is \n     that this whole area of biology is extremely complex, and the \n     process itself is only now beginning to be understood by \n     people who have devoted years of study to the subject. It is \n     thus premature to attempt to define in legislation a process \n     that is still evolving.\n       Second, we are concerned by the bill's permanent \n     prohibition of human somatic cell nuclear transfer. While no \n     responsible member of the life sciences community is in favor \n     of cloning humans at this time, there may come a time, after \n     further research and study, when it will be viewed as less \n     egregious. For example, infertile couples might appreciate \n     the availability of human somatic cell nuclear transfer, as \n     it might someday enable them to experience the joys and \n     rewards of parenthood.\n       Third, cloning is a widely used technique in modern biology \n     to produce large numbers of cells and other biological \n     materials scientist need to carry out modern biomedical \n     research. The National Institutes of Health has produced a \n     paper called ``Cloning: Present Uses and Promises'', which \n     discusses all of these issues in clear and useful detail.\n       This paper explains that human somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer can have profound benefits for human health if \n     research is allowed to proceed using the technique. For \n     example, a burn victim often needs skin grafts. Current \n     grafting techniques require taking undamaged skin from the \n     victim and grafting it onto the patient's burned areas. Skin \n     from other humans cannot be used because it would be rejected \n     by the victim's immune system. However, if adult cells can be \n     taken from the victim, treated in such a way as to return \n     them to an embryonic state and then made to grow into skin \n     cells, virtually unlimited quantities of the victim's own \n     skin could be grown and used as grafts. This skin would not \n     be rejected since it would be genetically identical to the \n     victims' original skin.\n       The NIH paper also discusses the potential use of somatic \n     cell nuclear transfer in attacking diabetes, and other, more \n     rare genetic diseases. Of course, these therapies are not \n     available now--but they might be in the future, if biomedical \n     research on the uses and limits of somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer is not permanently banned, as it would be under the \n     provisions of your bill.\n       Even though your bill notes that ``Nothing in this Act . . \n     . shall be construed to restrict areas of scientific research \n     that are not specifically prohibited . . .'' section 2 \n     declares that ``. . . it is right and proper to prohibit the \n     creation of cloned human embryos that would never have the \n     opportunity for implantation and that would therefore be \n     created solely for research that would ultimately lead to \n     their destruction.'' This language, plus the way your \n     definition of ``human somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     technology'' is phrased, makes it impossible for research to \n     continue on these therapies using somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer. We respectfully note that we cannot support such a \n     broad prohibition.\n       A fourth matter to consider is that history is replete with \n     examples of bad law that were primarily the products of undue \n     haste. In our view, human cloning is not going to occur soon \n     enough to justify taking this bill directly to the floor of \n     the Senate without hearings at the subcommittee and committee \n     level. Such hearings would develop the points we raise above \n     as well as many more, and explore the consequences (both \n     positive and negative) of the bill's provisions. There is no \n     need at this point to short-circuit the normal hearing \n     process, which serves our country and the Congress very well.\n       Finally, all of the above notwithstanding, it is not \n     absolutely clear that the now famous sheep Dolly was cloned \n     using an adult cell and not a fetal cell in the first pace. \n     One prominent researcher, Dr. Norton Zinder, of Rockefeller \n     University, believes that it has not been proven that Dolly \n     was created using the nucleus of a somatic cell. In a recent \n     letter to Science, he notes that so far, Dolly has not been \n     replicated, and that it took 400 tries to create her in the \n     first place. One success in 400 ``Is an anecdote, not a \n     result,'' he writes. Thus, since it has not been definitely \n     proven that an adult cell was used to clone Dolly, it is \n     possible that Dr. Wilmut's announcement approximately a year \n     ago was mistaken, and that a fetal cell was used by accident \n     (the sheep from which the cell was taken was pregnant at the \n     time, and fetal cells circulate throughout the body in such \n     situations).\n       Thus, it may be that there is no danger of somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer being used to clone a human being because it \n     cannot be done! We simply don't know at this point. It would \n     therefore be unfortunate if this technique, which has promise \n     in so many other biological applications, was placed ``off \n     limits'' to researchers before its promise and pitfalls were \n     thoroughly explored. This is yet another reason why haste is \n     not desirable.\n       Let me make it clear that the ASBMB does not support human \n     cloning. This is why the ASBMB Public Affairs Advisory \n     Committee supports the National Bioethics Advisory \n     Commission's call for a 5-year moratorium. The committee \n     adopted the following resolution in September 1997:\n       ``The ASBMB Public Affairs Advisory Committee supports the \n     declaration of a voluntary five-year moratorium on cloning \n     human beings, where `cloning human beings' is defined as the \n     duplication of an existing or previously existing human being \n     by transferring the nucleus of a differentiated, somatic cell \n     into an enucleated human oocyte, and implanting the resulting \n     product for intrauterine gestation and subsequent birth.''\n       Numerous life sciences organizations, such as the Society \n     for Developmental Biology, the Federation of American \n     Societies for Experimental Biology, the American Society for \n     Cell Biology, and the Association of American Medical \n     Colleges, have indicated their support for a voluntary \n     moratorium on human cloning. We are confident that such a \n     moratorium will be effective in preventing the act you fear \n     from occurring. It would also allow the issue to be revisited \n     later, after further research and deliberation.\n       We hope you will take all these thoughts into consideration \n     before moving ahead with a bill that is well-intentioned but \n     which could also do serious harm to biomedical research \n     unless it is modified. We would be pleased to provide you \n     with further information on these issues in the days and \n     weeks ahead.\n       For your information, the American Society for Biochemistry \n     and Molecular Biology,\n\n[[Page S575]]\n\n     founded in 1906, is a scientific and educational organization \n     with a membership of 10,200 life scientists who teach or \n     conduct research at most of our country's colleges and \n     universities, nonprofit research institutions, in industry, \n     and for the federal government.

Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mack: The Congress is moving rapidly, indeed \n     precipitously, to legislate a ban on attempts to produce a \n     human being by somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) \n     technology. The bill sponsored by Senators Bond, Frist, Gregg \n     and others, if passed, would be the first to ban a specific \n     line of research. I believe this is a serious mistake, one \n     that we could regret because of its unintended implications \n     for otherwise valuable biomedical research.\n       Extending the President's moratorium to the private sector \n     would provide an interim solution to preventing any and all \n     attempts to produce a human being by SCNT until a \n     congressional commission determined whether and what kind of \n     legislation would be appropriation.\n       I call to your attention a position statement supported by \n     many scientific societies which recommends a course of action \n     you should consider.\n       At the request of the National Bioethics Advisory \n     Commission, the American Society for Cell Biology recommended \n     in the Spring of 1997 a voluntary international moratorium on \n     human nuclear transfer for the purpose of creating a new \n     human being. This would allow scientists and the public the \n     opportunity to determine the safety and appropriateness of \n     such experimentation.\n       The ASCB continues to support such a moratorium as a \n     constructive interim response to the concerns raised by the \n     cloning of an adult sheep. However, recent events in the U.S. \n     have escalated and infused new urgency into this debate, \n     resulting in increased demands for regulatory legislation.\n       The ASCB urges that if legislation is needed, it should \n     specifically be concerned with the reproduction of a human \n     being by nuclear transfer. At the same time, any legislation \n     should not impede or interfere with existing and potential \n     critical research fundamental to the prevention or cure of \n     human disease. This research often includes the cloning of \n     human and animal cell lines and DNA, but not whole human \n     beings.\n       The National Biomedical Advisory Commission did recommend a \n     three to five year moratorium on human nuclear transfer for \n     the purpose of creating a new human being in order to allow \n     time to evaluate the safety of and public views about such \n     procedures. The ASCB urges that the Commission's \n     recommendation be the basis for any federal legislation.\n           Very sincerely yours,\n                                                        Paul Berg,\n     Nobel Laureate, Chemistry, 1980.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          The American Society for\n\n\n                                                 Cell Biology,\n\n                                   Bethesda, MD, February 9, 1998.\n     To the President of the United States and Members of the \n         United States Congress:\n       There is a broad consensus supporting the President's \n     National Biomedical Ethics Advisory Commission's proposal to \n     ban the creation of a human being by somatic nuclear \n     transplants. The Commission urged that such a ban should not \n     deliberately or inadvertently interfere with biomedical \n     research that is critical to the understanding and eventual \n     prevention of human disease. To that end, we the undersigned \n     endorse the statement on cloning from the American Society \n     for Cell Biology. If legislation is deemed to be necessary, \n     we respectfully urge you to ensure that it be limited to the \n     cloning of human beings, and does not include language that \n     impedes critical ongoing and potential new research.\n           Sincerely,\n         Sidney Altman, Sterling Professor of Biology, Professor \n           Chemistry, Yale University, Nobel Prize in Chemistry, \n           1989; Kenneth J.

While the majority of the scientific \n     community and the public supports a ban on human cloning, the\n\n[[Page S576]]\n\n     bill's language would effect other important areas of medical \n     and scientific research.\n       As President of The American Society of Human Genetics \n     representing over 6,000 researchers in the field human \n     genetics, I want to go on record as opposing this bill.\n       Congress must make sure that any bill would not restrict or \n     inhibit stem cell research which is being used to create a \n     whole new type of therapy--cell therapy. Congress must also \n     make sure that research is not restricted into the pathology \n     of disease, gene therapy research, research into the ways \n     genes operate in the cell and other basic biomedical research \n     which gives hope that we can find and develop cures and \n     therapies for deadly and disabling diseases.\n       Thank you for allowing us to go on record as opposing S. \n     1601.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                               Arthur Beaudet, MD,\n     President, ASHG.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          National Association for\n\n\n                                          Biomedical Research,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: The NABR membership respectfully \n     requests that you vote ``no'' next Tuesday, February 10, when \n     a motion to invoke cloture and proceed to consider S. 1601, a \n     bill to ban human cloning, is scheduled to come before the \n     Senate. There is virtually unanimous agreement that human \n     beings should not be cloned. However, as currently drafted S. \n     1601 threatens to restrict research efforts far beyond those \n     which could involve cloning human beings. The proposal is \n     going to the floor without the customary committee \n     consideration and recommendation. The result is a well-\n     intentioned, but ill-defined, measure that will destroy \n     promising new research avenues that might provide long-\n     awaited solutions to untold human suffering. Your ``no'' vote \n     is needed to protect responsible biomedical research and \n     allow this legislation to receive the full deliberation it \n     deserves.\n       We all fear a disastrous outcome of new cloning \n     technologies; however, S. 1601 is not focused on outcomes. \n     Rather, for the first time, the government would ban a \n     specific research technique and process. To prevent a real or \n     imagined future calamity, approval of this bill would mean \n     the public must also forego all the beneficial fruits of \n     ``somatic cell nuclear transfer,'' including the possible \n     cloning of cells or tissue to cure and treat cancer, \n     diabetes, Alzheimer's and many other illnesses. (Please see \n     enclosed Time article for further discussion.) For this \n     reason, Congress certainly should take the time to carefully \n     consider S. 1601 and other proposals dealing with human \n     cloning. Surely, the people whose healthy futures depend on \n     more and better research must have the opportunity to \n     understand and participate in the decisions Congress is \n     facing. The current rush to pass imprecise, misunderstood \n     legislation to ban human cloning is much more dangerous to \n     the pubic than the remote chance a mad scientist might \n     actually attempt it in the near future.\n       Until the moral, ethical and medical questions surrounding \n     the possibility are fully explored and satisfactorily \n     answered, no one should try to duplicate a human being by \n     cloning. The nation's leading scientific, medical, \n     pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations agree and have \n     already subscribed to a voluntary moratorium to this effect. \n     In addition, the Food and Drug Administration has announced \n     it will exercise regulatory authority over human cloning \n     should any irresponsible individual try to ignore the \n     mainstream scientific community. Therefore, it is not \n     necessary to act hastily in the absence of all the facts.\n       Should you or your staff require additional information, \n     please contact NABR. Thank you for your consideration of this \n     urgent matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Frankie L.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       The Federation of American Societies for Experimental \n     Biology (FASEB) urges the Senate to proceed extremely \n     cautiously as it considers legislation regarding human \n     cloning. While the Federation considers the cloning of human \n     being to be reprehensible, dangerous, and unethical, we are \n     concerned that overly restrictive legislation could \n     unintentionally preclude critical research of great benefit \n     to the American people. We believe that S. 1599, currently \n     pending consideration by the Senate, would be damaging to \n     worthwhile research. By flatly banning all use of human \n     somatic cell nuclear technology for any purpose, this \n     legislation would close off key areas of research which do \n     not involve the creation of humans. We urge that the Senate \n     not approve this legislation in its current form as it does \n     not balance appropriate ethical considerations with the \n     health needs of the American people.\n\n\n                                        Ralph G.

I have a letter from the University of \nCalifornia at San Diego, from the professor of the Division of Cellular \nand Molecular Medicine, the Department of Pharmacology, University of \nCalifornia; another one from Dr. Bishop, Nobel laureate, University of \nCalifornia; a letter from the Whitehead Institute; another letter from \nthe University of California from the Vice President of Health Affairs \nand the Vice Provost of Research; a letter from Dr. Roger Pedersen, \nprofessor and research director of the Reproductive Genetics Unit, \nUniversity of California, San Francisco; and a letter from the Nobel \nlaureate of chemistry to Senator Mack. In 1980, he won the Nobel prize.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     University of California,\n\n                                 San Diego, CA, February 10, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to urge you to \n     continue working to protect basic biomedical research in any \n     proposed human cloning legislation. While we all agree that \n     ``cloning'' a complete human being is undesirable and \n     unethical at present, it is very important that any \n     legislation that is passed not inadvertently block important \n     research into regenerative technology, or into the creation \n     of artificially grown human organs for transplantation and \n     other purposes. For example, as you know the recently \n     proposed Bond/Frist cloning bill, S. 1599 in the Senate is \n     far too broad and would ban many related and valuable \n     research and medical activities. Your bill S. 1602 with \n     Senator Edward Kennedy (D-MA) bans the implantation of the \n     product of somatic cell nuclear transfer into a woman's womb. \n     The language in S. 1602 appears much more reasonable and with \n     minor modification could be recommended for support by the \n     scientific community.\n       For your information, I have reproduced below a statement \n     from the American Society for Cell Biology on cloning, which \n     clearly delineates principles that many scientists feel are \n     most useful in thinking about this important legislative \n     challenge.\n\n``The American Society for Cell Biology Statement on Cloning, January, \n                                  1998\n\n       ``At the request of the National Bioethics Advisory \n     Commission, the American Society for Cell Biology recommended \n     in the Spring of 1997 a voluntary international moratorium on \n     human nuclear transfer for the purpose of creating a new \n     human being.

The ASCB urges that the Commission's \n     recommendation be the basis for any federal legislation.''\n       It is very important that our citizens and legislators \n     think calmly and carefully about what legislation is passed \n     in this area. We must ensure that we do not inadvertently \n     hold back important and valuable medical research. I am sure \n     that simple and temporary legislation, which doesn't seek to \n     be too broad in its scope, and introduce many unintended \n     consequences would be the best strategy. I hope that you will \n     proceed with great caution.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lawrence S.B.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am very concerned about efforts to \n     bring Senate Bill 1599, the Bond bill, to an immediate vote. \n     While I agree that there should be a national ban on human \n     cloning, it is essential that any such law protect areas of \n     critical research that can benefit human health. The Bond \n     bill's generic ban on the use of ``human somatic cell nuclear \n     transfer technology,'' would, in fact, be quite damaging to \n     medical research progress in the United States.\n       The Bond bill would seriously limit our ability to develop \n     new cell-based strategies to fight cancer, diabetes, and \n     Alzheimer's disease. It would also prevent vital research on \n     the repair of spinal cord injuries and severe burns.\n       I urge you to convey to your colleagues that the Bond bill \n     would cause us to lose ground in the battle against deadly \n     and disabling human diseases. In contrast, Senate\n\n[[Page S577]]\n\n     Bill 1602 (the Feinstein/Kennedy bill) focuses on the \n     implantation of the product of somatic cell nuclear transfer. \n     By banning implantation, the Feinstein/Kennedy bill would \n     permit life-saving research to continue and still prohibit \n     the cloning of human beings.\n       All major advances in technology raise new ethical, legal, \n     and social issues. The cloning issues are particularly \n     complex. I appreciate your efforts to promote widespread and \n     careful public deliberation and, at the same time to foster \n     important advances in human health.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Gerald R.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are writing on behalf of the \n     University of California to urge you to vote against the \n     upcoming cloture motion for S. 1601, the cloning bill. While \n     we recognize the sensitivity and importance of this issue, \n     the University is concerned that premature legislation on \n     cloning, however well intentioned, may prove to be too \n     inclusive, with resulting negative consequences on future \n     advances in biomedical research.\n       The current opportunities in biomedical research are \n     unparalleled. Thousands of experiments are carried out each \n     day in the university laboratories using routine molecular \n     and cellular research approaches involving human tissues, \n     cells and molecules. Over the past two decades, this research \n     has contributed to major advances in our understanding of the \n     molecular and cellular basis of human disease. It has led to \n     important new medical advances, including the production of \n     human insulin, hepatitis vaccine, and sensitive diagnostics \n     for AIDS. The scientific techniques involved in cloning \n     research are very promising in terms of our ability to treat \n     and manage myriad diseases and disorders, ranging from cancer \n     to heart disease, to Parkinson's and Alzhemier's, to \n     infertility and HIV/AIDS. These advances have saved hundreds \n     of thousands of lives and dramatically reduced health care \n     costs.\n       We urge you to vote no on the motion to invoke cloture on \n     S. 1601, so that there is more time to consider the \n     implications of cloning legislation. If Congress chooses to \n     enact legislation, we urge you to make certain that any \n     legislative language does not prohibit legitimate and \n     worthwhile scientific research that has the potential to \n     provide enormous health benefits. We would be happy to offer \n     our resources as the legislative debate continues.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cornelius L. Hopper,\n                                   Vice President, Health Affairs.\n     Robert N.

Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mack: I understand that the U.S. Senate is \n     considering several bills related to human cloning. One of \n     these bills, introduced by Senator Bond and others, prohibits \n     human somatic nuclear transfer to be used for the purpose of \n     creating an embryo. Although this bill, as I understand it, \n     protects many areas of science, the specific prohibition on \n     somatic nuclear transfer is unwarranted and potentially \n     detrimental to medical research.\n       The fundamental flaw in this legislation is the prohibition \n     of a technology irrespective of its application. Such \n     prohibition forecloses on any benefit from the technology, \n     even if that benefit were in no way objectionable. Many well-\n     intentioned people fail to understand that somatic cell \n     nuclear transfer is not limited to cloning an organism. There \n     are many examples of possible future applications of this \n     technology to produce healthy tissue for therapeutic \n     purposes, such as skin grafts for burn patients, or even to \n     create insulin-producing cells for diabetics. There may also \n     be applications for cancer patients who need a bone marrow \n     transplant for whom a match cannot be found.\n       The Senate should instead address its attention to specific \n     applications of this technology that are unwanted in our \n     society, such as creating a new human being.\n       I hope that you will work to ensure that research on this \n     promising technology is allowed to continue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      J.M. Bishop,\n     Nobel Laureate.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 February 4, 1998.\n     Hon. Senator Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: I am writing to express my deep \n     concern about the negative impact of impending legislation \n     introduced by Senators Bond, Frist et al. (S. 1599) intended \n     to regulate cloning of a human being. As an active researcher \n     in the scientific field of the discovery leading to Dolly, I \n     understand its implications for basic science and human \n     health. Dolly's existence proves for the first time that the \n     genetic material of an adult body cell can be completely \n     reprogrammed by the egg, thus totally restoring the genetic \n     potential for specializing into all possible cell types. This \n     discovery that genetic reprogramming is possible in mammals \n     is as important to human health as the discovery of \n     penicillin. Basic research on genetic reprogramming will \n     likely lead to novel transplantation therapies for numerous \n     human diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, \n     neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson disease), \n     genetic diseases and birth defects. I believe that imprecise, \n     hastily-written legislation against human cloning, such as S. \n     1599, will hinder these important research opportunities for \n     understanding genetic reprogramming of adult cells. Excessive \n     regulation as specified by S. 1599, including civil penalties \n     and criminalization, in the area of this new discovery is \n     likely to thwart the momentum of basic research on genetic \n     reprogramming and deter the enthusiasm and ability of \n     researchers poised to make major new contributions in \n     applying their findings to human health problems.\n       In no conceivable instance would research on genetic \n     reprogramming involve cloning of human beings. Indeed, \n     active, credible researchers and clinicians overwhelmingly \n     regard cloning a human being as an unethical and \n     reprehensible act. Last year, working through the Society for \n     Developmental Biology, I spearheaded a voluntary moratorium \n     on cloning human beings. This moratorium unequivocally \n     states that we have no intention to clone human beings, \n     where this is defined as ``duplication of an existing or \n     previously existing human being by transferring the \n     nucleus of a differentiated, somatic cell into an \n     enucleated human oocyte, and implanting the resulting \n     product for intrauterine gestation and subsequent birth.'' \n     To date, 15 additional scientific and medical societies, \n     including the Federation of American Societies for \n     Experimental Biology, the American Society for \n     Reproductive Medicine, and the Society for the Study of \n     Reproduction, together representing more than 60,000 \n     reproductive, developmental, cell and molecular \n     biologists, have endorsed this moratorium. Historical \n     precedent (with recombinant DNA technology) indicates that \n     a voluntary moratorium can deter activities that are \n     potentially unsafe for humans. It is evident from recent \n     events that anyone who advocates cloning human beings for \n     any purpose will be subjected to ostracism and discredited \n     scientifically. Therefore, I believe that the existing \n     voluntary moratorium against cloning human beings is an \n     effective means of regulating the behavior of U.S. \n     scientists and physicians.\n       Presently, the fields of developmental biology and human \n     genetics are at an exciting juncture, where many novel genes \n     are being identified through the Human Genome Project and \n     their functions during normal development are being \n     understood for the first time. In addition, an understanding \n     of how these genes interact with the internal and external \n     environment of the cell is emerging for studies such as those \n     giving rise to Dolly. Deriving the full benefits of these new \n     insights for human health will require a dedicated and \n     cooperative research effort by many scientists, including \n     those who conduct research on human cells and tissues.\n       In conclusion, there is a great risk that anti-cloning \n     legislation would deprive the American people of \n     unprecedented human health benefits. I thus urge extreme \n     caution in any legal sanctions, such as those included in S. \n     1599, which would have lasting detrimental effects on our \n     ability to alleviate human diseases, and would also undermine \n     the competitive abilities of U.S. scientists in our field.\n       Respectfully yours,\n                                         Roger A. Pedersen, Ph.D.,\n         Professor and Research Director, Reproductive Genetics \n           Unit, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology, and \n           Reproductive Science.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. There are new letters from industry groups. There is \na very interesting letter from Genentech. Genentech is a huge biotech \nfirm. Actually, biotechnology was spawned out of San Francisco and \nGenentech was one of the very first companies in the Nation to enter \nthis area. They have a very cogent letter that states well their \nopposition. They point out, ``. . . deliberate and exercise caution and \nrestraint in legislating this issue.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the February 9 letter from the \nBiotechnology Industry Organization be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, it has been ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n  Regarding Human Cloning Legislation Tuesday Cloture Vote: S. 1601, \n                               Bond/Lott\n\n                                                 February 9, 1998.\n       Dear Senator: Tomorrow the Senate is scheduled to vote on \n     cloture on S. 1601, the Bond/Lott human cloning bill. The \n     Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO) urges you to vote \n     ``no'' on the cloture petition. BIO represents 760 \n     biotechnology companies throughout the world engaged in \n     research on diseases, the immune system, cell therapy, \n     vaccines, drugs/biologics, antibiotics, and gene therapy.\n       The Bond/Lott bill is not ripe for consideration by the \n     Senate. It was introduced on Wednesday of last week, no \n     hearings have\n\n[[Page S578]]\n\n     been held on it and no mark-up in the two committees with \n     jurisdiction have been held on it. Most important, the bill \n     as drafted would have a dire impact on biomedical research \n     completely unrelated to human cloning.\n       This is not a human cloning bill. This is a bill which bans \n     the use of biomedical technology even if that use has nothing \n     whatever to do with human cloning.\n       A ``no'' vote is a vote to protect biomedical research on \n     deadly and disabling diseases.\n       There is no rush to legislate. The FDA has jurisdiction \n     over Dr. Seed and any others. Violations of the FDA \n     regulatory requirements carry draconian penalties. A ``no'' \n     vote is a vote to proceed with caution to make sure that \n     biomedical research is not harmed.\n       A ``no'' vote is a vote to restrict this bill to the human \n     cloning issue.\n       A ``no'' vote is a vote to permit the Senate Labor and \n     Senate Judiciary Committees, which have jurisdiction over the \n     bills to take care to draft the legislation and confine it to \n     the human cloning issue.\n       BIO believes that a human cloning experiment would be \n     utterly unethical and unsafe. What we are writing about here \n     is our views on the terms of the Bond/Lott bill, not the \n     larger debate about human cloning.\n       Attached is a more detailed statement outlining our \n     concerns about the Bond/Lott bill which was printed in the \n     Congressional Record on Thursday. If you have any questions \n     about our position, please feel free to call at 857-0244.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Bradish,\n       Director, Federal Government Relations.\n     Charles E.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJanuary 28 letter from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of \nAmerica be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                  Pharmaceutical Research and,\n\n                                     Manufacturers of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I urge you to consider any \n     legislative proposals to ban the cloning of an entire human \n     being with great caution. The research-based pharmaceutical \n     industry appreciates the widespread ethical and moral \n     concerns about the possibility of creating a genetic \n     duplicate of an existing (or previously existing) human \n     being. We also share the view expressed by the National \n     Bioethics Advisory Commission that such a procedure is \n     unsafe.\n       For equally valid ethical, moral and safety reasons, we are \n     concerned that some pending proposals would inadvertently \n     harm patients with unmet needs and their families. The member \n     companies of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of \n     America support the President's call for a voluntary \n     moratorium on any cloning of an entire human being. However, \n     the best help and heal patients, biomedical researchers need \n     to be able to continue to clone human genes, cells and \n     tissues. If not drafted with laser-precision, legislation to \n     ban ``human cloning'' could--unintentionally, but \n     heartbreakingly--stop life-saving and health-enhancing \n     medical research.\n       The Food and Drug Administration has announced it will \n     prevent any cloning of an entire human being. The FDA's \n     assertion of regulatory authority eliminates any need for \n     well-intended but risky haste. In your consideration of any \n     legislative proposals, we urge you to protect patients and \n     their families from unintended impediments to ethical, moral \n     and safe biomedical research that does not involve any \n     cloning of an entire human being, but does involve cloning \n     human genes, cells or tissues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan F. Holmer,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The California Biomedical Research Organization ``. . \n. urges you to support continuing debate about the potential negative \nimpact of Senator Trent Lott's legislation.''\n  This is accompanied by, I would have to say, 30 campuses and \ncompanies. Ligand Pharmaceuticals, two letters for the Record. I ask \nunanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Genentech, Inc.\n\n                              San Francisco, CA, February 9, 1998.\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mack: I am writing with regard to legislative \n     proposals currently pending in the Senate relating to cloning \n     entire human beings. This vexing topic needs to be put into a \n     larger perspective before the Senate votes on a bill, S. \n     1601, which was introduced only last week.\n       The biotechnology and research community has been very open \n     and public about its support for the President's request for \n     a voluntary moratorium on activities that could lead to the \n     cloning of entire human beings. This exercise of \n     responsibility in science is consistent with our long history \n     of restraint in the pursuit of basic biomedical research. We \n     do not plan or seek to clone entire human beings. In \n     addition, we fully recognize the existence of various federal \n     laws setting out the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug \n     Administration which, when taken together, would bar the \n     commercialization of cloning of entire human beings. Because \n     of this moratorium and existing legal limitations on action, \n     it is possible to deliberate and exercise caution and \n     restraint in legislating this issue.\n       The reality of modern biomedical research is that it is \n     difficult to predict in advance exactly how specific, even \n     esoteric, areas of research will produce breakthroughs. As \n     Michael Bishop (cancer researcher, Nobel laureate in medicine \n     and my colleague from the University of California, San \n     Francisco) spoke of this issue recently, in 1968 his work \n     with Dr. Harold Varmus, and Professor Herb Boyer would have \n     never been foreseen as leading to breakthroughs in \n     recombinant DNA research and cancer genetics. Similarly, work \n     done in the 1980s on transgenic animals by Dr. Phil Leder, of \n     Harvard, and others, would not have easily been understood as \n     being essential to the development of animal models that \n     could facilitate dramatic advances in our ability to test new \n     AIDS therapies.\n       It is also the case that with virtually every scientific \n     advance there are voices that seek to delay legitimate, if \n     misunderstood, advances in science. In the early 1970s, some \n     government officials sought to vary virtually all recombinant \n     DNA research out of exaggerated fears about the safety of the \n     technology. Researchers and companies voluntarily adopted a \n     moratorium on some research until more information was \n     obtained. Fortunately, the calls for more radical local or \n     federal regulation were rejected. The self-regulatory efforts \n     by industry and the research community worked, and there were \n     no significant safety issues to arise out of that research.\n       In the 1980s some critics advocated bans on transgenic \n     animal research out of fear of science. These requests for a \n     halt to research were often based on assertions of \n     pseudoscience. Again, we are fortunate that Congress did not \n     act to bar the creation of transgenic animals, which are now \n     so commonly used in drug development, especially in AIDS \n     research. In addition, transgenic animals may someday be used \n     for the actual production of pharmaceutical compounds. This \n     hope for pure protein production at a lower cost is yet to be \n     realized, but if Congress had acted in the 1980s to end \n     research, patients would have had that hope foreclosed.\n       Now Congress is faced with difficult decisions about how to \n     react to a single experiment in sheep. Each side of the \n     current debate has sincere motivations and convictions about \n     its legislative approach. Senators Bond, Frist and others \n     have bona fide concerns about cloning human beings and hope \n     that their bill would not affect biomedical research. Yet, \n     determining how to prohibit the act of cloning an entire \n     human being has proven to be a daunting task. For a set of \n     reasons outlined below, we prefer the approach taken in the \n     bill, S. 1602, to that found in the bill currently pending, \n     S. 1601.\n       Most importantly, in considering restrictions on scientific \n     research in the private sector (as opposed to previously \n     enacted limitations on the expenditure of federal funds), \n     great care must be exercised. In addition to the legal rights \n     of persons to free expression and inquiry in the private \n     market, there is little precedent for imposing limitations on \n     research except for reasons of safety or other narrowly \n     crafted circumstances.\n       In this instance, there are multiple possibilities of \n     promising research with somatic cells. Our hope in the \n     research community is that this branch of research will lead \n     to discoveries that permit us to develop new cures and \n     treatments for serious and unmet medical needs. Some of our \n     colleagues in academe have already begun exploring questions \n     of how to turn on and off these somatic cells so that new \n     biological material could be generated for transplantation \n     and for other therapeutic purposes. At this point in the \n     discovery process, it is not known exactly how to accomplish \n     this therapeutic goal, but one possible way is to use the \n     technique known as somatic nuclear cell transfer. Such \n     research could, in some circumstances, involve conduct that \n     would be permitted under S. 1602 and would be criminalized \n     under S. 1. This difference (among others noted below) is the \n     reason we prefer your bill.\n       There seems to be little dispute within the Congress about \n     the current inappropriateness of using somatic nuclear cell \n     transfer technology to create an embryo which is implanted \n     into the uterus, with the goal being reproductive in nature. \n     On the other hand, it is hard to understand why scientists \n     should become criminals if they pursue legitimate new \n     therapies for heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and other \n     diseases, and if their research has no prospect or intent of \n     creating an entire cloned human being.\n       Given our current state of knowledge, there is no \n     reasonable prospect for creating a new human being unless an \n     embryo is implanted into the uterus of a woman. Thus, the \n     approach should be to adopt a bill that effectively bars what \n     the political consensus\n\n[[Page S579]]\n\n     wants to prohibit, while simultaneously retaining the option \n     of research that is aimed at new therapies, not at \n     reproductive ends.\n       There are several other reasons to support the approach \n     taken in S. 1602:\n       S. 1602 preempts inconsistent state laws. Given the rush to \n     judgment in various states, the high likelihood for \n     overlapping and inconsistent standards, and the clearly \n     negative effect on interstate commerce, a federal standard is \n     appropriate.\n       S. 1602, unlike S. 1601, uses a civil penalty structure \n     that will be sufficient to deter unwanted conduct. If \n     criminal penalties or asset forfeiture are threatened for \n     research activities, there is likely to be a chilling effect \n     on research in this entire area. Moreover, there are \n     additional sanctions available under the Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act to address human cloning.\n       S. 1602 appropriately requires that Congress should review \n     these limitations on research after a set period of time. \n     This review could be facilitated if, using carefully drawn \n     criteria, there was a balanced review of this area of \n     research by a nonpolitical entity.\n       The suggestion in S. 1602 for international cooperation on \n     this topic is welcome, as is the ratification of the \n     authority of the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug \n     Administration.\n       One final point, S. 1601 would establish a commission that \n     could approach the bioethics questions associated with \n     certain limited new somatic cell nuclear transfer \n     technologies. This concept is worthy of serious \n     consideration. As we approach scientific advances, it is \n     important that we make sure that science reflects our basic \n     human and ethical values.\n       The work done by existing entities, such as the Recombinant \n     DNA Advisory Committee of the NIH, and the NIH-DOE Working \n     Group on Ethical, Legal, and Social Implications of Human \n     Genome Research, has advanced the public discussion. In this \n     regard, the work already done by the President's Commission \n     on the topic of cloning entire human beings has materially \n     assisted the national debate on this topic. We leave to the \n     political process questions of whether any such bioethics \n     commission should be situated in the Executive Branch and who \n     should exercise the appointment authority.\n       There are several caveats worth noting, however:\n       Past history, here and in Europe, suggests that there is a \n     real risk that any such commission could inadvertently begin \n     to function as a new regulatory entity and serve to delay the \n     approval of new treatments for patients. This temptation \n     should be avoided at all costs by explicitly limiting the \n     role of the commission.\n       There is a risk that any new commission will be led by \n     other political agendas into discussions that do not advance \n     progress on improving human health. This temptation should \n     also be avoided by narrowly circumscribing the commission's \n     charter.\n       The composition of any commission should broadly reflect \n     the best available thinking in science, law, and ethics. The \n     mere prohibition on political officials serving on such a \n     panel is not likely sufficient to prevent the politicization \n     of the appointment process. There are, I understand, \n     precedents that permit certain relevant professional \n     societies to offer lists of nominees to an appointing \n     authority. This approach would appear to mitigate the risk of \n     an overly political appointment process.\n       In closing, let me thank you for having the special \n     sensitivity and commitment to biomedical research to ask for \n     greater deliberation and for crafting a more precise bill \n     that seeks a uniform consensus about how to ban the cloning \n     of entire human beings.\n       The issue before the Senate is: Can we simultaneously \n     advance science and the search for cures for serious diseases \n     while also barring the cloning of entire human beings? We \n     believe that to foster further dialogue and deliberation can \n     help achieve that common goal.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Art Levinson,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             California Biomedical\n\n\n                                         Research Association,\n\n                                 Sacramento, CA, February 9, 1998.\n     Hon.

Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: Ligand Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San \n     Diego and its more than 300 employees, like other responsible \n     members of the biomedical community, deplore the recent \n     announcement by Dr. Richard Seed of his intention to clone a \n     human being. We regard such an effort to be medically \n     irresponsible and ethically abhorrent. Nevertheless, we are \n     concerned that Congress and State legislatures, in \n     understandable zeal to prevent Dr. Seed and anyone of a like \n     mind from actually attempting to clone a human, will enact \n     legislation that fails to distinguish between vital medical \n     research and misguided human cloning. Therefore, we ask that \n     you and other members of Congress carefully consider both the \n     need for and the scope of any legislation addressing this \n     issue before acting upon it.\n       With respect to whether legislation is needed, Ligand \n     suggests a careful review of existing legislation to \n     determine whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     already has the authority to regulate research related to and \n     the actual cloning of a human being. Many, including the \n     Biotechnology Industry Organization to which Ligand belongs, \n     believes the FDA has this authority.\n       If legislation is deemed to be necessary, it should achieve \n     two important ends. The first is that it should be drafted \n     narrowly to deal with the cloning of a human being and not \n     contain broad or even ambiguous prohibitions on cloning which \n     would halt or disrupt vital medical research based upon \n     widely accepted cloning techniques. Secondly, it should be \n     preemptive of State laws governing cloning. Biomedical \n     research is carried out, often with Federal funding, \n     throughout the United States. This research occurs in public \n     and private universities and in big and small companies. Much \n     of this research is done on a collaborative basis involving \n     entities in more than one state. Furthermore, every advance \n     paves the way for further progress. The individual states \n     should not, therefore, be allowed to erect a maze of law and \n     regulation which unnecessarily regulates this area of \n     research.\n       Congress, unlike the states, has ready access to the \n     expertise of NIH, NSF, FDA and other sources of expertise \n     that should be drawn upon before the drafting of appropriate \n     legislation. That fact, and the interlocking nature of \n     biomedical research, suggests that preemption is in the best \n     interests of the country with respect to dealing with the \n     issues raised by Dr. Seed. We believe this to be the case \n     even though our Federal system rightly contemplates that the \n     fifty states can exercise sovereignty in most areas, either \n     in concert with, or in the absence of legislation at the \n     national level.\n       Should you, therefore, have the opportunity to shape the \n     debate on this important, and even emotional issue, we ask \n     that you support hearings which address first whether new \n     legislation is required. If a reasoned analysis of current \n     law suggests that FDA is not able to effectively regulate, \n     then\n\n[[Page S580]]\n\n     and only then should legislation carefully drawn based on \n     input from the biomedical community be enacted.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               William L. Respess,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       Ligand Pharmaceuticals,\n\n                                      San Diego, February 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of Ligand \n     Pharmaceuticals Inc. asking that you oppose Senator Bond's \n     Bill S. 1599 concerning human cloning. It is my understanding \n     that this bill is to come up for a vote without hearings or \n     mark-up. We believe that is an action that is too precipitous \n     and could result in legislation which will adversely impact \n     the biomedical industry.\n       I wrote to you on February 2, 1998 expressing opposition to \n     the announcement by Dr. Richard Seed to engage in an effort \n     to clone a human being. However, legislation or regulation to \n     ban such activity must be carefully drawn so as not to \n     inhibit legitimate research. Therefore, it is essential that \n     hearings be held on any bill to permit testimony by \n     scientists, representatives of the biomedical industry, and \n     others potentially affected by such legislation to be heard \n     on the specifics of any bill. This is not the time for a \n     justifiable rush to judgment on Dr. Seed's announced \n     intention to result in hastily conceived legislation which \n     may do as much harm as good. Research on cloning and the use \n     of cloning techniques are important to the progress of \n     medical science. While Congress should move with deliberate \n     speed, this is not the occasion to act outside of the usual \n     congressional scheme of engaging in hearings before \n     appropriate committees before taking action on matters of \n     such import.\n       In my letter of February 2, 1998, I suggested that Congress \n     first look to determine whether the FDA already has the \n     authority to regulate in this area and, only if it is \n     persuaded that the FDA lacks such authority, to undertake to \n     draft legislation. I still believe that is the most \n     appropriate process.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               William L. Respess,\n                                            Senior Vice President.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me be very clear. Every letter \nthat is coming in says: Stop, consider, proceed cautiously; this bill \nwould be harmful; it would stop vital research. What is the rush, since \nthe FDA has asserted jurisdiction and the scientific community has \nengaged in a moratorium? Why proceed like this in such haste, straight \nto the floor?\n  Only two letters have come in saying, proceed like this: One from the \nChristian Coalition, and the other one is from the National Right to \nLife Committee, two letters. The entire scientific community says, go \nslow, define your terms, know what you are doing.\n  Let me share with you what I understand this technology is. Let's say \na somatic cell were taken out of my tissue. The nucleus of that cell is \nremoved and is entered into an egg cell and fused. That cell, once \nfused, begins to divide and create more cells. The only way that cell \ncan produce a human being is if it is put into a human uterus. \nOtherwise, it cannot produce a human being. We don't even know if it \nwill produce a human being if it is put in a uterus. There is only one \nknown instance in an animal, Dolly, which now Science magazine has \nchallenged in a major way. But what we do know is that those stem \ncells, because of their DNA, can clone tissue.\n  For example, a third-degree-burn patient who may reject a skin graft \nmay some day get a skin graft made from his or her own cells and will \nnot reject it. My husband, Bert Feinstein, died of colon cancer and \nliver cancer. What a miracle if those cells could have been used to \ncome up with a cancer treatment that would have prevented his death. \nThat is really where we are. That is what we hope for.\n  There are no definitions in the bill. We don't know what they call a \nsomatic cell. We don't know what they call an embryo. The bill does not \ndefine oocyte. But the point is, we have to know, and these terms have \nto be spelled out in the legislation.\n  The bill says, if there is this stem tissue research, it is illegal, \nand the scientists have a 10-year sentence.\n  So what we are begging, imploring, respectfully asking the \ndistinguished majority leader is, please, let's not proceed tomorrow. \nLet's observe the regular order. Let's go to committee. Let Senator \nKennedy and I have an opportunity to present our bill. Let's have the \nmajority leader, Senators Bond and Frist, whom I respect, have an \nopportunity to present their bill. Let's discuss it and see what is \nbest. Then at least we have heard everybody with knowledge.\n  Let me be clear. I want a bill. I want a carefully crafted bill. I \nwant this Congress to act to ban the cloning of human beings.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak \nas if in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S566-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S580-S583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            FEDERAL SURPLUS PROPERTY IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Federal \nSurplus Property Improvement Act of 1998'' and ask my colleagues for \ntheir support of this legislation.\n  Congressional oversight of our country's surplus personal property \ndonation program may not be a topic of debate in the Senate, but it is \nof great importance to my constituents and the 70,000 recipients of \nsurplus federal personal property in all of our states.\n  Members of Congress and state and local officials all have an \nobligation to see that the government distributes this property fairly \nand equitably, ensuring accountability to the taxpayers.\n  Too often, federal agencies forget that the owners of this property \nare the American people--the federal government is merely its public \ncustodian.\n  As my colleagues may know, once a piece of federal personal property \nsuch as a typewriter, chair or vehicle is declared ``excess'' by a \nfederal agency, it is offered to other federal agencies for their use. \nIf no other agency can utilize the property, it is donated to the \nstates or other public agencies.\n  The current system of disposal is based on reforms signed into law by \nPresident Ford over twenty years ago.\n  The reforms to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act \nof 1949 enacted in 1976 were based on concerns that as surplus property \ndistribution programs multiplied, confusion and inefficiency on the \npart of the federal government grew as well.\n  Congress realized that the various state agencies and the General \nServices Administration should work together to ensure a fair and \nequitable allocation of surplus federal property to eligible \nrecipients.\n  Under this new partnership, states would have a greater role over \ndistribution, while GSA would guide the overall system on the federal \nside.\n  Mr. President, the 1976 reforms also broadened the pool of eligible \nrecipients to include parks and recreation, conservation, public health \nand public safety.\n  Since then, each state agency for surplus property has worked with \nneighboring state agencies and GSA to provide the equipment, supplies \nand material used to educate our children, maintain roads and streets, \nkeep utility rates reasonable, train the workers of tomorrow, protect \nfamilies from crime, and during natural disasters, treat the health of \nour nation's sick and needy.\n  Through the efforts of the state agencies for surplus property, \neligible recipients have acquired impressive pieces of equipment such \nas trailers, forklifts, fire trucks, aircraft, boats and generators.\n  The original acquisition value of property distributed through the \nU.S. state agencies for surplus property totaled over $537 million in \nfiscal year 1997. Over the last few weeks, I have heard from many \nrecipients of surplus federal property and ask unanimous consent that \ntheir letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                      Department of Public Safety,\n\n\n                                        State Patrol Division,\n\n                                   St. Paul, MN, January 13, 1998.\n     Senator Rod Grams,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: For the past several years the flight \n     of the Minnesota State Patrol has called upon the services of \n     the state surplus property program, a division of the \n     Department of Administration, for various pieces of equipment \n     needed to accomplish our mission. In more recent years my \n     contact person at surplus property has been Mr. Gene Glaeser \n     who now heads up that program. Any time I have needed \n     something,\n\n[[Page S581]]\n\n     whether it be a helicopter, airplane, or an office desk, I \n     have never had to wait an unusually long period of time to \n     have my request filled by Glaeser's office.\n       In August 1992, the flight section had need of an aircraft \n     tug to move our helicopter that is stationed in the Cloquet \n     area in an out of our hangar. I simply called Gene Glaeser, \n     told him what I needed and in a matter of about a week, I was \n     notified by Glaeser that he had the tug I had requested. That \n     tug was put into service almost immediately.\n       Again in September of 1996 our organization had a need to \n     upgrade one of our helicopters from a two place piston \n     powered helicopter to a turbine powered ship. Shortly after \n     notifying surplus property of our need, I was told that a \n     helicopter meeting our specifications had been located right \n     here at the St. Paul Airport. This helicopter had been part \n     of the fleet of OH58 helicopters operated by the Army Reserve \n     Unit here in St. Paul, and this unit was being disbanded. \n     Within the first year, that helicopter was refurbished and \n     placed in service as part of our fleet of aircraft.\n       Once again, in February 1997 our unit had need for a twin \n     engine airplane. One week after I made the request for this \n     type of aircraft, Gene Glaeser called and said he had located \n     an aircraft he thought would fit our needs. It was a \n     Beechcraft Queen Air and it had been used by NASA for several \n     years and was based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia. \n     Following many phone calls to Langley to discuss the \n     condition of this craft, it was decided to acquire this \n     aircraft.\n       In each of the above cases, there has been substantial cost \n     savings to the State of Minnesota. The OH58 helicopter was \n     placed in service at a total cost of $84,000.00. Had we \n     purchased this same type of helicopter on the open market, we \n     would have paid an estimated $450,000.00-$550,000.00. The \n     Beechcraft Queen Air acquired from NASA, including the \n     training of six pilots to fly it, cost the state \n     approximately $36,000.00 to place it in service. This \n     aircraft has been appraised at $150,000.00-$175,000.00 by an \n     aircraft broker. In each of these cases, had the State Patrol \n     been forced to buy from the open market, we would not have \n     been able to upgrade our fleet because of budget constraints.\n       Had the surplus program not been available to us, our \n     chances of acquiring this equipment would not have existed. \n     This is a perfect example of our government obtaining the \n     most from a piece of equipment. When one agency no longer has \n     a need for that equipment, it is passed down to another \n     government agency that does have a need. I would hope that \n     this program would continue for many years into the future, \n     as everyone benefits from it. As is common in today's \n     language, ``it's a win-win situation.''\n       Should you have further questions regarding anything I have \n     stated, please feel free to call me. Thank you.\n       Sincerely,\n                                             Capt. David J. Allen,\n     Chief Pilot.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           The McCandless Township\n\n\n                                           Sanitary Authority,\n\n                                 Pittsburgh, PA, January 19, 1998.\n     Senator Rod Grams,\n     Dirkson Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: The McCandless Township Sanitary \n     Authority (M.T.S.A.) is located approximately 15 miles north \n     of the City of Pittsburgh PA. M.T.S.A.'s main function is to \n     collect and treat wastewater for seven surrounding \n     communities, with a total customer base in excess of 35,000 \n     residents. This Authority operates and maintains four \n     treatment facilities, fifteen pumping stations, over 250 \n     miles of sewer lines and employs in excess of 45 employees. \n     Over the last five to six years this Authority has actively \n     participated in the Pa. Federal Surplus Program. Purchases \n     through this program have become a normal part of our budget \n     with a yearly allocation of $20,000.00.\n       This Authority falls under the guidelines and rules and \n     regulation of the EPA and the Pa. DEP. Over the last couple \n     of years unexpected regulations have been imposed on this \n     Authority which require us to undertake the replacement and \n     enhancement of many of the older sections of the sewer line \n     collection system. Through the Federal Surplus Program we \n     were able to obtain equipment and materials to aid in this \n     system upgrading. Some of the items that were secured were: a \n     transit, material handling bucket, two-10 ton dump trucks, a \n     loader, fork lift, a job site toolbox, a six inch portable \n     pump, many small hand tools, hooks-cables-lifting straps and \n     even personal employee items such as boots and gloves.\n       Purchases through this program have also benefited our \n     wastewater treatment facilities. We have secured both \n     materials and equipment for use by our maintenance personnel. \n     Some of the pictures that are enclosed show projects that \n     have been completed. Many of these projects were completed \n     with use of stainless steel and/or aluminum which were \n     secured from Federal Surplus for a fraction of their normal \n     cost. This Authority also was able to secure a 5000 gallon \n     tank trailer for transporting sludge from our satellite \n     treatment facilities to our main sludge de-watering facility. \n     This in itself was an excellent purchase; we were able to \n     purchase a $40,000 trailer for $2,500.00. The Authority was \n     also able to supply the treatment facility personnel with \n     numerous safety related items such as self contained \n     breathing apparatus, life vests, rubber * * * boots and even \n     a small life raft.\n       This Authority has also used the Federal Surplus Program to \n     supplement its fleet of vehicles. We have purchased five mid-\n     sized trucks, one station wagon and numerous trailers; one of \n     which we use for hauling heavy equipment. These vehicles all \n     needed some repairs but Authority personnel were able to fix \n     them up to make them nice additions to the fleet. Pictures \n     and a brief description of each of these vehicles is \n     enclosed. One vehicle of particular interest would be the \n     vehicle used for the Dye Test Program. The Dye Test Program \n     was implemented to meet requirements set by PA. DEP, which \n     requires the Authority to begin testing resident's roof and \n     driveway drains to locate illegal connections to the sanitary \n     sewer. This program required the Authority to hire employees \n     and purchase equipment, so this vehicle and the cost savings \n     associated with it helped to get this program off the ground.\n       This Authority's involvement with the Pa. Federal Surplus \n     Program has been very beneficial to the Authority as well as \n     to the Authority's rate payers. The McCandless Township \n     Sanitary Authority has not had a rate increase since 1991 and \n     I believe that our involvement in this program as well as \n     other cost saving measures have helped to keep these rate \n     increases down. Finally, I would like to mention that we have \n     had purchase parts or materials from private distributors \n     when repairing some of our Federal Surplus purchases I was \n     surprised to see the amount of ``new stock'' they had on \n     hand. It was my understanding that state agencies have first \n     choice on surplus. I think there would be many government \n     bodies that could put this surplus to good use rather than \n     see a private company making a profit at the tax payers \n     expense.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Dennis J. Blakley,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n                                     FEDERAL SURPLUS PURCHASES COST

Organization partially funded \n     by the State of Alabama and the Federal Government. Our \n     Training School is a five year program that prepares our \n     students for working in the following trades: plumbing, \n     pipefitting, welding and air conditioning.\n       We have obtained supplies and equipment from our Local \n     State and Federal Surplus Division, that has been very \n     beneficial to our program. These purchases have also saved \n     our Program thousands and thousands of dollars. Without these \n     savings, our Program would not have been able to obtain the \n     training equipment we currently possess.\n       We are aware that there is less property available today \n     because of the downsizing of the Military. However, the \n     combinations of the special interest legislation and major \n     ``giveaways'' such as the humanitarian assistance program, \n     have destroyed most of\n\n[[Page S582]]\n\n     the opportunity the States have to receive the type and \n     quality of property available in prior years. Therefore, our \n     Program as well as all other non-profit organizations, suffer \n     the loss.\n       Sir, please help us in keeping the Federal Donation Program \n     going. If we can be of further assistance, please contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Wayne Barfield,\n     Business Agent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Grandview Police Department,\n\n                                  Grandview, WA, January 20, 1998.\n     Senator Grams,\n     Dirkson Senate Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: My purpose for writing you this letter \n     is to appraise you of the great benefits that my Agency and \n     City have received from our years of involvement in the \n     Federal Surplus Program. Over the past six years, we have \n     been very active in purchasing surplus equipment from the \n     Government that has improved the quality of our City, and \n     allowed us to expand and improve the operations in City \n     government.\n       Over the past six years, the City has purchased a bulldozer \n     and dump truck which has allowed us to build a quality Police \n     firearms range to allow our officers to be proficient in the \n     use of their weapons, as well as purchasing pickup trucks, a \n     van and other related equipment to augment our Department, to \n     allow us to better serve our citizens. The majority of \n     furniture, desks, computers, typewriters and other supplies \n     that we use on a day to day basis in the Police department \n     are from the federal surplus program. Without this program, \n     our Department would still be using equipment that was \n     purchased over 20 years ago. Due to our financial situation \n     in our rural area, this program has allowed us to keep our \n     department current with the modern technologies and equipment \n     of the 1990's. I would hate to think where our Department, as \n     well as other departments within the City would be if we had \n     not been a active purchaser of federal surplus property. \n     Citywide, we have purchased thousands of dollars worth of \n     quality equipment on a yearly basis, saving our taxpayers \n     tens of thousands of dollars.\n       I am a very proud participant of the federal surplus \n     program and believe that it is one of the best cost effective \n     programs that our City has ever been involved in. I also hope \n     that this program will continue to remain in tact in the \n     future and allow us to grow with it. We have the pleasure of \n     having Mr. Doug Coleman who is our State Federal Surplus \n     Property Manager, who does a fantastic job of working with \n     the local Cities in Washington State on the dispersement of \n     surplus property. I would hope that this worthwhile program \n     continues and grows.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                 David R. Charvet,\n     Chief of Police.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Talent Irrigation District,\n                                     Talent, OR, January 19, 1998.\n     Jack Guzman,\n     Acting Manager, Federal Surplus Property, Salem, OR.\n       Dear Mr. Guzman: The Federal Surplus Property Program is an \n     intricate part of the Talent Irrigation District's (TID) \n     operating target. It has significantly contributed to keeping \n     operating costs down resulting in low water rates for our \n     taxpayers. Here are just a very few specific examples.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                          Acquisition    Equivalent open\n                                              cost         market cost\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMaintenance Pick-up trucks............        $2,000.00     $8-10,000.00\nSnow Cat for Mountain/high lake                5,000.00        95,000.00\n operation............................\n6\" Gate valves........................            30.00           300.00\nFork Lifts............................         3,000.00         9,000.00\nStructural Steel and Steel plate......

In an era of austere funding and \n     increased property taxes TID has been able to keep water \n     rates one-third less than other Southern Oregon Districts. \n     This is a direct result of utilizing the Federal Surplus \n     Property program.\n       The only inequity in the system from a donee standpoint, is \n     the ``Host State'' procedures. Not having any military \n     installations, Oregon Donees are a notch below the host state \n     at the donee level. This needs attention.\n       Further comment would be redundant, suffice it to say \n     overall the program is very beneficial to the taxpayer.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Hollie Cannon,\n\n     Manager, Talent Irrigation District.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Birch Tree Communities, Inc.,\n\n                                     Benton, AR, January 19, 1998.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rod Grams: We are a non profit Certified \n     Community Mental Health Center. We are a clinical and \n     rehabilitative program for the chronically mentally ill. The \n     people we work with are the lowest of the low income people \n     in America.\n       We utilize the products of the Federal Donation Program \n     immensely. We use many of the products they have for sale. A \n     few of those items are beds and mattresses. To be able to \n     purchase only these items saves our organization thousands of \n     dollars each year. The total items we purchase and utilize \n     would be too lengthy to list.\n       A bed and mattress are very simple items, but can you \n     imagine sleeping without a bed or mattress? The people we \n     work with are classified as homeless and many have not had \n     the comfort of a bed or mattress for some time.\n       This letter is to definitely continue the Federal Donation \n     Program in its present form.\n           Sincerely,\n     Paul Enderlin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Mountain Fire/Rescue\n\n                             Mountain Ranch, CA, January 20, 1998.\n       Dear Senator Grams: On behalf of Mountain Fire//Rescue and \n     as the Chief of this Volunteer Fire Company, I'm writing to \n     you in response to the urgent letter I received from the \n     National Asso. of State Agencies for Surplus Property.\n       Mountain Fire/Rescue came to be 18 years ago and has grown \n     to be the largest fire unit in Calaveras County, CA. We have \n     94 pieces of fire fighting, rescue, potable water tenders, \n     generators and the parts to keep this equipment running. All \n     but 3 of our rolling stock was obtained through Surplus \n     property program.\n       We use this equipment in various ways:\n       Our 5 ton recovery vehicle (wrecker) is used to recover any \n     government agencies property that has become disabled. This \n     is a very poor county and most of the fire departments here \n     don't have the money to hire a large tow truck to recover \n     their equipment. This same unit responded to a call where a \n     farmer was driving his tractor and went over a mountain side, \n     300 yards. At the site, we pulled out the 400' + cable and \n     added all of our chain then a 20' piece of cable on the end \n     of this mess, put a snatch block in a tree by the victim, \n     that was pinned under the tractor, and was able to pick the \n     tractor off of him without hurting him further. Before we got \n     there, attempts to lift the tractor was futile. Every time \n     the rescue team tried to move the tractor it would slid down \n     the mountain side a little. He was air lifted to Modesto and \n     is doing fine now. Reports we received after this incident \n     tell us we saved his life. This was a piece of excess \n     property. Cost $99,000.00, our cost, $1200.00.\n       In 1994, on a presidential order, this Volunteer Fire Co. \n     was sent to Goma, Zaire, Africa on a C5A from Travis AFB non \n     stop, to produce potable water to the refugees 15 miles \n     outside of Goma. A Report can be found in Vol. 141 \n     Washington, Saturday, August 5, 1995 No. 130, on page E-1690, \n     True American Heroes, Hon. John T. Doolittle of California, \n     Friday, August 4, 1995. This may be useful to you. The \n     equipment was excess property except for the sub-pump and the \n     fire truck. As a US Army trained medic, I took along my \n     medical stuff from MFR. At the pumping site at Lac Kavu, MFR \n     set up pumping operations, chlorinated the water, took care \n     of the military personal at this site provided the heated \n     shower, built off the back of the fire truck and generally \n     blended in to the working order of this base. Two days into \n     the pumping operation, Dr. Thomas Durant, Asst. Medical \n     Director, Boston School of Medicine became my preceptor on \n     site. He was going to rent a car to go out to the refugee \n     camps and start to give shots to these poor people. He was \n     going to pay $100.00 per day for the rental. I told him to \n     take MFRs 1\\1/4\\ ton 4X4 pickup to do this work at no charge. \n     One day, as the doctor's and RNs were going to the camp, they \n     were stopped by a squad of Zaire soldiers, told to get out of \n     the truck. They were taken into a banana grove, where they \n     thought they were going to be shot. In the grove was a young \n     Zaire soldier that had picked up an explosive device of some \n     kind and blown his hands up. The doctors put him in the truck \n     and all his buddies and took him to a field hospital to be \n     treated. From that time on, no more stopping for road blocks. \n     This one vehicle provided the transportation for those good \n     docs and no one will ever know how many lives they saved. \n     Most of all of the support equipment we took with us was \n     surplus property.\n       Photos of the African event can be obtained by contacting \n     Lt.

This might be \n     something you want in your information briefing.\n       Lastly, we were told we were True American Heroes, \n     Congressman Doolittle has been the only person that has taken \n     it upon himself to make General Jack Nix's order to give us \n     the Category 1 and 2 civilian medals that Gen.

Mr. President, I am particularly impressed at how \neffectively the state agencies, GSA and the Defense Re-utilization and \nMarketing Service have worked together as a team to respond quickly and \nefficiently\n\n[[Page S583]]\n\nduring times of national disasters and emergencies.\n  Together they have successfully identified and transported sandbags, \nblankets, cots, tools, trucks and other equipment and supplies to \ndisaster sites.\n  In 1997, the state agencies and their federal partners faced a number \nof emergencies--and they delivered.\n  And I know Minnesotans who suffered through the Midwest floods last \nyear appreciated the relief provided to them during these horrible \ntimes. I recently received a letter from Dave Allen, Chief Pilot of the \nMinnesota State Patrol, and a recipient of surplus property distributed \nby the Minnesota State Agency for Surplus Property for the last several \nyears.\n  Mr. Allen wrote:\n\n       In February 1997 our unit had the need for a twin engine \n     airplane. One week after I made the request for this type of \n     aircraft, Gene Glaeser called and said he had located an \n     aircraft he thought would meet our needs. It was a Beechcraft \n     Queen Air and it had been used by NASA for several years and \n     was based at Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.\n       The Beechcraft Queen Air acquired from NASA including the \n     training of six pilots cost the State approximately $35,000 \n     to place it in service. This aircraft had been appraised at \n     $150,000-$175,000 by an aircraft broker . . . Had the surplus \n     property program not been available to us our chances of \n     acquiring this equipment would not have existed.\n       This is a perfect example of our government obtaining the \n     most from a piece of equipment . . . I would hope that this \n     program would continue for many years in the future, as \n     everyone benefits from it.\n\n  The plane filled a very important need during last year's floods by \nshuttling state and emergency management staff to meetings, where they \nassessed the damage in our communities and provided guidance to \nresidents.\n  The state agencies for surplus property should be commended for \nfollowing the intent of Congress and fulfilling their responsibilities \nunder Public Law 94-519. However, I believe that the volume and value \nof distributed surplus federal property would increase if the intent of \nthe Congress when it passed the 1976 reforms was more closely followed.\n  If Congress continues to allow surplus federal property to go abroad, \nor not make its way through proper channels to eligible recipients, our \nstudents, workers, taxpayers, and families will lose. The legislation I \nam introducing will address these concerns through the following \nprovisions.\n  First, this legislation would ensure that when distributing surplus \nfederal property, domestic needs are met before we consider foreign \ninterests. It would, however, grant the President the authority to make \nsupplies available for humanitarian relief purposes before going to the \nstates, in the case of emergencies or natural disasters.\n  Second, my bill would amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nprohibit the transfer of Government-owned excess property to foreign \ncountries or international organizations for environmental protection \nactivities in foreign countries unless GSA determined that there is no \nfederal or state use for the property.\n  Fourth, my bill would repeal the authority of the Secretary of Energy \nto transfer excess DOE research and development facility equipment to \neducational institutions in the U.S. This current practice by DOE falls \noutside the Donation Program and denies equal access to all local \neducation agencies, schools and universities.\n  Third, it would ensure that 8(a) firms participating in the Small \nBusiness Administration's Capital Ownership Development Program \nmaintain their eligibility to receive surplus Federal property, but \nthrough the normal process involving GSA and the State agencies. \nStates, not bureaucracies, should determine how to meet the needs of \nour schools and universities.\n  Finally, this legislation would require GSA to report to Congress on \nthe effectiveness of all statutes relating to the disposal and donation \nof personal property and recommend any changes that would further \nimprove the Donation Program.\n  Mr. President, my bill is based on the principle that eligible \nrecipients should be able to maximize their tax dollars through \nexpendable Federal property that meets their needs.\n  It takes an important step toward stopping publicly-owned property \nfrom being shipped abroad and given to other organizations before it is \ndistributed through each State agency for surplus property.\n  My legislation will fulfill the public's right to know how and where \ntheir tax dollars are being spent.\n  In many ways, it will serve as the second phase of the reforms \noverwhelmingly passed by Congress in 1976, by preserving the active \nrole of States in the handling and distribution of surplus Federal \nproperty. This initiative will benefit thousands of recipients--the \nNation's taxpayers.\n  The best interests of America's taxpayers has always been at the top \nof my agenda. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the \nSenate to move this legislation through Congress and give the taxpayers \nthe highest possible return on their investment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S580-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S583-S584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NOMINATION OF MARGARET MORROW\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that tomorrow we \nare going to be voting on the confirmation of Mrs. Margaret Morrow, \nJudge Margaret Morrow, who has been nominated for the position of U.S. \nDistrict Judge for the Central District of California. While I will be \nopposing her nomination, it is not because of her academic \nqualifications, nor her credentials, but her philosophy that she has \nexpressed in the past from the bench.\n  Lately a lot of people have said that the state of our judiciary is \nsomewhat deplorable, and I think it is, although I do not think it is \nbecause of the lack of judges being confirmed. I do not think that is \nthe problem. I think it is the philosophy, the dangerous philosophy of \nelitism which pervades the judicial branch of the Federal Government. \nThis elitism is dangerous and undercuts our belief in courts throughout \nAmerica. Regrettably, Mrs. Morrow is representative of that elitism.\n  I am most concerned more than anything else with statements she has \nmade about direct democracy. It seems to be her position that we in \nAmerica are not able to rule for ourselves, not able to make \nintelligent decisions, but those decisions would have to be made in \nsome protected ivory tower. She condemns direct democracy. She says, \n``Ballot initiatives,'' and this is a quote, ``render ephemeral any \nreal hope of intelligent voting of the majority.''\n  What she is saying here is that the people are not capable of making \nthese decisions. And, of course, they do have problems out there in the \nninth circuit, and the position she is seeking to gain would put her in \na position to actually promote some of those things that have been \ntaking place there.\n  Recently, in Bates v. Jones, a three-judge panel--Reinhardt, Sneed, \nand Fletcher--affirmed a decision by Judge Wilkins to throw out \nCalifornia's ballot initiative, Proposition 140--that's the term limits \nfor State officials--declaring them unconstitutional.\n  There have been other efforts such as proposition 209. Last year \nJudge Henderson struck down the voter-approved referendum ending State \naffirmative action programs, and fortunately for the 20 million \nCalifornia voters Henderson's original ruling has been struck down, \nrestoring their faith in the voting process.\n  Proposition 187. Judge Richard Pfaelzer declared a State law denying \nbenefits to illegal aliens unconstitutional because it conflicted with \nthe 1996 welfare reform law. That was overturned.\n  Proposition 208. Judge Carlton has recently blocked enforcement of \nthe popular initiative that has imposed limits on campaign \ncontributions at the State level.\n  During her confirmation, Mrs. Morrow claimed never to have publicly \nopposed a ballot initiative in the past decade with one exception and \nthat was proposition 209. In fact, in 1988, Morrow wrote an article \nurging lawyers to support or oppose various ballot initiatives. She \ndenounces three others later that year and spoke publicly against two \nothers. So I think it is fairly evident that Margaret Morrow, in \naddition to these problems, has a problem with the truth. And I \ncertainly think if there is anything we do not need in our judiciary it \nis someone of that philosophy.\n  I like the way Senator Ashcroft said it the other day. He said, \n``Morrow's writings make it clear that she believes people cannot be \ntrusted with\n\n[[Page S584]]\n\nthe fundamental powers of self-government.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S583-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, Senators Warner and Levin are absent \nfrom the Senate this week so that they can accompany Secretary of \nDefense Cohen on his trip to the Persian Gulf. They are representing \nthe Armed Services Committee on this important trip, and will report \ntheir findings to the Committee and to the Senate leadership.\n  During his absence, Senator Warner has requested that I insert the \nfollowing statement in the Record on his behalf. I am happy to do this \nfor my colleague. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Warner's \nstatement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Statement of Senator Warner--NATO Expansion Amendment\n\n  This past weekend I was privileged to attend the annual Wehrkunde \nConference in Munich, Germany. A main topic of discussion at this NATO \nsecurity conference was the issue of NATO expansion. I have \nconsistently expressed my sincere concerns with this policy.\n  NATO has been the most valuable and successful military alliance in \nthe history of this Nation. It has worked far beyond the expectations \nof its founders--keeping peace in Europe for 50 years, and securing \nvictory in the cold war. President Truman cited NATO and the Marshall \nPlan as the greatest achievements of his presidency. I am concerned \nthat we not do anything to undermine the effectiveness of this great \nalliance.\n  Recently, the Senate Armed Services Committee received testimony from \nformer Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger and former Secretary of \nState Henry Kissinger on the issue of NATO expansion. Although both \nsaid that the Senate should provide its advice and consent for the \nfirst round of expansion, they expressed a number of concerns. \nSecretary Schlesinger called this first round of NATO expansion ``a bad \nidea whose time has come.'' And Secretary Kissinger warned that we are \nin danger of transforming NATO into a ``U.N.-type instrument'' if \nexpansion is not handled properly.\n  It seems clear that this first round of expansion will go forward as \nplanned. My concern is that we build in a mechanism to guard against \nprecipitous, future expansion rounds.\n  During the Wehrkunde Conference, I had the opportunity to discuss an \nidea I have been contemplating to establish a moratorium--of 3 to 5 \nyears--on new members being invited to join the NATO alliance, \nfollowing the likely addition of Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic \nin 1999. In my view, such a moratorium is crucial to allow NATO to \nbegin the process of integrating the three new nations, and more fully \nassess the impact of this integration before proceeding with further \nexpansion rounds.\n  The purpose of this statement today is to promptly inform my \ncolleagues of my discussions in Germany and my intent, upon returning \nfrom the trip with Secretary Cohen, to submit to the Senate for \nconsideration an amendment which will establish a 3-year moratorium on \nfuture NATO expansions. This amendment will be drafted as a condition \nto the resolution of ratification, and will effectively prevent the \nUnited States from agreeing to any further expansion of the NATO \nalliance for a period of three years.\n  I will make a full set of remarks on this amendment and seek co-\nsponsors following my return. I look forward to engaging in an extended \ndebate on this issue--and other aspects of NATO expansion--in the weeks \nto come.\n  I thank Senator Thurmond for assisting me in making this statement a \npart of the Record during my absence on official business as part of \nSecretary Cohen's delegation to the Persian Gulf and Russia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S584-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S584-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S584-S585]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n 1998 ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS--MESSAGE FROM \n                          THE PRESIDENT--PM 96\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Joint Economic Committee.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  For the last 5 years this Administration has worked to strengthen our \nNation for the 21st century, expanding opportunity for all Americans, \ndemanding responsibility from all Americans, and bringing us together \nas a community of all Americans. Building a strong economy is the \ncornerstone of our efforts to meet these challenges.\n  When I first took office in 1993, the Federal budget deficit was out \nof control, unemployment was unacceptably high, and wages were \nstagnant. To reverse this course, we took a new approach, putting in \nplace a bold economic strategy designed to bring down the deficit and \ngive America's workers the tools and training they need to help them \nthrive in our changing economy.\n  Our strategy has succeeded: the economy has created more than 14 \nmillion new jobs, unemployment is at its lowest level in 24 years, and \ncore inflation is at its lowest level in 30 years. Economic growth in \n1997 was the strongest in almost a decade, and the benefits of that \ngrowth are being shared by all Americans: poverty is dropping and \nmedian family income has gone up nearly $2,200 since 1993. We also saw \nthe biggest drop in welfare rolls in history. Many challenges remain, \nbut Americans are enjoying the fruits of an economy that is steady and \nstrong.\n\n\n                 the administration's economic strategy\n\n  From the beginning, this Administration's economic strategy has had \nthree crucial elements: reducing the deficit, investing in people, and \nopening markets abroad.\n  Deficit reduction. In 1993 this Administration's deficit reduction \nplan set the Nation on a course of fiscal responsibility, while making \ncritical investments in the skills and well-being of our people. When I \ntook office, the deficit was $290 billion and projected to go much \nhigher. This year the deficit will fall to just $10 billion and \npossibly lower still. That is a reduction of more than 95 percent, \nleaving the deficit today smaller in relation to the size of the \neconomy than it has been since 1969.\n\n[[Page S585]]\n\nAnd this year I have proposed a budget that will eliminate the deficit \nentirely, achieving the first balanced budget in 30 years.\n  Beyond that, it is projected that the budget will show a sizable \nsurplus in the years to come. I propose that we reserve 100 percent of \nthe surplus until we have taken the necessary measures to strengthen \nthe Social Security system for the 21st century. I am committed to \naddressing Social Security first, to ensure that all Americans are \nconfident that it will be there when they need it.\n\n  Investing in our people. In the new economy, the most precious \nresource this Nation has is the skills and ingenuity of working \nAmericans. Investing in the education and health of our people will \nhelp all Americans reap the rewards of a growing, changing economy. \nThose who are better educated, with the flexibility and the skills they \nneed to move from one job to another and seize new opportunities, will \nsucceed in the new economy; those who do not will fall behind.\n  That is why the historic balanced budget agreement I signed into law \nin 1997 included the largest increase in aid to education in 30 years, \nand the biggest increase to help people go to college since the G.I. \nBill was passed 50 years ago. The agreement provided funds to ensure \nthat we stay on track to help 1 million disadvantaged children prepare \nfor success in school. It provided funding for the America Reads \nChallenge, with the goal of mobilizing a million volunteers to promote \nliteracy, and it made new investments in our schools themselves, to \nhelp connect every classroom and library in this country to the \nInternet by the year 2000.\n  The balanced budget agreement created the HOPE scholarship program, \nto make completion of the 13th and 14th years of formal education as \nwidespread as a high school diploma is today. It offered other tuition \ntax credits for college and skills training. It created a new \nIndividual Retirement Account that allows tax-free withdrawals to pay \nfor education. It provided the biggest increase in Pell grants in two \ndecades. Finally, it provided more funds so that aid to dislocated \nworkers is more than double what it was in 1993, to help these workers \nget the skills they need to remain productive in a changing economy.\n  But we must do more to guarantee all Americans the quality education \nthey need to succeed. That is why I have proposed a new initiative to \nimprove the quality of education in our public schools--through high \nnational standards and national tests, more charter schools to \nstimulate competition, greater accountability, higher quality teaching, \nsmaller class sizes, and more classrooms.\n  To strengthen our Nation we must also strengthen our families. The \nFamily and Medical Leave Act, which I signed into law in 1993, ensures \nthat millions of people no longer have to choose between being good \nparents and being good workers. The Health Care Portability and \nAccountability Act, enacted in 1996, ensures that workers can keep \ntheir health insurance if they change jobs or suffer a family \nemergency. We have also increased the minimum wage, expanded the earned \nincome tax credit, and provided for a new $500-per-child tax credit for \nworking families. To continue making progress toward strengthening \nfamilies, the balanced budget agreement allocated $24 billion to \nprovide health insurance to up to 5 million uninsured children--the \nlargest Federal investment in children's health care since Medicaid was \ncreated in 1965.\n  Opening markets and expanding exports. To create more good jobs and \nincrease wages, we must open markets abroad and expand U.S. exports. \nTrade has been key to the strength of this economic expansion--about a \nthird of our economic growth in recent years has come from selling \nAmerican goods and services overseas. The Information Technology \nAgreement signed in 1997 lowers tariff and other barriers to 90 percent \nof world trade in information technology services.\n  To continue opening new markets, creating new jobs, and increasing \nour prosperity, it is critically important to renew fast-track \nnegotiating authority. This authority, which every President of either \nparty has had for the last 20 years, enables the President to negotiate \ntrade agreements and submit them to the Congress for an up-or-down \nvote, without modification. Renewing this traditional trade authority \nis essential to American's ability to shape the global economy of the \n21st century.\n\n\n          seizing the benefits of a growing, changing economy\n\n  As we approach the 21st century the American economy is sound and \nstrong, but challenges remain. We know that information and technology \nand global commerce are rapidly transforming the economy, offering new \nopportunities but also posing new challenges. Our goal must be to \nensure that all Americans are equipped with the skills to succeed in \nthis growing, changing economy.\n  Our economic strategy--balancing the budget, investing in our people, \nopening markets--has set this Nation on the right course to meet this \ngoal. This strategy will support and contribute to America's strength \nin the new economic era, removing barriers to our economy's potential \nand providing our people with the skills, the flexibility, and the \nsecurity to succeed. We must continue to maintain the fiscal discipline \nthat is balancing the budget, to invest in our people and their skills, \nand to lead the world to greater prosperity in the 21st century.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on certain textile \nmachinery; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n[[Page S586]]\n\n             TEXTILE MACHINERY DUTY SUSPENSION LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould suspend the current duty on ink-jet textile printing machinery \nthrough December 31, 1999. I would like to make some brief comments \nabout this bill.\n  It is my understanding that this machinery is not made in the United \nStates, so there are no domestic producers that are likely to be harmed \nby this bill. Furthermore, the revenues currently generated by the duty \non these machines are under $500,000 per annum, making it a de minimis \namount under budget rules. This being the case, Mr. President, I think \nmy colleagues will agree that this bill is not apt to have any \ndetrimental effects on domestic industry or federal revenue.\n  In fact, I believe such a measure could represent a potential \neconomic benefit for the textile industry. These ink-jet printing \nmachines are used to print patterns and designs on fabrics, and they \nare indispensable for a large part of our domestic textile industry. \nThey are also extremely costly. It stands to reason that every little \nbit we can do for our domestic textile producers to reduce their costs \nof production help them to be competitive in this increasingly global \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, this is a good bill with no substantial costs \ninvolved, and I want to encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TEXTILE MACHINERY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter II of chapter 99 of the \n     Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States is amended by \n     inserting in numerical sequence the following new heading:\n         \n\n         ``    9902.84.43     Ink-jet textile    Free        No change        No change       On or before\n                               printing

             8443.51.10).....\n \n\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply to goods entered, or withdraw from warehouse for \n     consumption, on or after the date that is 15 days after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n       (c) Retroactive Application.--Notwithstanding section 514 \n     of the Tariff Act of 1930 or any other provision of law, upon \n     proper request filed with the Customs Service not later than \n     180 days after the date of enactment of this Act, any entry, \n     or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, of goods \n     described in subheading 9902.81.10 of the Harmonized Tariff \n     Schedule of the United States (as added by subsection (a)) \n     that--\n       (1) was made after December 31, 1997, and before the date \n     that is 15 days after the date of enactment of this Act; and\n       (2) with respect to which there would have been no duty if \n     the amendment made by subsection (a) applied to such entry or \n     withdrawal,\n     shall be liquidated or reliquidated as if such amendment \n     applied to such entry or withdrawal.\n\n

Grassley) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Finance:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 73\n\n       Whereas on a level playing field, United States producers \n     are the most competitive suppliers of agricultural products \n     in the world;\n       Whereas increased United States agricultural exports are \n     critical to the future of the farm, rural, and overall \n     economy of the United States;\n       Whereas the opportunities for increased agricultural \n     exports are undermined by the unfair subsidies provided by \n     trading partners of the United States, and by various tariff \n     and nontariff trade barriers imposed on highly-competitive \n     United States agricultural products;\n       Whereas United States agricultural exports reached a \n     record-level $60,000,000,000 in 1996 compared to a total \n     United States merchandise trade deficit of $170,000,000,000;\n       Whereas the United States is currently engaged in a number \n     of outstanding trade disputes with the European Union \n     regarding agriculture matters and the disputes involve the \n     most intractable issues between the United States and the \n     European Union;\n       Whereas the outstanding trade disputes include the failure \n     to finalize a veterinary equivalency program, which \n     jeopardizes an estimated $3,000,000,000 in trade in livestock \n     products between the United States and the European Union;\n       Whereas the World Trade Organization has ruled that the \n     European Union must allow the importation of beef with growth \n     hormones produced in the United States;\n       Whereas the European Union has yet to fulfill its \n     commitment under the Agreement on Application of Sanitary and \n     Phytosanitary Measures reached as part of the General \n     Agreement on Tariffs and Trade;\n       Whereas the European Union has promulgated regulations \n     regarding the use of ``specified risk materials'' for \n     livestock products which have a disputed scientific basis and \n     which serve to impede the importation of United States \n     livestock products despite the fact that no cases of bovine \n     spongisorm encephalopathy (mad cow disease) have been \n     documented in the United States;\n       Whereas the European Union has hindered trade in products \n     grown with the benefit of biogenetics based on claims that \n     also have a disputed scientific basis;\n       Whereas these barriers to biogenetic trade could have a \n     profound negative impact on agricultural trade in the long \n     run; and\n       Whereas there are also continuing disputes regarding \n     European Union subsidies for dairy, wheat gluten, and canned \n     fruits: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the European Union unfairly restricts the importation \n     of United States agricultural products;\n       (2) the restrictions imposed on United States agricultural \n     exports to the European Union are the most vexing problems \n     facing United States exporters in Europe;\n       (3) the elimination of restrictions imposed on United \n     States agricultural exports should be a top priority of any \n     current or future trade negotiations between the United \n     States and the European Union; and\n       (4) the United States Trade Representative should not \n     engage in any trade negotiations with the European Union to \n     achieve sectoral liberalization unless an initiative to \n     achieve the elimination of unfair restrictions on United \n     States agricultural products is advanced on the same time \n     frame as the sectoral negotiations.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, many of the lessons that we have \nlearned regarding agricultural trade strategy, to change the subject to \none that we have been not necessary been talking recently, have taken a \nlot of time for us to learn. I used to work in this field, the trade \nfield. I worked for the Secretary of Agriculture, and I have been \naround some of these negotiations.\n  It took the United States forty years of multilateral negotiations, \nbut in the Uruguay Round, we finally got it right: in order to achieve \nmeaningful agricultural market liberalization, we must link progress in \nagricultural liberalization to progress in other sectors critical to \nour trading partners.\n  Throughout the world, agriculture is one of the most highly protected \nindustries. It is also represents one of the strongest comparative \nadvantages that the United States enjoys. Additionally, the U.S. \nagriculture industry is a critical building block of this economy, \nemploying 22.7 million people. That is about 17 percent of the total \ndomestic labor force. Agriculture also contributed $997.7 billion \ndollars to our economy in 1996. In other words, 13.1 percent of our \ncountry's GDP is agriculture-based. Furthermore, a large portion of \nwhat we produce in the U.S.--roughly 40 percent--is consumed overseas.\n  Because agriculture is so critical to the U.S. economy and so reliant \non exports, I find it exceedingly troubling, along with Senator \nGrassley, to hear the recent news reports that the office of the United \nStates Trade Representative plans to pursue a trans-Atlantic trade pact \nthat would not address agricultural issues. The barriers to U.S. \nagricultural exports represent some of the most significant market \naccess problems that the United States currently faces in Europe. \nFurthermore, the U.S. is currently engaged in a number of outstanding \ntrade disputes with the EU regarding agricultural matters, and these \nare among the most intractable issues between our two continents. It is \nincomprehensible to me that the U.S. would consider entering \nnegotiations that would overlook these crucial issues.\n  Today I am joining with Senator Grassley in submitting a Senate \nConcurrent Resolution, which expresses\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\nthe sense of the Congress that the EU is unfairly restricting the \nimportation of United States agriculture products and that the \nelimination of such restrictions should be a top priority in trade \nnegotiations with the European Union.\n  Mr. President, quite simply, it would be foolhardy for the United \nStates to proceed with negotiations that avoid some of the issues that \nit has been seeking most desperately to advance. Without the leverage \nthat is gained by simultaneously negotiating access in areas where the \nU.S. seeks greater access with the areas in which the EU would like \ngreater access, the U.S. is positioning itself to hand over the keys to \nthe bank. While leaving out the touchy issues in agriculture may allow \nthe U.S. to quickly conclude an agreement, it is a strategy that would \nundermine the long-run economic interests of this country.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me in sending a message to this \nAdministration that the agriculture industry is not willing to be sold \nout for the sake of an chance to culminate a quick trade deal. We will \nnot support any new trade negotiations unless agriculture issues are \nadvanced on the same time frame as issues involving other sectors of \nthe economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S587-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Mr. President, I rise today to add my support to \npromoting electronic commerce and keeping it free from new Federal, \nState or local taxes. I am pleased to cosponsor the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act, S. 442, as it was reported out of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee.\n  In ways that are becoming increasingly apparent, the Internet is \nchanging the way we do business. More than 30 million people around the \nworld surf the Net. And more and more of these users turn to the World \nWide Web and Internet to place orders with suppliers, sell products and \nservices to customers, communicate with clients and market products.\n  This Internet market is growing at a tremendous pace. Over the past \ntwo years, sales generated through the Web grew over 5,000%. And \naccording to one Internet research firm, Net merchants are expected to \nsell $6.6 billion worth of goods by the year 2000.\n  The growth of electronic commerce is everywhere, including my home \nstate of Vermont. On my home page on the Web, I have put together a \nsection called ``Cyber Selling In Vermont,'' which is a step-by-step \nresource guide for exploring on line commerce and other business uses \nof the Internet. It includes links to businesses in Vermont that are \nalready cyber selling. As of today, this site includes links to Web \nsites of more than 100 Vermont businesses that are doing business on \nthe Internet, ranging from the Quill Bookstore in Manchester Center to \nAl's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse in Newport.\n  As electronic commerce continues to grow, I am hopeful that we in \nCongress will be leaders in developing tax policy to nurture this \nexciting new market. That is why I have closely followed the Internet \nTax Freedom Act since Senator Wyden introduced it last summer. I want \nto commend the senior Senator from Oregon for his leadership on cyber \ntax policy.\n  During my time in the Senate, I always tried to protect the rights of \nVermont state and local legislators to craft their laws free from \ninterference from Washington. Thus, the broad, open-ended moratorium on \nstate and local taxes relating to the Internet in the original bill \ngave me pause. I certainly agreed with the goal of no new state and \nlocal taxation of online commerce, but the means were questionable.\n  I believe those questions have been fully answered by the changes \nmade to this legislation during its consideration in the Senate \nCommerce Committee. I want to commend Senators McCain, Wyden, Burns and \nKerry for crafting a substitute bill that protects the free flow of \nonline commerce while accommodating the rights of state and local \ngovernments. In particular, I am pleased that the revised legislation \nadds an end date of January 1, 2004 to the moratorium and clarifies the \nlist of state and local taxes that are grand fathered under it. The \naddition of state tax organizations to the Presidential task force to \ndevelop long-term Internet tax policy also makes good sense.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nto foster the growth of online commerce and will work hard for its \nswift passage into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S589-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HONORING THE DEEDS OF MR. FRANK ``SKIP'' PETTIS III\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask you today to join me in \nhonoring a native hero of Rhode Island, who, by his courage and \nunselfish interest in the well-being of someone he did not know, saved \na man from nearly certain death.\n  When Frank ``Skip'' Pettis III set off to work on January 27, he had \nno idea that he would return home a hero. Pettis, who owns Pettis \nMarina near Pawtuxet Cove in Warwick, RI, was working when he overheard \nradio conversations between the Coast Guard and tugboat operators about \na kayaker who was declared missing in Narragansett Bay.\n  Pettis jumped into one of the marina's 24-foot salvage boats and \nraced to the scene. There, he found Steven McGarry of Warwick, without \na kayak or lifejacket, floating in the waves and clinging to a pair of \nempty bleach bottles, being used as traps. Mr. Pettis grabbed the half \nconscious and hypothermia-sticken McGarry but, unaided, was unable to \nlift him into the boat.\n  Fighting the cold and wet of the waves and the weight of McGarry's \nbody, Pettis waited for what must have seemed an eternity until \nfirefighters arrived to help fish him out of the water. As Pettis put \nit later, ``All I could do was envision him just sliding out of my \nhands . . . I didn't want that vision stuck in my head for the rest of \nmy life.'' McGarry, whose temperature had dropped to 82 degrees, was \nrushed to Rhode Island Hospital, where he was listed in critical \ncondition. By the next day, thanks to Pettis' heroism, McGarry had \nsufficiently recovered to give thanks to his rescuer.\n  On January 28, just a day after Pettis hoisted McGarry's nearly \nfrozen body from the icy water, Mayor Lincoln Chafee declared ``Skip \nPettis Day'' in Warwick to honor our local hero.\n  Mr. President, Skip Pettis is a model for people across America. \nHearing of a stranger in need, he joined in a desperate search for a \nman who, for all purposes, was lost at sea. Finding him, Pettis \npersevered alone in preventing McGarry's death until help arrived. Mr. \nPettis' experience exemplifies a form of altruism that can seem rare \ntoday, and, as such, I believe his heroic actions should be \nhonored.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S589-2", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S589-S590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO ISIDORE SCHWARTZ\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Isidore \nSchwartz, a Polish immigrant to the United States and World War II \nveteran who is reported to have been the first man to repair mechanical \nwatches in combat during his four years of dedicated service to the \nUnited States Army.\n  Mr. Schwartz learned the trade of watch repair through a Work \nProgress Administration program during the Depression, a skill which he \nlater used to assist the United States military. Upon induction into \nthe army, Isidore Schwartz, wishing to use all of his talents to help \nthe war effort, brought the necessary instruments for repairing \nmechanical watches. Originally, he merely intended to perform favors \nfor the men with whom he served. His ability to repair military \nmechanical watches in combat developed into a skill recognized and \nsought after by the Army.\n  Mr. Schwartz's talent was discovered during an inspection tour of an \ninfantry company. The Commanding Officer of the Company asked Mr. \nSchwartz's Commanding Officer if he had a watchmaker. The Commanding \nOfficer called Mr. Schwartz over and presented him with several \nmalfunctioning military watches. Working out of a modified bus, Isidore \nSchwartz successfully repaired the watches. Word spread to the War \nDepartment that Private Schwartz had the ability to perform the \nimportant function of military watch repair in combat. Had it not been \nfor Mr. Schwartz's initiative during his service, these military \nwatches would have been shipped for repair under hazardous war time \nconditions.\n  Isidore Schwartz's contribution to the war effort was not limited to \nthe repair of mechanical watches in combat as he used his ingenuity to \nperform similar important tasks. One accomplishment was the repair of a \nlieutenant's eyeglasses which were severely bent out of shape. In the \nprocess of straightening the frame, hinges broke on both sides making \nthe glasses unwearable. Despite lacking the necessary parts to perform \nthe repair, Mr. Schwartz, using a small brass rod and a jeweler's file \ncreated the necessary hinges thus successfully completing the repair. \nIt is this creativity and dedication to helping fellow soldiers and the \nUnited States Army which makes the actions of Private Schwartz \ndeserving of recognition and commendation.\n  Through our recognition of Mr. Schwartz's achievements, we are \nreminded of the tremendous contribution immigrants have made in the \nshaping of our nation. This diverse group of extraordinary, \nenterprising, and self-sufficient individuals have continuously served \nto strengthen the United States. The great desire of America's \nimmigrants to contribute combined with a passion to improve their new \nhome has allowed the United States to assume the position of world \nleader. We are forever grateful for their strength and courage.\n  The quiet, yet significant actions of Isidore Schwartz during his \nfour years\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\nof military service in Northern Ireland and North Africa exemplify his \ncommitment and dedication to the United States of America. It is with \ngreat pleasure that I join his many friends in the Bronx who will be \nhonoring Mr. Schwartz this summer for being the first man to repair \nmechanical watches in combat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S589-3", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S590-S592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE COMING BUDGET SURPLUS\n\n Mr. KYL. Mr. President, with the federal government apparently \non the verge of running its first unified budget surplus in nearly 30 \nyears, many people are beginning to ask what comes next? What should \nhappen to the budget surplus when it materializes? Should we spend it? \nShould we begin to pay down the national debt? Or should we provide \nhard-working Americans with meaningful, long overdue tax relief?\n  Before we try to answer those questions, it would be worthwhile to \nrecall how we got here. Remember, it was not that long ago--in fact, it \nwas as recently as February of 1995--that President Clinton submitted a \nbudget that would have locked in annual deficits in the range of $200 \nbillion for the foreseeable future. A unanimous Senate rejected the \nClinton budget on May 19, 1995. And from that point on, the debate took \na fundamental turn from whether to balance the budget, to how to \nbalance it.\n  During the last three years, we have begun to slow federal spending \ngrowth. We eliminated 307 mostly small federal programs. But perhaps \nthe most decisive factor has been what we did not do. We did not impose \nanother large tax increase on already overtaxed families and \nbusinesses. And that gave people enough room to do things to invigorate \nthe economy.\n  In fact, the economy has outperformed just about everyone's \nexpectations, producing tens of billions of dollars in unanticipated \nrevenues to the Treasury to close the budget gap. When the budget \nagreement passed last year, for example, unified budget deficits were \nprojected to go from $67 billion in fiscal year 1997 to $90 billion in \nfiscal year 1998. But as it turns out, the fiscal year 1997 deficit \ncame in at only $22 billion, and it is projected to amount to just $5 \nbillion in the current year. The unexpected turnaround is due almost \nentirely to the economy's performance, and it comes in spite of the \nsubstantially increased spending allowed by the 1997 budget agreement.\n  Whatever we ultimately decide to do with a unified budget surplus--\nand I would caution that projections of a surplus are just that, \nprojections--we ought to be sure that it sustains the economic growth \nthat has gotten us to where we are today.\n  Mr. President, the suggestions that have been made about how to \nhandle a budget surplus generally fall into four categories: Apply it \nto new or existing federal spending programs; use it to strengthen and \nimprove Social Security for future generations; apply it toward the \nnational debt; or return it to the American people in the form of tax \nrelief.\n\n\n               OPTION ONE: INITIATE NEW SPENDING PROGRAMS\n\n  The first option is to spend any surplus, and there is no shortage of \nsuggestions about how to do that. With deficits seemingly behind us, \nthe thought of lavishing readily available funds on new government \nprograms is tempting to many. President Clinton is proposing the \ncreation of dozens of new programs, costing $125 billion over the next \nfive years. That is in direct contradiction to his pledge to save \nSocial Security first.\n  There are good reasons to be cautious about creating any new spending \nprograms. For one thing, a surplus has yet to be posted. We should not \ncommit to spend what we do not have.\n  Moreover, we are all aware of the instability now being experienced \nby Asian economies, and some of that could spill over into our own \neconomy in the coming months. To some degree, United States markets \nhave already felt the effects of the Asian problems.\n  Just as the fast-growing economy has produced billions of dollars in \nadditional revenue for the Treasury during the last year, any slowdown \nin the economy could take billions of dollars out of the equation. If \nwe cannot ensure that any new programs have a dependable revenue stream \nto support them, we will be back into deficit very quickly.\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. President, millions of Americans, myself included, listened \nintently to what President Clinton had to say about Social Security in \nhis State of the Union address. What we heard--or what we thought we \nheard--was a declaration by the President to reserve any budget surplus \nthat might emerge in the next few years to shore up Social Security for \nfuture generations.\n  It was a statement that drew widespread praise from the public. But \nnow it turns out that what we heard is not, according to White House \nspokesmen, what the President really meant. The Washington Post put it \nthis way in a February 4 report: ``the ringing simplicity of Clinton's \ncall to `save Social Security first' gave way to a fog of bewildering \nbudget-speak from the administration's top economic advisers.''\n  It turns out that the President is not proposing to reserve the \nsurplus for Social Security at all. First, it is worth noting that his \nbudget would spend the surplus that is generated this coming year by \nthe Social Security system itself. In other words, President Clinton \ntakes an estimated $93 billion out of the Social Security trust fund, \nissues the retirement program a set of IOUs, and uses the money, not \nfor retirees today or in the future, but to pay for other programs run \nby the federal government.\n  Second, as I mentioned a few moments ago, he would diminish the size \nof the other surplus we are talking about--the unified budget surplus--\nby proposing to spend it on a whole host of new government programs \ncosting $125 billion over the next five years.\n  Is that really putting Social Security first? It seems to me that \nthat is a plan for putting it last--or at least way, way down the list \nof things to do with a budget surplus.\n  If we really want to save Social Security, we ought to get back to \nwhat most people thought Social Security was supposed to be: A safe and \nsecure account where their contributions could be deposited and where \nthey could grow to produce a nest egg for their retirement years. A \nunified budget surplus will make it easier to get to a system where \nmoney is put into individual Social Security retirement accounts for \neach citizen so that the money will actually be set aside for him or \nher. This would put Social Security reserves completely off limits to \nthe federal government so they could not be squandered on other \nprograms.\n  This may be the best thing to do with a unified budget surplus.\n\n\n           OPTION THREE: BEGIN TO PAY DOWN THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  Mr. President, there are those who say that we should not spend any \nsurplus revenues that may arise, nor reserve them for Social Security, \nbut begin to pay down the debt instead.\n  The federal government has not run a unified budget surplus since \n1969, so the fact that it may do so next year is indeed significant. \nBut I would caution that we are not yet at the point that we can \nactually begin to pay down the debt--at least in the sense that most \npeople think of. The fact of the matter is that the national debt will \ncontinue to rise, even though we are about to enter an era of \nsurpluses. Why?\n  We are only on the verge of running a surplus in the unified budget--\nwhat we get when we total up all government revenues and expenses, \nincluding Social Security revenues and expenditures. If borrowing from \nSocial Security and other trust funds were removed from the \ncalculation, the Clinton budget would show not a surplus of $9.5 \nbillion for fiscal year 1999, but a deficit of $95.7 billion.\n  With borrowing comes the obligation to repay. That is, the IOUs that \nare issued to the Social Security trust fund must be repaid as the \nneeds of the retirement system dictate. This is one reason that the \nPresident's budget forecasts the debt rising from $5.5 trillion this \nyear to $6.3 trillion by 2003.\n  We have a long way to go before we balance the budget without relying \non Social Security, and so the first order of business must be federal \nspending restraint. That is why we should reject President Clinton's \ncall to spend billions of dollars to start dozens of new programs. When \nwe get to the point where we can balance the budget without relying on \nSocial Security, the debt will stop growing, and then we can think \nabout starting to shrink it.\n  But here is the more fundamental point: it seems to me that if our \nonly\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\nfocus is on paying down the debt, we will fail in our ultimate duty to \nthe American people. At best we will merely perfect a mechanism for \ncollecting the taxes and paying the debts of a government that still \nregulates too much, spends too much, and taxes too much. Milton \nFriedman has said that he would rather have a smaller budget that is \nout of balance, than a larger budget that is in balance. I think he is \nright.\n  It is more important, in my view, to aim first to limit government \nspending, reduce taxes, and foster a less intrusive federal government. \nThe fact that we achieve balance only by relying on Social Security and \nother trust funds is indicative of a government that is still operating \nfar beyond its means.\n  A final point. Jack Kemp has suggested that keeping taxes higher than \nthey need to be simply to run budget surpluses to slow the amount of \ndebt we are accumulating puts the ``cart of austerity ahead of the \nhorse of economic growth.'' I think his point is a valid one. The \nabsolute size of the debt is not nearly as burdensome as its size \nrelative to the overall economy. In other words, as long as the budget \nis in balance or near balance, the country's true debt burden is going \nto shrink by virtue of a growing economy.\n  The focus ought to be on maintaining a healthy and growing economy \nthat produces good new jobs, more opportunities for everyone to get \nahead, and the resulting capability to meet federal budget requirements \nand actually pay down the debt over time.\n\n\n              OPTION FOUR: PROVIDE BROAD-BASED TAX RELIEF\n\n  That gets to the fourth option: Tax relief. We know from recent \nexperience that a strong economy can turn the unified budget from \ndeficit into surplus, so long as we also exercise some modest restraint \nover federal spending. So a thriving economy is one of the keys to \nsolving our Nation's long-term budget problems. It is a thriving \neconomy that will make it much easier to safeguard Social Security and \nMedicare for the generations to come.\n  But with the favorable short-term budget outlook so dependent upon \neconomic growth, and no significant pro-growth policy changes to \nprevent the already lengthy expansion from petering out, many of us \nbelieve that it will be difficult, if not impossible, to ever realize \nthe extra revenues that we are depending on for the budget to stay in \nbalance once it gets there.\n  Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan gave this advice to the \nBudget Committee in early February: He told us to view the surplus very \ncautiously, avoid new spending, adhere to spending caps, and focus on \ngrowth-oriented tax cuts, like lowering marginal income-tax rates and \nreducing capital-gains taxes.\n  So, Mr. President, regardless of what happens to a unified budget \nsurplus, it would be prudent to invest in economic growth, and the best \nway to do that would be to reduce income-tax rates for all Americans. \nThis would help the economy by lowering the tax on each additional \ndollar earned--something that will stimulate work, saving, and \ninvestment. This, in turn, will lead to more jobs, better pay, more \nopportunities for all Americans, and ultimately more revenue for the \nTreasury.\n  If the political climate is such that across-the-board income-tax \nrate reductions cannot be accomplished this year, then providing \nmarriage-penalty and death-tax relief may be the best alternative for \nhelping millions of hard-working families, while promoting economic \ngrowth.\n  Mr. President, in early December, Congressman John Shadegg and I \nhosted a town hall meeting in Scottsdale, Arizona, to discuss taxes \nwith our constituents. Half the session was devoted to reform of the \nInternal Revenue Service. The other half focused on tax reform.\n  Most of the people we heard from expressed frustration with the \nfederal government's propensity to try to pick winners and losers--that \nis, to target tax relief to select groups of Americans. That is what \nPresident Clinton is proposing again this year. The consensus was in \nfavor of broad-based relief so that everyone has a chance to do \nbetter--singles as well as married couples, retirees as well as \nstudents, families with children as well as those without. People also \ncried out for simplification. Last year's attempt to provide tax relief \nresulted in an additional 821 changes in the Tax Code. It is just too \ncomplex.\n  In fact, most constituents favor scrapping the entire Tax Code and \nstarting over with an entirely new tax system--one that puts taxpayers' \ninterests ahead of the interests of accountants, lawyers, and \nlobbyists. A majority of the Arizonans who attended the Town Hall \nmeeting appeared to favor a national sales tax. But there is a lot of \nsupport for the flat tax as well.\n  Therein lies our dilemma. While public sentiment appears to be \nstrongly in favor of a fundamental overhaul of the Tax Code, \nsignificant public consensus has yet to emerge in favor of a single-\nrate or flat tax over a sales tax or some alternative. And given \nPresident Clinton's lack of support for any fundamental tax reform, it \nis likely to take a broad public consensus, the likes of which we have \nnot seen in recent years, to drive such a tax overhaul through Congress \nand past the President's veto pen. Comprehensive reform will take time \nto accomplish.\n  In the meantime, though, we can take a big step in the direction of \nfundamental reform by providing broad-based tax relief to the American \npeople. Income-tax rate reductions would be best, but we ought to go as \nfar as we can this year. Marriage-penalty and death tax relief are \nother good places to start.\n\n\n                        A FEDERAL SPENDING LIMIT\n\n  Mr. President, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee \nrecently recommended that we not only provide tax relief, but also set \na goal of limiting federal revenue to no more than 19 percent of Gross \nDomestic Product (GDP)--that is about 0.9 percent less than where \nrevenues are today. The growing debt under the Clinton budget and the \ndozens of costly new programs the President is proposing are evidence \nof the need to limit the government's burden on hard-working Americans. \nObviously, a tax limit would also have to be coupled with a requirement \nthat the government balance its books.\n  Establishing such a limit is an idea that I have advocated for some \ntime, although I think a better and more direct approach would be to \nlimit federal spending instead of revenue.\n  It has proven notoriously difficult to accurately project what \nfederal revenues will be from year to year. And even if we could \naccurately predict revenues, keeping them within the limit would no \ndoubt require near constant tinkering with the Tax Code--something that \nought to be avoided if we are interested in simplifying compliance and \nreturning some stability to the tax laws.\n  But we can limit spending. And that is the cornerstone of the \nBalanced Budget/Spending Limitation Amendment that I have proposed over \nthe years. Voters in my home state of Arizona overwhelmingly approved a \nspending limit as part of our state's constitution in 1978. It is a \nhome-grown idea that would work well in Washington, too.\n  The spending limitation amendment I propose would limit spending to \n19 percent of GDP, which is roughly the level of revenue the federal \ngovernment has collected for the last 40 years. There are also \nstatutory approaches to establishing such a limit.\n  Balance the budget and limit spending, and there is no need to \nconsider tax increases. Congress would not be allowed to spend the \nadditional revenue that is raised. Link federal spending to economic \ngrowth, as measured by GDP, and an incentive is created for Congress to \npromote pro-growth economic policies--that is, policies that lead to \nmore jobs and better pay, more opportunities for small businesses. The \nmore the economy grows, the more Congress is allowed to spend, but \nalways proportionate to the size of the economy.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n  Mr. President, we need to be straight with the American people when \nwe talk about a budget surplus. It has yet to materialize, so we should \nnot attempt to spend what we do not have. Paying down the debt is not \nreally an option, since the debt will keep growing as a result of \ncontinued borrowing from Social Security and other trust funds. We \nstill have a long way to go to balance the budget without Social \nSecurity.\n  We can, however, begin to protect Social Security from spendthrift \npoliticians by considering ways of putting\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\nSocial Security contributions off-limits to the government in \nindividual Social Security accounts. And we can invest in broad-based \ntax relief that will help fuel economic growth so that we not only have \nthe means to safeguard Social Security and Medicare for future \ngenerations, but the resources to balance the budget without relying on \nSocial Security.\n  The healthy and growing economy of the last year did what the big tax \nincreases of 1993 and 1990 could not do. It has produced the surge in \nrevenues that has nearly closed the gap between government revenues and \nexpenditures. And it has validated what many of us have said for some \ntime: Reduce the tax burden imposed on the American people, and the \neconomy will flourish and produce the revenues we need to solve our \nbudget problems.\n  Let us really put Social Security first, and let us provide broad-\nbased tax relief. Those objectives should top our agenda for the \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S590-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S592-S593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           JUDICIAL VACANCIES\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today, my colleague from \nIllinois, Senator Durbin, and I are recommending that President Clinton \nnominate David Herndon and Jeanne Scott for federal judgeships in the \nSouthern and Central Districts of Illinois. David Herndon has been a \nhighly respected Illinois Circuit Court judge since 1991. Prior to \nthat, he practiced for 14 years, developing a real expertise in complex \nlitigation. Jeanne Scott has served as an Illinois state judge for 18 \nyears. She is currently the Division Chief for Civil cases in Sangamon \nCounty. She has a sterling reputation as a dedicated and fair judge. \nShe will be the first female federal judge in the history of the \nCentral District of Illinois. It is therefore an appropriate moment for \nme to say a few words about a matter of critical importance: the \nexceptionally large number of judicial vacancies in our federal court \nsystem.\n  Currently, there are 83 vacancies in the federal judiciary. This \naccounts for approximately one out of every ten federal judges. Twenty-\nfive of the vacancies have been in existence for 18 months or longer \nand are therefore regarded as ``judicial emergencies.'' Over one-third \nof the seats in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit are \nvacant. As of last year, the average number of days from nomination to \nconfirmation was at a record high of 183.\n  Illinois presently has seven vacant judgeships. One of these, in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois, dates back \nto November of 1992. Another, in the Central District, dates back to \nOctober of 1994. Two of the nominees for these vacancies are awaiting \naction by the Senate Judiciary Committee and two are awaiting action by \nthe full Senate. In the Southern District, the chief judge went for \nmore than a year without having time to hear a single civil case \nbecause his criminal docket was so full. In the Central District, major \ncivil trials have had to be postponed because of the shortage of \njudges. Commenting on the imminent retirement of a third judge in his \ndistrict, Marvin Aspen, the chief judge of the Northern District, \nrecently told the Chicago Sun-Times that ``if Congress does not move \nquickly . . . in a short time we could have a serious backlog.'' Last \nweek, Judge Aspen called the number of judicial vacancies nationwide \n``an unprecedented scandal.''\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist stated in his 1997 Year-End Report on the \nFederal Judiciary, ``Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels \nindefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally \nhas been associated with the federal judiciary.'' The Chief Justice \nplaced much of the blame squarely on the Senate. He said, ``Some \ncurrent nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate \nJudiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate confirmed \nonly 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under the 101 judges it \nconfirmed during 1994.''\n  By failing to move expeditiously on judicial nominations, the \nmajority party in the Senate is failing to live up to its \nresponsibilities to the American people. President Clinton has made 91 \njudicial nominations during the 105th Congress, but the Senate has \nconfirmed only 39 of these individuals. As the Chicago Tribune \neditorialized last month, ``If Republicans don't like the choices, let \nthe Senate debate them and vote them down. Doing nothing, as the Senate \nhas done lately, is cowardly and cynical.''\n  Worse yet, it is affecting the quality of justice in the United \nStates. The increase in the number of judicial vacancies in combination \nwith the growth in criminal and civil filings has created a huge \nbacklog of federal cases. According to Chief Justice Rehnquist, since \n1990, the number of cases filed in courts of appeals has increased by \n21 percent and those filed in district courts have grown by 24 percent. \nThere was a five percent increase in the criminal caseload in 1997. \nThis resulted in the largest federal criminal caseload in 60 years.\n\n  According to the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the number \nof active cases pending for at least three years rose 20 percent from \n1995 to 1996. According to the most recent data provided by the \nDepartment of Justice, there are more than 16,000 federal cases that \nare more than three years old.\n  Time magazine wrote last year that ``some Republicans have as much as \ndeclared war on [President] Clinton's choices, parsing every phrase \nthey've written for evidence of what they call judicial activism.'' \nThis has discouraged qualified candidates from subjecting themselves to \nthe confirmation process. For instance, last September, Justice Richard \nP. Goldenhirsch of the Illinois Court of Appeals, withdrew his name \nfrom consideration for a federal judgeship, stating that, because of \nthe ``poisoned atmosphere of the confirmation process, my nomination \nwould be pending for an indefinite period of time.'' He stated that the \nprotracted nature of the process was ``particularly unfair to the \npeople of the Southern District of Illinois, who deserve a fully \nstaffed court ready to hear their cases.''\n  In condemning President Clinton's judicial nominations, one of my \nRepublican colleagues described the judicial branch last year as being \nfull of ``renegade judges, [who are] a robed, contemptuous intellectual \nelite.'' And in explaining why the confirmation of a California appeals \ncourt judge had been delayed for two years, a senior member of the \nRepublican majority stated, ``If you want to blame somebody for the \nslowness of approving judges to the Ninth Circuit, blame the Clinton \nand Carter appointees who have been ignoring the law and are true \nexamples of activist judging.''\n  The President's record of judicial appointments belies any assertion \nthat he has sought to stack the federal judiciary with the types of \njudges referred to by my colleagues. The New York Times commented last \nyear that what ``may be most notable about Clinton's judicial \nappointments may be reluctance to fill the court with liberal judges.'' \nThe Times noted that a statistical analysis by three scholars \n``confirms the notion that the ideology of Clinton's appointees falls \nsomewhere between the conservatives selected by [Presidents] Bush and \nReagan and the liberals chosen by President Carter.'' The Times quoted \nan author of the study, Professor Donald Songer of the University of \nSouth Carolina, as stating that Clinton's appointments were ``decidedly \nless liberal than other modern Democratic presidents.'' Professor \nSonger stated that, from an ideological standpoint, President Clinton's \njudges were most similar to judges selected by President Ford.\n  Republican members of the Senate thus cannot claim that they are \nsafeguarding the judiciary from liberal jurists. Indeed, it is they \nwho, in the words of Time magazine, are currently engaged in ``what has \nbecome a more partisan and ideological examination of all judicial \nnominees.'' As my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, stated last \nSeptember, the ``continuing attack on the judicial branch [by \nRepublican Members of Congress], the slowdown in the processing of the \nscores of good women and men the President has nominated to fill \nvacancies on the Federal courts around the country, and widespread \nthreats of impeachment [against federal judges] are all part of a \npartisan ideological effort to intimidate the judiciary.''\n  Mr. President, Chief Justice Rehnquist has called the independence of \nthe judiciary ``the crown jewel of our system of government.'' Our \ncourts are\n\n[[Page S593]]\n\nrevered around the globe precisely because of their ability to \nadminister justice impartially and without regard to the prevailing \npolitical climate. Republicans in Congress are seeking to undermine \njudicial independence and freedom of action. A key element of their \nstrategy has been to put a choke hold on the process of confirming \nnominees sent by President Clinton. This state of affairs must not be \nallowed to continue. As Chief Justice Rehnquist has stated, ``The \nSenate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, \nbut after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or \ndown.'' Let the Senate heed the words of the Chief Justice and commit \nitself to enabling the federal judiciary to be, as the Supreme Court \npediments proclaim, the guardian of our liberty and the guarantor of \nequal justice under the law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S592-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  A TRIBUTE TO CADET CAPTAIN GUY PRYOR\n\n   Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Cadet Captain Guy Pryor, a student \nat Haywood High School, in Brownsville, Tennessee, will soon be honored \nby the Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps with its highest \nhonor, the Cadet Gold Valor Award. Cadet Pryor is receiving this award \nfor his heroic efforts on Sunday, December 19, 1997, as he attempted to \nsave the life of an automobile accident victim.\n  Cadet Pryor and his friends left a Sunday evening church party in \nJackson when they came upon the scene of an accident, a head-on \ncollision. One of the cars in the accident, a Toyota pick-up, was \nalready engulfed in flames, lying in a ditch, having rolled about 100 \nfeet from the crash site. The man trapped in the vehicle was \ndesperately calling for help.\n  Without hesitating, Cadet Pryor ran to the truck, and began pulling \nat the passenger door. Those watching cautioned him that the truck \nmight well explode at any moment, and called for him to move from the \ntruck. The flames were already so hot Cadet Pryor's palms burned, and \nan onlooker threw him a coat to better insulate his hands against the \nfire.\n  Cadet Pryor succeeded in pulling the man from the truck just as \nparamedics arrived. Unfortunately, the victim, Hugh Rainey Pegram of \nJackson, died on the way to the hospital, and our hearts go out to his \nloved ones. Cadet Pryor was taken to the hospital for treatment of his \nburned hands and released.\n  So often we do not hear about our young people who distinguish \nthemselves. Cadet Pryor is a hero in the truest sense of the word \nbecause at great peril to himself, he gave willingly and without \nquestion to a fellow human being in need. His spirit of service and \nselflessness is an example for all of us to emulate.\n  This recognition from the Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training \nCorps is a wonderful testament to Cadet Pryor's bravery that Sunday \nnight. The Cadet Gold Valor Award brings honor to Cadet Pryor and his \nfamily, and also to the outstanding Tennessee 944th unit of the Junior \nROTC at Haywood County High School. Cadet Pryor's story is an \ninspiration to us all, and I am proud to be his United States \nSenator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/02/10/senate-section/article/S593-1", "month": "02", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "10", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S593]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NATIONAL AFRICAN AMERICAN CREED\n\n Mr. BENNETT.
