Mr. President, on March 20, my dear friend and former \ncolleague, Senator Dave Durenberger, lost his father, George \nDurenberger, at the age of 90.\n  But, because the Senate was just beginning its recess at that time, I \ndid\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\nnot have the opportunity to pay respect to my friend and the much-\ncelebrated life of his father. It is for this purpose that I rise \ntoday.\n  It has been said that, ``the worst sin against our fellow creatures \nis not to hate them, but to be indifferent to them; that is the essence \nof inhumanity.'' George Durenberger, the parent, the teacher, the \ncoach, must have been acutely aware of this because there was not \nindifference in him. He saw worth in every person he met and rewarded \nthem with a first chance, a second, and a third.\n  In short, George Durenberger never gave up on anyone. Beyond all his \nother contributions, George Durenberger will be most remembered for his \nabiding faith in people.\n  According to newspaper accounts, George Durenberger was one of the \n``best known and most well-liked men in Central Minnesota.'' By the \nsame accounts, ``Big George'' as he was often called, was ``a legend.''\n  Coming to St. John's Abbey and University in Collegeville, MN in 1924 \nas a student, George Durenberger obtained hero status as the star \noffensive center on the football team, the first three time All-\nMinnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference award winner, and also \nthe captain of not only the football team but the basketball team as \nwell.\n  Upon graduation in 1928, Durenberger became a professor and coach at \nSt. John's and, over the course of 44 years, served as head coach of \nthe football, basketball, and baseball teams--and sometimes all at \nonce.\n  Durenberger served as athletic director for both St. John's \nUniversity and St. John's preparatory school athletics for all but 2 of \nhis 44 years at St. John's.\n  Many Minnesotans still recall that it was George Durenberger who \nstarted the round robin system of intercollegiate competition in the \nMinnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. And, some still remember \nthe national recognition he gained through his ace athletic program to \ncondition the 87th Airborne Detachment for World War II.\n  Perhaps, these accomplishments figured into St. John's decision to \nname the college's athletic field complex, the ``George Durenberger \nField.'' But, I believe that what contributed most to his Herculean \nstature can be best expressed in George Durenberger's own words:\n\n       A coach should be judged not only on his ability to produce \n     winning teams, but also on whether or not he has made a \n     positive contribution to the moral, mental, social and \n     emotional growth of his students.\n\n  George Durenberger was the epitome of a teacher. He knew and loved \npeople. He saw the good in them--even when they could not see it in \nthemselves.\n  ``The young men who came to St. John's in the early forties from the \nsmall towns of Minnesota and North Dakota were very much in need of a \nrole model,'' recalls former Minnesota Supreme Court Justice John \nSimonett. ``Then we met `Big George'. And we looked up to him--both \nliterally and figuratively.''\n  George Durenberger lifted spirits, recalled another St. John's \nalumnus, ``I always left George feeling better about myself.'' George \nDurenberger ``was the first person I met as a student at St. John's in \n1924,'' remembered Fred Hughes, a St. Cloud attorney and former \nUniversity of Minnesota Regent, ``and to this day, he remains the \nbest.''\n  And, consider what the Hill newspaper's Al Eisele, who attended St. \nJohn's, had to say. Mr. Eisele said, ``George Durenberger was as much a \npart of the modern history of St. John's University as the Benedictine \nmonks who founded it 150 years ago.''\n  Durenberger, ``a physically imposing man with a booming voice and \noutgoing personality,'' as described by Eisele, ``helped shape the \nlives of thousands of young men.'' As athletic director, Durenberger \nwas such a forceful man, noted Eisele, that he even got the monks to \nexercise.\n  In closing, Eisele remarked that Durenberger and his wife Isabelle \nwere ``surrogate parents to many * * * and an inspiration to all.''\n  George Durenberger never left St. John's until he died. He loved the \ninstitution and all the people and memories that came with it. However, \nthis love was not connected to stubborn consistency but to confection. \nGeorge Durenberger, said one friend, ``was driven by a vision of a \n`better city' ,'' something akin to the city referred to in the book of \nHebrews.\n  Another book in Scriptures, Proverbs, states, ``Train up a child in \nthe way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.'' \nAccording to George Durenberger's eldest son, my friend and former \ncolleague, ``All my desire for public service and for making the world \na better place than I found it, came from him.'' That was Dave \nDurenberger.\n  In this way, and in so many others, George Durenberger made a very \nprofound and lasting contribution to the world. All he withheld from \nthe world was indifference.\n  Mr. President, I offer George Durenberger's wife, Isabelle; his \ndaughters, Constance and Mary; his sons, George Mark and Thomas; his \nnine grandchildren and two great grandchildren; and most especially I \noffer his eldest son, my dear friend, David Durenberger, my most \nheartfelt sympathy.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield back the remaining part of my time and suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2865-5", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2866-S2870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MEDICARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I have come to the floor each day this week \nto talk about what I think is the critical need for the Senate to \ndevelop a bipartisan plan to reform Medicare. Medicare is a lifeline \nfor millions and millions of American families, and I think it is \nunderstood by every Member of this body that this is a program that \nfaces financial crisis as we look to the next century.\n  Today, as part of the effort to build support for a bipartisan \nMedicare reform effort I will look specifically at the Medicare \nreimbursement formula. I think it is important to take this subject up \nbecause I believe today's Medicare reimbursement system in many \ninstances overcharges taxpayers on costs and shortchanges older people \nwho need and deserve good quality care.\n  Now, Mr. President, as we all know, there are essentially two major \ntypes of health care in America. There is traditional health care, what \nis known as fee-for-service. It means just what it sounds like. \nProviders get paid on the basis of the number of services that they \nrender. This, unfortunately, can encourage waste. If, for example, an \nolder person in traditional health care receives 10 medical tests and 4 \nwould have been sufficient, under traditional health care the provider \ngets paid for 10. The other type of health care is what is known as \nmanaged care or health maintenance organizations. This is essentially a \nprepaid kind of arrangement. It creates incentives to hold down costs. \nBut as we know, in some instances, tragically, it has also been used as \na tool to hold back on needed health care that older people depend on.\n  The Federal Government, looking to the great demographic changes, the \ndemographic earthquake that our country will face in the next century, \nhas sought to try to change this system of reimbursement and, in \nparticular, try to encourage the availability of good quality--I want \nto emphasize that, good quality--managed care or health maintenance \norganizations.\n  They set up a plan for reimbursing these organizations known as the \naverage adjusted per capita cost, or AAPCC. Now, I am the first to \nadmit that discussion of this topic is pretty much a sleep-inducing, \neye-glazing issue, but certainly for folks in rural Wyoming, rural \nOregon and across this country, the low-cost areas, it has great \nimplications, but also it has great implications for the system as a \nwhole.\n  I believe that the Federal Government has botched the job of handling \nthis reimbursement system, and it is time to make some fundamental \nchanges. Under this reimbursement system, Medicare pays health \nmaintenance organizations 95 percent of the estimated cost of treating \na patient under fee-for-service plans in a particular county. What this \nvery often means\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nis that in an area where there has not been an effort to inject \ncompetition, where there has not been an effort to drive out waste, you \nhave wasteful, inefficient fee-for-service health care being offered, \nand it is being used, essentially, as a path to guide reimbursement for \nthe HMO's, the health maintenance organizations.\n  I brought a couple of charts to the floor today. The first is one \nthat shows that many, many of our counties across this country that \nhave tried to hold down costs are reimbursed for health maintenance \norganizations, or the competitive part of the Medicare system, in a way \nthat is below the national average. Certainly, Mr. President, you and \nothers like myself who represent rural areas see how critical this \nissue is because our providers have difficulty providing the defined \nbenefits under Medicare, let alone some of the extras such as reduced \ndrugs, eyeglasses and hearing aids that are available in many of the \nhigh-cost areas.\n  For example, as my next chart illustrates, in 1997, one of the very \nhigh-cost reimbursement areas was in Florida, in Dade City, FL, with \n$748 a month received there, whereas in Arthur, NE, they receive $221 \nper month. So the question, essentially, is to our colleagues, again, \non a bipartisan basis, our colleagues from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey and \nSenator Hagel: Is it true that a typical 72-year-old Nebraskan is that \nmuch healthier than a typical New Yorker of the same age? Well, \nMedicare thinks so. That is how the Federal Government does business. \nThe Federal Government conducts its affairs that way. I think it is \nwrong. It is that way not just for folks in Nebraska but many other \nparts of the country like ours that, again, we share on a bipartisan \nbasis, and as a result our seniors get a much thinner Medicare benefit \npackage than they would if they were in an area that was much more \ncostly.\n  For example, in my home community of Portland, OR, we have the \nhighest concentration of HMO's in the country, the highest level of \npenetration of HMO's in the United States, just about 60 percent, and \nwe are reimbursed at a level significantly below the national average \nof $467. We get reimbursed at a $387-per-month level. What happens is a \nsenior who lives in Dade City, FL, or in southern California or parts \nof New York State calls seniors I represent in Oregon and asks them how \nMedicare is going, and seniors in the high-cost areas say, ``It's going \ngreat because we can get prescription drugs, eye glasses and hearing \naids all at essentially little or no cost,'' and seniors in Oregon get \nnone of those things, and, in fact, many of their providers in rural \nparts of our State have difficulty providing basic services.\n\n  So the question then becomes, what are some of the fundamental ways \nin which to change this system which so often rewards waste, penalizes \nthe frugal and, in effect, creates an incentive for various parts of \nthe country to do business as usual, even though the General Accounting \nOffice and other bodies are saying that business as usual will be bad \nnews for both seniors and for taxpayers. Several practical suggestions \nare at hand, Mr. President, and suggestions that I believe ought to be \nadopted on a bipartisan basis. I think for the long term, it is time to \nseparate out, to literally cut off the link between HMO's, the managed \ncare, and fee-for-service, because I think what we are having today is \na situation that literally creates incentives for wasteful health care.\n  Second, it seems to me there ought to be a new minimum payment floor \nthat brings up all the counties that have been low cost, and especially \nthose in rural areas, and certainly the President of the Senate, just \nas I see in rural Oregon, understands the importance of that.\n  Third, it seems to me that the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, ought \nto begin a gradual effort to move to a national reimbursement level, a \nblended kind of level, and do it gradually so that areas that have been \nmore inefficient are not going to face all of the changes \novernight, but are going to understand very clearly that with an effort \nto move to a blended or national reimbursement rate, Congress is not \ngoing to tolerate what we have today, which is a system that rewards \nwaste.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, it seems to me that the Federal Government \nshould be trying to promote competition, serious competition, as the \nprivate sector does, in areas of high-cost managed care or significant \npenetration of health maintenance organizations. There is no question \nin my mind that some HMO's are overpaid. We do need to produce \ncompetition in those areas. I believe that that can be carefully \ntargeted. That, in my view, is the guts of reimbursement reform, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I would like to conclude my remarks today by saying that going to the \nnext level of Medicare reform after we take care of the reimbursement \nissue is a logical step because it flows from what needs to be done \nwith the reimbursement formula. By getting good data and more logical \ndata about the various counties, the Health Care Financing \nAdministration will be in a position to make information available to \nolder people and their families across this country about how to make \nbetter choices with respect to their health care. Today, what we have \nis a situation where many older people get no choices at all. We see \nthat in many rural parts of our country because of the reimbursement \nformula. The reimbursement formula is so low that many plans won't come \nin, so seniors in those areas get few choices. In the high-cost areas, \nthe Federal Government has put out a mishmash of information which \nmakes it impossible to choose between the various services that are \navailable to them, and that is absolutely key because in those high-\ncost areas we have exactly the places where it is most important to get \ncompetition.\n  Yesterday, I brought to the floor--I am going to blow it up in the \ndays ahead so that it's possible for the Senate to see it in more \ndetail--an example of what it is like for an older person in Los \nAngeles to try to navigate through the various health choices available \nto her. In fact, it takes one full wall, in a picture that the General \nAccounting Office took, just to put the various pieces of information \nthat that senior would have to wade through. So I want to see us now \nhave the Federal Government look to what the private sector is doing to \nempower seniors and their families to get understandable, clear \ninformation about Medicare so that they can make appropriate choices. \nThis involves details on the way different Medicare choices and plans \nwork, data on the experience of seniors with similar health and income \nbackgrounds, the methods and the decision steps used by plans to pay \nparticipating practitioners and health care facilities and providers. \nAnd, Mr. President, certainly, Members of this body should understand \nthat this is doable because this is largely the kind of information \nthat is available to Members of the Senate and other Federal employees \nwho participate in the Federal employee health plan.\n  So in ensuring that seniors can receive a full list of plans \navailable to them, enrollment fairs are an approach that has been \nlooked at in the past, and there may be other ways to do that, such as \npublishing appropriate performance data on plans. These kinds of steps \nare approaches that the Federal Government has pursued and have related \nto Senators and members of the Federal service. It seems to me that \nthere is no reason to further delay making this kind of information \navailable to those who depend on Medicare. Older people ought to be in \na position to enroll and disenroll from a plan at any time.\n  Certainly, this kind of approach will encourage competition. Perhaps \nat some point there ought to be incentives to try to keep people in \nplans that are cost effective, and I think that the Federal Government \ncan look to this kind of approach. But, certainly, significant rights \nof older people to enroll and disenroll in plans is critical.\n  So these kinds of rights, like appeal rights when you have been \ndenied benefits, a good grievance procedure--in effect, a patients' \nbill of rights--is what is fundamental to making sure that older people \nare in a position to get the kind of information they need in order to \nmake choices about their health care and, at the same time, inject \ncompetition into this system.\n  We have made many of these decisions already as it relates to Federal \nemployees and Senators. We have made them as it relates to the private \nsector and, in fact, we have even made them in areas that have \nparallels to this program--for example, in the Medigap\n\n[[Page S2868]]\n\nProgram. I and others were involved in this to try to make sure that \nseniors who purchased supplemental coverage would be in a position to \nmake sure they could get full value and have a place to turn to for \ntheir questions. We can take a lesson from the Medigap Program, and the \nFederal Government ought to make available troubleshooters to answer \nquestions from older people as we move to competition.\n  So, Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I think every \nMember of this body understands that business as usual with respect to \nMedicare is unacceptable. I will tell you, if you don't like the \nprogram, if you really dislike Medicare, keep it the way it is, because \nthe way it is is going to be a path that will cause, in my view, great \ncalamity for families and seniors. If you believe Medicare is a program \nthat has made an enormous difference in the lives of older people, I \nthink that is the best argument for a bipartisan Medicare reform \neffort, a bipartisan Medicare reform effort that would ensure that \nseniors got guaranteed, secure benefits, not some check or some sort of \nvoucher that just said, well, maybe this will be enough for your care \nand maybe it won't.\n\n  Seniors deserve guaranteed, secure benefits. Many of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle have been absolutely right in saying that \nmuch of Medicare across this country is an outdated tin lizzy kind of \nprogram, a program that the private sector consigned to the attic years \nago. So let us try to bring the parties together around the proposition \nthat there ought to be defined, secure, guaranteed benefits, around the \nproposition that it is time to bring the revolution in the private \nsector to Medicare, and do it in a way that protects patients' rights--\nno gag clauses or limitations on what older people can know about \nplans, grievance procedures, appeal rights. Those are the kinds of \nissues I think that both parties can agree on.\n  I intend to come to the floor day after day to bring the issues of \nMedicare reform to the attention of the Senate and to the attention of \nthe public, because I believe this is going to be the issue that is \ngoing to dominate the debate about our priorities, particularly our \ndomestic priorities, for the next 15 to 20 years.\n  I believe that every Member of this body in the next century is going \nto be asked: What did you do in 1997 to get Medicare on track?\n  I believe there are opportunities now, as we move to the budget, as \nwe move to efforts to have a bipartisan balanced budget, to start the \nchanges that will put Medicare on track for older people and taxpayers.\n  Senator WYDEN. Mr. President, to reiterate, the heart of the Medicare \nProgram is the 38 million beneficiaries now dependent on this health \ncare system as an essential social lifeline.\n  Any changes we make to Medicare must, first and foremost, consider \nthe likely effects those reforms will have on these beneficiaries, many \nof whom are frail, infirm, and low-income.\n  As I've said every day on the floor of the Senate this week, I'm \ngoing to be talking today about the choices and access those \nbeneficiaries ought to have, but who in too many parts of the country \nhave no choices and poor access to health care.\n  I'm also going to be talking about the window of opportunity we have \nin this Congress to enact significant changes in the program to cure \nthe half-trillion-dollar shortfall we can expect in this program by the \nend of the coming decade, and to bring new choices, new access and new \nefficiencies necessary to save Medicare for not just the next 5 years, \nbut into 2010, 2020, and 2030.\n  As I said yesterday, Medicare is a 1965-model tin-Lizzy health care \nprogram showing little resemblance to the rest of American health care. \nVarious out-dated, out-moded and bureaucratic features of Medicare \npractically encourage practitioners in the greater part of the Medicare \nsystem to drive up unnecessary care and resulting over-billing--actions \nwhich over-charge the Government on costs, but short-change \nbeneficiaries on good health care.\n  Beginning in the last decade, the Government's partial solution to \nthis was to institute coordinated care in Medicare. We encouraged \nhealth insurers to begin offering plans that managed service Medicare \nbeneficiaries received, and we offered encouragement to beneficiaries \nto participate in the form of lower out-of-pocket costs and, we \nanticipated, a broader package of goods and services.\n  And we would determine how each plan, in each city, would be paid for \neach beneficiary in the plan according to an arcane formula called the \naverage adjusted per capita cost--or the AAPCC.\n  Now, before your eyes glaze over, let me give you a very simplistic \nidea of how the local AAPCC payment rate is determined, and how this \nformulation really penalizes beneficiaries living in places where \nmedical costs are relatively low.\n  The AAPCC is any given county is formulated on the cost of providing \nmedicine, per beneficiary, in the most costly portion of Medicare--the \ntraditional sector known as fee-for-service. This is the portion of the \nprogram where beneficiary can elect to see just about any doctor they \nwant, whenever they want, and the individual care providers in those \nsituations can be reimbursed for just about any services they deem \nnecessary for that beneficiary.\n\n  No questions asked. No oversight.\n  This may sound like a pretty good deal for the beneficiaries. But it \ndoesn't always mean they get the care they need or require. For \nexample, there's nothing to stop an individual provider in fee-for-\nservice for ordering up 10 or 12 tests for a beneficiary, when only 3 \nor 4 really are required.\n  This is one of the reasons why fee-for-service Medicare is growing at \na much more rapid rate than the rest of the program--and it's one of \nthe reasons we find ourselves in such a deep financial hole.\n  It is also clear that the rapid growth of fee-for-service Medicare \nseems endemic to certain large metropolitan regions of the county.\n  As my colleagues may be able to see, the areas in blue and white \nrepresent portions of the country where the AAPCC rate is below the \nnational average.\n  The areas in red and orange represents areas where the payments are \nabove the average.\n  And just for the record, the variation is huge. The 1997 high-\nreimbursement county is Richmond County, up in New York, at $767 per \nmonth, per beneficiary, while the lowest paid county was over here in \nArthur County, Nebraska, at $221 per month.\n  Now, I'd ask my colleagues Bob Kerrey and Chuck Hagel whether they \nthink a typical 72-year-old Nebraskan is that much healthier than a \ntypical New Yorker of the same age?\n  Medicare seems to think so, and I think they're wrong.\n  And unfortunately for folks in Nebraska and other low pay States--my \nhome State of Oregon is certainly one of them--the difference is that \nthey get a much thinner Medicare benefit package in coordinated care \nplans, if they have access to such plans at all because their monthly \nreimbursement rate is so abysmally low.\n  Let's talk about some examples of how this hurts beneficiaries in \ncost-efficient counties where the reimbursement rate is particularly \nscrewy.\n  In Mankato, MN, where the average payment is $300 per month, \nbeneficiaries in coordinated plans get their basic managed care \ncoverage under Medicare rules--but nothing else. No discounts on \nprescription drug purchases, no additional preventative care, no \nhearing aid discounts, no coverage for eyeglasses.\n  In Portland, OR, my home town, the rate is a little better at $387 \nper month, but that's still well below the $467 national average. That \nmeans the best additional benefit received by these folks, who have the \nhighest managed care penetration rate in the country at about 60 \npercent, is a 30 percent discount on prescriptions up to a $50 maximum.\n  Now, let's go up to the high end of this wacky AAPCC payment system. \nIn Miami, FL, where the payment rate is all the way up to $748 per \nmonth, seniors in these programs get unlimited prescription drug \nreimbursements, a $700 credit for hearing aids, and dental coverage--\nall add-ons that are virtually unheard of in most of the rest of the \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could say that this is the kind of cost-\naccounting that's going to add stability and integrity to the Medicare \nProgram into the\n\n[[Page S2869]]\n\nnext century. Unfortunately, all this payment formula accomplishes is: \nFirst, huge overpayments in some counties, with resulting extravagant \nprofits to insurance companies, and second, payments to other counties \nwhich are obviously too low, and which result in either no coordinated \ncare offerings to beneficiaries in those communities or bare-bones \nplans that for millions of beneficiaries to incur higher out-of-pocket \ncosts purely as a matter of geographic accident.\n  I believe we can transform Medicare from an aging dinosaur insurance \nprogram into a comprehensive seniors health care system while \nmaintaining our historic commitment to a basic package of benefits for \nevery beneficiary, no matter their health or income status.\n  But that transformation necessarily will involve providing seniors \nwith many more choices with regard to their health plan selection.\n  The current formula used for paying Medicare in rural counties and in \nother places where communities have worked hard to reduce general \nhealth care costs is precisely antagonistic to that purpose.\n  This system denies folks choice because it necessarily results in \npoor quality health plans, high out-of-pockets expenses, or no managed \ncare choices--or a combination of all three--for vast numbers of \nbeneficiaries.\n  And again, an accident of geography seems to be the deciding factor \nin the current state of affairs.\n  I believe Medicare reform has to include remedies for these problems.\n  This is not just a matter of increasing the benefit package for folks \nin low pay counties. More fundamentally, this is an issue of providing \nmore choices, to encouraging the entry of more plans, into large areas \nof this country where the current AAPCC formula creates reimbursement \nrates which are so low--which are so nonsensical--as to completely \ndiscourage anything but fee-for-service Medicare in those communities.\n  I believe reimbursement reform include several important features:\n  A new minimum payment floor that brings all counties up to 80 percent \nof the national average, immediately.\n  A new annualized reimbursement increase formula that shifts \nadjustments away from localized fee-for-service medicine costs, and \ntoward actual cost increases in coordinated care.\n  A systematic imposition of financial controls reimbursement growth in \nhigh-reimbursement counties in order to squeeze out what have to be \nmonumental over-payments to plans in those communities, and huge losses \nto the Medicare Program.\n  Mr. President, reforming Medicare isn't just about reforming payment \nsystems, however.\n  It's also about helping beneficiaries to become smarter shoppers in a \nnew Medicare environment that we hope will offer many of them many more \nchoices and options for care.\n  Therefore, it is critical that we change the program in way that will \nempower seniors to make the appropriate choices.\n  At the bottom, this means developing and executing a much better \nsystem of informing beneficiaries about their rights in managed care, \nand about the most important provisions of the health plans available \nto them. This information must be given to seniors as ``news they can \nuse''--data that is in clear and accurate layman's language, and which \nconforms to standardized reporting practices so that consumers can \ncompare one plan against another in a traditional kitchen-table-\nassessment.\n  Indeed, these tools if we had them would be useful, today, with \n80,000 beneficiaries per month choosing to leave fee-for-service \nMedicare for Medicare managed care organizations.\n  According to Stanley Jones, chairman of the National Institute of \nMedicine's committee on choice and managed care:\n\n       Many elderly are making these new choices without enough \n     information to judge which option is best for them, what the \n     plan they choose will actually cover, or how the plan will \n     operate.\n\n  Jones said that many seniors misunderstand the basic structure of HMO \npayment and care practices. He criticized Medicare managers for \nproviding information to beneficiaries about differences in available \nhealth plans that ``appears primitive'' compared with what's available \nfrom private purchasers.\n\n  Mr. President, last year I asked the General Accounting Office to \nlook into this problem, and the GAO auditors came to similar \nconclusions:\n\n       Though Medicare is the nation's largest purchaser of \n     managed care services, it lags other large purchasers in \n     helping beneficiaries choose among plans. The Health Care \n     Financing Administration (HCFA) has responsibility for \n     protecting beneficiaries' rights and obtaining and \n     disseminating information from Medicare HMOs to \n     beneficiaries. HCFA has not yet, however, provided \n     information to beneficiaries on individual HMOs. It has \n     announced several efforts to develop HMO health care quality \n     indicators. HCFA has, however, the capability to provide \n     Medicare beneficiaries useful, comparative information now, \n     using the administrative data it already collects.\n\n  The kind of data HCFA collects, now, of use to beneficiaries includes \nperformance indicators such as: First, annual disenrollment rates, \nsecond, cancellation rates, third, so-called rapid disenrollment \nrates--the percentage of enrollees who disenroll within 12 months of \nsigning up, fourth, rate of return to fee-for-service Medicare from the \nplan, and fifth, disenrollments tied specifically to sales agent abuses \ninvolving, among other things, marketers who mislead enrollees about \nwhat a plan may cover.\n  I think we can go beyond these quality indicators. The Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Program [FEHBP], for example, includes a \ngraded system of reports on the quality of key services in federal \nemployee health plans. There is no reason why Medicare beneficiaries, \nwho must make these decisions on their own without benefit of employers \nor corporate benefit managers, shouldn't have at least the kind of \nqualitative analysis available to members of Congress who are covered \nby FEHBP plans.\n  Mr. President, I am heartened by the announcement earlier this year \nby HCFA Administrator Bruce Vladeck that the program would begin \noffering beneficiaries some qualitative information on managed care \nplans through the Internet. I think that's great for seniors that use \nthe Internet in their homes or have access to that technology somewhere \nelse.\n  I think it's clear, however, that we need to step up efforts going \nbeyond the limited information that eventually would be made available \nat a HCFA website.\n  Here's the bare minimum of information that seniors need in a \nrevamped Medicare program which empowers them to make appropriate \nchoices:\n  Details on the way different Medicare choices and plans work.\n  Data on the experience of seniors of similar health and income \nbackground in those plans.\n  The methods and the decision steps used by plans to pay participating \npractitioners and health care facilities and service providers.\n  And here are the steps we need to take to insure seniors receive that \ninformation and the other tools they need to prevail in an increasingly \nmore complex and choice-intensive Medicare marketplace:\n  First, Medicare managers must ensure that every senior, in every \ncounty, receive a full list of plans available to him, with a detailed \ndescription of what each plan offers. These submissions must be written \nin a way that allows a consumer to make easy comparisons between plans.\n  HCFA should require annual ``enrollment fairs,'' giving seniors a \nchance to review all plan materials at least once a year in order to \ndetermine if alternative Medicare offerings might be more suitable to \nthe individual enrollee.\n  Second, Medicare must collect, evaluate and publish appropriate \nperformance data on every plan. Using independent quality review \norganizations like the National Council of Quality Assessment, Medicare \nmust devise and publish qualitative analysis--consumer report cards--on \neach Medicare plan, further enabling seniors to make appropriate \nchoices among offerings.\n  Third, consumers must be allowed to enroll and disenroll from plans \nat any time during their first 12 months in a plan. After the first \nyear of enrollment, disenrollment with guaranteed enrollment in a new \nplan would be limited to a first opportunity after six months in the \nsecond year.\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\n  We would make it somewhat tougher to disenroll after the first year \nbecause we would expect plans to make investments of preventative \nhealth services for new enrollees in the initial few months of their \nenrollment.\n  Fourth, health plan enrollees need a patient bill of rights that by \nFederal statute protects certain baseline issues fundamental to their \ngood health. At the top of this list would be a Federal statute \nabsolutely protecting the free and unfettered communication between \npatient and doctor on that enrollee's health condition and any \nappropriate services and procedures necessary to treat the patient.\n  Fifth, give Medicare beneficiaries a certain and sure grievance and \nappeals process, and the information they need to use it. Medicare must \nstreamline the current process, allowing beneficiaries to by-pass \ncertain bureaucratic roadblocks in the present system--most especially \nthose that force time-delaying procedural exercises when the outcomes \nalready are known. On an initial enrollment, and at any time a \nbeneficiary changes plans, an explanation of new or amended appeals \nprocedures must be part of the enrollment exercise.\n  And as with Medigap insurance, HCFA should hire and train ombudsmen \nand trouble-shooters tell help beneficiaries both understand provisions \nin plans, generally, and appeals and grievance procedures specifically.\n  Sixth, every Medicare risk provider should offer at least one plan in \nhis portfolio that includes a point-of-service provision, so that those \nseniors who would try plans if they could keep going to a particular \npractitioner would be allowed to do so.\n  Mr. President, I have spent quite a number of years talking with \nseniors about their health care. Before I was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1980, I was cochairman of the Oregon Gray Panthers. \nI know that seniors are deeply suspicious of any changes to Medicare, \nin particular, and many of them view the current debate over the shape \nand direction of the program with a good deal of alarm.\n  But many more who I've talked to recognize the need for changes and, \nindeed, want to see this debate begin.\n  And on the basis of those conversations I am convinced that seniors \nwill feel a lot better about anything we do if we give them more \ndecision-making power to fashion the health care they receive through \nthe program.\n  Fundamental to that is making sure they have the information and \ntools to make the right decision, at the front end, and to protect \nthemselves in the case of disputed decisions while they are enrolled in \nplans. These changes would go a long way toward providing seniors with \nthat kind of empowerment, and in the long run strengthening and \nimproving Medicare as a critical government program.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I take the floor today to discuss an \nissue that is serious and becoming more serious every year, and that is \nthe pitiful state of our legal system. It is becoming harder and harder \nand harder to convict anybody of anything. You can catch them on tape, \nfilm them committing the crime, and then you will probably lose it; \nthey will be found not guilty. No amount of evidence seems to be \nsufficient anymore. I think we have reached this sorry and pitiful \nstate because we have basically let the system be controlled by \nlawyers. When you control the legal system by lawyers, you are simply \nasking a thermostat to set itself. Defense lawyers are twisting and \nbending common sense to let the guilty go free, and they are aided by \njudges--in many cases, hand-picked by the trial lawyers. The lawyers \npick the judges.\n  At every turn, you have lawyers controlling a system that makes no \ncommon sense, except to serve one purpose, which is for their benefit.\n  The most recent example I can think of is the glaring stupidity \ninvolving the Oklahoma bombing case. First, it has taken 2 years to \nbring it to court when the man was caught the day after he did it. Now, \nmany taxpayers are appalled by the very fact that they are paying for \nMcVeigh's defense--they are paying for it. They think that is \nreprehensible. But they don't realize how much they are paying. If they \ndid, they would rise up and revolt. It is not just the defense of \nMcVeigh; it is gold-plated from one end to the other. He has 14--14--\nexpensive lawyers defending him that the working people of this country \nare paying for--14 of them. His chief lawyer, Mr. Jones, says that it \nwill cost $50 million to defend him. That is his estimate. Now, anybody \nthat has ever had a lawyer knows they never come in with a low \nestimate. They are estimating $50 million to defend him. This is \nabsolutely offensive to every taxpayer in this country, and it should \nbe. But this is a typical example of a legal system that is out of \ncontrol.\n  Now, to defend Mr. McVeigh because he blew up the building in \nOklahoma City, his lawyers have traveled literally all over the world. \nThey have been from Kansas, where he rented the truck, to Jericho. I \ndon't know why he would have been there. They have been to the \nPhilippines. These lawyers are traveling at taxpayers' expense. They \nhave been all over Italy. They have covered every country in Europe and \ngone to the West Bank. Nobody knows what they are searching for--maybe \nfor the real killer, or maybe just enjoying travel at taxpayers' \nexpense. While they have the killer, they are always looking for \nanother one. The taxpayers have paid for a TV and VCR for Mr. McVeigh \nso he can review the evidence.\n  Mr. President, to add insult to injury and outrage to outrage, they \nmoved the trial. So now we, the working people of this country, are \npaying $50,000 a week--$50,000 a week--for the living expenses of his \nlawyers. When you start talking about the working people, $50,000 every \nweek for the living expenses of his lawyers--they spent $0.5 million to \nremodel the courtroom in Denver for his trial. They couldn't try him at \nhome. They had to move it to Denver and we spent $0.5 million getting \nthe courtroom ready for him.\n  The victims of his crime have had to travel hundreds of miles from \nOklahoma to Denver in hopes that they see that he gets justice. They \nare paying for the defense of the man that killed their children. They \nare also having to pay for their own room, board and lodging in Denver. \nPlus they are paying $50,000 for his lawyers' lodging and board in \nDenver. There is no end to it.\n  How many times do the victims of this crime, or any crime, have to be \nmade victims again by the very judicial system that they are paying \nfor? We will be paying for McVeigh's trial long from now in the form of \ninterest on the debt and the money we borrow to give him $50 million \nfor his lawyers.\n  It would be my thought that if McVeigh didn't have the money for his \ngold-plated defense, he should not have blown up the building in the \nfirst place.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that there are a number of things we could \ndo, and we need to start fixing a system that is broke. And it is \nbroken bad. We need to change the law that allows criminals to get the \nbest defense that taxpayers can pay for. That is exactly what they are \ngetting. I am going to propose legislation putting a cap on the Federal \nDefender Program.\n  I would like to cap what McVeigh is getting right now. But that will \nbe appealed for years and years. As long as we pay the lawyers, they \nwill keep appealing for Mr. McVeigh. So he will be out there far into \nthe future with the people's money. The $50 million figure will run \ninto $75 million before we get through hearing about him. We need a \ncomprehensive overhaul of the legal system, and it needs to be done by \nnonlawyers. We need to overhaul the legal system and not let a single \nlawyer be involved in the overhaul. We need a national commission \ncomposed of nonlawyers to review the judicial system and provide some \ncommonsense solutions to the problem, and it needs to be made up of \nhomemakers, regular people, business people, truck drivers, and people \nwho would bring some practicality to it and not lawyers who would \ncontinue to feather their own nest.\n\n[[Page S2871]]\n\n  I think we need a victim's rights amendment to our Constitution. Over \nthe last 40 years liberal judges have turned our Constitution into the \n``Criminal Protection Act.'' The purpose of the last 40 years is to \nmake sure that every criminal is coddled, pampered, and looked after in \na very proper manner. It is time for it to stop, and the Constitution \nhas to protect victims as well.\n  Mr. President, I know that many Senators share what I am talking \nabout and are frustrated by what we see. I think we need to start on \nlegal reform, and I think we do need to do it soon.\n  The first thing that will be said is, ``If you start it, the \nPresident will veto it.'' Well, let him veto it. I think the American \npeople need to know where the President stands. So if he wants to veto \nit, let him do it. If the President says that the regular people of \nthis country--or if he chooses sides with Ivy League lawyers that never \ngot a murder case that they couldn't appeal, it is time to bring the \npracticality and the common sense of the American people into the legal \nsystem and take it out of the hands of the lawyers. The very idea of \n$50 million to defend McVeigh--$50 million, 14 lawyers. Anybody who \nwould tell me that that isn't an absolutely out-of-control system \nsimply has lost all common sense themselves.\n  It is time we put an end to it. I intend to introduce legislation \nthat will do so.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to start by using my own 5 \nminutes and at the end of that time go into leader time. If the \nPresiding Officer will indicate to me when I have consumed the 5 \nminutes, I will be grateful for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I rise again today to report to my \ncolleagues on the developing disaster in the State of North Dakota. As \nI reported to my colleagues yesterday, we were hit last weekend with \nthe most powerful winter storm in over 50 years. We are a State that is \naccustomed to tough storms. But, frankly, we have never seen one quite \nlike this. Mr. President, this storm came on top of the worst flooding \nthreat in 150 years. So we have a double whammy of a powerful winter \nstorm, dumping record amounts of snowfall, in addition to an underlying \nthreat of massive flooding, because before this storm hit North Dakota, \nwe were faced with a record snowfall in the State of North Dakota, over \n100 inches of snow, before we got dumped on with another anywhere from \n17 to 24 inches in the eastern part of our State.\n  As the paper of my hometown reported, ``A Doozy of a Record''--record \nsnowfall they are talking about. It is maybe hard to see on the chart \nhere. But what they are showing is a major shopping center. These are \ncars, or I guess more accurately they are the tops of cars. That is how \ndeep the snow was in my hometown.\n  That is not the only place that has been hit. It is across the State \nof North Dakota. This is from the largest city in our State, Fargo, ND. \nThe headline there is ``The Worst of Two Seasons.'' They are talking \nabout the blizzard on top of the flood.\n  Mr. President, this is a truly staggering set of circumstances that \nthe people of my State are having to cope with. Just this morning I was \ncalled by the head of the Corps of Engineers for our district, who \ninformed me that although all of the predictions were dire, they have \nnow become even worse.\n  As of this morning the National Weather Service is telling us that \nthe forecasted crest, instead of being 37\\1/2\\ feet in the city of \nFargo, our major town in North Dakota, it has now been raised to 39 to \n39\\1/2\\. Already we are faced with the worst flood in 150 years. We \nwere told this morning that this is the 500-year flood level. Of \ncourse, the dikes were built to accommodate the earlier projections at \n37\\1/2\\ feet. So the dikes were built to 39\\1/2\\ feet. Now we are told \nthe forecasted crest is 39 to 39\\1/2\\ feet.\n  Mr. President, this could be a calamitous situation. They are telling \nus that the crest will be reached late tomorrow or perhaps early \nFriday.\n  I have talked to the Corps of Engineers. They are working feverishly \nto add to the dikes that have already been constructed not only in \nFargo but right up the Red River Valley--in Harwood and Grand Forks, \nND--to try in a race against the clock to build these dikes high enough \nto protect the people and the property that is around this river.\n  Mr. President, this is the most heavily populated part of my State. \nThe disaster that is unfolding is truly staggering in proportion.\n  Early Saturday 80,000 people were without power, with wind chills of \n40 below zero. Can you imagine being an elderly person in a home being \nfaced with the most powerful winter storm in 50 years without heat? \nThat is what is happening in my State. Although great progress is being \nmade because of a really heroic effort by people to respond, still \ntoday 20,000 people are without power and without heat, most of them \nsince Saturday.\n  Today temperatures outside are hovering near zero in North Dakota, \nand even more threatening, temperatures inside these homes that are \nwithout heat ranging between 30 and 40 degrees. Not only is the human \ncondition being put under great stress but also livestock has been put \nunder grave stress in our State. Thousands of cattle are dead.\n  I was told yesterday of a ranching family that brought 10 of their \ncalves into their home to try to give them protection, and allow them \nto live. All 10 of them died. The cattle were dying because the wind \nwas so ferocious that it blew the snow up into their nostrils and they \nsuffocated. They can't get to many cattle to feed them because of the \nsnowdrifts that are everywhere.\n  Mr. President, I thought I would share with my colleagues just some \nof the individual stories that tell the depths of this tragedy.\n  A young man froze to death in his pickup when it became stranded only \n1 mile from the small town of Lankin, ND.\n  One family that is stranded in its farmhouse due to overland flooding \nis burning its fence posts to keep warm. The water around their house \nwas iced over, so neither emergency vehicles nor boats were able to \nrescue them. Another family was forced to snag logs that drifted by in \nflood waters to heat their home.\n  The Turtle Mountain band of Chippewas has snowdrifts of up to 15 \nfeet. Can you imagine a snowdrift of 15 feet that is blocking \ntransportation? In fact, emergency crews needed 4 hours to get to a man \nwho had a heart attack.\n  A man from Wilton, ND, went on the radio in search of hip-length \nwaders so that he could wade out to rescue 120 sheep that are caught up \nin the flood waters.\n\n  An elderly couple was trapped inside their home due to a 6-inch layer \nof ice that had formed over their doors and windows; trapped in their \nown home because ice had formed around the doors and windows and they \ncould not get out. An emergency rescue team was sent in to rescue them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes are up.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair for informing me. If we could now go on \nwith leader time, I would appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, a family in northeastern North Dakota--two \nparents and their 7-year-old--has been without power since Saturday \nwith snowdrifts trapping them in their home. They had to sleep huddled \nin the hallway to keep warm.\n  Seventy-five people have been stuck in the basement of the Hebron \ncity hall because their cars were pulled off of the major highway going \nby as that road became impassable. Those 75 people have been stuck \nthere since Saturday.\n  Officials in Cass County, the most populous county of our State, are \nhaving difficulty responding to emergency calls because the water \nsurrounding many homes is frozen. So they can't get there by wheel \nvehicles and they can't get there by boat. There is no\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\nway to get to people in order to extricate them.\n  Mr. President, there has been a tremendous response, not only by \nvolunteers in our State but also by the agencies attempting to cope \nwith this disaster.\n  I want today to thank the President for responding so quickly in \ndeclaring our State a Presidentially declared disaster. This is our \nsecond Presidentially declared disaster of this year. We are only in \nthe fourth month of this year. We already had a Presidentially declared \ndisaster because of the record amounts of snowfall. Now on top of that \nwe are anticipating a record flood.\n  These are truly difficult times for our State. Many homes are still \nwithout power. We need generators and fuel to heat homes, make certain \nthat essential services are up and operating. My State needs special \nheavy equipment to clear snow and ice from roads to allow for emergency \naccess.\n  This is a snowfall that is unlike any we have seen because it \nhappened with a freezing rain and then snowfall, and so the snowpack \nthat is there is like concrete. That is what the people who are out \nthere trying to fight this mess are telling us. They have never seen a \nsnowpack like this. We had rain on top of snow, it froze, and it is \nlike concrete trying to break through these incredible snowdrifts.\n  I also want to recognize FEMA and the capable administrator there, \nJames Lee Witt, who is coming to my State tomorrow. FEMA has responded \nmarvelously to the needs in North Dakota. I also wish to thank the \nCorps of Engineers that is involved in a really heroic effort. Some of \nthese people have been working around the clock with no sleep for days \nattempting to build these dikes higher as the flood crest forecasts \nkeep increasing.\n  I just want to say on behalf of the people of my State how much we \nappreciate the extraordinary response of the Corps of Engineers and of \nthe Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  I would also like to thank the president of Manitoba Hydro, Bob \nBrennan. We were alerted by the Governor; they were having trouble \ngetting people across our border. We got the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service to provide an immediate 2-week waiver on all of \ntheir requirements at the border. We talked to Manitoba Hydro and they \ncommitted to sending 100 people to our State to help rebuild the \ntransmission facilities. Now, that is real neighborliness, and we \nappreciate very much that our neighbor to the north has responded in \nthis most generous way of sending 100 people to help us rebuild the \ntransmission facilities in our State.\n  I would also like to thank the Internal Revenue Service. This is \nsomething we rarely do. They have indicated that they would practice \nforbearance on our individual income tax payers in the State of North \nDakota by allowing them to file by May 30 without late payment \npenalties. They will be asked to pay interest on the money during the \nperiod that they would have paid, but they are being given until May \n30. If they file and if they pay by that date, they will not be hit by \nany late-payment penalties. I am told that they are applying this same \nstandard to every State and every county that receives a Presidentially \ndeclared disaster in the face of what is happening in many parts of the \ncountry.\n  We struggle to find good news in all of this, hopeful news. But I can \ntell you there is good news and there is hopeful news, and that is the \nspirit of the people. In North Dakota, we say we have a yes, we can \nattitude, and that is exactly what we have seen in coping with these \ndisasters. As one emergency official said to me, Senator, I have seen \nblizzards; I have seen floods; I have seen power outages, but I have \nnever seen all three together at the same time.\n  That is what we are coping with in North Dakota. I must say that can-\ndo spirit has served us well. Not only do North Dakotans show that \nspirit, but I must say these Federal agencies that have come to help \nare also showing that spirit, and we deeply appreciate it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield back the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2871-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2872-S2873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISASTER RELIEF FOR MINNESOTA\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the President has now declared a major \ndisaster in my home State, Minnesota, and ordered Federal aid to \nsupplement State and local recovery efforts in areas hard hit by severe \nflooding, severe winter storms, snow melt, high winds, rain and ice. \nAnd this all continues. The declaration will make funds available for \ngrants, disaster housing and low-interest loans to cover uninsured \ndamaged property and other aid to help residents, businesses and local \ngovernments cope with ongoing storm and flood damage.\n  I am pleased by the swift action taken by the emergency management \ndivision of the Department of Public Safety in Minnesota. Jim Franklin \nand his hard-working staff, very hard-working staff are to be commended \nfor their efforts. I am very pleased with the action taken by the \nFederal Government as well.\n  I think James Lee Witt is one of the greatest employments ever made \nby any President. He has been so responsive to all of us in this \ncountry when citizens in our States are faced with these very difficult \nand painful crises. I do not think crisis is an exaggeration.\n  I am also really pleased with the way in which SBA, the Small \nBusiness Administration, has been so responsive.\n  Today, I will be requesting $50 million in additional energy \nassistance, the LIHEAP program, to help families who will soon be \nreturning to their homes only to find their heating systems have been \ndamaged. These are individuals with low income, many of them elderly, \nmany of them families with children, who, because of the severe cold we \nhave had all winter, have already had a very difficult time paying \ntheir heating bills. This aid is desperately needed. Many waterways in \nour State are already at record water levels. The Minnesota River is \nthreatening to totally overrun many cities along its border. Record \nflood conditions are being predicted along the Red River, which is \nexpected to crest within the next few days.\n  Along the Red River there are still ice and snowpacks which will be \nmelting in the coming days and weeks, further threatening communities \nalready under siege in northwestern Minnesota, and flood conditions \ncontinue to build along the Mississippi River as well, cresting any day \nnow.\n  Some communities have already been hit and are under water and ice. \nIn the town of Ada, nearly all the 1,000 residents have been forced to \nevacuate, including residents of a nursing home who had to be rescued \nby the National Guard. And, thank you, National Guard, for all of your \nfine work. Many of these people had little or no time to pack their \nbelongings before fleeing. And when they return, little will likely be \nsalvageable.\n  In Appleton, ice floe broke through the levee, and the river now has \nsurged 21.5 feet in one-half hour, forcing a massive volunteer effort \nto halt the flow of surging water and further prevent housing damage. \nThe Pomme de Terre River--let me repeat that--has surged 21.5 feet in \njust one-half hour.\n  The record flooding and cold temperatures have had a major impact on \nMinnesota. There have been widespread power outages throughout parts of \nthe State, and with the flooding and the cold, emergency repair crews \nare unable to get to the affected areas. Many farmers are having \ntrouble farming, and it is going to be a very, very difficult spring \nplanting season.\n  I am very pleased, again, that FEMA Director James Lee Witt has done \nso much and will be coming to Minnesota to see firsthand the \ndevastation. I believe he will be coming to South Dakota and North \nDakota as well. As a Senator from Minnesota, I express my sympathy to \nSenators from the Dakotas. Of course, we will all work together.\n  I have been touched by the sense of community among many people in \nMinnesota. Many folks do not care who they are working next to as long \nas\n\n[[Page S2873]]\n\nthey are working for their communities. People are working tirelessly, \naround the clock, to hold back the river. Neighbors are standing \nshoulder to shoulder, sandbagging. Volunteers are tirelessly serving \nsandwiches and hot coffee at fire stations.\n  When I was in Montevideo last week, it was just amazing. People who \nlive on the high ground, they don't ever have to worry about the flood; \nthey are out there, I mean really working to the point of exhaustion, \nsandbagging for others. High school students, I say to the pages, have \nvolunteered their time, and they are doing a great job. That is the \ngood news. The good news is the goodness of people in Minnesota. The \ngood news is all the ways in which people are working together--I might \nadd, to my colleagues, Democrats, Republicans, and others. The good \nnews is the voluntarism of young people. The bad news is that in all \ntoo many communities, it really looks like a war zone.\n  The weeks and months ahead will include many more hours of hard work, \ncleanup, removal of sandbags, restoration of buildings, and ensuring \nthat water supplies are not contaminated. People need not only the \nsupport of their neighbors, they need the support that only the Federal \nGovernment can provide.\n  It is interesting. Colleagues, Republicans and Democrats from other \nStates, during the years I have been here in the Senate, have come to \nthe floor and spoken about what citizens in their States have been \nconfronted with. I think all of us are sympathetic and all of us try to \nprovide the support.\n  I thank President Clinton for his very prompt response. I thank my \ncolleagues in advance for the support I know they will give. I thank \ncolleagues who have come up to me in the last couple of days and have \nasked me, how are people doing? What can we do to help? I am really \nproud--it is not a politician speaking--I am just really proud of \npeople in Minnesota. I wish people did not have to go through this. I \nam emotional about it. I am really emotional about it. I just wish this \nwas not happening, but it is, and it is so important that all of us at \nthe Federal level try to provide assistance to people in communities \nnot just in Minnesota but around the country when they are faced with \nthese kinds of disasters. This really is a disaster.\n  I look forward to getting back home as soon as possible this weekend. \nI look forward to James Lee Witt and others coming to visit Minnesota, \nNorth and South Dakota, and other States that are going to need the \nhelp. People really need the help. People really need the help, and we \nhave to make sure we provide it.\n\n  I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2872-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2873-S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE FTC CASE AGAINST JOE CAMEL\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced the Tobacco \nDisclosure and Warning Act. This bill will require tobacco companies to \ndisclose the ingredients, including the carcinogens, that exist in \ncigarettes. Cigarettes are the only consumable product in America \ntoday, the only one, whose ingredients are not disclosed. All kinds of \nfood products list all of the ingredients very specifically. I think it \nis wrong. The public should know what is in the cigarettes. We work \nhard and invest a lot of resources to stop our kids from doing things \nlike eating lead-based paint or drinking water with lead. We should not \nlet them smoke it.\n  This bill would also require large, blunt and centrally placed health \nwarnings on cigarette packs of the types used in other countries. I \nlook at this one, which is done in Canada. Very clearly, on the black \nportion here, it says, ``Smoking can kill you.'' It is also printed in \nFrench to make sure that people understand the threat to their health \nwhen they take up smoking.\n  I want to particularly focus on the issue, now, of tobacco \nadvertising and direct it towards the industry's use of Joe Camel. As \nyou know, the Federal Trade Commission has jurisdiction over the \nfairness and truthfulness of advertising. Today, I am sending a letter \nto the Chairman of the FTC, Robert Pitofsky, encouraging the Commission \nto bring a case against R.J. Reynolds for unfair advertising because of \nits portrayal of Joe Camel in its advertising campaign. I am joined by \nSenators Durbin, Kennedy, Harkin, Wellstone, Wyden and Murray.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Robert Pitofsky,\n     Chairman Federal Trade Commission,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Pitofsky: We are writing to you today to \n     encourage you to reopen an unfair advertising case against \n     the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company for marketing cigarettes to \n     children. The company's Joe Camel campaign is an outrageous \n     attempt to attract children to their product--a product that \n     is illegal for children to purchase.\n       Numerous new facts have been uncovered about the tobacco \n     industry's marketing efforts since the Commission's 1994 \n     decision not to bring such a case against R.J. Reynolds. The \n     most recent development was the Liggett Group's admission \n     that the tobacco industry does in fact target children in its \n     marketing efforts.\n       In addition, the Food and Drug Administration has collected \n     R.J. Reynolds documents that evidence a company policy to \n     appeal to ``presmokers'' and ``learners'' ages 14 to 18. A \n     1993 company study indicated that 86% of children age 10 to \n     17 recognized the image of Joe Camel, and 95% of those \n     children knew that Joe Camel sold cigarettes. Since Joe Camel \n     was introduced, Camel brand's youth market share has jumped \n     from less than 3 percent to as high as 16 percent.\n       For these reasons, we believe it is time for the FTC to \n     step in to protect our nation's children from a product that \n     kills one-third of its users. While tobacco companies have a \n     right to advertise their product to adults, the peddling of \n     illegal drugs to children cannot be tolerated.\n           Sincerely,\n     Frank R. Lautenberg,\n     Richard J. Durbin,\n     Paul Wellstone,\n     Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Ron Wyden,\n     Tom Harkin,\n     Patty Murray.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the letter simply asks the Chairman of \nthe FTC to revisit this case, because we believe that R.J. Reynolds is \nintentionally advertising a product to children which is illegal to \nsell to them. In 1994, the FTC voted 3 to 2 against bringing such a \ncase against R.J. Reynolds. At that time, the Commission cited a lack \nof evidence. But since then, dramatic new evidence, new material has \nbecome public. Last year, 67 Members of the House wrote a letter asking \nthe FTC to reopen the investigation. The FTC staff has recommended that \nthe Chairman do just that, and he will be making a decision over the \ncoming weeks.\n  Mr. President, Joe Camel is a prime example of advertising that ought \nto be stopped. If Joe Camel were real and smoked as much as he does in \nhis ads, he would be a dead camel. He would have bit the dust from \nemphysema, lung cancer, and heart disease.\n  The R.J. Reynolds company promotes the line of cigarettes with a \ncartoon character that is named ``Joe Camel.'' This character is seen \nin the advertisements promoting a ``cool'' and ``smooth'' image. He is \noften seen holding a cigarette out to the viewer of the ad. A picture I \nnoticed most recently is he is in a beach chair someplace where the \nsand is nice and white and fresh, and he is sitting there.\n  Why would a tobacco company use a cartoon character to market its \nproduct? It does not seem like a cartoon is the best way to appeal to \nadult smokers. R.J. Reynolds claims it is marketing to adults with Joe \nCamel. It is hard to believe.\n  An article published in the Journal of the American Medical \nAssociation revealed that 6-year-olds--6-year-olds--were as familiar \nwith Joe Camel as they were with Mickey Mouse. The Disney company has \nspent decades and a great deal of effort promoting Mickey Mouse, and if \nR.J. Reynolds is not marketing to kids, then it has pulled off perhaps \nthe most successful accidental promotional job in mass media history.\n  I want to be clear, I do not think that children are being drawn to \nJoe Camel\n\n[[Page S2874]]\n\nby accident. The truth is that R.J. Reynolds is marketing its deadly \nproduct to children.\n  In preparation for its rule designed to decrease teenage smoking, the \nFood and Drug Administration collected documents that show that R.J. \nReynolds targeted what it calls presmokers, identified as children as \nyoung as 14. A 1993 R.J. Reynolds document boasted that 86 percent of \nchildren age 10 to 17 recognize the image of Joe Camel and 95 percent \nof them knew Joe Camel sold cigarettes.\n  The most telling statistic is that since Joe Camel was introduced, \nCamel's share of the youth cigarette market has jumped from 3 percent \nto as high as 16 percent. Despite this criticism, R.J. Reynolds \nrecently decided to engage in even more egregious behavior. It is now \ntargeting kids based not only on age but race as well.\n  Mr. President, despite the rising rates of teenage smoking overall, \nAfrican-American children have bucked the trend. How has the tobacco \nindustry responded? It seems that R.J. Reynolds has decided that since \nits current marketing tactics are not working, it ought to target \nspecific groups of children, particularly African-American children. \nNot only have they targeted those children, but it is promoting a line \nof camels even more deadly than its standard cigarettes.\n  Recently, R.J. Reynolds introduced a product called Camel Menthols. \nMenthols are a particularly dangerous type of cigarette. The menthol \ncools the smoke so that it can be ingested deeper into the lungs. \nUnfortunately, menthols are very popular in the African-American adult \ncommunity. Critics are now charging that this line of Camel Menthols is \ndesigned specifically to appeal to African-American teens. In fact, it \nhas been shown that R.J. Reynolds has revamped the Joe Camel image for \nCamel Menthols ads to make the character more appealing to African-\nAmerican teenagers.\n  I consider R.J. Reynolds' corporate behavior inappropriate, and I \nhope that the FTC will take steps to end this advertising aimed at our \nkids, or any advertising aimed at our kids, because no parent, no \nguardian in good conscience could say to a child, ``Listen, here's some \nlead, here's some benzene, here's some arsenic, here's some chromium. \nIf you feel like having a little bit of it, take it.'' Your conscience \nwould never permit it, and the law would probably incarcerate you for \nendangering the health of a child. But here we have this advertising of \na product that carries all of these elements in them.\n  I have asked in this bill that was introduced yesterday to make sure \nall 43 carcinogens that are used in tobacco products are clearly \nidentified and that people are conscious of the fact that smoking may \ntaste good, but once they try it, they live with it for as short a \nperiod as their life will be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2873-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE LIFE OF TIM HAGAN\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today in my hometown of Mexico, MO, a very \ndear lifelong friend, Tim Hagan, will be buried. Lowell Lambert ``Tim'' \nHagan, III, owner of Hagan Clothing Co., died Sunday after a long \nbattle with cancer, and will be sadly missed by his family and all of \nus who were privileged to be counted among his friends.\n  Tim was a tremendous businessman and community leader. Born and \nraised in Mexico, MO, Tim developed a lifelong reputation as ``doer''. \nHe successfully ran the family clothing business, and was involved in \nnumerous community organizations, including the Rotary Club, the Mexico \nChamber of Commerce, and the Mexico Country Club. Out of compassion for \nthose less fortunate, he was the former president of the Audrain County \nCerebral Palsy Society, and for 6 years was chairman of the Missouri \nNational Multiple Sclerosis Hope Chest Campaign.\n  Because of his understanding of the daily challenges small business \nowners face, Tim was chosen to be part of the Missouri delegation for \nthe White House Conference on Small Business in 1995. That conference \nwas one of the most successful in history, in that some of the ideas \ngenerated by Tim and others to create small business jobs and \nopportunities have been acted on by Congress and many others are now \nbeing discussed.\n  Tim also felt that the education of our children and youth was \nparticularly important to securing a good future, and was instrumental \nin bringing the Technical College to Mexico. That contribution will \nbenefit the youth of Audrain County for years to come. His presence and \nspirit in the community will also continue to be felt for many years in \nthat his own son, John, will continue to run the fourth generation \nfamily business.\n  Tim shared with his friends a love of his Irish ancestry, though his \nlove was more frequently and forcefully expressed as a lifelong \nDemocrat. Even in the last days of his illness, he and I engaged in \nmany spirited, but good natured political debates.\n  Our culture is quick to glorify the here and now, the ``flash in the \npan'' celebrities, the ``cause'' of the day. By that measure, Tim Hagan \nstood apart. While he was known in the community as a ``feisty \nIrishman'' with unfailing energy, he was also a builder. He spent his \nentire life making life better for his family, his employees, his \nchurch, and his community. His love for others knew no racial or social \nboundaries. We will miss him terribly.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial by Joe A. May in \nyesterday's Mexico Ledger be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Mexico Ledger, Apr. 8, 1997]\n\n                      Memories of a Courageous Man\n\n       One measure of a man's life is how much he's missed once he \n     is gone. The death of Tim Hagan Sunday has left a void in \n     this community as immense as the spirit with which he moved \n     through this world.\n       Tim excelled as a husband, father and businessman, but \n     somehow that was expected. Those who had the pleasure of his \n     acquaintance knew he was incapable of offering anything less \n     than the best.\n       Through his work and volunteerism Tim touched many lives \n     and those of us who knew him will always treasure our \n     favorite memories.\n       Some may remember the third-generation clothier's innate \n     touch of class.\n       Some will remember the Mexico native's dedication to civic \n     projects that have improved our city.\n       Some will remember the gregarious Irishman and his \n     unflagging enthusiasm for the sports teams of his alma mater, \n     Notre Dame.\n       Some will remember the dedicated golfer and his exploits on \n     the greens or his stories of the game that time and blarney \n     could always improve.\n       As for me, I will remember Tim's friendship, his humor, his \n     generosity, his gift for lightening the burdens of others.\n       But all of us can share the memory of Tim's determination. \n     He had battled cancer since 1990. The faith, conviction and \n     love for family he demonstrated during that fight should \n     serve as an inspiration. Even on the most trying of days, his \n     attitude remained positive, his smile present.\n       His courage to the end provided the best testimony to the \n     man, his spirit and the life he spent among us.\n       He died as he lived--a feisty Irishman.\n       Goodbye, my friend. I will miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2874-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2874-S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RETIREMENT OF DR. JOHN B. BEGLEY\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to pay \ntribute to a man who simply could not have worked any harder on behalf \nof the Kentucky college he has represented for the past 20 years.\n  A native of Harrodsburg, KY, Dr. John Begley returned to Kentucky in \n1977 as head of Lindsey Wilson College in Columbia. It's hard to \nbelieve that the school John leaves today is the same one he came to 20 \nyears ago.\n  Back then, Lindsey was just another struggling junior college. Today, \nit's the fastest growing liberal arts college in Kentucky. Back then, \nenrollment hovered around 222 students. Today, 1,372 students look to \nLindsey for the tools to shape their futures. Back then, the school \noperated on a $600,000 a year budget and took in no more than $50,000 a \nyear in donations. Today, Lindsey has a $14 million budget, pulls in \n$1.3 million annually in donations and raised $18 million in a 5-year \ncapital campaign.\n  But perhaps most remarkable is that under John's leadership, the \ncollege has in no way sacrificed quality. Instead, they have strived \nfor, and by all accounts achieved excellence.\n  In addition to 15 baccalaureate majors, the college instituted a \nmasters in counseling and human development. Within just 2 years, the \naccrediting arm of the American Counseling Association ranked the \nmasters program as one of the top 12 counseling programs in the Nation.\n\n[[Page S2875]]\n\n  In an area of the State struggling for economic advancement, John \nmade sure the college met the unique needs of Appalachian families. \nThat meant making sure the college was readily accessible to area \nresidents looking for the resources they needed to better their lives. \nWith eight satellite branches, south central Kentuckians of all ages \nand from all walks of life can take advantage of the educational and \njob training opportunities at Lindsey.\n  In addition to academic excellence and steady financial growth, John \nalways looked toward improving the quality of student life. One way he \ndid that was through athletics. With 14 athletic teams and a men's \nsoccer team that has won back to back NAIA national championships--the \nfirst Kentucky college to do so in 45 years--the college has struck an \nimportant balance between excellence in academics and student life.\n  Clearly, John's successes came with the help of hundreds of hard \nworking colleagues, a community receptive to the college's needs, and a \nstudent body that took pride in their college's successes. But there \ncan be no doubt that John's leadership pulled those forces together and \ncreated something really wonderful--something all Kentuckians can look \non with pride.\n  Mr. President, I know I am not alone in wanting to thank John for \nleaving the college not only with a firm foundation from which to keep \nbuilding, but a standard of excellence that will serve generations of \nstudents and faculty for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2874-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE MINNESOTA FLOODS OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I just want to take a few minutes today to \ndiscuss the devastating floods that are paralyzing much of my home \nState of Minnesota. Most of the Nation knows we are experiencing some \nof the worst flooding in our history this week, and due to the severe \nsnowfall of this past winter, damage is expected to surpass that of the \ndisastrous 1993 floods.\n  Not only are Minnesotans fighting against the rising floodwaters, but \nthey are doing it in the wake of a blizzard that brought snow, ice, and \nbitterly cold temperatures to our State this weekend, as well. It has \ntruly been an ordeal--my heart goes out to those who are working \ndesperately to save their homes and land, and my thanks go to the \nthousands of Minnesotans who have stepped forward this week to help \ntheir friends, families, and neighbors. It is reassuring to know that \nour communities share a collective heart, and can be counted upon to \ncome together during tough times.\n  Now that President Clinton has approved our request that Minnesota be \ndeclared a disaster area, Federal money for flood victims is available \nin 21 Minnesota counties. That will enable cleanup efforts to get \nunderway, and help families and individuals whose homes and property \nhave been damaged or destroyed.\n  As of this past Monday, Minnesota Gov. Arne Carlson had activated \nmore than 1,000 of the state's 11,000 National Guard troops to assist \nwith sandbagging, emergency evacuation, and other flood-related duties. \nThe Guard has been tireless in their desire to help and we thank them \nfor that as well.\n  The disastrous floods have severely disrupted the lives of many, many \nMinnesotans, whose primary concern now is to ensure that their families \nand communities are safe, with adequate food and shelter. That being \nthe case, I have requested that Commissioner Richardson of the Internal \nRevenue Service extend the tax filing deadline for those taxpayers \nliving within the disaster area. Considering the many challenges \nMinnesotans will face in the next few weeks, cleaning up and rebuilding \ntheir lives and communities, extending the April 15 deadline is \ncrucial. I hope Commissioner Richardson will act immediately to grant \nthe extension.\n\n  Mr. President, we are used to harsh winters in Minnesota, but even we \nMinnesotans have never seen anything like this. Earlier this winter, \nheavy snows resulted in a Presidential disaster declaration for snow \nremoval in 55 Minnesota counties. That rapidly melting snow has now \ncaused extensive flooding on virtually every river and tributary in the \nState. This past weekend, the situation was compounded when Minnesota \nwas hit by a combination ice storm and blizzard. Freezing rain and snow \ndowned countless utility lines in northwestern Minnesota, leaving more \nthan 50,000 residents without power. Some power has been restored, but \nit is estimated that other areas may be without power for another 7 \ndays before repairs can be completed. The weekend storm, along with the \nsevere snows of this past winter, will make flooding this spring some \nof the worst in our history.\n  For communities along the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers east and \nsouth of Montevideo and south of Anoka, which includes the Twin Cities \nmetro area, the worst flooding is on the way and record and near-record \ncrests are expected there. The same is true along the north-flowing Red \nRiver along the Minnesota-North Dakota border. In Ada, in the State's \nnorthwestern corner, three-quarters of the town's 1,700 residents have \nbeen evacuated from their homes.\n  The flooding has been an exhausting nightmare for those who are in \nit, and agonizing for the rest of the Nation to watch. Yet, we have \nbeen inspired once again by the people of Minnesota, who have rallied \ntogether for their communities as they always do when tragedy strikes.\n  Young and old are working side by side to save their communities, \nfilling and hauling sandbags, feeding those who have lost their homes \nand finding them shelter, and making sure the volunteers are well cared \nfor. I read the comments of Marvin Patten of Granite Falls, who does \nnot have flood insurance and whose living room is flooded under 18 \ninches of water. He said, ``At first I sat and cried, but after a few \ndays you realize that we will manage.''\n  Shortly after the mayor of Granite Falls pleaded for sandbagging \nvolunteers, he told a reporter that ``everybody in town showed up. Just \nlike that. Amazing. I am stupefied.'' Now, as I read comments like \nthose and speak with Minnesotans who live in the flooded areas, I \ncannot help but think it is during critical times such as these that we \nfinally understand the importance of community, of neighbor helping \nneighbor. Those are the qualities that make us Minnesotans.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank God for the mercy he has \ngranted and the blessings he has bestowed upon our families and \ncommunities. It is within His strength that we find our own.\n  Mr. President, I heard the remarks of my colleague from Minnesota \nearlier this afternoon, and I appreciate his words and his efforts on \nbehalf of the people of our State.\n  We stand together with our colleagues from North and South Dakota, \nwho are facing devastation in their States equal to our own. When \ndisaster strikes, we are not Republicans or Democrats. We are \nrepresentatives of the people, and we will do whatever we must to \nprotect our citizens when their lives, homes, and property are \nthreatened.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2875-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I want to recognize the \nachievement and success of the University of Tennessee's Women's \nBasketball Team in winning the 1997 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball \nChampionship.\n  Under the outstanding leadership of coach Pat Summitt, the Lady \nVolunteers have taken home the championship trophy 2 years in a row. \nThese are the first back-to-back championships in 13 years, and we \ncouldn't be any prouder back home in Tennessee.\n  Throughout the season, the Lady Volunteers had their share both of \ntough games and exciting wins. But they proved their talent and skill \nin the end with their victory in the NCAA tournament.\n  Women's basketball has become a tradition in Tennessee, and those of \nus who are fans have grown accustomed to great performances on the \ncourt. Over the years, the University of Tennessee's Women's Basketball \nprogram has attracted some of the most outstanding scholar-athletes in \nthe nation, and in doing so it provides one of the most notable \nexamples of sports excellence and academic superiority to be found \nanywhere.\n  Coach Pat Summitt and her tremendous staff deserve special credit. \nWith this victory, Pat takes the fifth NCAA title of her career, \nplacing her behind only the great coach John Wooden in the championship \ntally. Pat has achieved a real milestone in winning 5 trophies in just \n11 seasons. She's been in charge of the team for 22 years now, starting \nwhen she was a graduate student, and only 1 year older than some of her \nplayers. Today, the program she worked to build and maintain has helped \nset the standard for many other successful athletic efforts in other \nuniversities, and women's college basketball is a national phenomenon.\n  In a word, Pat is a trailblazer. She has helped raise the profile of \nthe exciting sport of women's college basketball, and she's created a \nlot of new fans.\n  This championship season at UT will be remembered for a lot of \nthings, but most notably I believe we'll look back at the heart and the \ndetermination that led these women through to victory. The people of \nTennessee, fans and UT alumni who live across the country and around \nthe world are proud of this exceptional achievement.\n  When the UT Women cut down the nets in Cincinnati, they took home the \nmemory of a hard-fought victory across a dramatic 5-month season. In a \nteam loaded up with talent, the members came together for the effort it \ntook to bring home the trophy. With a record of 29 wins and 10 losses, \nthe Tennessee Lady Vols came through in the clinch. They surprised \nthose who counted them out. In the end, they won the final game 68-59, \nleading for the entire first half in the game against Old Dominion and \nkeeping up the pressure in the second half.\n  All the loyal fans of the University of Tennessee and all those who \nenjoy women's basketball have had the privilege of enjoying this \nfantastic season in a string of fantastic seasons. And with the young \nteam and the new recruits, there's sure to be more excitement on the \nway in the coming years. What a great achievement this is by an \noutstanding group of athletes and coaches. Congratulations to the \nUniversity of Tennessee Lady Vols--the 1997 NCAA champions.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2876-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ALLARD.

Mr. President, during my campaign for the U.S. Senate, I \nexpressed the themes of balancing the budget, congressional reform, \nmaking Government smaller, and moving the power out of Washington and \nto the States and localities. This is why I am proud to introduce \nSenate bill 519, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation \nTermination Act, better known as the OPIC Termination Act.\n  As a Member of the other body during the 104th Congress, I voted to \nreform the welfare system of this country. I voted to end the subsidies \nfor farmers. And now I believe it is time to end this form of corporate \nwelfare for large companies.\n  I have never believed in give-away programs. Whether you are a farmer \nor a large corporate owner, you should play by the rules of the free \nmarket system. ``Less Government'' should be the motto of this \nCongress.\n  OPIC is a Government agency which was established in 1969 and is now \nactive in 144 countries. It finances investments for American Fortune \n500 companies through direct loans, subsidized loan programs, and \ninsures them against political risk, expropriation and political \nviolence. It entices companies to enter into risky transactions from \nwhich private lenders shy away.\n  This private activity may seem to have a good end goal, but the \nproblem is not the end but the means. Basically, this is an insurance \nprogram run by the Federal Government for corporations who want to \ninvest in risky political situations. In short, we are running an \ninsurance program for major corporations.\n  What makes this even more problematic is that OPIC does not back this \ninvestment with their own finances, but with the full faith and credit \nof the U.S. Government--in its simplest terms, the U.S. taxpayer. Every \nloan and loan guarantee that OPIC finances puts the U.S. taxpayer at \nrisk. Today, nearly $25 billion is being risked in the name of the \ntaxpayers of these corporate OPIC loans.\n  Compounding the situation is that these loans and loan guarantees are \nnot safe investments. The Congressional Budget Office supplied a list \nof the quality of the portfolio at the end of the year, 1995. OPIC has \nconsistently taken risks in operations that are defined with the D-\nminus credit rating and even an F-double-negative credit rating.\n  As a member of the Banking Committee, I can assure you that if the \nU.S. taxpayer goes into a bank to get a loan to buy a house and they \nhave an F-double-negative credit rating, the bank will ask you to \nplease leave the building. But the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation does it every year, and with the hard-working taxpayers' \nmoney, dollars backing these loans. So the same taxpayer who can never \nhave a chance to secure a loan with this rating is securing loans for \nprojects with the same kind of credit rating.\n  The simple fact is subsidies have shown that this portfolio is so \nrisky you cannot even privatize OPIC because no buyer could risk losing \nbillions of dollars if these loans go bad. Proponents of OPIC state \nthat no loan or loan guarantee has gone bad and this is not risky.\n  If this scenario sounds familiar, it is because we have seen it \nbefore. In the late 1980's, the same claims were made by the Federal \nSavings and Loan Insurance Corporation, at least until the crisis hit. \nOne decade and $180 billion in taxpayer bailout dollars later, we found \nthis was not the case. It has been said that if we do not learn from \nthe past, we will ultimately repeat it. If we do repeat history, it \nwill again be the\n\n[[Page S2877]]\n\nfarmer in Sterling, the technician in Denver, and the accountant in \nGrand Junction who picks up the bill. I have learned from the past, and \nI do not want my children and grandchildren to suffer through another \ncorporate bailout.\n\n  Who gets these loans? Coca-Cola, DuPont, Union Carbide, McDonald's, \nand even two banks, Chase Manhattan and Citicorp. These, and many other \nlarge companies with OPIC loans, are not cash-starved companies, but \ncompanies with strong bottom lines. I do not believe the Federal \nGovernment should be in the business of business, and I do believe \nthese companies can stay strong and survive without OPIC. As in life, \nif the risk is too high, then maybe you should look elsewhere.\n  What do OPIC loans buy? We, the taxpayers, have developed a soft \ndrink bottling company in Poland and Ghana, a travel agency in Armenia, \na magazine in Russia, a lumber mill in Lithuania, an art gallery in \nHaiti, cable television in Argentina, a hamburger bun bakery and phone \nbook directories in Brazil.\n  Now, there may be some worthwhile projects and successes funded by \nOPIC, but, again, I do not believe that we need to be risking hard-\nworking taxpayer money on these ventures. Plus, this is a subsidy that \ndoes not get built into the cost of a product which may compete against \nAmerican products that are not subsidized.\n  Also, proponents of OPIC believe that if OPIC does not provide this \ninsurance, then companies will not enter these risky markets. There are \ncertainly private alternatives to OPIC's activities and one is starting \ninvestment funds for developing countries. Today, there are hundreds of \nprivate developing country investment funds. Portfolio money is flowing \ninto all parts of the developing world. If interested, they are listed \non the New York Stock Exchange. Even the proponents cannot deny the \nexistence of those private alternatives or that they may be available \nat lower cost. However, it seems they know a good deal when they see \none. With OPIC selling the full faith and credit of the U.S. taxpayer, \nforeign governments would be less likely to stick them with the bill.\n  Again, here lies the problem. These subsidized loans to promote trade \nand investment abroad distort the flow of capital and resources away \nfrom the most efficient uses, thus distorting trade and investment \nabroad. OPIC's impact on U.S. capital and resource markets may be \nnegative due to these distortionary effects of subsidized loans. In \nlayman's terms, OPIC distorts the marketplace, pushing out private \ninvestment, and does not allow it to grow.\n  This leads to the question, ``Is this the appropriate role for \nGovernment?'' What we are doing with OPIC is investing money in \ncountries involving risky business deals. We are trying to help other \ncountries' government-run corporations make the transition to the \nprivate sector. To do that, we run a Government corporation. Thus, we \nare trying to end other countries' government subsidies by running \nGovernment subsidies right here in Washington. This is not moving the \npower away from Washington, but right into the heart of DC.\n  I am not the only one saying that it is time for OPIC to go. In the \nother body, Representatives Andrews, Kasich, Sanders, Royce, Condit, \nDeFazio, Klug, Peterson, Shadegg, Jackson, Pascrell, and Dickey have \nintroduced H.R. 387 eliminating OPIC.\n  Also, the National Taxpayers Union says few other Federal programs \ncombine such undesirable elements as corporate welfare, wasteful \nspending, unnecessary foreign aid, mismanagement and risk to the \nAmerican taxpayers as the Overseas Private Investment Corporation.\n  Milton Friedman, one of the leading experts of economics from the \nChicago School of Economics, said he does not see any redeeming aspects \nin the existence of OPIC. It is special interest legislation of the \nworst kind.\n  This leads me to another important reason why OPIC should be \neliminated.\n  It seems to me that OPIC may be used as a political slush fund. \nWhether this is a perception or truth, I believe it is time to end this \nperception of impropriety.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na story from the Boston Globe dated Sunday, March 30, 1997.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Globe, Mar. 30, 1997]\n\n    Trade Trip Firms Netted $5.5b in Aid Donated $2.3m to Democrats\n\n                            (By Bob Hohler)\n\n       Washington.--Businesses that gave Democratic Party \n     committees more than $2.3 million and won coveted seats on US \n     trade missions during President Clinton's first term secured \n     nearly $5.5 billion to support their foreign business \n     operations from a federal investment agency.\n       In all, 27 corporations that sent executives on trade trips \n     with the late Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown obtained \n     part of a multibillion-dollar commitment in federally \n     guaranteed assistance from the Overseas Private Investment \n     Corp., according to a Globe analysis of fund-raising records, \n     trip manifests, and OPIC documents.\n       All but three of the 27 OPIC recipients donated to \n     Democratic Party committees, and most of them gave between \n     $50,000 and $358,000 during Clinton's first term.\n       While the Globe reported last month that Brown's trade \n     trips were a fund-raising bonanza for the Democratic Party, \n     what has previously gone unnoticed is the massive amount of \n     OPIC support given to companies that traveled with Brown and \n     donated money to the Democrats.\n       OPIC provides financing and political risk insurance that \n     many US businesses consider essential to expanding into \n     unstable or developing democracies. The Clinton \n     administration, with Brown coordinating much of the effort, \n     relied heavily on the federally funded corporation to boost \n     US exports and to create jobs through private investment \n     abroad.\n       No one has alleged that government officials arranged the \n     OPIC support in exchange for political donations, which would \n     violate federal law. But federal and congressional \n     investigators are examining whether Democratic Party leaders \n     pursued a reelection plan based in part on providing perks \n     such as seats on Brown's missions to major business donors, \n     many of whom stood to gain from government actions.\n       Many of the businesses that sent executives on Brown's \n     missions gave to the Republican Party, though generally less \n     than they donated to the Democrats. And several advocates for \n     campaign finance reform said regardless of the Democrats' \n     campaign strategy, the OPIC support that went to major donors \n     on Brown's missions created the perception that corporate \n     givers got what they wanted.\n       The average company contribution to Democratic committees \n     from OPIC recipients on Brown's trips was nearly $95,000. The \n     average support from the agency for the 27 recipients was \n     about $200 million per company.\n       Bill Hogan, director of investigative projects for the \n     Center for Public Integrity, said there were three ways to \n     look at the Brown trips, agency assistance, and donations to \n     Democratic committees.\n       ``One is that it was a happy accident,'' Hogan said. \n     ``Another is that the donations were an unbelievable \n     investment. And the third is that the companies would have \n     gotten the assistance anyway, and they just made nice, \n     spontaneous thank-you gifts to the party.''\n       OPIC spokeswoman Allison May Rosen said agency officials \n     ``may not have known'' that companies applying for assistance \n     had contributed to Democratic committees or sent executives \n     on missions with Brown.\n       Rosen said Brown and other administration officials may \n     also have discussed particular projects with OPIC staff, \n     including the agency's president, Ruth R. Harkin, the wife of \n     Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa.\n       During much of Clinton's first term, one of Brown's top \n     associates, Jeffrey E. Garten, then undersecretary for \n     international trade, served on OPIC's board of directors.\n       In addition, Brown attended several signing ceremonies for \n     OPIC-supported projects, including a 1995 event with \n     Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat for a bottled-water \n     operation in the West Bank and Gaza involving Culligan Water \n     Technologies Inc. of Illinois.\n       Rosen said OPIC awards corporate support solely on the \n     basis of a professional review process geared to ``using our \n     limited resources in a careful and prudent manner.''\n       Much of the OPIC support for participants on Brown's \n     missions was granted while the agency experienced what Harkin \n     described to a House panel last year as ``an unprecedented \n     demand for services.'' But even in such a competitive \n     climate, partisan political considerations have never \n     affected a decision on granting OPIC support, according to \n     Rosen.\n       ``It's not in our world,'' she said.\n       Brown, widely regarded to have been the Clinton \n     administration's most aggressive advocate for US businesses \n     abroad, died with 34 other people when the Air Force plane \n     carrying them on a trade mission to Bosnia crashed into a \n     mountainside in Croatia on April 3, 1996. Four of the victims \n     were executives with companies that had received OPIC \n     support: AT, Bechtel Corp., Foster Wheeler Corp., and Harza \n     Engineering Co.\n       Commerce spokesman Jim Dessler said it was ``natural that \n     there is a correlation between Commerce trade missions, which \n     focus\n\n[[Page S2878]]\n\n     on emerging markets, and OPIC financing, which deals with \n     investments in developing markets.''\n       But Dessler said Commerce officials exerted no influence on \n     the OPIC staff on behalf of trade mission participants or \n     Democratic donors. ``Absolutely none,'' he said.\n       OPIC, whose federal funding is under fire from some \n     lawmakers who consider it ``corporate welfare,'' provides \n     insurance and loan guarantees generally not available in the \n     commercial market because of risks involved. Corporate \n     recipients pay high insurance premiums and substantial loan \n     interest, which has helped OPIC turn a profit every year \n     since it was founded in 1971.\n       The agency received $104 million in federal funds last year \n     and returned $209 million to the Treasury.\n       Companies that went on Brown's trade missions received \n     nearly 14 percent of OPIC's total financial commitment of \n     $40.6 billion from 1993 to 1996, which included $34.5 billion \n     in political risk insurance and $6.1 billion in financing.\n       The businesses on Brown's missions received about $3.5 \n     billion in risk insurance and $2 billion in financing.\n       Among the companies that traveled with Brown, OPIC \n     supported projects ranging from Pepsi Cola bottling in Poland \n     to rocket engine development in Russia to cellular phone \n     systems in Argentina, Hungary, India, and Nicaragua.\n       The only Massachusetts company among the OPIC recipients \n     was State Street Bank and Trust Co., which sent an executive \n     to a trade summit with Brown in Amman, Jordan, in 1995. State \n     Street gave $20,500 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign \n     Committee in 1995 and 1996, and $10,000 to the Democratic \n     National Committee in 1996.\n       OPIC, in fiscal 1996, provided State Street a $54 million \n     insurance policy on the company's investment in a Brazil \n     manufacturing project.\n       Kari Murphy, a spokeswoman for State Street, said the \n     company has complied with its policy of taking ``an active \n     role in the governmental process as a good corporate \n     citizen.'' She said that includes obeying ``the letter and \n     spirit of all campaign finance and contribution laws.''\n       As for the Brown mission, which preceded State Street's \n     OPIC assistance, Murphy said, ``Neither then nor later did \n     State Street or any of our officers seek favorable treatment \n     from public officials or government agencies or make any \n     political contributions in connection with the trip.''\n       Of the other companies represented on Brown's missions, \n     OPIC gave the bulk of its support--$1.62 billion--to Citicorp \n     of New York and its subsidiaries, Citicorp received financing \n     or political risk insurance for projects in 23 countries \n     during Clinton's first term.\n       Citicorp was among 15 of the 27 OPIC recipients on Brown's \n     trips that had received support from the agency before \n     Clinton took office. And not all were major Democratic \n     supporters.\n       Among them was Anderman/Smith Overseas Inc., a Denver-based \n     oil company that received $40 million in political risk \n     insurance from OPIC in 1992 to develop a giant oil field in \n     Russia's western Siberia.\n       In 1994, when an Anderman/Smith executive joined Brown on a \n     prized trade mission to Russia, OPIC also provided the \n     company with a $40 million loan guarantee.\n       Yet Anderman/Smith was a small player in Democratic fund-\n     raising, with total contributions of $5,250 coming from an \n     executive's family. ``We wanted to succeed on our own \n     merits,'' said James Webb, the company's chief financial \n     officer.\n       Webb praised OPIC as competent and professional, saying the \n     agency ``looked into every nook and cranny'' of his company's \n     finances. ``We certainly didn't get any special treatment,'' \n     Webb said.\n       The biggest giver to the Democrats among the companies on \n     Brown's missions was Entergy Power Development Co. of New \n     Orleans. After donating only $20,000 to Democratic national \n     committees in 1991 and 1992, Entergy's giving soared to \n     $337,613 during Clinton's first term.\n       Entergy's chairman, Edwin Lupberger, traveled with Brown to \n     China in 1994 to close a deal to build a $1 billion power \n     plant there with the Lippo Group of Indonesia. Lippo's ties \n     to former members of the Clinton administration are under \n     investigation by the FBI.\n       The Entergy-Lippo deal fell through. OPIC, which does not \n     do business in China, was not involved in the project.\n       However, Entergy received $165 million of insurance \n     coverage from OPIC in 1996 for a hydroelectric power project \n     in Peru.\n       An Entergy spokesman did not return a phone call.\n       Several other federal agencies, including the Export-Import \n     Bank, the US Agency for International Development, and the US \n     Trade and Development Agency, also provided assistance to \n     businesses that gave to the Democratic Party and sent \n     executives on trade missions.\n       Administration officials said politics played no role in \n     any funding decision. But campaign reform advocates were \n     skeptical.\n       ``In too many cases,'' said Ellen Miller of the advocacy \n     group Public Campaign, ``it looks as if those who had the \n     opportunity to reap those kinds of rewards were those who \n     invested first in the Democratic Party.''\n\n\n                         foreign trade, US aid\n\n       Twenty-seven companies that obtained coveted slots on trade \n     missions with the late Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown \n     during President Clinton's first term received support for \n     foreign projects from the Overseas Private Investment Corp., \n     a federal agency. All but three of the companies donated to \n     the Democratic Party in the same period.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Donations to Domocratic Party                                 OPIC aid 1993-96               \n                 Company                 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Brown trip                       1993-96             Amount                 Country          \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEntergy Power Development...............

The headline from above the fold says, ``Trade-trip firms \nnetted $5.5 billion in aid, Donated $2.3 million to Democrats.'' It \ngoes on to state that 27 corporations that sent executives on trade \ntrips with late Commerce Secretary Ron Brown received part of a \nmultibillion-dollar commitment in OPIC loans and guarantees. All but 3 \nof the 27 OPIC recipients donated to Democratic Party committees, and \nmost of them gave $50,000 to $385,000 during the President's first \nterm.\n  As mentioned in the story, it is very difficult to ascertain whether \nthe OPIC loan influenced giving to the party, or if the donation \ninfluenced who received the OPIC assistance, or if there was any \nimpropriety at all.\n  To me, it does not matter. Since the awarding of OPIC assistance is \nentirely discretionary by the administration in power, it invites and \nwelcomes possible abuse as described in the Boston Globe. OPIC should \nnot exist in the first place, and even the perception that it could be \nused as a slush fund, whether Republican or Democrats, makes its \nelimination even more important.\n  With this bill, some proponents of OPIC will describe me as \nantibusiness or antitrade. I guess to them, getting the Government out \nof the business of business is antibusiness. I must say that I believe \nthis is a probusiness, anti big Government proposal.\n  I am a free trader. I am a supporter of the GATT and NAFTA, and \nbelieve that free trade is the best way to raise the living standards \nfor all Americans. We need to support policies that reduce trade \nbarriers. OPIC does not reduce trade barriers for all companies to \ncompete in the marketplace. It is an income transfer program from U.S. \ntaxpayers to a selected group of businesses, who may have donated or \nwill feel obligated to give to a political party. These subsidies may \nincrease exports for a few selected companies that have the political \ninfluence to secure these loans, but it does little to expand the \noverall economic growth of this country. OPIC loans protect \ninefficiency and reduce total economic activity, shifting economic \nresources from taxpayers and unsubsidized businesses to politically \nconnected businesses. Free trade is about getting the Government out of \nthe private sector. The Federal Government can advocate U.S. business \nand trade without supporting politically connected businesses. Let us \npush for open markets, not for open political purses.\n  Last, as we are attempting to balance the budget by the year 2002 and \nreduce Government spending, we must begin to eliminate giveaway \nprograms and corporate welfare. Eliminating OPIC will save $107 million \nthis year and $296 million over the next 5 years. This does not include \nthe money saved if any of OPIC loans or guarantees go bad and have to \nbe bailed out by the taxpayers. We must get all spending under control \nand all parts of the budget must sacrifice. Balancing our budget will \ndo more to increase economic and job growth than any OPIC loan can \noffer.\n  Mr. President, this effort is supported by individuals on both the \nleft and the right of the political spectrum. With all the talk by \nliberals and conservatives about eliminating corporate welfare, I \nbelieve it is time we begin to do what we say and it ought to start \nhere with OPIC. OPIC should not exist under a Republican or Democrat \nPresident or Congress.\n  I thank you for this time and I ask all my colleagues to support S. \n519 and this effort to eliminate the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, a couple of my colleagues this morning \nhave spoken, as I did yesterday, about the devastating blizzards and \nfloods that have confronted people in North and South Dakota and the \nMinnesota region in recent days. I suppose only those who have been \nthere can fully understand the dimension of the tragedy. It is, indeed, \na tragedy.\n  North Dakota has had the toughest winter that it has ever had, with \nfive and six major blizzards, closing down virtually all roads, \nincluding the interstate highways, causing serious problems. On top of \nthat, with the expected floods that would come as a result of the \nrecord amount of snowfall from these previous blizzards, last week\n\n[[Page S2880]]\n\nsomething called the grandfather of all blizzards came to North Dakota.\n  Leon Osborne, who works at the University of North Dakota and is \nsomeone who runs a weather service that I think is tops in our region, \ndescribed this blizzard as the worst in 50 years in our State. This \nblizzard came on top of all of the other blizzards and on top of the \nflooding that was already beginning in our State. The snowfall last \nweekend ranged anywhere from 12 inches to over 20 inches of snowfall \nwith winds 40 and 50 miles an hour in some parts of North Dakota. The \npicture of North Dakotans trying to fill sandbags in the middle of a \nsnow blizzard is quite extraordinary.\n  The Dakotans have had a very, very difficult time coping with these \nproblems. Last Tuesday we had a meeting with President Clinton and the \nhead of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the \nPresident signed a disaster declaration for North and South Dakota.\n  My understanding is that he probably signed a disaster declaration \nfor some of the Minnesota counties today. There are teams of folks from \nFEMA now on the ground in our region, and there will be a visit to \nNorth Dakota by the head of FEMA and by the Secretary of Transportation \nand other senior officials. My understanding is that the Vice President \nwill also visit North and South Dakota and Minnesota the day after \ntomorrow.\n  I intend to travel with the senior officials as they go to North \nDakota, as do my colleagues, and we will be a part of a group that \nattempts to make certain that all of the resources of the Federal \nGovernment are made available at this time when it is needed in North \nDakota and in our region to help people who are trying to dig out from \nthis blizzard and trying to cope with massive flooding.\n  The newspaper headlines tell it better than I can. This one describes \nit pretty well: ``Down, But Not Out.'' North Dakotans are a tough \npeople. They have suffered through a good many weather-related events \nin years past, but this was about as tough as it gets. ``State \nParalyzed by Blizzard.'' The newspaper headlines describe all of the \nmyriad events that have occurred. ``Area Residents Hang Tough Despite \nFlooding.'' ``Search for Heat and Power Endangers Lives: With Power \nLines Down, Crews Struggle To Restore Power to Thousands of Homes.'' It \nhas been a very, very tough time.\n  The stories of the folks who have had to endure this are really quite \nremarkable. We have men and women who are trying to restore power to a \nState in which up to 100,000 citizens were without power. Some are \nstill without power. Men and women, linemen and others working for \nutility companies, electric co-ops and others are out in tough \ncircumstances trying to restore power to North Dakota. They are doing \nan extraordinary job for our State.\n  Livestock losses are going to be very substantial in North Dakota. \nThe threat to human life has been substantial. Fortunately, we have not \nhad many deaths in North Dakota, but it has been a very challenging \ntime. We are told that in some areas, one half of the young calves \nbeing born--and this is calving season for ranchers--one half of the \ncalves are dying as they are born.\n  They are being found on the ground in circumstances where the \nranchers simply could not save them. One rancher, I believe, brought \nfive or seven of his calves into the home to try to save their lives. \nAll of them died. Also, 300 milk cows were killed when a dairy barn \ncollapsed under the weight of the snow. There are stories about cows \nand calves with a full 1-inch thick coat of ice on them as a result of \nthe blizzard, rain, and the snow.\n  Farmers and ranchers have attempted, especially for the young and the \nvulnerable calves, to use air dryers to try to remove that ice from the \ncoats of those calves. Then the power fails, so you cannot use air \ndryers, and the calves die. Those are just some of the stories of \npeople who have been confronted with this challenge.\n  There was a story, in fact, yesterday about two fellows who were \nleaving a North Dakota community and were caught by this blizzard with \nwhiteout conditions and they became stuck, could not move, could not \nsee. They saw a building just faintly, just a few yards away, so they \nwent to the building, which turned out to be a small bar on the edge of \nthis town. So they broke into the bar and then used the telephone to \ncall the wife of one of the two men who had broken into the bar and had \nthe wife call the bar owner.\n  Remember, this is a whiteout blizzard, with no traffic available to \nmove, and they are stuck and caught. The bar owner called the bar where \nthe two fellows had broken in to seek shelter and said, ``Well, help \nyourself to whatever is there. There is frozen chili in the freezer.'' \nThe folks were stuck there, I guess for a day and a half in the place. \nI suppose there are worse places to be stuck if you are in the middle \nof a blizzard, but it is a story that is replicated all across our \nState of neighbors helping neighbors, especially now confronting \ndigging out from a blizzard and confronting the raging flood that will \ncome.\n  The flood is going to be a very significant problem. Part of it has \nalready hit. I want to tell my colleagues about the Red River--which, \nincidentally, is the only river in America that runs north, I believe. \nBecause it runs north, it is running into an area up north that has not \nyet thawed, and the result is the water cannot flow easily because it \nis flowing toward ice. So it starts down south in our State and floods \nthere first and then the flood exacerbates as it goes north.\n  In Wahpeton, flood stage is 10 feet, the current height of the river \nis 16 feet and is predicted to go to 18\\1/2\\ feet. In Fargo, ND, the \nflood stage on the Red River is 17 feet, the river is at 33 feet and \nexpected to go to 37\\1/2\\ feet. In Grand Forks, flood stage is 28 feet, \nand it is expected to crest at 49 feet. That is the Red River. The \nSheyenne River is the same story. At West Fargo, the Sheyenne flood \nstage is 16 feet, and the current height is 23 feet. In Abercrombie, \nthe Wild Rice River flood stage is 10 feet and the current height is 24 \nfeet.\n  So we face enormous challenges now as we confront digging out from a \nblizzard that represented the worst blizzard in 50 years and as we \nanticipate the continuation of a flood. This will be the worst flood \nthat we will have had in a century.\n  Now, Mr. President, today is Wednesday, and I indicated we met with \nthe President on Tuesday. President Clinton indicated to us that the \nhead of FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, would come to \nNorth Dakota. He indicated he would invite a Cabinet Secretary, too, to \ncome, and a senior team of administration officials will visit our \nregion. I am also told that Vice President Gore will visit North \nDakota, South Dakota, and Minnesota on Friday, the day after tomorrow, \nand I expect that the congressional delegation, myself included, will \njoin him in that visit.\n  I appreciate very much the attention of the agencies and the \nadministration in understanding the difficulty we face, understanding \nthe gravity of the situation that yet exists in North Dakota with power \nlines down, with thousands of North Dakotans still without power after \nmany, many days. I believe that we will appreciate very much in North \nDakota the visit from the Vice President and from the head of FEMA and \nCabinet officials who come to view firsthand what could be done on \nbehalf of the Federal Government to make all of the resources of the \nFederal Government available to North Dakotans as they work together \nand fight together to confront these challenges.\n\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I will be working in the coming days \non the supplemental appropriations bill, which we hope will include the \nkind of resources that are necessary for all of the agencies to respond \nto this problem. Mr. President, there are not many States in our \ncountry in which interstate highways are closed or will be closed. Yet \nthis morning Interstate 29 has one lane closed, and it is expected that \nInterstate 29 will be closed completely in North Dakota. In fact, a \ndike will be built across the interstate when it is closed, and it will \nbe closed for some time. Interstate 94, a major artery east and west in \nour State, is now surrounded by lakes of water on both sides, and some \npredict that we will probably not escape having that interstate closed \nas well. But it is a very difficult circumstance, with road crews and \nothers struggling in a crisis situation to meet the needs of people who \nhave been confronted by this blizzard and these floods.\n\n  Many are finding that just the infrastructure things we normally take \nfor\n\n[[Page S2881]]\n\ngranted are now shut off, and it makes dealing with all of this much, \nmuch more difficult. I suppose electricity is the thing that most of us \nalmost always take for granted every day. I have talked to several \nNorth Dakotans in the last hours, and they reiterate that it is \nsomething we take for granted, but the loss of electricity, especially \nin the circumstance in North Dakota, with record low temperatures this \nmorning, dating back to the 1890's, has been a very difficult \ncircumstance for families struggling to keep warm and struggling to \nconfront these elements.\n  So, Mr. President, Senator Conrad, myself, and Senator Wellstone, who \nspoke earlier, and others, intend to go to North Dakota with the senior \nFederal team, either tomorrow or Friday, and do everything we possibly \ncan to try to bring some help to some folks who are now trying to help \nthemselves dig out and prepare for floods. We hope that when all of \nthis is done--and it is going to be some while--that the record will \nshow that everybody rushed to the folks in this region who have been \nhurt, the North Dakotans and South Dakotans and Minnesotans, and \neverybody did everything humanly possible to make life better, and \nextended a helping hand to try to get them through these challenges.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2879-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2881]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this begins our third day of debate on \nS. 104, the nuclear waste repository legislation, which has been \nintroduced by myself and Senator Craig and a number of other \ncosponsors. This may not be a very exciting topic, Mr. President, but \nit is an important issue and it is an important responsibility for this \nbody.\n  What we have is a situation where, as the charts will show, at some \n80 sites in 41 States this waste has been accumulating. The Federal \nGovernment agreed in 1982 to accept this waste by 1998. Well, 1998 is \nnext year. Now, the site that has been suggested as being the best for \nthe waste is out in the Nevada desert at the Nevada test site.\n  Again, to refresh the memories of my colleagues, this is what the \nsite looks like. It was used for over 50 years for more than 800 \nnuclear weapons tests. It is probably one of the more remote areas in \nthe United States, but it is unique inasmuch as it has been a selected \ntest site.\n  Now, why this site? That is a legitimate question, and I know my \ncolleagues from Nevada are very concerned about it being designated in \ntheir State. I am sympathetic to that. But the reality is that it has \nto be put somewhere, Mr. President. In the debate yesterday, my \ncolleagues from Nevada claimed that during the development of our \nnuclear program, it was necessary to do our patriotic duty to designate \nan area out in the Nevada desert, and you might say their State was \nused for that purpose as a contribution to the effort to fight and win \nthe cold war.\n  I think it is fair to say, and the statement was made yesterday, that \nCongress chose that area to be studied for nuclear waste disposal for \npolitical reasons. Well, I don't know whether that is correct or not. \nIt had to be somewhere. But Nevada is where we conducted nuclear tests, \nand where there is radioactivity from those tests. But\n\n[[Page S2893]]\n\nin the debate yesterday, the Senators from Nevada indicated there was \nno rational, technical, or scientific reason for placing a spent fuel \nstorage facility in Nevada. Well, I don't know any other place in the \ncountry where we tested 800 nuclear bombs.\n  Now, it's also important to note that the Department of Energy spent \nover a billion dollars studying other potential sites before narrowing \nthe list to three sites, including Yucca Mountain. Congress settled on \nYucca Mountain in 1987. It indicated that it had a unique geology, and \nit tied in the reality that the Nevada test site had been used to \nexplode nuclear weapons for 50 years. In other words, it said that from \na geological point of view, it meets our expectations. Secondly, it is \nan area that has been used, and, therefore, it should be sufficient for \nthis type of permanent repository.\n  As we look at this test site, we should recognize that the last \nweapon was exploded underground there in 1991. Underground tests are \nstill being performed with nuclear materials being exploded with \nconventional explosives, as I understand it, from time to time--all \nwith the wholehearted support, I might add, of the Nevada delegation. \nIn fact, not too long ago, one of the Nevada Senators supported storing \nspent fuel at the site.\n  I have a copy of a resolution that reappeared, from the Nevada \nassembly; it's joint resolution No. 15. That is a copy of the \nresolution, Mr. President, dated February 26, 1975. I am not going to \nread the whole resolution, but I think it is important to recognize \nthis:\n\n       Whereas, the people of southern Nevada have confidence in \n     the safety record of the Nevada test site and in the ability \n     of the staff to site and to maintain safety in handling of \n     nuclear materials.\n\n  And, also:\n\n       Whereas, nuclear waste disposal can be carried out at the \n     Nevada test site with minimal capital investment relative to \n     other locations.\n  That is from the copy of the resolution that we have on the chart \nbehind me.\n\n       Therefore, be it resolved by the assembly and the State of \n     Nevada jointly that the legislature of the State of Nevada \n     strongly urges the Energy Research and Development \n     Administration to choose the Nevada test site for the \n     disposal of nuclear waste.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, that was indicative of the attitude prevailing on \nFebruary 26, 1975. The resolution was passed. It passed the Nevada \nSenate by a 12-6 vote, aided by the vote of one of our colleagues here \nin the Senate from Nevada, and it was signed by the Governor of Nevada, \nMike O'Callaghan.\n  Well, I ask, Mr. President, what has changed? That test site hasn't \nchanged. It is still there. It still has a trained work force, still \nhas an infrastructure for dealing with nuclear materials. The geology \nof the site certainly hasn't changed. Obviously, at least one of the \nNevada Senators thought it was the best place to store nuclear waste in \n1975, or he would not have supported this resolution. In my opinion, \nwhen you are all through with going through the areas in the rest of \nthe States, it is still the best place.\n  Where are we today? Well, we are still on our way--business as usual \naround the Senate, putting off decisions. We began this debate in the \n104th Congress with the consideration of S. 1271. The Nevada Senators \nobjected saying that the bill would gut environmental laws, allow \nunsafe transportation, and endanger the health and safety of Americans. \nWe had objections from the administration saying that we were choosing \nNevada as the site prior to the determination that the Yucca Mountain \nsite would be viable as a permanent repository.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 27\n\n(Purpose: To provide that the Savannah River Site and Barnwell County, \n South Carolina shall not be available for construction of an interim \n                           storage facility)\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Thurmond], for himself \n     and Mr. Hollings, proposes an amendment numbered 27.\n       On page 28, line 16, after ``Washington'' insert the \n     following: ``, and the Savannah River Site and Barnwell \n     County in the State of South Carolina,''.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by myself and the senior Senator from South Carolina, Senator \nThurmond.\n  We all know the score, the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee has outlined the state of our nuclear waste policy \nand we are aware of the need to move this bill forward.\n  Currently, DOE is contractually bound to begin receiving spent \ncommercial nuclear fuel in 1998. Under the 1982 Nuclear Policy Act, DOE \nwas directed to identify, construct, and operate an underground \nrepository to dispose of the Nation's commercial nuclear fuel.\n  Identifying such a site proved difficult, so in 1987 Congress \nintervened and directed DOE to study or characterize only one site, \nYucca Mountain, NV. Since 1987 DOE has been studying the Yucca Mountain \nsite to determine if it is a suitable site for the permanent \nrepository. This characterization was to be completed and, if the site \nwas suitable, a permanent facility was to be constructed by 1998.\n  I don't need to point out how far this process has fallen behind. If \nit was on schedule then we would not be debating this bill today. It is \nnow 1997, and DOE has not finished its site characterization work. In \nfact they tell me that, if there is no further delay and the site \nchecks out, then the permanent repository will not be ready until 2010 \nat the earliest.\n  Obviously that causes a problem since last year a Federal court held \nthat DOE does have an obligation to dispose of the waste by the 1998 \ndeadline. So where does the waste go in 1998? Well, to Senator \nMurkowski's credit, he is trying to answer that question. That solution \nis to construct a temporary storage facility at the Yucca Mountain if \nthe site is suitable for the permanent repository.\n  The Senator from Alaska has tried to accommodate a bunch of competing \ninterests, and, hoping to avoid a veto by the White House, he has \nprovided a means by which the President can identify an alternative \nsite if the Yucca Mountain site is deemed unsuitable. It is this \nprovision, allowing the President to designate an alternative temporary \nstorage site, that brings me\n\n[[Page S2894]]\n\nhere today. My friends from Oregon, Senators Wyden and Smith, both of \nwhom are on the Energy Committee, offered a provision at markup to \nensure that the DOE's Hanford Site be excluded as a possible \nalternative temporary storage site.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the DOE's Savannah River Site is \nlocated in my State, and I am here today to explain why, like the \nHanford Site, it is not a suitable site for a temporary facility. After \nmy colleagues hear SRS's disadvantages, they will agree. SRS is not the \nplace for this spent fuel.\n  The amendment before us simply codifies that position. It simply \nstates that the Savannah River Site and Barnwell County South Carolina, \nlike Hanford, cannot be identified by the President as an alternative \ntemporary storage site.\n  I am not going to spend time arguing why Yucca Mountain is the best \nsite for this facility. The chairman of the Energy Committee has done a \nfine job of that. What I will do is tell you why SRS is not the site.\n  SRS is a 198,000-acre reservation located in South Carolina and \nabutting Georgia. It is 12 miles southwest of Augusta, GA, and 10 miles \nsouth of Aiken, SC. This is a highly populated area which has been and \ncontinues to grow rapidly. I have heard people argue that the Savannah \nRiver Site is some rural out-of-the-way place. Well, that is just not \nthe case. The population within a 50-mile radius of SRS numbers about \n615,000. This obviously encompasses all of Aiken, SC, and Augusta, GA, \nwhose combined population is more that 400,000 people, plus a number of \nsmaller communities that are too numerous to mention.\n  What is more astounding is that the population living within a 100-\nmile radius of the site numbers 2.6 million people. This includes a \nnumber of larger cities including the capital of South Carolina, \nColumbia, Charleston, SC, Hilton Head, SC, Savannah GA, and Augusta, \nGA. In fact, there are private homes located on private lands located \nwithin 200 feet of the site.\n\n  To say this is a far and out-of-the-way place is just not the case. \nPutting additional nuclear waste in such a highly populated area is \ncrazy.\n  In addition, as I understand the scientists, their most constant fear \nis that nuclear material is exposed to water and leaches into surface \nor subsurface waters and that this water carries the contamination off-\nsite. Therefore it is critical that this nuclear material be kept dry \nand away from the corrosive effects of water.\n  Well, for anyone who has visited the Savannah River site, or, for \nthat matter the lowcountry of South Carolina, they know that in reality \nit is all wetlands or as some say, a swamp. In fact, the Savannah River \nsite is literally surrounded by water. There are extensive water \nresources on, under, and adjacent to the site.\n  The Savannah River, which marks the border of the States of South \nCarolina and Georgia also marks the 20-mile western boundary of the \nsite and six major streams flow through the site and into the river.\n  It is this river, the Savannah, which supplies drinking water for \nBeaufort and Jasper Counties in South Carolina and the town of Port \nWentworth, GA. In addition, it runs directly through the city of \nSavannah, GA, downstream and supports an active commercial and sport \nfishing industry.\n  Studies indicate that portions of the site are within the 100-year \nflood plain, and although this information is not available, I would \nnot be surprised to find that the entire site is within the 500-year \nflood plain.\n  Under the surface there are several aquifer systems. The largest of \nwhich is the Cretaceous or Tuscoloosa Aquifer. It is a huge aquifer \nstretching all across the Southeast. In general, the groundwater on the \nsite flows into one of the numerous streams or swamps on the site and \nthen flows into the Savannah River which is, as I mentioned earlier, \nthe source of drinking water for numerous cities and towns downstream.\n  The water not making its way to the river is absorbed into the ground \nand eventually makes it to the groundwater. The level of this \ngroundwater, like its flow, varies but in some places it is literally \nwithin inches of the surface. The rate of flow for this groundwater \nvaries with areas where it travels as fast as several hundred meters a \nyear. So it is not hard to imagine a scenario, and we have had cases, \nwhere nuclear contaminants have reached the groundwater and quickly \nmoved off site.\n  It is interesting to note, but not surprising, that virtually every \ncounty in South Carolina and Georgia has some number of households \ngetting their drinking water directly from these subsurface aquifers. \nIn fact, over 50 percent of the households in two counties that abut \nthe site draw their drinking water from wells.\n  Obviously, with the abundant wetlands, rivers, streams, and, an \nabundance of precipitation, averaging over 44 inches per year, the \nSavannah River site is not the place for this spent fuel--if you want \nto keep it dry.\n  There are numerous other reasons to eliminate the Savannah River site \nfrom consideration. Not the least of which is that South Carolina and \nthe Savannah River site are already doing their share to safely store \nnuclear waste. In fact, foreign research reactor fuel shipped from all \nover the world passes right by my front door as it is being shipped to \nCharleston and then up to the Savannah River site. In addition, the \nsite is constantly receiving waste from the nation's nuclear defense \nfacilities and domestic research reactors. We have all the waste we can \nhandle.\n  Trust me, I have visited the site repeatedly over my career, and I am \naware of the cleanup job we face down there. We have spent years \ngetting a waste processing facility up and running, and we are just now \nreally beginning to clean up the 33 million gallons of liquid high-\nlevel nuclear waste on site. That does not include all the other forms \nof waste: low-level, transuranic, and hazardous. To add more waste to a \nsite which has its hands full cleaning up the mess caused by 40 years \nof nuclear weapons production is not the solution.\n  It is clear given the dense population of the area and its geography \nthat it is not the best site for any waste. Our goal should be to \nensure that the Savannah River site is cleaned up and that its waste is \nstabilized and moved off-site. The site is not suitable to receive \nadditional waste. This amendment simply ensures that the Savannah River \nsite is not overrun with waste and that it continues without \ninterruption the cleanup and stabilization of its existing \ncontamination.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may be \nallowed to speak for up to 20 minutes, followed by Senator Reid and \nSenator Bryan for up to 10 minutes each, and further, that debate only \nbe in order at this time.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, if I \nunderstand the unanimous consent request, the manager of the bill will \nspeak for 20 minutes, the Senators from Nevada will speak for 10 \nminutes each, and there will be no further debate on this bill tonight. \nIs that correct?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It wasn't my intent necessarily to eliminate debate \nfrom any other Senator who may come down. I have no objection if that \nis the proposal from the other side.\n  Mr. REID. I want no further debate tonight.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Then I would agree. If we may withhold that for a \nmoment, let me check with the Cloakroom. I want to make sure we don't \nhave anyone else.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I advise my colleagues from Nevada that \nI agree to their alteration to the agreement which would limit debate \nto 20 minutes on this side and 10 minutes each, with the understanding \nthat there be no further debate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we began this debate with the consideration of Senate \nbill 1271. The Senators from Nevada, of course, objected, saying the \nbill would gut environmental laws, saying it would allow unsafe \ntransportation and endanger the health and safety of Americans.\n  We had objections from the administration. They opposed choosing \nNevada as the interim site prior to a determination that Yucca Mountain \nwould be viable as a permanent repository. To address these concerns \nand others, we have attempted to adjust our bill. We began with Senate \nbill 1271, then a new bill, Senate bill 1936, and again with an \namendment in the form of a committee substitute to Senate bill 1936. \nWith each new version of the bill, we attempted to strengthen the \npublic health and environmental safeguards as well as meet the criteria \nof Members who were concerned about these items.\n  First, in an effort to address the administration's concerns, we made \nit clear that no construction of an interim facility would take place \nat the Nevada test site until Yucca Mountain was determined to be \ntechnically viable as a permanent repository. So let me make that \nclear. No construction would be initiated without the viability being \ndetermined.\n  We have extended the time period in order to accommodate the reality \nthat nothing moves very fast when you are addressing nuclear waste.\n  With respect to concerns over radiation protection standards, we \nbegan with a 100-millirem standard which could not be reviewed by any \nFederal agency. The bill before us today allows the EPA to issue a \nstricter standard if it determines one is necessary. So we have \ntightened up on the radiation standards.\n  With respect to the NEPA requirements, our latest version requires \nthe Department of Energy and the NRC to fulfill the requirements of \nNEPA in conjunction with the operation of both an interim storage \nfacility and a repository. Our first bill did not contain that \nrequirement. So, again, we tightened it up with regard to NEPA \nrequirements.\n  With respect to concern about transportation safety, we have accepted \ntransportation language offered by Senator Moseley-Braun of Illinois, \nSenator Wyden, and others.\n  With respect to the preemption of other laws, we proposed language \nconsistent with the preemption authority found in the existing \nHazardous Material Transportation Act. Indeed, I think we have made \nsubstantial changes in the bill. What is before us today is far \ndifferent than what we originally introduced as Senate bill 1271 in the \n104th Congress.\n  Despite all of the changes we have made, the opponents of this bill \ncontinue to object to the bill as if no changes were made. We have \nheard it referred to as ``Mobile Chernobyl,'' ``emasculating NEPA \nlaws'' and ``running roughshod over all environmental laws.''\n  The emotional rhetoric that has been used fails to recognize the \nchanges we have made in this bill and the charges that we have refuted.\n  The suggestion has been made that the transportation is unsafe. We \nhave shown how we have safely been moving fuel around for many years. I \nhave some charts behind me to show that. Not only have we moved fuel, \nbut fuel has been moved overseas.\n  Here is a chart showing specifically fuel what is coming to the \nUnited States from other countries: Australia; it is coming from \nTurkey, Iran, Pakistan, and Canada. How does it get here? It moves. It \nis transported. And it is transported safely. The French, the Japanese, \nand the Swedes are moving spent nuclear fuel. Spent nuclear fuel is \ncoming from Japan, going to France for reprocessing, being taken back \nto Japan, and being put back in the reactors. They have what they call \nreprocessing. They don't bury their waste. They put it back in the \nreactors and burn it. It combats proliferation. I am not here to argue \nthe merits of that. I am simply showing that this waste does move, and \nit moves in transportation casks.\n  We have heard it argued that transportation casks are unsafe. But we \nhave shown that the transportation casks can withstand significant \nexposure to crashes, and can survive fires. We have shown the casks \nhave been tested by a locomotive hitting them at the 90 miles an hour, \nor crash into a brick wall at 80 miles per hour, submerged in water, \nand bathed in fire. These casks are safe, and they are designed to \nsurvive any type of real world accident. We have the technology to do \nthat.\n  I also want to show a chart relative to the movement of waste \nthroughout the United States, which I think is significant inasmuch as \nit reflects on the reality that we move a tremendous amount of waste \nthroughout the United States.\n  But here we are. In the years 1979 to 1995, there were 2,400 \nshipments across the United States through every State except Florida \nand South Dakota. I don't know how we missed those. But there are the \ntransportation routes. So we have moved them safely. We have shown that \nour national labs have certified that the casks can survive any real \nworld crash.\n  We have heard statements that radiation protection standards are \nunsafe. We have shown how our standard is more protective than the \ncurrent EPA guidance that allows five times as much. We allow EPA to \ntighten the standards further, if need be.\n  It has been said on the other side that the Nuclear Waste Technical \nReview Board says there is no compelling technical or safety reasons to \nmove fuel through a central location.\n  We have shown that a more complete reading of the Technical Review \nBoard's testimony--and their report--indicates there is a need for \ninterim storage, and there is a need for Yucca if Yucca is determined \nto be a suitable site for the permanent repository.\n  The other side has indicated we can delay this action until August \n1998, at a time when a viability determination is made with respect to \nYucca.\n\n  We have shown that delay is what has gotten us into this situation in \nthe first place.\n  There is a court case which has already determined that the Federal \nGovernment is liable because of its delays and its inability to accept \nthe waste.\n  Eight months from now, when the Government is in breech of contract,\n\n[[Page S2896]]\n\nthen the courts are going to consider the damage that we face.\n  We as legislators have a responsibility to protect the taxpayers. \nWith each delay, the damage is going to mount. With each delay, the \nliability to the taxpayer will mount. With each delay, there will be a \npressure to yield to even further delays. The call for delay is really \na siren's song. It is a trap. It is an excuse for no action.\n  Only yesterday I heard our ranking member, Senator Bumpers, \nsuggesting that we could wait until August 1998 to deal with this \nproblem. Well, it might sound reasonable at first. It has been so long \nnow. But let's give it a little more thought.\n  Will Congress deal with the nuclear waste issue in an election year \nwith time running out in the 105th Congress? I think not. Will my \nfriends from Nevada forego their rights to filibuster the bill at that \ntime? I think not. As a practical matter, delay until August 1998 will \nslip to 1999. And, if we are waiting until 1999, why not allow the \ndecision to wait for the license applications in 2001 or 2002? All the \nwhile we will be in violation of our contractual commitment. We will be \nincreasing the damages. If we delay until 2001 or 2002, then why not \ndelay until final licensing of a permanent repository is due in the \nyear 2015.\n\n  Let me refer you to the picture of where we propose to put this. This \nwaste would be put in a temporary repository located at the Nevada test \nsite, which was used for more than 50 years and over 800 nuclear \nweapons tests have taken place in that area.\n  That is what we propose. It would be adjacent to the continuing \ndevelopment of a permanent site in Yucca Mountain. We have gotten \nnearly 5 miles of tunnel done now. The problem is that site is not \ngoing to be ready until the year 2015.\n  I do not expect the changes we have made in this bill, along with the \nothers, will necessarily satisfy all my friends on the other side. All \nthe members of the Nevada delegation have appeared before the \ncommittee, and they have said they would oppose any approach that would \nbring nuclear waste to Nevada, so I do not realistically expect my good \nfriends to change their minds. They are doing what they feel they must \ndo for their State. But I do hope my other colleagues who have not \nexpressed support for our bill will understand just how far we have \nalready come to make accommodations and to reject the emotional \nrhetoric that has been heard so often with regard to this bill.\n  We are starting this bill with 63 votes. That is what we had last \nyear. It is no secret that we are seeking a higher number. So we are \nprepared to adopt amendments today to further address the concerns of \nsome Members who have indicated concerns to the White House as well and \nto generally try to tackle all reasonable concerns that still may \npersist about the bill. We have developed this substitute amendment. We \nhave worked closely with Senator Bingaman, and I commend him and his \nstaff for their hard work.\n  Let me go over the amendments very briefly, point by point. S. 104 \nsets the size of the interim storage facility at 60,000 metric tons. \nOpponents of S. 104 have charged that the large size of this interim \nstorage facility diverts resources away from the permanent repository \nat Yucca.\n  The Senators from Nevada have also incorrectly stated that it is our \nintent to make the interim repository the de facto permanent \nrepository. Clearly, that is not the case.\n  Our amendment allows the Secretary to set the size of the facility \nbased on the emplacement. Initial capacity would be 33,100 metric tons. \nThis adequately addresses charges made by the critics of S. 104 that \nthe repository is too large, and it makes it clear that the interim \nfacility can never be a substitute for a permanent repository.\n  As we have said all along, the work at Yucca for the permanent \nrepository will go on; it must go on. This provision in our substitute \nmakes it clear that it has to go on.\n  S. 104, as reported, envisioned the initial operation of a central \nstorage facility by December 31 in the year 2002, if Yucca Mountain is \ndetermined to be viable, and December 31, 2004, if it is determined not \nto be viable. Critics of S. 104 charged that this did not allow \nadequate time for the NEPA and the NRC licensing process to work.\n  Our amendment addresses these concerns by shifting those dates to \nJune 30, 2003, and June 30, 2005.\n  S. 104 sets a 100-millirem dose standard that could be reviewed and \nchanged to protect public health and safety. Critics of S. 104 argued \nthat this was not good enough and that there should be a risk-based \nstandard as recommended by the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Our amendment, therefore, mandates full EPA involvement in the \nsetting of the risk-based radiation protection standard that is likely \nto result in a standard of 25 to 30 millirem. This is the approach \nendorsed by the Senators from Nevada I believe yesterday.\n  S. 104 ensured that the State and local jurisdictions could not \nhamstring Federal intent by allowing the Atomic Energy Act and the \nHazardous Materials Transportation Act to preempt all inconsistent \nlaws. Critics charged that this preemption authority was too broad \nbecause it allowed Federal laws to be preempted as well.\n\n  Our amendment, therefore, makes it clear that our bill would preempt \nState and local laws only, only where State intransigence prevents \nFederal purposes. We have adopted a more narrow approach that attempts \nto I think bring in a careful balance of State and Federal law.\n  We do not preempt Federal law. Therefore, let us be very clear about \nwhat we have attempted to do with our amendment here today. We have \nworked to address all the key objections of critics of S. 104 and still \nhave a bill.\n  The statement of administration position and the recent letters sent \nto the majority leader by the Secretary of Energy really are not \nreferring to the bill that incorporates the amendments we proposed here \ntoday, so their objection, if you will, is inappropriate because it \ndoes not relate to the changes we have made, and we look forward to any \ncomments the administration might make with regard to these \nadjustments.\n  Let me go over each of the administration's criticisms and how we \nhave addressed them. The administration's position initially stated \nthat S. 104 would ``effectively replace EPA's authority to set \nacceptable release standards.''\n  Mr. President, I am going to need about 3 more minutes here with no \nobjection from my colleagues from Nevada. I would ask that they be \nextended 3 more minutes as well.\n  Mr. REID. Whatever the Senator needs, we will extend the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend. Let me begin again.\n  The administration's position states that S. 104 would ``effectively \nreplace EPA's authority to set acceptable release standards.'' Our \namendment, as I have stated earlier, places the EPA in a key role \ndeveloping risk-based standards for the repository consistent with the \nrecommendations of the National Academy of Sciences.\n  The administration position states that S. 104 would create loopholes \nin the application of the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  We have answered that. A full EIS is required prior to placement of \nany waste in temporary storage or the repository, and our amendment \nrequires the evaluation of transportation which S. 104 excluded.\n  The administration also stated that S. 104 would ``weaken existing \nenvironmental standards by preempting all Federal, State and local laws \ninconsistent with the environmental requirements of this bill and the \nAtomic Energy Act.''\n  Our amendment completely changes section 501 of the bill. There will \nbe full application of health and safety laws except where the local \njurisdiction attempts to unreasonably stand in the way of the Federal \nmandate.\n  The administration's position further states that S. 104 ``would \nundermine the ongoing work at the permanent disposal site by siphoning \naway resources.''\n  That is simply not true. Our amendment establishes a user fee which \nwas specifically added to provide sufficient funds for the construction \nand operation of a central storage facility and continued work at Yucca \nMountain.\n  Finally, the administration's position states that ``it would \nundermine\n\n[[Page S2897]]\n\nthe credibility of the Nation's nuclear waste disposal program by \ndesignating a site for an interim storage facility before viability has \nbeen assessed.''\n  As I have said earlier, that is simply not true. Our bill \nspecifically conditions the use of the Nevada test site as a site for a \ntemporary storage until completion, until completion of a viability \nassessment for the repository at Yucca Mountain. We have attempted to \nmirror the administration's position on this issue, and I think we \nhave.\n  Mr. President, we have worked very hard to satisfy legitimate \nconcerns of the administration and all Senators. We continue to remain \nopen to suggestions. Our willingness to consider new approaches will \nnot stop with the Senate passage of this bill. There will be \nconsideration in the House, and there will be a conference. This is not \nthe last word. We will continue our quest for compromise that is not \nonly acceptable to a bipartisan majority of Congress but hopefully the \nPresident as well.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to again advise my colleagues of my \nthanks to Senator Bingaman for the efforts made to accommodate his \namendments. I think we were able to accommodate seven of the eight. I \nwould like to conclude by simply explaining the one that we could not \nresolve.\n  As the Chair is aware, Senator Bingaman opposes our provision, and \nthat specific provision is if the Yucca Mountain site fails as a \npermanent disposal site, if it fails in the sense of the licensing \nviability or suitability test, why, then the President must pick an \nalternative temporary site. Our position is that if we should get to \nthis point, and it is very unlikely that it could occur, that Yucca \nwould fail as a permanent disposal site, it would be the President's \nobligation to pick a temporary site. It would also bind Congress in \napproving the President's site. However, if Congress does not approve, \nor if the President fails to pick a site in 2\\1/2\\ years, then we go \nback to the Nevada test site more or less as the default position.\n  Senator Bingaman's position is a little different. He says if Yucca \nfails and the President picks a site, and, of course, Congress must \napprove, but if the Yucca site is not approved and the President does \nnot pick, or Congress does not approve, then the waste would stay where \nit is, at 80 sites in 41 States, and it would stay there, well, until \nwe developed a new nuclear waste program for the country. It could stay \nthere basically, in his contention, for an extended period of time.\n  We found that irreconcilable. We feel that in order to bring this to \na conclusion, we have to structure the amendments in such a way as to \ndetermine, indeed, that if Yucca Mountain is not deemed to be an \nadequate site and if the President finds it necessary as a consequence \nof Yucca not being deemed an adequate site, the responsibility is the \nPresident's, with the approval of Congress, but if all proposed to duck \nresponsibility, then clearly it comes back to the Nevada test site in \ndefault. And the rationale for that is obvious. Without closing the \nloop, we have left a loophole, and we would not see a satisfactory \ndetermination by the parties who must bear the responsibility. And the \nCongress and the Senate certainly share in that.\n  So with that concluding remark, I yield and encourage the Chair to \ngrant an equal amount of time to my good friends from Nevada.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Chair advise the Senator from \nNevada how much time the Senator from Alaska consumed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator consumed 25 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair advise the Senator when he has used 11 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, sir. If you will proceed, I will be happy \nto do that.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not mean in any way to denigrate pigs. \nI like pigs. As far as I am concerned, they do not look too bad. But no \nmatter how you dress up a pig, formal clothes or dress, it still looks \nlike a pig. And this legislation, no matter how you dress it up, still \nappears to be garbage. It is a bill that is not good legislation. No \nmatter how you dress it up, it is a bad piece of legislation. Not the \nleast reason for that, Mr. President, is the fact that now, this year, \nwe are trying to interchange the word ``viability'' with \n``suitability.'' They are two totally different concepts with two \ntotally different meanings.\n  As defined by the Department of Energy, viability is simply a finding \nthat to that point in time, no disqualifying characteristic has been \nfound. It simply says to this point we have not yet found anything \nwrong. It does not mean that the site will be suitable. Subsequent to \nviability, there is significant additional technical study to be \npursued in the context of a repository design. The site could still be \nfound unsuitable for an extended period later, while they find out if \nit is suitable. So an assessment of viability does not mean much.\n  This distinction between viability and suitability has been \nrepeatedly pointed out to the Congress. It is a shame that in this \ndebate, this year, we are now trying to satisfy the element of \nsuitability by using the word ``viability.'' The distinction was \nemphasized by the immediate past Director of DOE's Office of Civilian \nRadioactive Waste Management, who cannot be considered someone who is \nopposed to the nuclear industry. He simply said the finding of \nsuitability is much different and a much higher standard than the \nfinding of viability.\n  The distinction was emphasized in S. 104 testimony by the Chairman of \nthe Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. He said repeatedly, as did \nthe former Chairman of the Office of Radioactive Waste Management, ``Do \nnot confuse viability with suitability. Suitability is the final step \nbefore license applications can be pursued. No centralized interim \nstorage should be approved before that suitability decision has been \nmade.'' This is very clear. So, in this debate let us not confuse \nsuitability with viability.\n  There have been constant statements made on this Senate floor during \nthe past few days that nuclear waste transportation is just fine, they \ndo it other places. How many times have we heard statements, people \nsaying we transport nuclear waste all over? Let me read from a letter \nwritten to my colleague, Senator Richard Bryan, on March 28, 1997. This \nis not something that took place in ancient history. This is a brandnew \nletter. Let me read it:\n       Dear Senator Bryan: As the Senate prepares for a vote on S. \n     104, I thought you might find my recent experience with real-\n     world transportation of radioactive waste in Gorleben, \n     Germany of interest.\n       In early March, I was part of an international team which \n     monitored the transport of six CASTOR casks of high-level \n     atomic waste from southern Germany to the small northern \n     farming community of Gorleben, a distance of about 300 miles. \n     My experiences are chronicled in the enclosed issue of the \n     Nuclear Monitor. But I want to add just a few points.\n       Too often, I feel like many of your Senate colleagues \n     believe nuclear waste transportation is just another routine \n     industrial endeavor and that, if they vote for a bill like S. \n     104, this transport will just be carried out with few \n     problems.\n       The reality in Germany is quite different. The CASTOR \n     shipments were met with protest every mile of the way. The \n     shipments were front page news in every German newspaper the \n     entire week I was in the country. Near Gorleben, a farming \n     area and home of the ``interim'' waste storage facility, \n     opposition to the transport and the ``interim'' facility is \n     very nearly unanimous. In some towns nearby, I could not find \n     a single house or farm that did not display anti-CASTOR, \n     anti-nuclear, and anti-government signs. Farmers barricaded \n     roads, and dug holes under them so the 100-ton CASTOR casks \n     could not travel across them. Schoolchildren were forcibly \n     removed from their schools, so police could use them as \n     staging areas. The CASTOR transports had changed a quiet, \n     conservative region of Germany into a bastion of protest and \n     anger, causing a divisiveness in German society only now \n     being recognized by the German Parliament, which has begun \n     hearings on the issues.\n       The transport of these six casks required 30,000 police and \n     $100 million. More than 170 people were injured during \n     demonstrations, more than 500 arrested. Even the police have \n     called for an end to the shipments; they no more like \n     arresting demonstrators (who many sympathize with) than they \n     like guarding highly radioactive waste casks. I personally \n     measured the radiation from one of these casks: at 15 feet, \n     it was 50 times higher than background levels--an amount \n     no one should involuntarily be exposed to, and pregnant \n     women and children should never be exposed to. The police, \n     of course, stand much closer than 15 feet, and for hours \n     at a time.\n\n[[Page S2898]]\n\n       Eight casks, of 420, have been shipped to Gorleben. Total \n     cost to the German government has been about $150 million. \n     Each shipment the protests and anger increase, instead of \n     dying down.\n       Perhaps obviously, while watching the casks lumber down the \n     highway toward Gorleben, at about 2 miles per hour (it took \n     them about six hours to move the final 14 miles), surrounded \n     by police and protestors, I reflected on what this might mean \n     to our own radioactive waste programs. We're not trying to \n     move six casks, or eight, or even 420. Under S. 104, we could \n     be moving as many as 70,000 casks--not six in one year, but \n     six every day. And we wouldn't be moving them 300 miles, but \n     many hundreds and thousands of miles at a time.\n       I frankly don't know if we will experience protests like \n     those in Germany, though I suspect we will. But I do know we \n     will experience the same type of anger expressed by the local \n     farmers and townspeople, the same type of distrust of \n     government and authority, and the same kinds of societal \n     divisions. And I have to ask myself, has anyone in the Senate \n     actually thought about what these waste shipments could mean? \n     I fear not.\n       Nor, I am convinced, is the U.S. government as prepared as \n     the German government to handle these shipments. Germany was \n     able to place 30,000 police, brought in from all across the \n     country, along the transport route. Medical people and the \n     Red Cross were well in evidence. The first line of emergency \n     responders--the police--obviously were present for every mile \n     of the transport. And they were clearly well-trained, if \n     sometimes visibly uncomfortable in their roles.\n       It will not work to simply load up a huge cask of high-\n     level atomic waste from a nuclear utility and send it onto an \n     American highway or railway like a truck or boxcar carrying \n     cars or oranges or even gasoline or some other hazardous \n     material. Radioactive waste shipments are qualitatively \n     different and require much more thought, planning and \n     contemplation than the U.S. Senate so far appears willing to \n     provide.\n       In the end, it required establishment of a literal police \n     state in the Wendland area of Germany, and very nearly a war \n     zone, to complete this cask movement. I do not believe this \n     would be a credible or accepted policy in the United States.\n       With only eight of 420 casks shipped, Germany's Parliament \n     is re-evaluating the entire program. Perhaps we can learn \n     from them, and begin our re-evaluation before the shipments \n     start.\n       I would be happy to further brief you or your colleagues on \n     my experiences at your convenience.\n\n  It is signed by Michael Mariotte.\n  So, Mr. President, saying you can ship these casks with no problem is \njust not common sense, in light of what has happened in other places of \nthe world. In the country of Germany, a very sophisticated country, \nParliament has had to stop the shipment program.\n  This substitute is no different from the bill as originally \nsubmitted. S. 104 and its nuclear industry advocates insist that waste \nwill be stored in Nevada no matter what. And they do not at all \nconsider the transportation problems, as I indicated we should. The \nsubstitute amendment says that if Yucca Mountain is determined \nunacceptable by the President, then a different interim storage site \nmust be designated within 24 months. If a different interim site is not \nso designated within that period, then Nevada would become the default \nstorage site.\n  Sponsors of S. 104 in this Senate and the nuclear industry know that \nno such designation is possible within 24 months. Everyone knows that. \nThat is why this substitute is as big a sham as the original bill. As I \nindicated, you can dress up a pig however you want, but it is still a \npig. This legislation is still garbage, no matter how they try to dress \nit up.\n  They know that there has been spent to this point over a decade \ntrying to understand the area around Yucca Mountain well enough to \napprove permanent storage there. They want to void the billions of \ndollars spent in Yucca Mountain and sidetrack, short-circuit the \nsystem. They know that any site that receives nuclear waste will keep \nit forever, because a permanent repository will never be built. That is \nthe whole game of the very powerful, greedy, devious, deceptive nuclear \nwaste industry. They do not want to play by the rules. They want to \nhave their own game where they set their own rules, as they are trying \nto do in S. 104, and they are trying to doctor it up by saying we have \nmade the goal lines not 100 yards apart, they are only 80 yards apart. \nThat is not true.\n  They know once waste is moved from its generator site to a \ncentralized site, it will never be moved again. A suitability decision \nwill permit designation of a site. Viability will not.\n  So the only possible way to proceed, the only way to overcome the \noverwhelming opposition to centralized interim storage, is to designate \nan interim storage site at a place that has already been found suitable \nfor permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. That is the only way to \ndo it.\n  It is this inability to see that S. 104 is putting the horse behind \nthe cart, that is, establishing an interim site before a suitability \ndecision--it is this blindness that compels me to believe S. 104 is \nreally all about sabotaging this country's avowed policy to permanently \ndispose of nuclear waste.\n  The industry, with all their money and all their profits, want to \nchange the system. They want to change the rules in the middle of the \nball game. Everyone knows that Nevada is not happy with Yucca Mountain. \nBut at least some rules have been established there, where scientists \nhave at least some say in what is going on there. And the reason the \nnuclear waste industry is willing to change--wants to change the rules \nin the middle of the game is they know that Yucca Mountain is being, at \nthis stage, studied, analyzed, and characterized in a fair fashion.\n  Think about it. S. 104 would move nuclear waste to Nevada and store \nit there permanently at a site that has been found unsuitable for that \npurpose. I repeat. Think about it. S. 104 would move nuclear waste to \nNevada and store it there permanently at a site that has been found \nunsuitable for that purpose. What could be more outrageous than that?\n  Such a policy goes beyond stupidity, goes beyond unfairness. It would \nknowingly risk public health and safety by storing waste at a site that \nhas been determined to be an unsafe site, and, by storing waste on an \nopen, concrete pad, exposed----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator has used 11 \nminutes.\n\n  Mr. REID. I thank the Chair.\n  By storing waste on an open, concrete pad, exposed to the weather and \nall manner of natural and accidental damage. That is wrong. Permanent \nstorage, because that is what it would be, at a temporary site would be \nabout the worst decision this Senate could make.\n  This legislation, this so-called substitute, is as bad as the \noriginal bill. I defy anyone to controvert what we have talked about \nhere today, about the problems they had in Germany. Eight casks out of \n420, moved 300 miles, not thousands of miles like we are moving them \nhere. They had to call out 30,000 police and army personnel to allow \nthose to proceed, at a cost of $150 million.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield myself such time \nas I may need.\n  Mr. President, I want to continue this discussion of my colleague. \nEach of us was thinking in the same frame of reference. He said no \nmatter how much you dress up a pig it's still a pig. I learned as a \nyoungster the old adage, you cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's \near. You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. And that is \nexactly what we have here.\n  We have not had a chance to review in detail all the asserted changes \nthat the chairman of the committee intends, and we will have a chance \nto comment on that tomorrow. But central to this debate, the basic \nissue, the point at which all discussion begins, every thoughtful and \nanalytical and policy frame of reference, is the question of whether or \nnot we should place interim storage anywhere before a determination is \nmade with respect to a permanent repository or dump. That is why the \nadministration continues to oppose this legislation, Senator Bingaman \nopposes this legislation, why every environmental organization in \nAmerica opposes this legislation. Because the basic flaw is this is \nunnecessary and unwise. We will have a chance to expand upon this \ntomorrow.\n  But you go back to the origin of this debate, 17 years ago, you \nscratch the surface and always the nuclear utility industry and its \nhighly paid advocates have one mission and one mission only--remove the \nwaste from the reactor site. That was the essence of the debate, as we \nhave pointed out time and time again on the floor dating\n\n[[Page S2899]]\n\nback to 1980 when then the Holy Grail of the industry was an ``away-\nfrom-reactor'' storage program; the same basic concept, anywhere away \nfrom here, get it out, away from reactor storage. The Congress wisely \nrejected in 1980 that approach, just as they have rejected that \napproach consistently, year after year.\n  I want to refer to the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. We have \ntalked about that a great deal. Much has been made of its contents. But \nthe point that needs to be made is there is no urgent technical need \nfor interim storage of spent fuel--none. Our colleague, the ranking \nmember of the committee, last night, the senior Senator from Arkansas \n[Mr. Bumpers], went on at great length about: There is no necessity, no \nneed to do so. Indeed, any thoughtful policy approach rejects that \npremise.\n  Again, in 1997, a reconstituted Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board \nreaches the same conclusion, namely that there is no necessity and no \nreason to move at this time.\n  They make a second point here that I think is important to emphasize, \nand that is, if the site selection process is to retain any integrity \nat all, here is what Dr. Cohon said in his testimony of February 5:\n\n       However, to maintain the credibility of the site-\n     suitability decision, siting a centralized storage near Yucca \n     Mountain--\n\n  That is interim storage he has reference to--\n\n       should be deferred until a technically defensible site-\n     suitability determination can be made at Yucca Mountain.\n\n  That is the essence of the argument, that no decision should be made \nuntil a defensible site-suitability determination can be made at Yucca \nMountain.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       We have estimated that such a determination could be made \n     within about 4 years.\n\n  Those are Dr. Jared Cohon's comments.\n  So, Mr. President, it is clear that the nuclear utility industry is \nscrambling at the last moment to put together a few flourishes on the \nlegislation that is before us, but they will not and cannot change the \nbasic flaw in that they would propose to site interim storage at the \nNevada test site before a determination is made with respect to the \npermanent repository.\n  Let me say, for those who have followed this issue over the years, \nthe only justification for siting it at the Nevada test site--and this \nwas debated last year on the floor, to some extent--was the assumption, \nthe predicate that Yucca Mountain would be the permanent repository. \nThat was the only basis. How in the world can you place interim storage \nuntil you have a determination made as to whether the permanent \nfacility, which is the whole predicate of the interim storage licensing \ndecision, has been determined, and that has not occurred.\n  So this has nothing to do with science. Frequently, science is \ninvoked to defend the course of action that our colleagues on the other \nside of this issue would urge upon the body. This has absolutely \nnothing to do with science; it has everything to do with nuclear \npolitics as advocated by the nuclear power industry and their legions \nof lobbyists who line the hallways and the corridors of this Chamber, \nas well as the other body.\n  A second point I think needs to be made here and was addressed, in \npart, by my senior colleague, and that is the transportation issue. If \nwe should not be moving it at all until a decision is made, why place \nat risk the citizens of 43 States, 51 million people, along highway and \nrail corridors in America? Senator Reid is quite correct that Europe is \noften cited: ``My gosh, they have their situation handled; why can't we \ndo it here?'' Believe me, once you start moving 85,000 metric tons of \nhigh-level nuclear waste, you are going to have communities, and \nrightly so, exercised about the transport of those kinds of volumes.\n  The chairman of the committee says, ``Well, we're shipping nuclear \nwaste around now.'' That is true to some extent, but the difference \nbetween 2,500 shipments and 17,000 shipments in which the 2,500 \nshipments have traveled 900 miles or less is a vastly different \nproposition in terms of magnitude of risk of shipping waste over \nthousands of miles. Remember, most of these reactors are in the East \nand would be transported virtually from coast to coast, a very \ndifferent proposition again.\n  Something else that we have tried to make understandable in this \ndebate to our opponents is the fact that the casks that would be used \nhave not yet been designed, nor have they been manufactured. So we are \ntalking about a totally different reconfigured cask that will take some \ntime.\n  I invite my colleagues' attention to the testimony of Dr. Jared \nCohon, again, earlier this year when he indicated that it is not just a \nsiting decision. He says:\n\n       But developing a storage facility--\n\n  And he is referring there, again, to interim storage--\n\n       requires more than a siting decision. It also requires the \n     development of a transportation system, and it is likely that \n     such transportation system will take several years to \n     develop.\n\n  So the notion that somehow instantaneously this problem is taken care \nof, just pass S. 104 and all of our problems go away.\n  I want to respond to one other issue briefly before concluding. The \nnotion is somehow fostered here that if an interim storage facility is \nlocated at the Nevada test site, that rather than having 109 different \nreactor sites around the country where nuclear waste is stored, we will \nhave only one. Mr. President, that is not correct. We will have 110, \nnot 109.\n  Many people may not be familiar with the fact that immediately after \na spent fuel cell assembly is removed from the reactor because it no \nlonger has the efficiency necessary to generate electrical power, it is \nstored for many, many years in a spent-fuel pond or pool for it to cool \noff for a period of time. We are talking about reactors that are \nlicensed up to the period of 2033. So we are going to have nuclear \nwaste stored at many sites around the country for many, many years, \nirrespective of S. 104.\n  So the notion that is held out of ``pass this bill and we will have \nno nuclear waste other than at the site designated in this bill, the \nNevada test site,'' is certainly a false premise and, indeed, once the \nwaste is removed, the reactor itself remains and is hazardous for an \nextended period of time.\n  There are many things we will be talking about in more detail during \nthe course of the debate over the next few days. But no matter how they \ntry to recast this as a different piece of legislation, some chameleon-\nhued piece of nuclear legislation, when you get to the very essence, \nthe core of the legislation, its fatal and unperfectable flaw is that \nit calls for siting interim storage before the decision is made on the \npermanent facility, and no one in the scientific community is arguing \nfor that proposition.\n  So this is nuclear politics, and we are simply responding to the \nbidding of the nuclear utility industry, which, for more than a decade \nnow, has urged the Congress, in one form or another, to remove the \nreactor waste, send it somewhere else, send it anywhere, but get it out \nfrom under us, and that is the objection that the policymakers, who \nhave given this their thoughtful attention--the President of the United \nStates and others--have said that is what is wrong with this \nlegislation. It is what was wrong with the legislation in 1996, and \nthat has not changed in the original form in which this bill was \nintroduced, and based upon the discussion of the chairman of the \ncommittee, it has not changed in the substitute that is being proposed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I send a cloture motion to the desk to the \npending committee substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby\n\n[[Page S2900]]\n\n     move to bring to a close debate on the substitute amendment \n     to S. 104, the Nuclear Policy Act:\n\n         Trent Lott, Frank Murkowski, Lauch Faircloth, Phil Gramm, \n           Craig Thomas, Gordon Smith, Ted Stevens, Pete Domenici, \n           Slade Gorton, Larry Craig, William Roth, Conrad Burns, \n           Spencer Abraham, Bob Smith, Susan Collins, and Don \n           Nickles.\n  Mr. LOTT.

These deeply rooted American qualities spur our \ndetermination to explore new scientific frontiers and spark our can-do \nspirit of technological innovation. Continued American leadership \ndepends on our enduring commitment to science, to technology, to \nlearning, to research.\n  Science and technology are transforming our world, providing an age \nof possibility and a time of change as profound as we have seen in a \ncentury. We are well-prepared to shape this change and seize the \nopportunities so as to enable every American to make the most of their \nGod-given promise. One of the most important ways to realize this \nvision is through thoughtful investments in science and technology. \nSuch investments drive economic growth, generate new knowledge, create \nnew jobs, build new industries, ensure our national security, protect \nthe environment, and improve the health and quality of life of our \npeople.\n  This biennial report to the Congress brings together numerous \nelements of our integrated investment agenda to promote scientific \nresearch, catalyze technological innovation, sustain a sound business \nenvironment for research and development, strengthen national security, \nbuild global stability, and advance educational quality and equality \nfrom grade school to graduate school. Many achievements are presented \nin the report, together with scientific and technological opportunities \ndeserving greater emphasis in the coming years.\n  Most of the Federal research and education investment portfolio \nenjoyed bipartisan support during my first Administration. With the \nstart of a new Administration, I hope to extend this partnership with \nthe Congress across the entire science and technology portfolio. Such a \npartnership to stimulate scientific discovery and new technologies will \ntake America into the new century well-equipped for the challenges and \nopportunities that lie ahead.\n  The future, it is often said, has no constituency. But the truth is, \nwe must all be the constituency of the future. We have a duty--to \nourselves, to our children, to future generations--to make these \nfarsighted investments in science and technology to help us master this \nmoment of change and to build a better America for the 21st century.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to require the display of the POW/MIA flag on various \noccasions and in various locations; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n              the NATIONAL POW/MIA RECOGNITION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I want to begin my statement today \ndescribing a powerful and emotional sight that moves us to the core of \nour faith and beliefs about America and about those who served in the \nArmed Forces of our Nation.\n  Many of us have visited one or more of the military academies that \ntrain our future military leaders. These academies have varied missions \nand yet all of them share in the critical task of developing leaders \nfor their particular service. On the grounds of each academy is a \nchapel, a spectacular place that at once identifies itself as a place \nof worship.\n  In each chapel, a place has been reserved for the prisoners of war \nand the missing in action from their particular service. A pew has been \nset aside and marked by a candle, a powerful symbol that not all have \nreturned from battle. This hallowed place has been set aside so that \nall POW's and MIA's are remembered with dignity and honor. It is a \nmoving and emotional moment to pause at this reserved pew, to be \nencouraged by the burning candle, to recall the valor and sacrifice of \nthose soldiers, sailors, and pilots and to be inspired today by what \nthey have done.\n  We can do more to honor the memory of the POW's and MIA's who have \nserved in our Nation's wars.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing the National POW/MIA Recognition \nAct of 1997. This act would authorize the POW/MIA flag to be displayed \nover military installations, post offices, and memorials around the \nNation and other appropriate places of significance on Armed Forces \nDay, Memorial Day, Flag Day, Independence Day, Veterans Day, National \nPOW/MIA Recognition Day, and on the last business day before each of \nthe preceding holidays. A companion bill has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives by Congresswoman Jane Harman from California.\n  Congress has officially recognized the National League of Families \nPOW/MIA flag. Displaying this flag would be a powerful symbol to all \nAmericans that we have not forgotten--and will not forget.\n  As you know, the United States has fought in many wars, and thousands \nof Americans who served in those wars were captured by the enemy or \nlisted as missing in action. In 20th century wars alone, more than \n147,000 Americans were captured and became prisoners of war; of that \nnumber more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When we add to the \nnumber those who are still missing in action, we realize that more can \nbe done to honor their commitment to duty, honor, and country.\n  The display of the POW/MIA flag would be a forceful reminder that we \ncare not only for them, but also for their families who personally \ncarry with them the burden on sacrifice. We want them to know that they \ndo not stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they \nremember the loyalty and devotion of those who served.\n  As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the \nremembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and \nmost noble acts we can do. Let us now demonstrate our indebtedness and \ngratitude for those who served that we might live in freedom.\n  Just as those special reserved pews in the chapels of the military \nacademies recall the spirit and presence of our POW's and MIA's, so too \nwill the display of their flag over military installations and other \nGovernment offices be a special reminder that we have not forgotten--\nand will not forget. Before this coming Memorial Day I invite my Senate \ncolleagues to please join me in passing this bill to display the POW/\nMIA flag on national days of celebration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n[[Page S2902]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to exclude \ncertain farm rental income from net earnings from self-employment if \nthe taxpayer enters into a lease agreement relating to such income; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                   the FARM INDEPENDENCE ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill on the \nInternal Revenue Code. From time to time we need to change the Internal \nRevenue Code, particularly when it deals with agriculture. However, \nthere may be some people listening who do not understand agriculture. \nThey may see these efforts as doing something special for farmers. I \nwant to clarify today that I am a person who comes from the school of \nthought that every penny of legal tax that is owed the Federal \nGovernment should be paid. But I think, also, we have a responsibility, \nas Representatives of the people, to make sure that we balance \ntaxpayers' compliance with taxpayers' rights.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is centered on a proposition \nthat has been the law for approximately 40 years. It proscribes that \nmost farm landlords, just like small business people and other \ncommercial landlords, should not have to pay self-employment tax on \ncash rent income. For 40 years it has been that way for farm people and \ncity people alike. But in 1995, there was an Arkansas Federal tax court \ncase that said the IRS could take other expansive factors into \nconsideration. As a result of that tax case, the IRS decided to issue a \nrelated technical advice memorandum. These are widely deemed to be IRS \npolicy statements on the law. As a result, many farm landlords are now \ntreated differently from commercial and other city landlords. \nConsequently, farmers and retired farmers now find themselves paying \n15.3 percent self-employment tax on cash rent.\n  So, I say to the IRS, as I give an explanation for my legislation \nthis morning: Don't try to game the system. The law remains what people \nhave counted on for 40 years. Unless there is an act of Congress, you \nought to respect history before you change the rules. Obviously, the \ntest of time ought to prove the taxpayer was right and the IRS was \nwrong, particularly since there now is a difference between the farm \nsector and the city sector.\n  The correct rationale is simple, the self employment tax applies to \nincome from labor or employment. Income from cash rents represents the \nvalue of ownership or equity in land, not labor or employment. \nTherefore, the self employment tax should not ordinarily apply to \nincome from cash rents.\n  So, along with Senator Grams of Minnesota, I am introducing this bill \nso farmers and retired farmers are not going to be encroached upon by \nthe IRS and the Tax Code as a result of this Arkansas Federal tax court \ncase and the IRS technical advice memorandum. The IRS has thus, through \nthis court case and broadened by its own pronouncement, introduced a \nnew barrier to the family farmer. Our legislation would remove this new \nIRS barrier so that farm families and retired farmers can continue to \noperate.\n  Specifically, our legislation would clarify that when the IRS is \napplying the self-employment tax to the cash rent farm leases, it \nshould limit its inquisition to the lease agreement. This is not an \nexpansion of the law for the taxpayers. Rather, it is a narrowing of an \nantitaxpayer expansion initiated by the Internal Revenue Service. The \ntax law does not ordinarily require cash rent landlords in cities to \npay the self-employment tax. Indeed, cash rent farm landlords are the \nonly ones occasionally required to pay the tax. This is due to a 40-\nyear-old exception that allowed the retired farmers of the late 1950's \nto become vested in the Social Security system.\n  However, the law originally imposed the tax on farm landlords only \nwhen their lease agreements with their renters required the landlord to \nparticipate in the operation of the farm and in the farming of the \nland.\n  Forty years later and we are here today, the IRS has expanded the \napplication of the self-employment tax for farmland owners. Now the Tax \nCourt has told the IRS that in one particular instance, the IRS could \nlook beyond the lease agreement. On this very limited authority, the \nIRS has unilaterally expanded the one court case even further so it now \napproximates a national tax policy.\n  Our legislation clarifies that the IRS should examine only the lease \nagreement. Thus, it would preserve the pre-1996 status quo. We want to \npreserve the historical self-employment tax treatment of farm rental \nagreements, equating them with landlords in small businesses and \ncommercial properties within the cities. The 1957 tax law was designed \nto benefit retired farmers of that generation so that they would \nqualify for Social Security.\n  So, obviously, those persons of the 1950's have all since passed from \nthe scene. Their children and grandchildren are now the victims of this \nIRS expansion of their old rule. Congress does not intend that farm \nowners be treated differently from other real estate owners, other than \nas they have been historically. We need the clarity provided in our \nlegislation in order to turn back an improper, unilateral, and targeted \nIRS expansion of old tax law.

Mr. President, I rise this morning in strong support of \nthe Farm Independence Act of 1997 which my good friend, Senator \nGrassley, and I introduce here today. This legislation is critical in \nprotecting American farmers and ranchers from yet another IRS attack--\nthe third this year--on the family farm.\n  I suspect when President Grover Cleveland remarked that, ``just when \nyou thought you were making ends meet, someone moves the ends,'' the \nformer President must have been thinking about the Internal Revenue \nService.\n  This time, the IRS has issued a decision in one of its technical \nadvice memoranda that, if fully enforced, will result in a 15.3-percent \ntax increase for thousands of farmers. Let me repeat that. A recent IRS \ndecision could result in a 15.3-percent tax increase for thousands of \nfarmers.\n  Essentially, if a producer incorporates--and many Minnesota \nproducers, both small and large, do--and then rents his land to the \nfarm corporation, the rental income the farmer receives is not only \nsubject to income tax but to an additional 15.3-percent self-employment \ntax.\n  The purpose of the Grassley-Grams Farm Independence Act of 1997 is \nsimple and it is straightforward. Our bill would stop the IRS from \nimposing this 15.3-percent tax increase on our farmers and ranchers.\n  Mr. President, last Congress, we passed the most sweeping reforms in \nagricultural policy in 60 years and gave farmers the freedom to farm. \nAt that time, we also promised farmers regulatory relief, improved \nresearch and risk management, free and fair trade, and--perhaps most \nimportantly--we promised farmers tax relief.\n  Now, many of us in Congress have made tax relief a top priority. I do \nso, in part, because it is a top priority for Minnesota farmers, and \ntoward this end, I am an original cosponsor of a bill to repeal the \nestate tax, and I strongly support legislation to cut capital gains \ntaxes.\n  But, unfortunately, we haven't made much progress in convincing the \nPresident and some in Congress that this is not fat-cat legislation but \nabsolutely necessary for the survival and success of the family farm.\n  But, even more frustrating than these obstacles to providing farmers \nwith critical relief from the death tax and capital gains taxes are \nback-door attempts by the IRS to actually raise taxes on our farmers \nand ranchers.\n  First, came the alternative minimum tax which attacked cash-based \naccounting. Second, came a decision that income from culled cows--cows \nthat don't milk--is income that disqualifies low-income farmers from \nreceiving the earned income tax credit. And, now, the IRS wants to \nexact a 15.3-percent tax increase on thousands of American farmers and \nranchers.\n  Mr. President, I am 100 percent committed to providing Minnesota \nfarmers with tax relief they desperately need. I hope the President and \nothers in Congress come around on this issue as well.\n  But, at a bare minimum, the President should send a signal to the IRS \nthat these back-door attempts to raise revenues on the backs of the \nNation's farmers and ranchers is totally unacceptable.\n  I am convinced that a second gold age of agriculture is within reach \nin the final days of this century and also the whole of the next if \nonly we in Government help--rather than hinder--our farmers' and \nranchers' efforts.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Farm \nIndependence Act of 1997. I also commend the Senator from Iowa for his \nleadership on this issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL:\n  S. 530. A bill to amend title 11, United States Code, to limit the \nvalue of certain real and personal property that a debtor may elect to \nexempt under State or local law, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                the BANKRUPTCY ABUSE REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Bankruptcy \nAbuse Reform Act of 1997, legislation which addresses a serious problem \nthat threatens Americans' confidence in our bankruptcy laws. The \nmeasure would cap at $100,000 the State homestead exemption that an \nindividual filing for personal bankruptcy can claim. It passed the \nSenate last term when it was included into the Bankruptcy Technical \nCorrections Act (S. 1559), and I hope that we can all support this \nmeasure again this year. The goal of our measure is simple but vitally \nimportant: to make sure that our Bankruptcy Code is more than just a \nbeachball for crooked millionaires who want to hide their assets.\n  Let me tell you why this legislation is critically needed. In chapter \n7 Federal personal bankruptcy proceedings, the debtor is allowed to \nexempt certain possessions and interests from being used to satisfy his \noutstanding debts. One of the chief things that a debtor seeks to \nprotect is his home, and I agree with that in principle. Few question \nthat debtors should be able to keep the roofs over their heads. But, in \npractice, this homestead exemption has become a source of abuse.\n  Under section 522 of the Code, a debtor may opt to exempt his home \naccording to local, State, or Federal bankruptcy provisions. The \nFederal exemption allows the debtor to shield up to $15,000 of value in \nhis house. The State exemptions vary tremendously: some States do not \nallow the debtor to exempt any of his home's value, while eight States \nset no ceiling and allow an unlimited exemption. The vast majority of \nStates have exemptions under $40,000.\n  My amendment under section 522 would cap State exemptions so that no \ndebtor could ever exempt more than $100,000 of the value of his home.\n  Mr. President, in the last few years, the ability of debtors to use \nState homestead exemptions has led to flagrant abuses of the Bankruptcy \nCode. Multimillionaire debtors have moved to one of the eight States \nthat have unlimited exemptions--most often Florida or Texas--bought \nmulti-million-dollar houses, and continued to live like kings even \nafter declaring bankruptcy. This shameless manipulation of the \nBankruptcy Code cheats creditors out of compensation and rewards only \nthose who can game the system. Oftentimes, the creditor who is robbed \nis the American taxpayer. In recent years, S swindlers, insider \ntrading convicts, and other shady characters have managed to protect \ntheir ill-gotten gains through this loophole.\n  One infamous S banker with more than $4 billion in claims against \nhim bought a multi-million-dollar horse ranch in Florida. Another man \nwho pled guilty to insider trading abuses lives in a 7,000-square-foot \nbeachfront home worth $3.25 million--all tucked away from the $2.75 \nbillion in suits against him. We read even now about the possibility \nthat O.J. Simpson may seek to avoid the civil suit judgment against him \nbuying a lavish home in Florida, a State with an unlimited exemption, \nand declaring bankruptcy to avoid paying his multimillion-dollar \nobligations. These deadbeats get wealthier while legitimate creditors--\nincluding the U.S. Government--get the short end of the stick.\n\n  Simply put, the current practice is grossly unfair and contravenes \nthe intent of our laws: People are supposed to get a fresh start, not a \nhead start, under the Bankruptcy Code.\n  In addition, these unlimited homestead exemptions have made it \nincreasingly difficult for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \nand the Resolution Trust Corporation to go after S crooks. With the \nS crisis costing us billions of dollars and with a deficit that still \nremains unacceptably high, we owe it to the taxpayers to make it as \nhard as possible for those responsible for fraud to profit from their \nwrongs.\n  Mr. President, the legislation that I have introduced today is \nsimple, effective, and straightforward. It caps the homestead exemption \nat $100,000, which is close to the average price of an\n\n[[Page S2904]]\n\nAmerican house. And it will protect middle class Americans while \npreventing the abuses that are making the American middle class \nquestion the integrity of our laws--the abuses the average American \ntaxpayer is paying for out of pocket.\n  Indeed, it is even generous to debtors. Other than the eight States \nthat have no limit to the homestead exemption, no State has a homestead \nexemption exceeding $100,000. In fact, 38 States have exemptions of \n$40,000 or less. My own home State of Wisconsin has a $40,000 exemption \nand that, in my opinion, is more than sufficient.\n  Mr. President, this proposal is an effort to make our bankruptcy laws \nmore equitable. I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 530\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge as wilderness; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n              ARCTIC NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I read recently that ``the best thing we \nhave learned from nearly five hundred years of contact with the \nAmerican wilderness is restraint,'' the need to stay our hand and \npreserve our precious environment and future resources rather than \ndestroy them for momentary gain.\n  With this in mind, Ioffer legislation today that designates the \ncoastal plain of Alaska as wilderness area. At the moment this area is \na national wildlife refuge--one of our beautiful and last frontiers. By \nchanging its designation, Mr. President, we can protect it forever.\n  And I can't stress how important this is.\n  The Alaskan wilderness area is not only a critical part of our \nEarth's ecosystem--the last remaining region where the complete \nspectrum of arctic and subarctic ecosystems comes together--but it is a \nvital part of our national consciousness. It is a place we can cherish \nand visit for our soul's good. It offers us a sense of well-being and \npromises that not all dreams have been dreamt.\n  The Alaskan wilderness is a place of outstanding wildlife, wilderness \nand recreation, a land dotted by beautiful forests, dramatic peaks and \nglaciers, gentle foothills and undulating tundra. It is untamed--rich \nwith caribou, polar bear, grizzly, wolves, musk oxen, Dall sheep, \nmoose, and hundreds of thousands of birds--snow geese, tundra swans, \nblack brant, and more. In all, about 165 species use the coastal plain.\n  It is an area of intense wildlife activity. Animals give birth, nurse \nand feed their young, and set about the critical business of fueling up \nfor winters of unspeakable severity.\n  The fact is, Mr. President, there are parts of this Earth where it is \ngood that man can come only as a visitor. These are the pristine lands \nthat belong to all of us. And perhaps most importantly, these are the \nlands that belong to our future.\n  Considering the many reasons why this bill is so important, I came \nacross the words of the great Western writer, Wallace Stegner. \nReferring to the land we are trying to protect with this legislation, \nhe wrote that it is ``the most splendid part of the American habitat; \nit is also the most fragile.'' And we cannot enter ``it carrying habits \nthat [are] inappropriate and expectations that [are] surely \nexcessive.''\n  The expectations for oil exploration in this pristine region are \nexcessive. There is only a 1-in-5 chance of finding any economically \nrecoverable oil in the refuge. And if oil is found, the daily \nproduction of 400,000 barrels per day is less than 0.7 percent of world \nproduction--far too small to meet America's energy needs for more than \na few months.\n  In other words, Mr. President, there is much more to lose than might \never be gained by tearing this frontier apart. Already, some 90 percent \nof Alaska's entire North Slope is open to oil and gas leasing and \ndevelopment. Let's keep this area as the jewel amid the stones.\n  What this bill offers--and what we need--is a brand of pragmatic \nenvironmentalism, an environmental stewardship that protects our \nimportant wilderness areas and precious resources, while carefully and \njudiciously weighing the short-term desires or our country against its \nlong-term needs.\n  Together, we need to embrace environmental policies that are workable \nand pragmatic, policies based on the desire to make the world a better \nplace for us and for future generations. I believe a strong economy, \nliberty, and progress are possible only when we have a healthy planet--\nonly when resources are managed through wise stewardship--only when an \nenvironmental ethic thrives among nations--and only when people have \nfrontiers that are untrammeled and able to host their fondest dreams.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join again with Senator \nRoth in this effort to designate the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as \na wilderness area.\n  This legislation would save the American people the huge social and \nenvironmental costs of unwise and unnecessary development of one of \nnature's crown jewels. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the last \ncomplete Alaskan wilderness with elements of each tundra ecosystem, the \nbiological heart of the North Slope of Alaska. It is on a par with our \nother great national resources, including the Grand Canyon, \nYellowstone, Jackson Hole, the Badlands, Glacier Bay, and Denali. This \nis a unique piece of God's Earth that must be preserved for our entire \nNation for centuries to come.\n  Make no mistake, environmental impacts to the Arctic National Refuge \nfrom oil development would be severe and irreversible. The refuge \nincludes the calving grounds for one of the largest caribou herds in \nNorth America, the Porcupine herd--152,000 strong. Native American \ncustoms have centered around the herd's annual migration for at least \n20,000 years. The refuge is a treasure chest of plants, animals, and \nwilderness unique to the world in terms of abundance, diversity, and \nvalue to humankind. Over 200 species of plants and animals thrive in \nthe refuge, including muskoxen, snow geese, Arctic foxes, Arctic \ngrayling, and Arctic char. It is the only natural area in the United \nStates with all three species of North American bears--the black bear, \nthe grizzly bear and the polar bear. It is one of the most natural \nareas in our Nation, untouched by development, and the last of its \nkind.\n  Many environmental studies demonstrate that the negative \nenvironmental effects of opening the Arctic Refuge to development will \nbe severe. Biologists from Federal and State agencies and universities \nhave concluded that oil development will harm the calving of the \ncaribou herd, and reduce its long term numbers very significantly. The \nOffice of Management and Budget has stated that ``exploration and \ndevelopment activities would bring physical disturbances to the area, \nunacceptable risks of oil spills and pollution, and long-term effects \nthat would harm wildlife for decades.'' Raymond Cameron, formerly of \nthe Alaska Department of Fish and Game, documented that 19 percent\n\n[[Page S2905]]\n\nfewer calves are born to caribou cows on developed lands as opposed to \nundeveloped lands, with a 2-percent margin of error. His study also \ndocumented that caribou cows miss yearly calving at a 36-percent rate \nin developed areas, versus only 19 percent in undeveloped areas. Even a \nsmall change in calving success can lead to long-term population \ndeclines. A study by the State of Alaska showed that the Arctic caribou \nherd at Prudhoe Bay declined from 23,400 to 18,100--23 percent--since \n1992. All the population decline occurred in habitat affected by oil \ndevelopment, while herds in undeveloped areas grew slightly. Biologists \nfear that development impacts would be proportionately greater on the \nherd that uses the Arctic Refuge.\n  The amount of oil that potentially can be recovered from the Arctic \nRefuge is simply too small to affect our energy security, and too \ndestructive to the environment to be worth it. A 1995 assessment of \npetroleum reserves by the U.S. Geological Survey reported that there is \na 95-percent chance that only 148 million barrels of oil exist in the \nrefuge. This would amount to a drop in the national oil bucket--an 8-\nday supply. Even if the USGS high estimate were correct, the refuge \nwould hold at most a 290-day supply for the United States.\n  We can all hope for another strike like Prudhoe Bay. But the simple \nreality, based on the very best geological science and economics \navailable today, is that alternative energy supplies, as well as the \nreal energy savings from national energy conservation programs, are far \nmore reliable, tangible, and less destructive energy sources than a \nwild gamble with the Alaskan wilderness.\n  The remaining 90 percent of the Alaskan North Slope is already open \nto oil and gas leasing. Is it too much to protect what little we have \nleft? Every reliable national poll conducted on this issue shows \nAmericans of all political persuasions are against development in the \nrefuge by a more than three to one margin. Let's honor our history of \nconservation and protect the future for generations to come, by saving \nthe Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr. Thomas, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Craig, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Roberts, Mr. \n        Kerrey, and Mr. Grassley):\n\n  S. 532. A bill to authorize funds to further the strong Federal \ninterest in the improvement of highways and transportation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n  SURFACE TRANSPORTATION AUTHORIZATION AND REGULATORY STREAMLINING ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nSurface Transportation Authorization and Regulatory Streamlining Act, \nor STARS 2000. I am joined in this effort by my colleagues on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, Senators Kempthorne and Thomas. \nAnd by Senators Dorgan, Conrad, Daschle, Johnson, Burns, Craig, Enzi, \nHarkin, Bingaman, Roberts, and Kerrey of Nebraska.\n\n  This bill reauthorizes this Nation's surface transportation programs \nfor the year 2000, and beyond.\n  As most of my colleagues know, we must act soon to renew these \nprograms since today's law, the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act, or ISTEA, will expire on September 30.\n  STARS 2000 builds on the progress already made by ISTEA. But it also \nmakes some important improvements. Let me focus on the three most \nsignificant aspects of the bill.\n\n\n                             funding levels\n\n  First, the bill increases funding for our highway programs to $27 \nbillion annually. Transportation is a critical part of our Nation's \neconomic growth and prosperity. The investments we make today in \ntransportation will help keep us globally competitive well into the \nnext century.\n  Furthermore, these investments directly generate hundreds of \nthousands of jobs--in Montana, in Idaho, in Illinois, in every State. \nThey also indirectly help sustain businesses and millions more jobs all \nacross the country.\n  The funding in STARS 2000 will support all types of transportation \nprojects. It also will enable States and local governments to make the \ninvestment decisions that best reflect their transportation priorities.\n  The funding level in STARS 2000 corresponds to the amount of money \nestimated to be in the highway trust fund over the next 6 years.\n  As my colleagues know, this is money already being collected from the \ntax on gasoline and other fuels. My view is that we should spend it for \nthe purpose for which it was collected.\n  Even with this increase, however, we will not eliminate the shortfall \nin meeting our transportation needs. The Department of Transportation \nestimates that over $50 billion would be needed each year in order to \njust maintain current highway and bridge conditions.\n  Yet, today annual spending by all levels of government is only $39 \nbillion per year.\n  Our competitors know the advantage of a sound transportation system. \nThat is why Japan invests over four times what we do in transportation \nas a percentage of GDP. The Europeans spend twice as much.\n  We cannot afford to squander this important competitive edge. While \nSTARS 2000 is not the complete solution, it is a big step in the right \ndirection.\n\n\n                              streamlining\n\n  Second, STARS 2000 dramatically streamlines and simplifies today's \ntransportation programs. It reduces administrative burdens on the \nStates and the complexity of the programs by consolidating several \nfunding categories and by allowing for greater flexibility in \ndecisionmaking.\n  The bill has two key categories for funding. The National Highway \nSystem, which makes up 60 percent of the core program, and the Surface \nTransportation Program, which accounts for the remaining 40 percent.\n  The National Highway System carries the bulk of our recreational and \ncommercial traffic. It consists of 160,000 miles of highways, including \nthe entire 45,000 mile Interstate System.\n  These roads connect our cities and towns. Our farms to their markets. \nAnd our manufacturing facilities to our seaports. It just makes sense \nthat the NHS should be a priority.\n  STARS 2000 devotes over $14 billion annually to these roads.\n  As with current law, the Surface Transportation Program remains the \nmost flexible category of funds. States can shift funds among projects \nto best serve their transportation needs. STARS 2000 retains ISTEA's \nprograms and project eligibilities and includes over $9 billion \nannually for them.\n\n\n                            funding formulas\n\n  Third, STARS 2000 updates ISTEA's funding formulas. One criticism of \nthe current formulas is that they are based on outdated and unnecessary \ndata.\n  This bill rectifies that problem by using up-to-date information.\n  The STARS formula also reflects the transportation needs of a State. \nWe have included such factors as lane miles, vehicle miles traveled, \nand freeze-thaw cycles, to better account for the cost of maintaining \nand improving our highway system.\n\n\n                              environment\n\n  STARS 2000 also continues the commitment to the environment that \nbegan in ISTEA. It dedicates some $380 million annually to congestion \nmitigation and air quality projects.\n  Furthermore, it requires that these funds be spent on projects in \nareas that have not attained our transportation-related air quality \nstandards.\n  Frankly, I had hoped to include more funding for these projects in \nthis bill. But as this legislation progresses, I intend to work with my \ncolleagues to see if we can't be more generous here.\n  STARS 2000 also continues the transportation enhancement program. \nThis is an innovative program that has given States the ability to \ninvest in nontraditional highway projects such as bike paths, \npedestrian walkways and historic preservation.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In conclusion, STARS 2000 is a good bill. But it also is one of \nseveral bills that our committee will consider in the coming weeks.\n  Under the leadership of our chairman, Senator Chafee and our \nsubcommittee chairman, Senator Warner, along with Senator Moynihan, and \nothers, I have no doubt that these various\n\n[[Page S2906]]\n\nproposals will be brought together to produce a fair bill.\n  A bill that will bring this Nation and its transportation system into \nthe next century.\n  Before yielding the floor, I wish to thank the primary cosponsors of \nthis bill, Senators Kempthorne and Thomas, for their hard work in \ndeveloping this legislation. I am also grateful for the help of our \nState transportation departments, particularly in Montana and Idaho, \nand their staff, in fashioning this bill.\n  STARS 2000 brings a new approach and some new ideas to our surface \ntransportation policy. I commend it to my colleagues for their \nconsideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \nshort summary of it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 532\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This \n     figure includes annual revenue, interest accumulated from \n     unobligated balances, and the gradual spend-down of \n     unobligated balances.\n       STARS 2000 funding levels are approximately $27 billion \n     annually.\n       The breakdown is as follows:\n\n[[Page S2913]]\n\n       National Highway System--$14.163 billion\n       Surface Transportation Program--$9.442 billion\n       Equity programs--approximately $2.8 billion\n       Federal lands programs\n       1. Indian reservation roads--$191 million\n       2. Public lands highways--$172 million\n       3. Parks and Parkways--$84 million\n       Cooperative Federal Lands Transportation Program (new)--\n     $155 million\n       Territories--$35 million\n       Recreational Trails--$30 million\n\n\n                            FUNDING FORMULAS\n\n       STARS 2000 funding formulas are based heavily on the extent \n     and use of a State's highway system. Interstate lane miles \n     and vmt, NHS lane miles and vmt, federal-aid lane miles and \n     vmt, square footage of bridges, diesel sales and 4 other \n     formula factors consisting of air quality, federal land \n     ownership, population in relation to lane miles and freeze/\n     thaw cycles.\n       STARS 2000 also includes a 95% minimum allocation equity \n     account.\n\n\n                          STREAMLINED PROGRAM\n\n       Under STARS 2000, the federal program is streamlined in \n     order to allow the program to be highly flexible. This \n     enables different States to choose projects that meet their \n     transportation priorities. Projects such as highway \n     reconstruction, safety improvements, transit, bridges, \n     enhancements, CMAQ projects or other eligible investments.\n\n\n                        national highway system\n\n       Funding for the National Highway System represents sixty \n     percent of the core formula program under STARS 2000. Funds \n     may be used for Interstate maintenance activities, bridge \n     improvements and other uses eligible under today's current \n     NHS program.\n\n\n                     surface transportation program\n\n       Funding for the Surface Transportation Program (STP) \n     represents forty percent of the core formula program under \n     STARS 2000. Under this flexible program, funds may be used \n     for projects eligible under today's Surface Transportation \n     Program and projects eligible under today's Congestion \n     Mitigation and Air Quality (CMAQ) program.\n\n\n                              enhancements\n\n       STARS 2000 retains the transportation enhancement program. \n     Today, the core of the enhancement program is a 10% set-aside \n     of the $4 billion STP program--$400 million. STARS 2000 \n     requires 5% of the new $9.44 billion STP program be set-aside \n     annually--approximately $480 million. Eligibility under the \n     enhancement program is not changed.\n\n\n                            safety programs\n\n       Current law requires a 10% set-aside of STP funds for \n     railway crossing elimination and hazard elimination programs.\n       STARS 2000 retains this set-aside (10% of what a State \n     received under the STP category in 1997), but gives States \n     additional flexibility in meeting this requirement. States \n     must spend at least 2.5% of the requirement on railway-\n     highway crossing projects, at least 2.5% of the requirement \n     on hazard elimination projects and the remaining 5% may be \n     used for either program at the discretion of the State.\n\n\n                             bridge program\n\n       STARS 2000 eliminates the bridge program as a separate \n     category. However, STARS 2000 retains the national commitment \n     to bridges repairs by requiring every State to spend at least \n     as much on bridges as it does today, using National Highway \n     System or Surface Transportation Program funds.\n       The bridge discretionary program is also retained at FY \n     1997 levels--$60.5 million annually to be funded from the NHS \n     and STP program.\n\n\n                 congestion mitigation and air quality\n\n       STARS 2000 eliminates the CMAQ program as a separate \n     category. However, included in the Surface Transportation \n     Program funding formula is an ``air quality'' factor. States \n     that receive funds under the air quality factor--which are \n     those States that receive CMAQ funds under today's CMAQ \n     formula for their nonattainment areas--would be required to \n     spend such funds in their nonattainment areas for CMAQ \n     eligible projects. This provision translates into a $380 \n     million air quality program.\n\n\n                          recreational trails\n\n       STARS 2000 proposes a $30 million annual funding level for \n     the National Recreational Trails program. Funds are to be \n     used for both motorized and nonmotorized trails, consistent \n     with current law. The matching requirement has been adjusted \n     from today's 50/50 matching ratio to a new 80/20 matching \n     ratio.\n\n\n                             federal lands\n\n       STARS 2000 retains the current federal lands categories--\n     public lands, Indian reservation roads, parks and parkways. \n     Current funding levels are retained as well.\n       A new Federal lands category, the Cooperative Federal Lands \n     Transportation Program is also proposed at $155 million \n     annually. These funds are to be used by States to improve \n     State-owned or maintained roads that lead to, are adjacent to \n     or pass through Federal lands or reservations.\n\n\n                           regulatory review\n\n       The Department of Transportation is required to review all \n     significant rules it has issued. Any rules that are obsolete, \n     overlapping, duplicative or conflict with other Federal rules \n     shall be either amended, rescinded or continued without \n     change after such periodic review.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise this morning to talk about the \nreauthorization of the Federal highway bill. I am very pleased to join \nwith Senators Baucus and Kempthorne in the introduction of the Surface \nTransportation Authorization and Regulatory Streamlining Act for the \nNext Century, STARS 2000. I am also pleased that there will be 14 \noriginal cosponsors in support of this important legislation.\n  This is the time for the reauthorization of the Federal highway bill, \ncalled ISTEA, that has been in place for the past 6 years and has made \na very important contribution to this country and its transportation. \nIt has made some important changes in our surface transportation \npolicies, but as we move into the 21st century, we need to update the \nlaw and make it more flexible and more efficient in order to meet the \ntransportation challenges of the new century. I believe STARS 2000, \nachieves this goal. It will create new rules of the road to help us to \nbuild the highways and bridges to the 21st century.\n  With respect to the gas tax, it is a user fee, of course, that each \nof us pay as we buy gas wherever we are in this country. American \ntaxpayers have been shortchanged with regard to the benefits they are \ngetting from the gas tax. Not all of the gas taxes have been used for \nsurface transportation. We need to get back to a user-fee system where \nthe taxes paid, in this case by the users of highways, are used then \nfor surface transportation. STARS 2000 addresses this problem by \nrestoring the integrity of the fee system by spending as much out of \nthe highway fee system as it can sustain. We have been spending less \nthan $20 billion annually. STARS 2000 raises the authorization to $27 \nbillion. We believe those dollars ought to go into the highway system.\n  In addition, it provides a framework for any additional revenues such \nas the 4.3 cents that currently goes to deficit reduction. Should these \nuser fees be transferred to the highway trust fund, they would be \ndistributed according to the bill's formula. STARS 2000 will help my \nState and many States maintain a national system.\n  If you are going to go from Washington to California, you obviously \nhave to go throughout the whole country and therefore it is key to have \na Federal system. In my State, a small State in terms of population but \nlarge in terms of space, we pay more per capita than any other State, \nnearly $200 for every person in our State for highway gas taxes, and \nyet we have deteriorating bridges and roads, as do many States.\n  In addition, the Federal Government owns 50 percent of Wyoming. One \nof the principle authors of this bill and my friend, Senator \nKempthorne, his State of Idaho has even larger holdings. In Nevada, it \nis 86 percent federally owned so we have to take Federal lands into \naccount as we talk about a Federal system.\n  In fact, Yellowstone Park, located in Wyoming, has a backlog of \nnearly $250 million in road repairs and maintenance that needs to be \nconsidered. Unfortunately, we are not meeting these needs. For example, \nthe Clinton administration admits that this country only invests 70 \npercent of what needs to be invested just to maintain our \ntransportation infrastructure. These shortfalls hurt all taxpayers, of \ncourse. The STARS 2000 coalition States are bridge States--people and \ngoods cross these States to other destinations. A set of efficient and \nwell maintained roads are as important to the cities that export goods \nacross the country and around the world as they are to people in our \nStates. These transactions contribute to the Nation's economy and its \njob creation. STARS 2000 will make a smooth flow of people and goods \nacross the country a reality.\n  One of the keys to the highway program is that each State knows best \nwhat it should be doing with the resources it has, and its priorities \nare. Clearly, the highways and roads in New York City are quite \ndifferent than those in Wyoming or Nevada, so we need to have the \nflexibility for State and local officials to make the decisions there. \nSTARS 2000 does that by significantly increasing the surface \ntransportation program, the STP portion, and puts the decisionmaking \nauthority for how this money is allocated into the hands of state and \nlocal people.\n\n  Unfortunately, the administration bill, NEXTEA, is advertised as \nbuilding\n\n[[Page S2914]]\n\na bridge to the 21st century. Unfortunately, it is my belief that in \nits present form that bridge will collapse. NEXTEA does not restore the \nintegrity of the trust fund, so for the American taxpayer, there is no \ntrust in the trust fund. It does not streamline the program. It does \nnot make the kinds of changes that are needed. It hangs on to what we \nhave done in the past. It also handcuffs local authorities in terms of \nmaking decisions. NEXTEA adds regulations. God knows, we need to move \naway from regulations and allow the highway program to be more \nefficient.\n  STARS 2000 emphasizes the Federal component of our program and \nachieves a fair and equitable method of distribution. Based on a \npercentage share of the Federal highway program, 37 States do better \nand 1 tied compared to NEXTEA; 33 States do better than under the \ncurrent law; 25 States higher, 6 the same compared to STEP 21. In \naddition, STARS 2000 addresses the donor/donee issue by creating a 95 \npercent minimum allocation to all States. That means all States will \nget at least 95 percent of what they put into the highway trust fund.\n  The STARS 2000 coalition will be a significant factor in the ISTEA \nreauthorization debate. Without our coalition, without our States, you \ncannot get there from here--physically or politically. STARS 2000 is \nmore than a marker. It is a coalition of States that are needed to make \nan interstate map to the 21st century.\n  Quite often, in my experience in the House, the highway money flows \nwhere the votes are. But that really does not work in a transportation \nprogram. You have to have one that covers the country and is, indeed, a \nFederal program. The funding formulas under STARS 2000 are based on the \ntransportation needs of the country.\n  STARS 2000 maintains the integrity of the original ISTEA. It improves \nit by a smarter investment of taxpayers' money. It meets our growing \ninfrastructure needs. It increases job and economic growth and \nincreases flexibility and efficiency. We get more bang for the buck.\n  So we are emphasizing the National Highway System, allowing more \ndecisions to be made closer to home, and I certainly would submit to my \nfellow Members of the Senate this is a bill that we can all support and \nwill provide a better infrastructure for highway surface \ntransportation.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the time. I thank Senators Kempthorne and \nBaucus for their hard work on this legislation and look forward to \nworking with them in the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, may I commend my colleague from \nWyoming, Senator Thomas, for giving an excellent view as to the bill \nthat we are submitting to Congress today, the Surface Transportation \nAuthorization and Streamlining Act, or STARS 2000.\n  I appreciate the fact that Senator Thomas and Senator Baucus of \nMontana and I will be able to form this partnership, with many more \npartners in the Senate joining our effort, including the Senator from \nKansas, who will be joining us. I also want to recognize that I \nappreciate Senator John Warner, who is the chairman of this particular \nsubcommittee dealing with this issue of the national highway bill, for \nholding a hearing in the State of Idaho, for coming to Idaho so that \nthe western perspective could be made part of the public record. Also, \nSenator Baucus, who came to that hearing in Idaho--I appreciate my \nneighbor from Montana coming over and making that effort; it was an \nexcellent hearing--and, too, acknowledging Senator Chafee, the chairman \nof the full committee, making that hearing in the West a reality. So, \nagain, it demonstrates that all of us, while we may be coming at this \nfrom slightly different views, are working together. That is important \nand significant.\n  With STARS 2000, I believe, as Senator Thomas has pointed out, we are \ngoing to restore the integrity of what a trust fund is: a trust fund. \nSo the money that is gathered for that dedicated purpose ought to be \nused for that dedicated purpose. Doesn't that sound amazing that we \nwould have to even say that? But it is not happening. Currently we only \nauthorize about $18 billion that are to be used on the national highway \nprogram. The full amount that could be used, the maximum, is $27 \nbillion. So this legislation by Senator Baucus and Senator Thomas and \nmyself would authorize the full $27 billion to be used for the highways \nof this country, because that is why we have been collecting this \nhighway tax.\n  It provides a fair distribution throughout the United States, and it \nis going to address the very key issues, such as extent and usage of \nthe highways; the lane miles that are there; the poor air quality in \nsome regions of the country, some of the cities that are having \ndifficulty with poor air quality; the tax-exempt Federal lands, as have \nbeen referenced. In the State of Idaho we are 67 percent federally \nowned. In the State of Texas--I do not believe there is any federally \nowned land in the State of Texas. So you can see we come at this from \ndifferent perspectives. Low population density--Idaho is the 13th \nState, as far as ranking in landmass, yet we rank 41st in population. \nSo you can see there are not a lot of folks. Take the District of \nColumbia, for example, this city right here around Capitol Hill. It has \na little over one-half-million people. The State of Idaho has 1 million \npeople in the entire State, versus one-half-million in just this city.\n  It also authorizes full funding for the National Recreational Trails \nAct, $30 million annually, something that had been talked about and was \nto have occurred years ago. It has not done so. We are going to do \nright by that.\n  We also know there is this issue of the donor/donee States. Some \nStates put in their share, and they get more than they put in. Other \nStates put in their share, and they get less back than they put in. We \naddress that head on by increasing the minimum allocation program from \n90 percent up to 95 percent. Under STARS 2000 formulas and proposed \nincreased funding levels, it would result in 47 States receiving \ngreater funding than they do under the current ISTEA program. Mr. \nPresident, 47 States will actually receive more funds.\n\n  Again, as has been pointed out, we really do provide for the \nstreamlining, for greater flexibility, so those programs, such as the \nSurface Transportation Act--in essence, we double the funds in that \naccount. We double that, and then we say to the States and the local \ncommunities: Now, with that additional funding, you make the decisions \nof where you think your priorities are in your State, rather than \npeople back in Washington, DC, who may never have been to your State \ndetermining how it should be spent.\n  This is the national highway bill that we are talking about. I want \nto underscore national, because it is to apply to all 50 States. That \nis how we are going to have good interstate commerce. The \nadministration says they understand the needs of rural America. If they \nunderstand the needs of rural America, I question why the \nadministration's proposed reauthorization of the highway bill cuts \nfunding to eight of the most rural States in the country.\n  What is this question of rural and urban? Let me give an example, if \nI may, Mr. President. Here is the State of Idaho. I would use as an \nexample highway 95 that runs, in essence, from the Canadian border \nvirtually down to the Nevada border, a little over 500 miles. Again, \nthe State of Idaho, population of 1 million people. Let us take \nrelatively the same distance, and let us go from right here, \nWashington, DC, and if we drive to Boston, it is 463 miles--about the \nsame distance. So I am making it a good comparison. The difference is, \nhere you have one million people to support systems such as this. In \nthis area, where you actually go through seven States, not one State \nand the District of Columbia, you have virtually 43 million people as a \ntax base to support that infrastructure. It just shows you that in the \nless densely populated areas we do need to have assistance.\n  Do you know there are trucking firms that enter the State of Idaho at \nEastport to go through customs? Then they immediately exit the State of \nIdaho and they travel the Canadian highways heading toward Seattle, for \nexample, and then reenter the United States. Why do they do that? As \none trucking company, Swift Transportation, testified at our hearing \nout in Idaho, they have 5,000 trucks that run throughout the United \nStates, but they said there are so many significantly unsafe portions \nof, for example, highway 95, they do not allow their truck\n\n[[Page S2915]]\n\ndrivers to go on highway 95 because of safety considerations. They said \nthat is the only stretch of highway that they really have that sort of \nrestriction on anywhere in the United States.\n  Yet this is a national highway bill. It is not the national and \nCanadian highway bill. So we need to address this, and that is what \nthis does. But it is not parochial. Certainly I am trying to look out \nfor rural America, but I reiterate, this legislation does better for 47 \nStates than under the current program that is in existence today.\n  So I believe we have something here that is good for the country. It \nis going to put the faith back into what a trust fund is supposed to \nbe. It is going to give greater flexibility for those of us who believe \nin States rights, the 10th amendment; that folks in those 50 States can \nmake just as good if not better decisions than we do at the Federal \nlevel. So it has so much to offer to so many.\n  Again, I am proud to be part of this, and I thank Senator Thomas and \nSenator Baucus for their efforts in this partnership.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak briefly about the \nSurface Transportation Authorization and Regulatory Streamlining Act. \nAs I do, Mr. President, I want to emphasize my belief that the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act [ISTEA], has in large \npart been a great success for our Nation. ISTEA has been a \nrevolutionary effort to distribute transportation funding to assist \nStates in major highway, bridge, environmental, research, and safety \nprojects. After 6 years, however, we have learned that there are areas \nof ISTEA in which we can make significant improvement. STARS 2000 is \nthe best mechanism so far by which we can do that.\n  I am cosponsoring STARS 2000 because it reemphasizes the national \ninterest in a national transportation system. Mr. President, each State \nis a vital part of the national system; without one part the whole \nsystem fails. The highway system in New Mexico for instance, serves not \njust its resident and industrial traffic needs, but its highways also \nserve as a vital link for commerce between the Pacific coast and the \neastern seaboard, and between Mexico and Canada. The system of highways \ncrossing New Mexico is also crucial for the movement of manpower, \nequipment, and supplies in support of our Nation's defense. STARS 2000 \noffers a balanced, sensible approach so that all the States continue to \nplay a central role to the overriding national goals.\n  Just as importantly, STARS 2000 effectively addresses the unique \ncharacter of western, rural States and their importance to our national \nsystem of highway. New Mexico, for example, has only six-tenths of 1 \npercent of the total U.S. population. However, it must maintain 2 \npercent, 3,000 miles, of the National Highway System. Many people do \nnot realize that road travel takes on a different meaning in the West. \nFor instance, a trip from Farmington, NM, to Hobbs, NM, is 513 miles, \nand there are few options other than driving to make that tip. By \ncontrast, that same distance would take you from Washington, DC, to \nDetroit, MI.\n  STARTS 2000 also builds on the successes of ISTEA. For instance, the \nSurface Transportation Program maintains Federal support for the bride \nreplacement and rehabilitation program. STARS 2000 also maintains \nsupport for Federal lands roads, a program that is vital to States in \nthe West where a vast majority of our Nation's Federal lands are \nlocated. Forty percent of New Mexico, for example, is Federal land. \nSTARS 2000 eliminates the old system that penalizes a State for using \nFederal funds on roads located on Federal lands and Indian \nreservations. This is a step in the right direction and it is \ndesperately needed in the West. I am concerned that STARS proposes only \nlevel funding for the Indian reservation road program. Although I am \nsupporting S. 437, the American Indian Transportation Improvement Act, \nI will continue to try to increase funding for roads and bridges on \nIndian reservations.\n  STARS 2000 also includes a program that addresses congestion \nmanagement and air quality. I am concerned, however, with the degree to \nwhich resources for this activity have been cut and the fact that it is \neliminated as a separate category within STARS. CMAQ has been a \nsignificant reason cities like Albuquerque have attained and are \nmaintaining clear air standards, and I hope we will find ways to keep \nthis program working.\n  Additionally, STARS 2000 addresses the need to maintain our Nation's \ncurrent system of roads and bridges. Unless the current system is \nsufficiently maintained, we will inevitably have to spend many more \ndollars to rebuild the system, something we can ill-afford. In New \nMexico, like most other States, maintenance costs overwhelm the State's \ntotal highway budget. To its credit, New Mexico applies much of its \nhighway funding to maintenance. Nevertheless, if the entire New Mexico \nroad budget were applied to maintenance alone, only 7,500 of the \nState's 11,600 miles of highways could be adequately maintained. As \nmany as 5,800 miles of New Mexico's roads have deteriorated to the \npoint that they must be replaced at a cost of $1.15 million per mile. \nAs a result, New Mexico, like most other States in the West, is unable \nto fund other critical transportation objects.\n  As we continue to recommit ourselves to maintaining and improving our \nNation's transportation system, let me say that it is also incumbent \nupon the individual States to share in this ever-increasing \nresponsibility. Clearly, there is a strong national transportation \ninterest, but the States must recognize its own obligations. We are \ndoing our part at the Federal level, and States must do the same.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and I commend my \nesteemed colleagues, Senators Baucus, Kempthorne, and Thomas, for \nworking diligently to assemble this legislation. I believe that STARS \nis a measure that will eventually lead to a better, more efficient \ntransportation system in our country and ultimately a stronger economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself and Mr. Stevens):\n  S. 533. A bill to exempt persons engaged in the fishing industry from \ncertain Federal antitrust laws; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  The Fishing Industry Bargaining Act\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stevens and \nmyself, I am reintroducing the Fishing Industry Bargaining Act, a bill \nto allow antitrust immunity for certain cooperative activities \ninvolving domestic fishermen and processors.\n  This bill will allow collective agreement between fishermen and \nprocessors. It is patterned after legislation adopted by the Alaska \nState Legislature, but which requires congressional action to fully \ntake effect.\n  Under existing law, fishermen are able to form associations for the \npurpose of collective bargaining with individual processors. This bill \nwill allow them to work with similar associations of processors to \nestablish first-wholesale purchase prices--that is, the prices paid to \nthe processors for fish products, and ex-vessel prices paid to the \nfishermen.\n  This is intended to counter the fact that prices currently are all \ntoo often set by first-wholesale buyers rather than producers. As a \nresult, processors forced to accept a price set by their buyers are in \nturn forced to set ex-vessel prices based on the buyers' offer, rather \nthan prices that respond fully to other market forces.\n  I want to make it clear that this bill in no way would allow \nprocessors to associate solely amongst themselves to set either ex-\nvessel or wholesale prices. That is the kind of activity our current \nantitrust law is primarily designed to prevent, and this bill will \nleave that unchanged. Processors would continue to be prohibited from \nagreeing on prices unless fishermen participated in and were party to \nany agreement.\n  What the bill will accomplish is to strengthen the position of the \nUnited States seafood industry generally--fishermen and processors \ntogether. In this, it would apply to fishermen and fish processors in \nall parts of the country, not just in Alaska.\n  We look forward to a hearing which will air the views of the Alaska \nfishing industry and the fishing industry in other parts of the \ncountry, and urge prompt action by this Congress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2916]]\n\n                                 S. 533\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 44 of title 18, United States Code, \nto improve the safety of handguns; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       HANDGUN SAFETY ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the need for increased \nattention to gun safety. Increasingly, children are gaining access to \nloaded and unlocked guns with fatal consequences. Recently, an 8-year-\nold girl in Bridgeport, CT, took a gun that was left behind a couch and \nshot and killed her 10-year-old sister.\n  These tragedies happen far too frequently. A report from the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention notes that nearly 1.2 million latch-\nkey children have access to loaded and unlocked firearms each day. \nChildren cause over 10,000 unintentional shootings each year in which \n800 people die.\n  This violence is not limited to the home. The Connecticut Department \nof Health recently completed a survey of 12,000 Connecticut teenagers \ncalled the Voice of Connecticut Youth. More than one-third of boys in \n9th and 11th grades said they either had a gun or could get one in less \nthan a day. When you consider intentional and unintentional shootings, \n16 children are killed with firearms every day in this country.\n  We must put an end to the tragedy of gun violence. We need to take \nsteps to ensure that gun owners are storing their guns safely--\nunloaded, locked, and out of the reach of children. That is why I am \ncosponsoring Senator Kohl's legislation, S. 428, which requires \nlicensed manufacturers, importers, and dealers to sell handguns with a \nchild safety or locking device. The bill also requires a warning that \nthe improper locking or storage of a handgun may result in civil or \ncriminal penalties.\n  Today I am also introducing a separate measure that would simply add \nanother section to Senator Kohl's bill. The section would authorize the \nNational Institute of Justice to conduct a study on possible standards \nfor gun locks. As we move to have greater use of gun locks, we ought to \nmake sure that those locks are high quality.\n  These small steps forward could save thousands of lives. They will \nnot affect responsible gun owners who are already doing the right \nthing, but they will remind careless gun owners of the need for \nincreased safety.\n  My home State of Connecticut is out in front on this issue. One of \nour State laws requires locks on handguns, another State law requires \nthat guns be stored away from children. But one State can only do so \nmuch. A gun bought outside our State can become an instrument of \ntragedy within our State. And we also need to make kids across the \nNation safer. In many ways, this issue is simple--if we require safety \ncaps on medicine to protect kids, we should clearly require safety \nlocks on guns.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me and Senator Kohl in support of \nthese gun safety measures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill, the \nHandgun Safety Act of 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Parkinson's disease is a debilitating, \ndegenerative disease which is caused when nerve centers in an \nindividual's brain lose their ability to regulate body movements. \nPeople afflicted by this disease experience tremors, loss of balance \nand repeated falls, loss of memory, confusion, and depression. \nUltimately, this disease results in total incapacity for an individual \nincluding the inability to speak. This disease knows no boundaries, \ndoes not discriminate, and strikes without warning.\n  This important piece of legislation honors Mo Udall, a dear friend of \nmine who served as a dedicated Congressman from Arizona for 30 years. \nMo is remembered most for his warmth, compassion, integrity, and his \nwit. He was a champion of civil rights, political reform, and a \nprotector of the environment. In 1980, Congressman Mo Udall was \ndiagnosed with Parkinson's disease and he began his valiant battle \nagainst this disastrous disease. Mo was forced to resign from Congress \nin 1991, his exemplary career prematurely ended by Parkinson's.\n  I was fortunate enough to have not only worked with Mo Udall as a \nRepresentative from Arizona, but to have Mo as a mentor and a close, \npersonal friend. Mo's stewardship and integrity would not allow him to \nbecome involved in partisan politics. When I arrived in Washington, DC, \nas a freshman Congressman from Arizona, Mo reached across the aisle, \ntook me under his wing and provided me with guidance, leadership, \nhumor, and, most importantly, friendship. I can never begin to \nadequately thank Mo for all that he provided me and his profound impact \non my early years as a Member of Congress. In some way, I hope that my \nefforts on his behalf and the millions of others with Parkinson's can \nbe a token of appreciation for all that Mo has given me and our \ncountry.\n  Personally, I have witnessed the devastating effects and personal \ntolls which Parkinson's disease has on its victims, as I have watched \nthis horrible disease wreck havoc on my dear friend, Mo. I have watched \nMo, his family, and friends wage a daily battle against this painful \ndisease. Every day, Mo and millions like him throughout the country \nface a disease which is physically crippling and financially \ndevastating. I can truly empathize with the fear and frustration that \nMo and others like him must be feeling as they become prisoners within \ntheir own bodies, clinging to the hope that a scientific breakthrough \nmay soon be discovered and they will be liberated from their personal \nprison.\n  The Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act provides \nthe hope Mo and millions like him are looking for. This bill will help \nus make significant scientific progress by increasing the Federal \nGovernment's financial investment in Parkinson's research for fiscal \nyear 1998 by authorizing $1 million.\n  An important component of this legislation will be the establishment \nof up to 10 Morris K. Udall Centers for Research on Parkinson's Disease \nthroughout the Nation. These centers will be responsible for conducting \nbasic and clinical research in addition to delivering care to \nParkinson's patients. Uniting these three areas will assure that \nresearch developments will be coordinated and the care delivered to \npatients will be effective, high quality services based upon the most \nrecent research developments. The Morris K. Udall Centers will be \nstructural in a manner which allows them to become a source for \ndeveloping teaching programs for health care professionals and \ndisseminating information for public use.\n  In addition, this bill will create a national Parkinson's Disease \nInformation Clearinghouse to gather and store pertinent data on \nParkinson's patients and their families. This collected data will \nfacilitate and enhance knowledge and understanding of Parkinson's \ndisease.\n  This bill will establish a Morris K. Udall Excellence Award to \nrecognize publicly the investigators with a proven record of excellence \nand innovation in Parkinson's research and whose work has demonstrated \nsignificant potential for the diagnosis or treatment of the disease.\n  I am heartened by the tremendous progress scientists are making in \nParkinson's research. There is significant scientific evidence \nindicating that there is very strong potential for major breakthroughs \nin the cause and treatment of Parkinson's in this decade. According to \na wide array of experts, we are on the verge of substantial, ground-\nbreaking scientific discoveries regarding the cause and potential cure \nof Parkinson's disease. We need to seize this rare opportunity to \ndiscover the cause, treatment, and a potential cure for one of the \nNation's most disabling diseases. It is imperative that we give our \nscientific researchers the necessary funding and support to combat this \nand other neurological diseases, and to improve the lives of many \nAmericans.\n  This is why we must enact the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research \nand Education Act of 1997. We can't allow this opportunity to make \nsignificant progress in the area of Parkinson's research slip away \nbecause of a lack of support for our Nation's scientific researchers.\n  Finally, I would like to thank the hundreds of individuals who have \nwritten or called my office in support of this measure. These \nindividuals are committed to seeing this legislation enacted this year \nand are hopeful that Parkinson's research will finally receive a fair \nand justifiable investment from the Federal Government.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a small sampling of the many letters I \nhave received in support of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's bill from \nactual Parkinson's patients, family, and friends of Parkinson's \npatients, advocate groups, scientists, and physicians be included in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                       Phoenix, AZ, April 1, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: My friend Richard and I first met in \n     the lobby of St. Joseph's Hospital Barrows Neurological \n     Institute in Phoenix Arizona. I was in my late thirties, he \n     was in his early fifties, we had both been diagnosed with \n     Young-Onset-Parkinsons Disease. We were both afraid.\n       We became friends as we vowed to fight this disease which \n     was trying to imprison us\n\n[[Page S2918]]\n\n     in our own bodies. We had just learned about the ``Udall \n     Bill.'' We had just learned that scientists promised a cure \n     within three to five years if they received sufficient \n     funding. The ``Udall bill'' could make that happen. We saw \n     the promise of a miracle.\n       We talked about it in depth. We knew we had been marked for \n     a slow death and we shared with each other how we feared for \n     our families. I raised my three children as a single parent, \n     and my kids were struggling under the weight that my illness \n     had brought us. Richards' wife had just told him that she \n     couldn't stand living with him as he slowly became a freak to \n     observers and she couldn't stand the strain having to care \n     for him through the pain and slow death. So she left him. He \n     felt it wasn't her fault.\n       We knew the enemy. The worst thing of this disease was it's \n     slow tortuous progression. We preferred death rather than the \n     years of Hell we were facing. But it was not a choice. With \n     the Udall bill, we might make it. We still had the will to \n     fight. We grasped at hope. We hoped that we could stand the \n     side effects of our medication and hold out until the bill \n     was passed. Once it did, we knew it would take three years \n     for significant improvement in care--but we grasped at the \n     hope. We dedicated the only functioning time we thought we \n     might have left to getting the bill passed.\n       We wrote letters, we visited our representatives, we put up \n     flyers, we scrimped and saved to mail letters to friends and \n     to travel to other states to tell them about the bill, but \n     Richard's disease progressed very quickly. Within a year he \n     had to have an attendant at home to feed him, bathe him, \n     dress him. Then he had to go to a nursing home. He was barely \n     able to whisper, unable to walk, unable to sit up without \n     being tied to his chair--his head hung over and his eyes \n     reflected his suffering--He was fully aware of what was \n     happening every minute of his torture.\n       I continued my advocacy efforts, including three trips from \n     Arizona to Washington DC to try to help our Representatives \n     to understand why they should pass the bill. And I would go \n     to the nursing home and report to Richard. Last year we came \n     very close, but we didn't make it. I told Richard and his \n     face and neck were wet with tears as I told him to try to \n     just `hang in there' one more year. I had told him that the \n     year before. We both cried. We were afraid. We were alone. \n     Richard whispered that he knew he'd never hold his \n     grandchildren, but he'd not go down without knowing we'd \n     ``kick Parkinsons in the ass'' first. Richard died of \n     Parkinsons Disease last month.\n       I'm 44 years now, I have difficulty walking short distances \n     and my strength struggles for me to sit up. Although my \n     medication's losing effectiveness and side effects don't \n     cease, I'm still here. Still holding on. With your help, I \n     will see the passage of the ``Udall bill for Parkinsons''.\n       Thank you for doing all that you are, to help us ``kick \n     Parkinsons in the ass''.\n     Maryhelen Davila.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                      Kingwood, TX, April 8, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you so much for your support and \n     concern for the Parkinson's disease community. I have \n     suffered with PD for 22 years. My hopes for a cure have been \n     raised and dashed on several occasions. Without adequate \n     funding PD will dash the hopes of millions of American as the \n     baby boomer generation approaches the age when PD typically \n     strikes.\n       Unless you experience if you can't know how awful this \n     disease is. Day after day it takes away the very fiber of who \n     you are, what you might be and what you might do for society \n     your family and yourself. At the age of 52 I can no longer be \n     counted on to perform even the basic duties of life for \n     myself. Wheelchairs, walkers, hospital beds combined with \n     hundreds of dollars of medicine each month are what I count \n     on for mobility. While my husband and family and our support \n     group have been my heroes through these 22 years, their \n     resources are exhausted. The Udall bill gives us all the hope \n     that we need to combat this lousy disease one day at a time \n     until a cure if found.\n       Again, thank you for your support for this disease which \n     has been so neglected for so long. In 1817 James Parkinson \n     wrote his paper describing the most prevalent symptoms of \n     this disease. This work 180 years later is still used today \n     to describe in disease. Let 1997 be the year that we change \n     all that. Let it be the year we raise the consciousness of \n     all Americans about the devastation caused by PD and \n     neurological disorders. Let this decade of the brain unravel \n     the mysteries of neurological disorders and let our leaders \n     in Washington pave the way for the cure.\n       Do it for Mo, and do it for me. Thanks for listening. This \n     letter was typed by my husband Bob.\n           Original signed by,\n     Nancy Martone.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Manlius, NY, April 1, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your support and \n     leadership on behalf of people with Parkinson's Disease.\n       At the age of forty-nine I was stricken with Parkinson's \n     Disease. I managed to continue working till I retired last \n     year at the age of fifty-six. I was earning about $165,000.00 \n     per year as a trial attorney.\n       My disability and those with early onset of the disease \n     place a heavy financial burden on the Government and the \n     private sector. I am applying for Social Security Disability \n     plus private disability plans. My medical costs are \n     $18,000.00 plus per year and in two years my medical costs \n     will be another burden on the Social Security trust funds. I \n     estimate that the cost of my illness to society will exceed \n     $1,100,000 if I live to age sixty-seven when I would normally \n     retire.\n       I also notice on the internet that Parkinson's Disease is \n     striking younger and younger people and that the mean age of \n     diagnosis is now fifty-seven years old. If this trend \n     continues, more people will be receiving Social Security \n     Trust Funds at an early age and fewer people than expected \n     making contributions.\n       As I attend support group meetings, I see many people \n     drained of energy, strength and who are unable to articulate \n     their plight. Scientists and researchers express the \n     possibility of new medicines and a cure if more research \n     dollars are invested as proposed by the Parkinson's Bill. \n     Let's apply more research funds to keep people with \n     Parkinson's Disease working longer and leading a healthier \n     life.\n       For those who no longer speak for themselves and myself, I \n     wish to thank you for your support.\n           Very truly yours,\n     A. Dale Severance.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                     Berkeley, CA, March 20, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am writing to you regarding the \n     Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Bill which \n     is going to be reintroduced in the Senate next month. As you \n     remember the Udall Bill passed the Senate but stalled in the \n     House in 1996. May I take a minute of your time to explain \n     why the Udall Bill is so important to me?\n       My wife Frances, now 57, was diagnosed with Parkinson's \n     Disease nine years ago. She is a clinical psychologist and \n     Jungian analyst who still manages to work, but most people \n     stricken with Parkinson's are not so lucky. Unfortunately 40% \n     of the newly diagnosed cases are people under 60 years of \n     age--this disease of the elderly is hitting middle aged \n     people with disastrous results. The disease is incurable and \n     progressive forcing doctors, lawyers, professors, business \n     people, teachers and artists to give up productive lives. I \n     have seen the devastation of families and careers first hand \n     among the many Parkinson's patients I have met. And I have \n     also seen unbelievable courage, intelligence and absolute \n     brilliance as people try to find a way to live with the \n     disease.\n       Without further research there is no hope to cure the \n     disease. The current medications mask the symptoms and that \n     is all. The present national research effort is a joke. There \n     is no unified research agenda and the 30 million dollars \n     allotted to the disease (compared 217 million dollars for \n     Alzheimer's and one and a half billion dollars for AIDS) is \n     not nearly enough. There is terrific research potential but \n     no money. The Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Bill \n     will provide the coordination, the research agenda, and the \n     money. Please help us by cosponsoring the bill, or if you \n     cannot cosponsor it, could you at least vote for it? We \n     desperately need your help!\n       I would very much like to talk with you about the Bill if \n     you have any questions (510-527-0966 or \n     tobriner@uclink.berkeley.edu).\n           Thanks so much for your help.\n\n                                             Stephen Tobriner,\n\n                               Professor of Architectural History,\n     University of California, Berkeley.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Orinda, CA, March 29, 1996.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for agreeing to introduce \n     the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act to \n     the House. I am grateful for your efforts on behalf of this \n     bill.\n       My closest friend, Frances Tobriner, was diagnosed with \n     Parkinson's Disease when she was 46 years old. She is now 57 \n     years old and is courageously managing to work as a \n     psychologist. I have learned that this disease is not limited \n     to the elderly. Young, talented people are vulnerable. There \n     is no cure for this disease and those of us who are able \n     bodied bear helpless witness to the progressive deterioration \n     of those we care about.\n       There are many research possibilities that await funding. I \n     believe that the advances in research will help not only the \n     many victims of Parkinson's disease, but other neurological \n     ailments as well. To date there is no unified research agenda \n     and the relatively small amount of money is not enough. The \n     Udall Parkinson's Research and Education Act will help \n     enormously.\n       Thank you for your efforts. Know that you have support \n     among constituents.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Sue N. Elkind, Ph.D.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       Merriam, KS, April 3, 1997.\n     Re Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Research, Assistance, and \n         Education Act of 1997.\n\n     Hon. John McCain\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator McCain: This is to thank you and Sen. Paul \n     Wellstone for taking the\n\n[[Page S2919]]\n\n     lead in reintroducing the Udall bill in the 105th Congress, \n     as well as the many other Senators who are already supporting \n     the bill.\n       A stepped-up effort in research and coordination of that \n     research means added hope for me and my family that a \n     possible cure may be found in time to help me. You see, I was \n     diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease at the age of 44, nearly \n     13 years ago. It was only two years after my marriage to my \n     wonderful husband, who has stood by me ``in sickness'' much \n     sooner than we ever imagined. I managed to follow through on \n     a long-term project, as President of a Kansas City group \n     which established a 100,000-watt FM community radio station \n     in 1988 after 11 years of effort. I kept up with the station \n     and other community interests and part-time teaching pretty \n     much full force until 1990, but since then I have had to cut \n     back more and more. You can't imagine how grateful I am for \n     access to the internet (my husband's idea) which re-\n     established my ability to connect to the world.\n       My husband who is a community college teacher of 29 years \n     has had to take on domestic duties I once did. His daughter, \n     4 when we married, never remembers when I was a normal, \n     active person. And my aging parents help drive me to the \n     doctors, as my right side is too weak most of the time to \n     allow me to push the gas pedal.\n       This disease CAN go the way of polio, tuberculosis, small \n     pox and others--GONE. Maybe not for me, but surely for the \n     thousands of millions who don't yet know they are at risk for \n     it.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara Blake-Krebs.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                               East Brunswick, NJ, March 31, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for introducing the Morris \n     Udall Bill for Parkinson's Disease Research. I will make a \n     special trip to Washington on April 9, 1997 to be present at \n     your introduction.\n       In 1946 my grandfather, Benjamin Miller, died of \n     complications from bedsores and infection as a result of \n     Parkinson's Disease. He was forced to live with \n     uncontrollable tremors, locked rigid muscles, loss of all \n     motor function and eventually the total incapacity to care \n     for himself. The last 10 years of his life he was in a \n     totally rigid state and toward the end he could only move his \n     eyes. Contrary to our religious law, my mother agreed to \n     allow his body to be used for research believing that the \n     help it might provide others would more than make up for this \n     breach of tradition. She often said that because of her \n     decision, her father played a part in the development and \n     refinement of L-dopa.\n       As fate would have it, my brother is now diagnosed with \n     Parkinson's and while his lifestyle is somewhat better than \n     it might have been 50 years ago, his hideous fate is sealed \n     unless the research continues until a definitive cure has \n     been found.\n       Through your foresight to introduce the Udall Bill in the \n     105th congress there is great potential for a breakthrough in \n     Parkinson's disease treatment and ultimately the discovery of \n     a cure.\n       Thank you again.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mrs. Barbara Schirloff.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Rush \n           University--Department of Neurological Sciences, Center \n           for Brain Repair,\n                                       Chicago, IL, April 2, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I was very pleased to hear that you \n     have re-introduced the Udall Bill. As a researcher of \n     Parkinson's disease for 25 years, I can assure you that the \n     bill is timely and that the money will be well spent if the \n     bill is passed. I have witnessed the revolution in this field \n     from the early years of levodopa through the discovery of the \n     neurotoxin MPTP, the implantation of adrenal tissue and now \n     pallidotomy and neural grafting. They have been exciting and \n     productive times and quite frankly, it has just plain been \n     fun doing the work and actually seeing it impact the lives of \n     our patients.\n       Currently, my laboratory is working on the mechanisms \n     responsible for the neuroprotection that appears to be \n     occurring with the drug pramipexole. Although the drug itself \n     appears to offer the PHD patient a new and very effective \n     addition to the antiparkinson arsenal, the more interesting \n     aspect of our research is that the drug appears to be turning \n     on the production of a new trophic molecule that has the \n     potential to reverse the neurodegenerative process. We are \n     currently trying to isolate this protein so that it can be \n     tested. Our lab has also recently discovered important \n     signals that influence the development of DA neurons (which \n     die in PD). We can now take so-called progenitor cells and \n     convert them into DA cells from grafting. If we are \n     successful at doing this in human cells, we would be able to \n     provide the world with adequate tissue for grafting on demand \n     and thereby totally bypass the abortion issue since cells \n     from only one abortion could be expanded in the lab to serve \n     the needs of all transplant centers. Finally, we are also \n     trying to determine in humans the cause for levodopa induced \n     hallucinations. We know nothing about this phenomenon except \n     that it is the number one cause for patients being placed in \n     nursing homes and once PD patients enter a nursing home they \n     generally die there.\n       As you will hopefully recognize, my laboratory is very \n     vested in the treatment and management of PD. Our approach to \n     this disease is, we feel, novel and appropriate to the \n     current status of knowledge in this field. We are not \n     restricted by ideas. We are restricted by lack of funds. I am \n     not at all reluctant to ask the government for money for \n     research. Having been in this business as long as I have, I \n     have come to recognize that we in science actually spend our \n     research dollars in a frugal and effective manner. We have so \n     little of it we have to make it last and work effectively. I \n     can therefore assure you that this will not be a ``pork'' \n     project but will actually result in the desired and intended \n     effects. I therefore thank you for your efforts to increase \n     funding for my field. Even though I don't necessarily agree \n     with the notion of legislative earmarking for research \n     dollars, PD is a disease where throwing adequate funding at \n     it will have a tremendous impact and likely reduce health \n     care costs dramatically.\n       If I can ever be of any help to you in your efforts to make \n     this bill a reality or if you simply need background \n     information, please feel free to contact me. Again, thanks \n     for your help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Paul M.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: I am so grateful that you are \n     sponsoring the Udall Bill. I pray that it will pass. We (I am \n     a member of the Parkinsn (sic) Listserv) have been asked to \n     catalog our symptoms for you, so here goes: I was diagnosed \n     with Parkinson's 6 years ago after progressive weird symptoms \n     which I did not realize were significant, such as loss of \n     ability to wash my hair with my left hand, difficulty \n     shuffling and holding cards when I play bridge, a couple of \n     episodes of feeling like I was walking underwater, it was so \n     hard to move; I was diagnosed immediately when seen by a \n     neurologist and put on medication which gave me strange \n     twisting motions of one of my feet. We lowered the dosage. \n     The dyskinesia went away, but the medicine supposedly has a \n     tapering off of effectiveness. So far, it works. I can once \n     again wash my hair with my left hand thanks to the medicine. \n     My illness is progressing, not too fast, but the changes I've \n     had to make are accumulating: walk one mile instead of three, \n     cut back on activities (dropped out of a bridge group, buy \n     instead of make pies, etc., don't crochet or paint--doesn't \n     seem worth the effort) great difficulty in doing up buttons, \n     loss of strength, tire easily, not able to `write' legibly, \n     nor be heard by most people when I speak (young people can \n     usually hear me), have difficulty standing up from chairs, \n     usually can't taste or smell, though I can now and then which \n     makes me impatient for THE CURE, knowing that all is \n     apparently not lost, just somehow not available. I am \n     terribly worried about inability to get long term care health \n     insurance. Nobody will take me and I dread the effect on my \n     husband if he has to spend everything to take care of me. I \n     am blessed with a wonderful, caring husband, who never \n     complains about my increasing dependency on him.\n       Bless you for what you have given your country.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mrs. Elizabeth Southwood.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                                    The Parkinson's Institute,\n\n                                     Sunnyvale, CA, April 7, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator McCain: Thank you for your unflagging support \n     of the Udall Parkinson's Research bill. I am writing today to \n     explain why this bill is so important to me, to my colleagues \n     in research and clinical care, and to the patients and \n     families who suffer from Parkinson's disease and other \n     movement disorders.\n       I have been a practicing neurologist for more than 25 years \n     and have specialized in Parkinson's disease care and research \n     for the last 15 years. As a scientist in close touch with the \n     international research community in the field of \n     neurodegenerative diseases, I see tremendous potential in a \n     dozen scientific directions for finding a cure for \n     Parkinson's disease within the next decade. That is not a \n     statement I make lightly, nor is it a statement that can be \n     applied across the board to the diseases of aging. Instead, \n     it is based on a careful assessment of the technologies that \n     are open now and to the new technologies opening daily to the \n     scientists who specialize in movement disorders.\n       As a physician who sees only patients with Parkinson's \n     disease and related movement disorders--some of which are \n     even more devastating--I realize that every patient I see is\n\n[[Page S2920]]\n\n     under a kind of death watch. Their disease is inexorably \n     progressive; there is no cure; and even the gold standard of \n     medications available cannot control symptoms indefinitely. I \n     have learned, as all physicians must learn, to achieve a \n     certain detachment from the inevitability that faces my \n     patients, but it remains a constant trial to look at these \n     individuals and know that my armamentarium is so limited. \n     Part of the way to deal with this challenge, both for \n     physician and patient, is to take comfort in the fact that \n     there is enormous hope through the efforts of the researchers \n     in my own laboratory and in similar institutions around the \n     world.\n       What is needed to take advantage of the new technologies \n     and the enormous pool of talented investigators waiting to \n     use them is to make them available to a much larger number of \n     laboratories; to increase the probability that the critical \n     breakthroughs will occur sooner rather than later. No one \n     laboratory can travel every possible avenue of investigation \n     no matter how impressive their equipment and no matter how \n     many bright young postdoctoral fellows are on staff. Rather, \n     we must seek to multiply the approaches to the puzzling \n     problems that still face us by utilizing the different \n     insights, experience, and research philosophies of a variety \n     of laboratories across the country at academic medical \n     centers, at NIH, and in independent research institutes like \n     our own.\n       Ultimately, that takes money and that is where we turn to \n     the Congress for help directed specifically to Parkinson's \n     disease. You know, I'm sure, of the discrepancies in research \n     funding per patient between Parkinson's disease and other \n     disorders. The message I want to send to you today is that \n     research dollars for movement disorders will not be thrown \n     into a black hole of hopelessness, but invested in a national \n     program with tremendous hope for the future.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        J. William Langston, M.D.,\n     President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n         APDA Parkinson's Disease Information & Referral Center at \n           the University of Arizona,\n                                        Tucson, AZ, April 7, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: We are writing to tell you how \n     grateful we are that you have taken on the role of lead \n     republican sponsor in the Senate for the Morris K. Udall bill \n     for Parkinson's Research. There is tremendous support for \n     this bill in Arizona, not only among Parkinson's patients and \n     their family members, but among an ever-widening circle of \n     physicians, scientists and thoughtful members of the general \n     public. It is clear that research holds the key to improved \n     treatments--even a cure--for Parkinson's disease. Only \n     through research will we find a way to reduce the human \n     suffering and economic burden of this terrible illness.\n       In Arizona we have taken a special interest in the Udall \n     bill, partly because it is our state which Mo Udall served so \n     well, partly because our state's attractiveness as a \n     ``retirement'' state means we have a higher proportion of \n     residents in the age range most at risk for PD, and partly \n     because several of our state's medical institutions--the \n     University of Arizona College of Medicine in Tucson, the \n     Barrow Neurological Institute in Phoenix, and the Mayo clinic \n     in Scottsdale--already oversee extensive Parkinson's research \n     programs.\n       Members of the Arizona Chapter of the American Parkinson \n     Disease Association (APDA) and the staff of its associated \n     Information & Referral Center at the University of Arizona \n     have worked hard to educate Arizona residents about \n     Parkinson's disease and the promise of Parkinson's research. \n     The recent Agenda 97 symposium at the University of Arizona \n     brought together Parkinson's researchers, advocates and \n     government officials for a public forum. The outstanding \n     efforts of the APDA committee Arizona Parkinson's Advocates, \n     led by Bob Dolezal, have made the Mo Udall bill a popular \n     cause throughout the State.\n       We applaud your efforts and support you one hundred \n     percent. Thank you again for leading the way to passage of \n     the Udall bill in 1997.\n           Sincerely,\n     Erwin B. Montgomery, Jr., MD,\n       Medical Director, APDA Information & Referral Center at the \n     University of Arizona.\n     Cynthia A.

John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: Your dedication to bring about the \n     reintroduction of the Morris K. Udall Parkinson's Disease \n     Research and Education Act is most appreciated. The bitter \n     sweet partial victory at the end of the 104th Congressional \n     session was difficult to accept.\n       To Americans suffering from this hideous disease, the issue \n     is so clearly defined: there are 1 to 1.5 million people \n     struck with a disease that costs the government 6 billion \n     dollars annually to maintain status quo; whereas an annual \n     investment of 100 million dollars for research would yield a \n     net savings of $124,500,000,000 in five years based on the \n     forecast of eminent scientists who predict major advances in \n     the treatment of or even a possible cure for Parkinson's \n     disease.\n       It is with this great anticipation that I face my 17th year \n     living with the disease. During the last number of years, \n     managing my daily minimal activities have become more and \n     more difficult. Since I am only 55 years old, I still have a \n     window of opportunity to re-enter the world of participation \n     rather than inaction. Currently my life revolves around \n     frantically attempting to accomplish somethings during the \n     infrequent and much too short periods of time that my \n     medication kicks in.\n       I must believe that with your leadership and guidance the \n     Udall bill will make its perileous journey through the Halls \n     of Congress and will gain enough bi-partisan support for \n     passage and thus insure more adequate research and \n     development funding. For those 50,000 People with Parkinson's \n     who received their diagnosis during this past 12 months and \n     for my own salvation, I join you and your staff in an all-out \n     effort to guarantee the passage of the new Udall bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Margaret Tuchman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Biden, \n        Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Graham, Mr. Cleland, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Reid, Mr. Feingold, and Mrs. \n        Murray):\n  S. 536. A bill to amend the National Narcotics Leadership Act of 1988 \nto establish a program to support and encourage local communities that \nfirst demonstrate a comprehensive, long-term commitment to reduce \nsubstance abuse among youth, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 the drug-free communities act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as you know the issue of drug use by our \nchildren is very important to me. I believe that we must do whatever we \ncan to protect our children from the harmful effects of illegal drugs. \nThe survey by the Partnership for a Drug-Free America recently released \nshowed that children continue to cite their parents as a reliable \nsource of information about the dangers of drugs. This confirms a 1996 \nstudy by the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse which showed that \nthe extent parents shouldered responsibility for their kids resisting \ndrugs was a key indicator of whether or not their child experimented \nwith drugs. Not Presidents, not Federal officials, not television, but \nparents and others who play an integral role in a child's life make the \ndifference.\n  Today, in conjunction with 13 of my fellow Senators, we are \nintroducing the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997. This act will take \nfunds currently being spent for less productive areas of the Federal \ndrug control budget and route them to community coalitions with proven \ntrack records. Seeking to make the most efficient use of taxpayer \ndollars, Federal grants will match funding efforts from the private \nsector and the local community.\n  It will put resources in the hands of those who make a difference; of \nthe people that our children say their opinions they respect. It puts \nthe resources at the community level, where parents, teachers, coaches, \nand community leaders can use these resources to educate our children \nabout the evils of drug use.\n  There are four key features to this legislation, features that make \nit different from existing funding opportunities. First, communities \nmust take the initiative. In order to receive support, a community \ncoalition must demonstrate that there is a long-term commitment to \naddress teen-drug use by having a sustainable coalition that includes \nthe involvement of representatives from a wide variety of community \nactivists.\n  In addition, every coalition must show that it will be around for a \nwhile. Community coalitions must be in existence for at least 6 months \nprior to applying for funds provided for in this bill, and they are \nonly eligible to receive support if they can match these donations \ndollar for dollar with non-Federal funding, up to $100,000 per \ncoalition.\n  The third key feature of this legislation is an assurance that the \nfunds for this bill will come from existing legislation. We plan on \nworking closely\n\n[[Page S2921]]\n\nwith the members of the Appropriations Committee to find appropriate \noff-sets within the current $16 billion Federal drug control budget.\n  An advisory commission, consisting of local community leaders, and \nState and National experts in the field of substance abuse, will \noversee the implementation of the program at the Office of National \nDrug Control Policy. They will insure the funds are directed to \ncommunities and programs that make a difference in the lives of our \nchildren.\n  At other times I've talked about the statistics--how drug use is up \nagain this year among teens, and how emergency room admissions are \nrising after years of decline, and other depressing statistics. But the \nbill we introduce today is in support of organizations that are on the \nfront lines, making a difference in the lives of our children. I urge \nmy fellow members to join my colleagues and me in supporting this \nlegislation for our children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 536\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am very proud to join the Senator from \nIowa in being an original cosponsor of the drug-free communities \nlegislation.\n  In the last 5 years, substance abuse by America's young people has \nmore than doubled. Even more troubling, it is taking place at younger \nand younger ages.\n  We need to turn this around. And this is a challenge that requires \nthe involvement of the whole community--young people, their parents, \nschools, businesspeople, the media, law enforcement, religious \norganizations, civic and fraternal groups, as well as professionals in \nthe area of drug abuse treatment.\n  Community-based antidrug coalitions have proven their worth in the \nfight against drug abuse. I'm thinking of groups like the Madison \nCounty Prevention Assistance Coalition Team--or PACT--in Madison \nCounty, OH. PACT was established in a rural area in central Ohio in \n1991, and rapidly inspired over 50 local substance abuse prevention \ninitiatives.\n  What PACT did was mobilize the community. Middle school students \nacted as mentors and role models for third graders. Teachers in Head \nStart taught their students about drug abuse prevention. A local church \nheld a father-son retreat.\n  A research team from Miami University found that Madison County's \nalcohol-related crime dropped by 50 percent. And students are reporting \na decline in the use and availability of alcohol and other drugs.\n  The key is mobilizing the community. The bill we're introducing today \nwill help tap into this resource--by redirecting Federal funding to \ncommunity coalitions that have developed comprehensive programs to \neducate children about the dangers of drugs. A similar bill was \nintroduced in the House by Representatives Portman, Hastert, Rangel, \nand Levin.\n  This bill will channel funds from the fiscal year 1998 drug control \nbudget--in the form of matching grants--to community coalitions with \nproven track records. It will enhance programs that work, without \nallocating new funds.\n  I think this is exactly the type of legislation we need. It's a \nsensible and cost-effective approach to solving a major problem. And I \nwill join my colleague from Iowa in working for its enactment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join in introducing today \nwith Senator Grassley and others the Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997. \nThis legislation will help take an important step forward toward a goal \nwe all share--keeping kids away from drugs and drugs away from kids.\n  This 5 year, $140 million authorization to fund local antidrug \nprevention efforts could be an important catalyst to getting local \ngroups together to plan, coordinate, and carry out the wide variety of \ndrug prevention treatment activities we all know are necessary to \nreverse the rise of drug abuse among our children. By unleashing the \ntalents and energy of local coalitions of local businesses, schools, \nlaw enforcement, religious organizations, doctors, and others we can \nbuild community-wide and community-based drug prevention efforts.\n  For all these reasons, I am pleased to offer my support for the \nconcept embodied in this legislation. But, I must offer two important \nconditions to my support for this bill. First, as potentially valuable \nas antidrug coalitions can be, I do not believe it would be wise for us \nto ``rob Peter to pay Paul'' by trying to fund this drug prevention \neffort by cutting funding for other, worthy drug prevention efforts. It \nis my\n\n[[Page S2924]]\n\nunderstanding that the other sponsors of this legislation in both the \nHouse and the Senate share this view, and I look forward to working \nwith them to find the modest dollars necessary to fund this effort.\n  Second, it is also my understanding that the sponsors of this \nlegislation are continuing to work with the Drug Director to iron out \nthe bureaucratic details of how this effort will be undertaken at the \nFederal level. I am confident that none of the sponsors of this bill \nhave any desire to establish any new layers of wasteful bureaucracy, so \nI look forward to working with them to pass the most efficient, \neffective effort possible.\n  This bill offers a key example of the bipartisan support for drug \nprevention and drug treatment efforts which exists at the grassroots \nlevel throughout our Nation. In the weeks and months ahead, I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the same bipartisan fashion.\n  As my colleagues have heard me note on numerous occasions--our Nation \nstands on the edge of the ``baby boomerang''--with 39 million American \nchildren under the age of 10, the greatest number since the 1960's. We \nmust prepare for these 39 million as they enter their teen years when \nthey will be at their greatest likelihood of falling prey to drugs and \ncrime. If we do not, we will pay for our lack of foresight with what \ncould be the most severe epidemic of youth drug abuse, youth violence, \nand youth crime our Nation has ever suffered.\n  Preparing each of these 39 million American children means giving \nthem the techniques and the desire to stay away from drugs--in short, \ndrug prevention. The Drug-Free Communities Act of 1997 is one of what \nmust be many elements of a comprehensive, nationwide drug prevention \neffort. I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and I look forward \nto passing it into law.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in the introduction \nof the Drug Free Communities Act and urge its passage. This bill \nresponds to a distressing increase in teenage drug use by providing \nstartup funding and technical assistance to community coalitions that \nwork together to prevent drug use.\n  According to the University of Michigan's 1996 Monitoring the Future \nstudy, more than half of all high school students use illicit drugs by \nthe time they graduate. The Office of National Drug Control Policy \ncited in their strategy report that nearly 1 in 4 high school seniors \nused marijuana on a past-month basis in 1996.\n  The age for which children start using drugs is declining. While the \nnumber of teenagers using marijuana increased 37 percent from 1994 to \n1995, the age of first use declined from 17.8 years of age in 1987 to \n16.3 years of age in 1994. There was also a drop in age for first use \nof cocaine from 23.3 years to 19 years old. Drug use is starting at an \nearly age.\n  Drug abuse costs this country approximately $67 billion a year in \nsocial, health and criminal costs. But the 14,000 drug-related deaths \neach year cannot be calculated in costs. The destruction of lives of \nthe drug users, their families, friends, and neighbors is inevitable.\n  The need to correct the trend is imperative and it is communities \nthat can do it. Community coalitions are essential for an effective \nprevention program. It is the community groups that see the problem \nfirst hand and know what is needed in that area to stop children from \nusing drugs.\n  This bill will provide the incentive for community action groups to \nwork together for the sole purpose of drug prevention. Groups \nrepresenting youths, parents, businesses, schools, law enforcement, \nreligious organizations, health professionals, as well as government \nagencies will be expected to prepare a strategy and implement it--\ntogether. But the community must be organized first, prior to receiving \ngrant funds, in order for the coalition to prove a long-term \ncommitment.\n  The grants will be distributed to organized community coalitions that \nhave matching funds and those funds cannot be derived from the Federal \nGovernment. This requirement ensures that the coalition has support and \ncan be sustained after the grant sunsets. This will not be another \nFederal program, but rather a means to support organized coalitions \nthat devise and implement a comprehensive antidrug campaign while they \nget off the ground.\n  Several groups in my State have already endorsed this proposal \nincluding the Syracuse Police Department, the mayor of Syracuse and \nagencies in Onondaga County. Respected national organizations that deal \nwith drug and alcohol abuse have also endorsed the proposal including \nDARE, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica, and Empower America, among others.\n  This is a comprehensive strategy to a problem that is best dealt with \nat the local level. I urge my colleagues to closely review the merits \nof this bill and support its passage. Our communities need it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of the \nDrug Free Communities Act.\n  The objective of this bill is to protect our greatest national \nresource--our children--from the deadly scourge of drug abuse. And it \nprotects them in a way that has been proven through the centuries--by \nstrengthening communities. This bill gives local communities the \nsupport they need to keep drugs away from their young people. And it \nallows them to use it in a way that has proven to be effective in their \ncommunity, and not as some Washington bureaucrat dictates.\n  Unfortunately, recent studies of drug use in America demonstrate the \nneed for a program such as this. The statistics on substance abuse \namong our Nation's children are particularly disturbing:\n  According to the University of Michigan's 1996 study ``Monitoring the \nFuture,'' half of all high school students have tried some type of \nillicit drug by the time they graduate. Drug use among eighth graders \nhas risen 150 percent in the last 5 years. Overall, drug use for \nchildren between the ages of 12 and 17 has increased more than 100 \npercent, from 5.3 percent in 1992 to 10.9 percent in 1995.\n  The drug most often used by these children continues to be marijuana. \nMore children are smoking marijuana and they are starting to do so at a \nyounger age. According to the ``Monitoring the Future'' study, almost \n25 percent of high school seniors had used marijuana during the \nprevious month. Between 1994 and 1995, the rate of use among 12- to 17-\nyear-olds increased 37 percent, from 6 percent to over 8 percent.\n  And the use of marijuana often leads to the use of stronger and more \ndangerous drugs. A study completed by Columbia University's Center on \nAddiction and Substance Abuse found that children who smoke marijuana \nare 85 times more likely to try cocaine than children who have never \ntried marijuana.\n  The use of cocaine and heroin among our children is also on the \nincrease. Among high school seniors in 1996, over 7 percent had tried \ncocaine at some time. And the number of younger children experimenting \nwith these drugs is alarming. During the last 5 years, heroin use among \n8th to 12th graders and the number of 8th graders who had tried cocaine \nhad doubled.\n  So what can we do to help our youth reject the temptation to use \ndrugs? We can help families to convince kids that they must never even \ntry illegal drugs.\n  That is why I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Drug-Free Communities \nAct of 1997, which we are here to introduce today. This bill will help \ncommunities reduce drug use among youth by providing matching grants of \nup to $100,000 to community coalitions for the establishment of \nprograms designed to prevent and treat substance abuse in young people. \nThese grants will be used to provide support to local communities who \nhave proven their long-term commitment to reducing drug use among \nyouth. It includes provisions for an advisory commission of substance \nabuse experts to oversee the program, to ensure that grants go only to \nthose programs that have demonstrated success in keeping our children \nand grandchildren off drugs.\n  There are several reasons why every Member of Congress should support \nthis bill:\n  This program helps local communities in a way that is consistent with \nthe 1997 strategy of the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The \nNo. 1 goal of the strategy is to encourage\n\n[[Page S2925]]\n\nAmerica's youth to reject illegal drugs by assisting community \ncoalitions to develop programs that will accomplish this goal. The \ngrants provided for in the Drug Free Communities Act will establish a \npartnership between the Federal Government and local communities.\n  There are safeguards to prevent abuse of the program. Only \nestablished groups that can provide matching funds will be eligible to \nreceive funding. This ensures that only programs that have a proven \ntrack record of success in fighting drug abuse among our young people \nwill receive funding.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill. \nOur children's future depends on keeping them free of drugs, and this \nlegislation will help those groups who can make a difference in the \nlives of our youth. There is no greater service that we can provide to \nour country than to keep our children drug-free.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof the Drug Free Communities Act of 1997. This bill will lend a helping \nhand to local coalitions that are leading the fight against substance \nabuse.\n  Few would argue that substance abuse, particularly among our youth, \nis a growing problem in communities across our Nation. Drug use among \nteens has increased sharply in recent years. There is reason to \nbelieve, however, that local coalitions, reflecting a broad cross-\nsection of the communities they serve, can do much to combat drug use \namong youths as well as adults.\n  The Drug Free Communities Act would lend important assistance to \nthese coalitions. Specifically, the bill would authorize grants of up \nto $100,000 to local coalitions whose principal mission is the \nreduction of substance abuse. To be eligible for a grant, a coalition \nmust include representatives from the religious, business, law \nenforcement, education, parental, and health care communities, as well \nas local government officials, in the geographic region served by the \ncoalition. To enhance coalition accountability--and thus to direct \nresources to the most successful coalitions--a participating coalition \nwould be required to conduct an initial benchmark survey of drug use in \nits community, followed by biennal surveys. No new funding would be \nneeded for the bill, as grant moneys would be drawn from the existing \nbudget of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.\n  In short, Mr. President, this bill recognizes that the efforts of \nlocal leaders are indispensable in the war on drugs. I am proud to \nsupport those efforts, and look forward to passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Biden, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Inouye, \n        Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Ford, Mr. Reid, \n        Mr. Leahy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Chafee, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Reed, Mr. Mack, Mr. Robb, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Levin, Mr. Frist, Mr. Bond, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \n        Specter, Mr. Burns, Mr. Glenn, Mr. Coats, Mr. Akaka, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 537. A bill to amend title III of the Public Health Service Act to \nrevise and extend the mammography quality standards program; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                 the mammography quality standards act\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am honored to be joined by my \ncolleagues, both men and women from both sides of the aisle, in \nintroducing the reauthorization of the Mammography Quality Standards \nAct [MQSA]. The bill I am introducing today reauthorizes the original \nlegislation which passed in 1992 with bipartisan support.\n\n  What MQSA does is require that all facilities that provide mammograms \nmeet key safety and quality-assurance standards in the area of \npersonnel, equipment, and operating procedures. Before the law passed, \ntests were misread, women were misdiagnosed, and people died as a \nresult of sloppy work. Since 1992, MQSA has been successful in bringing \nfacilities into compliance with the Federal standards.\n  What are these national, uniform quality standards for mammography? \nWell, facilities are required to use equipment designed specifically \nfor mammography. Only radiological technologists can perform \nmammography. Only qualified doctors can interpret the results of \nmammography. Facilities must establish a quality assurance and control \nprogram to ensure reliability, clarity, and accurate interpretation of \nmammograms. Facilities must be inspected annually by qualified \ninspectors. Finally, facilities must be accredited by an accrediting \nbody approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n  This current reauthorization makes a few minor changes to the law to \nensure the following: Patients and referring physicians must be advised \nof any mammography facility deficiency. Women are guaranteed the right \nto obtain an original of their mammogram. Finally, both State and local \ngovernment agencies are permitted to have inspection authority.\n  I like this law because it has saved lives. The frontline against \nbreast cancer is mammography. We know that early detection saves lives. \nBut a mammogram is worse than useless if it produces a poor-quality \nimage or is misinterpreted. The first rule of all medical treatment is: \nAbove all things, do no harm. And a bad mammogram can do real harm by \nleading a woman and her doctor to believe that nothing is wrong when \nsomething is. The result can be unnecessary suffering or even a death \nthat could have been prevented. That is why this legislation is so \nimportant. This law must be reauthorized so that we don't go back to \nthe old days when women's lives were in jeopardy.\n  I want to make sure that women's health care needs are met \ncomprehensively. It is expected that 180,000 new cases of breast cancer \nwill be diagnosed and about 44,000 women will die from the disease in \n1997. This makes breast cancer the most common cancer among women. And \nonly lung cancer causes more deaths in women.\n  We must aggressively pursue prevention in our war on breast cancer. I \npledge to fight for new attitudes and find new ways to end the needless \npain and death that too many American women face. This bill is an \nimportant step in that direction. On behalf of all the women of the \nSenate, I invite the men of the Senate who have not already cosponsored \nto do so. The women of America are counting on your support.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support, as \nan original cosponsor of the reauthorization of the Mammography Quality \nStandards Act [MQSA].\n  I first lent my support to this effort when the MQSA was initially \nintroduced and passed in the 102nd Congress. For the past 5 years, this \ncritically important legislation has provided women with safe and \nreliable mammography services. As the Mammography Quality Standards Act \ncomes up for reauthorization, I urge all of my fellow colleagues to \nonce again make a commitment to the health and well being of America's \nwomen by supporting this legislation.\n  Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer to affect women. In \nfact, almost 1 in 9 women will develop breast cancer at some point in \ntheir lives. Mammography, while not a cure for cancer, provides the \nbest detection system for diagnosing this dangerous and deadly disease. \nAnd, early detection of breast cancer is often the key to effective \ntreatment and recovery.\n  The Mammography Quality Standards Act ensures that mammography \nservice providers comply with Federal requirements. These quality \nstandards guard against inaccurate or inconclusive mammography results, \nthereby reducing the costly procedures associated with false positive \ndiagnoses.\n  Before this legislation was originally enacted, women were often at \nthe mercy of their mammography service provider, unaware if these \nproviders lacked the necessary equipment, or even adequately trained \ntechnicians. The MQSA is helping to effectively eliminate concerns of \nsubstandard mammography and its possibly tragic results by assuring \nthat only the correct radiological equipment is used in\n\n[[Page S2926]]\n\nmammography testing. Further, this legislation is assuring women that \nonly physicians adequately trained in this medical area are \ninterpreting mammograms.\n  New to this legislation are some additional requirements which seek \nto further assure women that their mammogram service produces the most \naccurate and timely detection of any irregularities. Mammography \nservice providers will now be required to retain women's mammogram \nrecords so that an accurate medical history is maintained. \nReauthorization of these quality standards will also ensure that \npatients are notified about substandard mammography facilities.\n  I wish to commend Senator Mikulski for her leadership on this crucial \nlegislation. Again, it is my pleasure to join my colleagues in ensuring \nthat quality mammography service is readily available, and I urge the \nSenate to act quickly and approve this critically important measure for \nAmerican women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2901-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2926-S2931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 538. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to convey \ncertain facilities of the Minidoka project to the Burley Irrigation \nDistrict and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n              the burley irrigation district transfer act\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior to transfer certain facilities \nat the Minidoka irrigation project to the Burley Irrigation District. \nThe introduction of this legislation results from a hearing I held in \nthe Senate Energy Committee in the past Congress and is nearly \nidentical to S. 1291 from that Congress. I am introducing this project-\nspecific legislation because it is obvious to me a general transfer \nbill is not workable; each reclamation project has unique qualities, \nand projects should be addressed individually or in distinct groupings.\n  The Reclamation Act of 1902 was part of the history of Federal public \nland laws designed to transfer lands out of Federal ownership and to \nsettle this Nation. The origins of that policy predate the Constitution \nand derive from the early debates that led to the Northwest Ordinance \nof 1787. The particular needs and circumstances of the arid and \nsemiarid lands west of the 100th meridian led to various proposals to \nreclaim the lands, including the Desert Land Act and the Carey Act. In \nhis State of the Union Message of 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt \nfinally called for the Federal Government to intervene to develop the \nreservoirs and works necessary to accomplish such irrigation. The \nreclamation program was enormously successful. It grew from the \nirrigation program contemplated by one President Roosevelt to the \nmassive works constructed four decades later by the second President \nRoosevelt. For those of us in the Northwest, there is a very personal \nmeaning to a line from Woody Guthrie's song about the Columbia that \ngoes: ``your power is turning our darkness to dawn, so roll on \nColumbia, roll on.''\n  If what is known now had been known then, some projects may have been \nconstructed differently. However, that is not the question we have \nbefore us. The central question is whether and to what extent the \nFederal Government should seek to transfer the title and responsibility \nfor these projects. Has the Federal mission been accomplished?\n  The best transfer case would be the single purpose irrigation or \nmunicipal and industrial [M] system that is fully repaid, operation \nhas long since been transferred, and the water rights are held \nprivately. That is the case with the Burley Irrigation District \ntransfer.\n  The transfer of title is not a new idea. Authority to transfer title \nto the All American Canal is contained in section 7 of the Boulder \nCanyon Project Act of 1928. General authority is contained in the 1955 \nDistribution Systems Loan Act. Recently, Congress passed legislation \ndealing with Elephant Butte and Vermejo.\n  The Burley Irrigation District is part of the Minidoka project that \nwas built under the authorization of the 1902. Reclamation Act. By a \ncontract executed in 1926, the District assumed the operation and \nmaintenance of the system.\n  All construction contracts and costs for the canals system, pumping \nplants, power house, transmission lines and other improvements have \nbeen paid in full. Contracts for storage space at Minidoka, American \nFalls, and Palisades reservoirs have been paid in full, along with all \nmaintenance fees. This project is a perfect example of the Federal \nGovernment maintaining only a bare title, and that title should now be \ntransferred to the project recipients who have paid for the facilities \nand the rights of the Burley Irrigation District.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 540. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide annual screening mammography and waive coinsurance for \nscreening mammography for women age 65 or older under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the medicare mammography screening expansion act\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no doubt a lot of women in \ntheir forties who are awfully confused these days about whether they \nshould receive a regular mammogram to test for breast cancer. Over the \nlast several years--and especially over the last couple of months--the \ndebate in the scientific community and the conflicting scientific \nstudies have not painted a very clear picture for younger women.\n  But, what is perfectly clear--what is not in dispute--is that older \nwomen should receive regular mammograms. Mammograms save lives. And, \nthe scientific studies confirm it. If all women over 50 received \nregular mammograms, breast cancer mortality could be reduced by one-\nthird. The recommended screening guidelines reflect this, no matter \nwhat group's guidelines you read. The American Cancer Society, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nMedical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the \nAmerican College of Physicians all recommend that women over 50 receive \nannual mammograms.\n  Now, here's the problem. Women 65 and over have Medicare as their \nhealth insurance. The guidelines tell them--and their doctors are \ntelling them--to get a mammogram once a year. But, Medicare pays for \nmammograms only once every 2 years. This means that an elderly woman \nmust pay the cost of every other mammogram herself--or go without a \nmammogram every other year. And, even when Medicare pays for the \nmammogram, the woman is still responsible for at least 20 percent of \nthe cost.\n  The result, Mr. President, is that too many women are following \nMedicare's payment rules--and not getting tested--rather than following \nthe scientific guidelines--and being tested.\n  Two years ago, a study was published in the New England Journal of \nMedicine. It found that only 14.4 percent of women without Medicare \nsupplemental insurance--that is, women who do not have, on top of \nMedicare, private insurance that may cover mammograms on an annual \nbasis--only 14.4 percent of those women received even a mammogram once \nevery 2 years, let alone annually. Even among those women with \nsupplemental insurance, less than half had a mammogram over the course \nof 2 years. The study concluded that a woman's inability to pay a share \nof the costs for mammograms ``is an obstacle to the effective mass \nscreening of older women for breast cancer.'' And, I would add, an \nobstacle to saving thousands of lives.\n  So, Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare Mammography \nScreening Expansion Act. This bill does two things. First, it would \ncover mammograms under Medicare once every year, as recommended by the \nguidelines, instead of once every 2 years, which is now the law. \nSecond, it would eliminate the 20-percent copayment that is currently \ncharged to women when they receive a mammogram, so that women are not \ndiscouraged from obtaining this important preventive measure because of \nthe cost. I should note that eliminating the copayment is not \nunprecedented. Medicare already does not charge copayments for flu \nshots and most clinical laboratory tests.\n  Mr. President, we know that mammograms save lives. Yet, current \nMedicare policy creates barriers that are\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\npreventing women from seeking this simple, life-saving procedure. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in making mammography screenings more \navailable and more affordable for American women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 541. A bill to provide for an exchange of lands with the city of \nGreeley, CO, and the Water Supply and Storage Co. to eliminate private \ninholdings in wilderness areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the rockwell ranch land transfer act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould provide for a land exchange between the city of Greeley, the \nWater Supply and Storage Co., and the Forest Service. This legislation \nwas introduced last year and was passed by the House of Representatives \nas part of the Presidio package. It's my hope that we can pass this \nlegislation and have it signed into law before the session ends.\n  The city of Greeley and Water Supply and Storage operate eight \nreservoirs in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest. Because of the \nlocation of the reservoirs they are operated under Forest Service \nsupervision. This supervision has at times been controversial due to \ndisputes concerning whether being located on Forest Service property \nallows them to divert water in the national forest for purposes other \nthan the benefit of the owners. The legislation I am introducing would \nbenefit Greeley and Water Supply and Storage by allowing them to \nprotect these significant investments. As an additional benefit this \nlegislation would put an end to a bitter dispute between Greeley and \nthe Forest Service. The national forest would also greatly benefit from \nthis legislation. It would receive 708 acres of inholdings within the \nforest and the wilderness area. This land has been sought by the Forest \nService for some time and this exchange would finally allow them to \nconsolidate valuable resources in Colorado.\n  I offered this same bill last year when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. Unfortunately, it was caught up in election year \npolitics, specifically, my election. This year I want to put that \nbehind, and work toward passing this legislation as negotiated over the \npast several years with Greeley, and with Water Supply and Storage, and \nwith the Forest Service.\n  I believe that as introduced this legislation strikes a balance \nbetween protecting the rights of my constituents in Greeley and \nThornton and protecting the environment.\n  As currently drafted, Greeley and Thornton have not only agreed to \ntransfer their inholdings, they have also agreed to continue to \nparticipate in negotiations with a variety of governmental \norganizations and environmental groups to designate habitat for the \nwhooping crane. Furthermore, they have agreed to an improved stream \nflow in the Poudre River as a condition of the exchange and since many \nwesterners would rather part with blood than water, I think they've \ngone the extra mile.\n  This legislation is win/win for all involved. We should put all the \npolitics behind us, pass the legislation, and move on to matters that \nare less easily resolved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Santorum, and Mr. Ashcroft):\n  S. 544. A bill to provide certain protections to volunteers, \nnonprofit organizations, and governmental entities in lawsuits based on \nthe activities of volunteers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  The volunteer protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in just a few weeks, on April 27-29, \nthe Presidents' Summit for America's Future will assemble in \nPhiladelphia, cochaired by President Clinton and President Bush. This \nis an effort to mobilize millions of citizens and thousands of \norganizations to ensure a bright future for our youth and make \neffective citizen service an integral part of the American way of life. \nA number of leading corporations and service organizations have made \nspecific commitments of resources and volunteers to achieve the \nsummit's goal.\n  The leaders at the summit will issue a great call to action for \nAmericans, asking them to volunteer their time and efforts in community \nservice. This is in the best tradition of America. The thread of \nhelping your neighbor and taking an active part of civic life runs all \nthrough the history of our Nation. It is woven deeply into the fabric \nof our communities. It is a tie that binds us together as a robust and \nhealthy society.\n  Yet many who would heed that call to participate in the great \ntradition of volunteerism will not do so. Not because they lack the \ndesire or the ability to help, but for fear of punitive litigation. In \na recent Gallup study one in six volunteers reported withholding their \nservices for fear of being sued. About 1 in 10 nonprofit groups report \nthe resignation of a volunteer over litigation fears.\n  That is why I am today introducing the Volunteer Protection Act of \n1997, a bill to grant immunity from personal civil liability, under \ncertain circumstances, to volunteers working for nonprofit \norganizations and governmental entities. Senators McConnell, Abraham, \nSantorum, and Ashcroft have joined me as original cosponsors.\n  This act provides that no volunteer of a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity shall be liable for harm caused by the volunteer's \nacts or omissions on behalf of the organization. To enjoy this \nprotection, the volunteer must be acting within the scope of his or her \nresponsibilities in the organization and must not cause harm by willful \nor criminal misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct.\n  In other words, this act provides volunteers liability protection for \nsimple negligence only. It does not provide immunity from suit for \nmisconduct that includes violent crimes, hate crimes, sex crimes, or \ncivil rights violations. It does not apply where the defendant was \nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n  It is intended to protect volunteers who make a simple, honest \nmistake. The injured party will still have the recourse of suing the \norganization itself to be made whole. Nonprofit organizations will \ncontinue to have the duty to properly screen, train, and supervise \ntheir volunteers. The organization's liability is not affected. But we \nwill free the volunteers from fear of crushing lawsuits for mistakes \nmade while trying to do a good deed.\n  Federalism concerns arise whenever Congress takes up tort law. Our \nbill gives States flexibility to impose conditions and make exceptions \nto the granting of liability protection. It allows States to \naffirmatively opt out of this law for those cases where both the \nplaintiff and defendant are citizens of the State.\n  This bill requires clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence \nbefore punitive damages may be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit \norganization, or governmental entity because of a volunteer's actions. \nIt also establishes a rule of proportionate liability rather than joint \nand several liability in suits based on the action of a volunteer.\n  Mr. President, the Volunteer Protection Act will encourage the spirit \nof civic involvement and volunteerism that is so crucial to a healthy \ncivil society and stronger communities. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Protection Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n     is deterred by the potential for liability actions against \n     them and the organizations they serve;\n       (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n     organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n     associations, social service agencies, educational \n     institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n     affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n     directors and service in other capacities;\n       (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n     is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n     programs\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n     than would be obtainable if volunteers were participating;\n       (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n     effective social service programs, many of which are national \n     in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n     represent some of the most successful public-private \n     partnerships, protection of volunteerism through \n     clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n     assumed by the volunteer in connection with such \n     participation is an appropriate subject for Federal \n     legislation;\n       (5) services and goods provided by volunteers and nonprofit \n     organizations would often otherwise be provided by private \n     entities that operate in interstate commerce;\n       (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n     costs, volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher \n     costs in purchasing insurance, through interstate insurance \n     markets, to cover their activities; and\n       (7) reform efforts should respect the role of the States in \n     the development of civil justice rules, but recognize the \n     national Government's role.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the \n     interests of social service program beneficiaries and \n     taxpayers and to sustain the availability of programs, \n     nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities that \n     depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws to \n     provide certain protections from liability abuses related to \n     volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental \n     entities.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of any State to \n     the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act, \n     except that this Act shall not preempt any State law that \n     provides additional protection from liability relating to--\n       (1) volunteers or to any category of volunteers in the \n     performance of services for a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity; and\n       (2) nonprofit organizations or governmental entities.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This Act \n     shall not apply to any civil action in a State court against \n     a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity \n     in which all parties are citizens of the State if such State \n     enacts a statute--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this Act \n     shall not apply to such civil action in the State; and\n       (3) containing no other provisions.\n\n     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n       (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as \n     provided in subsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable \n     for harm caused by an act or omission of the volunteer on \n     behalf of the organization or entity if--\n       (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n       (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n     licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate \n     authorities for the activities or practice in the State in \n     which the harm occurred, where the activities were or \n     practice was undertaken within the scope of the volunteer's \n     responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity; and\n       (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal \n     misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a \n     conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of \n     the individual harmed by the volunteer.\n       (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers to \n     Organizations and Entities.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect any civil action brought by any nonprofit \n     organization or any governmental entity against any volunteer \n     of such organization or entity.\n       (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization or Entity.--\n     Except as provided under subsection (e), nothing in this \n     section shall be construed to affect the liability of any \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity with respect to \n     harm caused to any person.\n       (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the \n     laws of a State limit volunteer liability subject to one or \n     more of the following conditions, such conditions shall not \n     be construed as inconsistent with this section:\n       (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures, \n     including mandatory training of volunteers.\n       (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity \n     liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the \n     same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or \n     omissions of its employees.\n       (3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     inapplicable if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, \n     vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which the State \n     requires the operator or vehicle owner to possess an \n     operator's license or to maintain insurance.\n       (4) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of \n     a State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n       (5) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     applicable only if the nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for \n     individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a \n     volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A \n     financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance \n     policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a \n     risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n     arrangements that satisfy the State that the organization or \n     entity will be able to pay for losses up to a specified \n     amount. Separate standards for different types of liability \n     exposure may be specified.\n       (e) Limitation on Punitive Damages of Volunteers, Nonprofit \n     Organizations, and Governmental Entities.--\n       (1) General rule.--Punitive damages may not be awarded \n     against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental \n     entity in an action brought for harm because of the action of \n     a volunteer acting within the scope of the volunteer's \n     responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity unless the claimant establishes by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the harm was proximately caused by \n     an action of such volunteer which constitutes willful or \n     criminal misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to \n     the rights or safety of the individual harmed.\n       (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) does not create a cause of \n     action for punitive damages and does not preempt or supersede \n     any State law to the extent that such law would further limit \n     the award of punitive damages.\n       (f) Exceptions to Limitations on Liability.--The \n     limitations on the liability of a volunteer, nonprofit \n     organization, or governmental entity under this section shall \n     not apply to any misconduct that--\n       (1) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n     defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act \n     of international terrorism (as that term is defined in \n     section 2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been \n     convicted in any court;\n       (2) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n     Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n       (3) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable \n     State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n     court;\n       (4) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been \n     found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law; \n     or\n       (5) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n     determined pursuant to applicable State law) of intoxicating \n     alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.\n\n     SEC. 5. LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In any civil action against a volunteer, \n     nonprofit organization, or governmental entity based on an \n     action of a volunteer acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity, the liability of each defendant who is a \n     volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity for \n     noneconomic loss shall be determined in accordance with \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant shall be liable only for \n     the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to the defendant in \n     direct proportion to the percentage of responsibility of the \n     defendant (determined in accordance with paragraph (2)) for \n     the harm to the claimant with respect to which the defendant \n     is liable. The court shall render a separate judgment against \n     each defendant in an amount determined pursuant to the \n     preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     determine the percentage of responsibility of each person \n     responsible for the claimant's harm, whether or not such \n     person is a party to the action.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Economic loss.--The term ``economic loss'' means any \n     pecuniary loss resulting from harm (including the loss of \n     earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical \n     expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death, \n     burial costs, and loss of business or employment \n     opportunities) to the extent recovery for such loss is \n     allowed under applicable State law.\n       (2) Harm.--The term ``harm'' includes physical, \n     nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses.\n       (3) Noneconomic losses.--The term ``noneconomic losses'' \n     means losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, \n     inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, \n     disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and \n     companionship, loss of consortium (other than loss of \n     domestic service), hedonic damages, injury to reputation and \n     all other nonpecuniary losses of any kind or nature.\n       (4) Nonprofit organization.--The term ``nonprofit \n     organization'' means--\n       (A) any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under \n     section 501(a) of such Code; or\n       (B) any not-for-profit organization organized and conducted \n     for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, \n     civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes.\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\n     any political subdivision of any such State, territory, or \n     possession.\n       (6) Volunteer.--The term ``volunteer'' means an individual \n     performing services for a nonprofit organization or a \n     governmental entity who does not receive--\n       (A) compensation (other than reimbursement or allowance for \n     expenses actually incurred); or\n       (B) any other thing of value in lieu of compensation,\n\n     in excess of $500 per year, and such term includes a \n     volunteer serving as a director, officer, trustee, or direct \n     service volunteer.\n\n     SEC. 7. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--This Act shall take effect 90 days after \n     the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Application.--This Act applies to any claim for harm \n     caused by an act or omission of a volunteer where that claim \n     is filed on or after the effective date of this Act, without \n     regard to whether the harm that is the subject of the claim \n     or the conduct that caused the harm occurred before such \n     effective date.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, volunteer service has become a high \nrisk venture. Our ``sue happy'' legal culture has ensnared those \nselfless individuals who help worthy organizations and institutions \nthrough volunteer service. And, these lawsuits are proof that no good \ndeed goes unpunished.\n  In order to relieve volunteers from this unnecessary and unfair \nburden of liability, I am pleased to join in the introduction of the \nVolunteer Protection Act.\n  The litigation craze is hurting the spirit of voluntarism that is an \nintegral part of American society. From school chaperones to Girl Scout \nand Boy Scout troop leaders to unpaid rural doctors and nursing home \naides, volunteers perform valuable services. And, these volunteers are \nbeing dragged into court and needlessly and unfairly sued. The end \nresult? Too many people pointing fingers and too few offering a helping \nhand.\n  So, this bill creates immunity from lawsuits for those volunteers who \nact within the scope of their responsibilities, who are properly \nlicensed or certified where necessary, and who do not act in a willful, \ncriminal or grossly negligent fashion.\n  The bill recognizes that the States may enact their own form of \nvolunteer protection and provides that State laws may permit the \nfollowing:\n  A requirement that the organization or entity adhere to risk \nmanagement procedures, including the training of volunteers;\n  A requirement that the organization or entity be accountable for the \nactions of its volunteers in the same way that an employer is liable \nfor the acts of its employees;\n  An exemption from the liability protection in the event the volunteer \nis using a motor vehicle or similar instrument;\n  An exemption from the liability protection if the lawsuit is brought \nby a State or local official; and\n  A requirement that the liability protection applies only if the \nnonprofit organization or government entity provides a financially \nsecure source of recovery, such as an insurance policy for those who \nsuffer harm.\n  I look forward to the Senate's prompt consideration of this bill. Our \ncommunities are depending upon us to enact this pro-volunteer \nlegislation. The time has come for us to help those who have given so \nmuch to all of us.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to rise today to \njoin my colleagues, Senator Coverdell and Senator McConnell, in \nintroducing the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. I commend Senators \nCoverdell and McConnell for their leadership in encouraging and \nsupporting the voluntarism that is so important to communities in \nMichigan and across this country.\n  This long overdue legislation will provide volunteers and nonprofit \norganizations with desperately needed relief from abusive lawsuits \nbrought based on the activities of volunteers. Those are precisely the \nactivities that we should be protecting and encouraging.\n  Last Congress, I spoke on the floor many times concerning the need \nfor litigation reform and describing the litigation abuses that plague \nour small businesses, our consumers, our schools, and others. I came to \nCongress as a freshman Senator intending to press for lawsuit reforms, \nand I did. I supported the securities litigation reform legislation, \nwhich Congress successfully enacted over the President's veto, and I \nalso supported the product liability reform bill, which the President \nunfortunately killed with his veto. I also introduced legislation with \nSenator McConnell to provide broader relief in all civil cases, and \noffered floor amendments that would do the same.\n  I continue to support broader civil justice reforms and I \nparticularly look forward to considering product liability reform \nlegislation both in the Commerce Committee and on the floor. But I \nbelieve that our voluntary, nonprofit organizations urgently need \nprotection from current lawsuit abuses. I encourage my colleagues to \nconsider the problems facing our community groups and their volunteers, \nand to support this legislation. I hope that in this instance President \nClinton will support this litigation reform bill, recognize the value \nof volunteers and nonprofit groups, and give them the protection they \nneed to keep doing their good deeds.\n  Nonprofit organizations hold our Nation together. In them we learn to \ncare for our neighbors. They are key to our survival as a nation and we \nmust protect them with systemic reforms.\n  America has a vast interstate network of 114,000 operating nonprofit \norganizations, ranging from schools to hospitals to clinics to food \nprograms.\n  This network's revenues totaled $388 billion in 1990. Meanwhile, \nrevenues for the 19,000 support institutions, which raise money to fund \noperating organizations came to $29 billion. And total revenues for \nreligious congregations were $48 billion. That's $465 billion worth of \nnonprofit activity we enjoyed in 1990 alone, Mr. President.\n  Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on volunteers, and Americans \ngladly comply. According to a 1993 report from the Independent Sector, \na national coalition of 800 organizations, Americans donated 9.7 \nbillion hours of their time to nonprofit organizations that year. This \nvolunteer time produced the equivalent of 5.7 million full time \nvolunteers, worth an estimated $112 billion.\n  Unfortunately voluntarism is declining nationwide. According to the \nIndependent Sector report, the percentage of Americans volunteering \ndropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 1991 and 48 percent in \n1993. Americans also are giving less money. The average household's \ncharitable donation dropped from $978 in 1989 to $880 in 1993.\n  The decline of giving and volunteering spells danger for our \nvoluntary organizations, for the people who depend on them, and for the \nsocial trust that is based on the spirit of association.\n  But why is voluntarism on the decline? Obviously there are a number \nof relevant factors, not least among them the need so many people today \nfeel to work ever-harder and ever-longer to bear our growing tax \nburden. But one major reason for the decline is America's litigation \nexplosion. Nonprofit organizations are forced to spend an \nincreasing amount of time and resources preparing for, avoiding, and/or \nfighting lawsuits. Thus litigation has rendered our nonprofit \norganizations less effective at helping people, and allowed Americans \nto retreat more into their private lives, and away from the public, \nsocial activity that binds us together as a people.\n\n  The litigation costs facing voluntary associations are many. John \nGraham, on behalf of the American Society of Association Executives \n[ASAE], gave testimony last year arguing that liability insurance \npremiums for associations have increased an average 155 percent in \nrecent years. Some of our most revered nonprofit institutions have been \nput at risk by increased liability costs.\n  Dr. Creightin Hale of Little League Baseball reports that the \nliability rate for a league increased from $75 to $795 in just 5 years. \nMany leagues cannot afford this added expense, on top of increasing \ncosts for helmets and other equipment. These leagues operate without \ninsurance or disband altogether, often leaving children with no \norganized sports in their neighborhood.\n  What kind of suits add to insurance costs? ASAE reports that one New \nJersey umpire was forced by a court to pay a catcher $24,000. Why? \nBecause the catcher was hit in the eye by a softball while playing \nwithout a mask. The catcher complained that the umpire should have lent \nhim his.\n  Organizations that try to escape sky-rocketing insurance costs must \nself-insure, and Andrea Marisi of the Red\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\nCross will describe self-insurance costs only as ``huge.'' The result? \nObviously, we have fewer funds available for providing services than \nwould otherwise be the case.''\n  Outside insurance generally comes with significant deductibles. \nCharles Kolb of the United Way points out that insurance deductibles \nfor his organization fall into the range of $25,000-30,000. When, as \nhas been the case in recent years, the organization is subjected to \nthree or four lawsuits per year, $100,000 or more must be diverted from \ncharitable programs.\n  And there are even more costs. Mr. Kolb reports that the costs in \nlost time and money spent on discovery, for example going through files \nfor hours on end to establish who did what when, can run into the \nthousands of dollars. Further, as the Boy Scouts' William Cople puts \nit: ``We bear increased costs from risk management programs of many \nkinds--[including] those to prevent accidents. We have higher legal \nbills as well. But even more of a problem is the need to find pro-bono \nhelp to quell possible lawsuits. The Scouts must spend scarce time, and \nuse up scarce human capital in preventing suits. For example, 5 years \nago the General Counsel's office, a pro-bono operation, committed less \nthan 100 hours per year on issues relating to lawsuits. Last year we \ndevoted about 750 hours to that duty.'' The Boy Scouts must do less \ngood so that they can defend themselves from lawsuits.\n  Frivolous lawsuits also increase costs by discouraging voluntarism. \nDottie Lewis of the Southwest Officials Association, which provides \nofficials for scholastic games, observes, ``Some of our people got to \nthe point where they were just afraid to work because of the threat of \nlawsuits.'' What makes this fear worse is the knowledge that one need \ndo no harm in order to be liable.\n  Take for example Powell versus Boy Scouts of America. While on an \nouting with the Sea Explorers, a scouting unit in the Boy Scouts' \nCascade Pacific Council, a youth suffered a tragic, paralyzing injury \nin a rough game of touch football. Several adults had volunteered to \nsupervise the outing, but none observed the game. The youth filed a \npersonal injury lawsuit against two of the adult volunteers. The jury \nfound the volunteers liable for some $7 million, which Oregon law \nreduced to about $4 million--far more than the volunteers could \npossibly pay.\n  What is more, as Cople points out, ``the jury seemingly held the \nvolunteers to a standard of care requiring them constantly to supervise \nthe youth entrusted to their charge, even for activities which under \nother circumstances may routinely be permitted without such meticulous \noversight.''\n\n  One child's tragedy led a jury to impose an unreasonable standard of \ncare on individuals who, after all, had volunteered their time and \neffort for an outing, not a football game.\n  No one can provide the meticulous oversight demanded by the jury. \nThus volunteers are left at the mercy of events, and juries, beyond \ntheir control.\n  Such unreasonable standards of care also penalize our nonprofit \norganizations. Len Krugel of the Michigan Salvation Army reports that \nregulations and onerous legal standards often keep his organization \nfrom giving troubled youths a second chance. Because the organization \nis held responsible for essentially all actions by its employees and \nvolunteers, it can take no risks in hiring. Thus the Salvation Army can \nneither hire nor accept voluntary services from any individual with any \ndrug conviction, including a 0.3 reading on a breathalyzer test for \nalcohol consumption. As Mr. Krugel observes, ``If we can't give these \nkids a second chance, who can?''\n  Then there is the problem of joint and several liability, in which \none defendant is made to pay for all damages even though responsible \nfor only a small portion. Such findings are a severe burden on the \nUnited Way, a national organization that sponsors numerous local \nnonprofit groups. Although it cannot control local operations, the \nUnited Way often finds itself a defendant in suits arising from \ninjuries caused by the local entity.\n  Such holdings result from juries' desire to find someone with the \nfunds necessary to pay for an innocent party's injuries. But this \nsearch for the deep pocket leads to what Ms. Marisi calls a ``chilling \neffect'' on Red Cross relations with other nonprofits. The Red Cross is \nnow less willing to cooperate with smaller, more innovative local \nagencies that might make it more effective.\n  Thus nonprofits forbear from doing good because they cannot afford \nthe insurance, they cannot afford the loss of volunteers, they cannot \nafford the risk of frivolous lawsuits.\n  The Volunteer Protection Act will address the danger to our nonprofit \nsector, Mr. President. It will not solve all the problems facing our \nvolunteers and nonprofits, but it will provide voluntary organizations \nwith critical protection against improper litigation, at the same time \nthat it recognizes the ability of the States to take additional or even \nalternative protections in some cases. By setting the standard for the \nprotection of volunteers outright, this bill provides much-needed \nlawsuit relief immediately to volunteers and nonprofits wherever they \nmay be. Let me briefly describe what this bill does.\n  The bill protects volunteers from liability unless they cause harm \nthrough action that constitutes reckless misconduct, gross negligence, \nwillful or criminal misconduct, or is in conscious, flagrant disregard \nfor the rights and safety of the individual harmed. This ensures that \nwhere volunteers truly exceed the bounds of appropriate conduct they \nwill be liable. But in the many ridiculous cases I have discussed--\nwhere no real wrongdoing occurred--the volunteer will not be forced to \nface and defend a lawsuit.\n  In lawsuits based on the actions of a volunteer, the bill limits the \npunitive damages that can be awarded. It is unfortunate that charities \nand volunteers have punitive damages awarded against them in the first \nplace, but they do--Congressman John Porter reports that in August of \n1990 a Chicago jury awarded $12 million to a boy who was injured in a \ncar crash. The ``negligent'' party? The estate of the volunteer who \ngave his life attempting to save the boy.\n  Under this bill, punitive damages in cases involving the actions of a \nvolunteer could be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, \nor government entity only upon a showing by the claimant that the \nvolunteer's action represented willful or criminal misconduct, or \nshowed a conscious, flagrant disregard for the rights and safety of the \nindividual harmed.\n\n  This should ensure that punitive damages, which are intended only to \npunish a defendant and are not intended to compensate an injured \nperson, will only be available in situations where punishment really is \ncalled for because of the egregious conduct of the defendant.\n  The bill also protects volunteers from excessive liability that they \nmight face through joint and several liability. Under the doctrine of \njoint and several liability, a plaintiff can obtain full damages from a \ndefendant who is only slightly at fault. I have spoken many times \nbefore about the unfairness that may result from the application of \nthis legal doctrine. The injustice that results to volunteers and \nnonprofits is often even more acute, because they lack the resources to \nbear unfair judgments.\n  This bill strikes a balance by providing that, in cases based on the \nactions of a volunteer, any defendant that is a volunteer, nonprofit \norganization, or government entity will be jointly and severally \nresponsible for the full share of economic damages but will only be \nresponsible for noneconomic damages in proportion to the harm that that \ndefendant caused. That is a fair approach.\n  Finally, I would like to speak for a moment about how this \nlegislation preserves important principles of federalism and respects \nthe role of the States. First, the bill does not preempt State \nlegislation that provides greater protections to volunteers. In this \nway, it sets up outer protections from which all volunteers will \nbenefit and permits States to do more. Second, the bill includes an \nopt-out provision that permits States, in cases involving only parties \nfrom that State, to affirmatively elect to opt out of the protections \nprovided in the Volunteer Protection Act. A State can do so by enacting \na statute specifically providing for that. I suspect that no States \nwill elect to do so, but I feel that, as a matter of principle, it is \nimportant to include that provision.\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\n  In short, these reforms can help create a system in which plaintiffs \nsue only when they have good reason--and only those who are responsible \nfor their damages--and in which only those who are responsible must \npay. Such reforms will create an atmosphere in which our fear of one \nanother will be lessened, and our ability to join associations in which \nwe learn to care for one another will be significantly greater.\n  And that, Mr. President, will make for a better America.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2926-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2926-S2931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Kempthorne):\n  S. 538.

Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill to \nauthorize the Secretary of the Interior to transfer certain facilities \nat the Minidoka irrigation project to the Burley Irrigation District. \nThe introduction of this legislation results from a hearing I held in \nthe Senate Energy Committee in the past Congress and is nearly \nidentical to S. 1291 from that Congress. I am introducing this project-\nspecific legislation because it is obvious to me a general transfer \nbill is not workable; each reclamation project has unique qualities, \nand projects should be addressed individually or in distinct groupings.\n  The Reclamation Act of 1902 was part of the history of Federal public \nland laws designed to transfer lands out of Federal ownership and to \nsettle this Nation. The origins of that policy predate the Constitution \nand derive from the early debates that led to the Northwest Ordinance \nof 1787. The particular needs and circumstances of the arid and \nsemiarid lands west of the 100th meridian led to various proposals to \nreclaim the lands, including the Desert Land Act and the Carey Act. In \nhis State of the Union Message of 1901, President Theodore Roosevelt \nfinally called for the Federal Government to intervene to develop the \nreservoirs and works necessary to accomplish such irrigation. The \nreclamation program was enormously successful. It grew from the \nirrigation program contemplated by one President Roosevelt to the \nmassive works constructed four decades later by the second President \nRoosevelt. For those of us in the Northwest, there is a very personal \nmeaning to a line from Woody Guthrie's song about the Columbia that \ngoes: ``your power is turning our darkness to dawn, so roll on \nColumbia, roll on.''\n  If what is known now had been known then, some projects may have been \nconstructed differently. However, that is not the question we have \nbefore us. The central question is whether and to what extent the \nFederal Government should seek to transfer the title and responsibility \nfor these projects. Has the Federal mission been accomplished?\n  The best transfer case would be the single purpose irrigation or \nmunicipal and industrial [M] system that is fully repaid, operation \nhas long since been transferred, and the water rights are held \nprivately. That is the case with the Burley Irrigation District \ntransfer.\n  The transfer of title is not a new idea. Authority to transfer title \nto the All American Canal is contained in section 7 of the Boulder \nCanyon Project Act of 1928. General authority is contained in the 1955 \nDistribution Systems Loan Act. Recently, Congress passed legislation \ndealing with Elephant Butte and Vermejo.\n  The Burley Irrigation District is part of the Minidoka project that \nwas built under the authorization of the 1902. Reclamation Act. By a \ncontract executed in 1926, the District assumed the operation and \nmaintenance of the system.\n  All construction contracts and costs for the canals system, pumping \nplants, power house, transmission lines and other improvements have \nbeen paid in full. Contracts for storage space at Minidoka, American \nFalls, and Palisades reservoirs have been paid in full, along with all \nmaintenance fees. This project is a perfect example of the Federal \nGovernment maintaining only a bare title, and that title should now be \ntransferred to the project recipients who have paid for the facilities \nand the rights of the Burley Irrigation District.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 540. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide annual screening mammography and waive coinsurance for \nscreening mammography for women age 65 or older under the Medicare \nProgram; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the medicare mammography screening expansion act\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, there is no doubt a lot of women in \ntheir forties who are awfully confused these days about whether they \nshould receive a regular mammogram to test for breast cancer. Over the \nlast several years--and especially over the last couple of months--the \ndebate in the scientific community and the conflicting scientific \nstudies have not painted a very clear picture for younger women.\n  But, what is perfectly clear--what is not in dispute--is that older \nwomen should receive regular mammograms. Mammograms save lives. And, \nthe scientific studies confirm it. If all women over 50 received \nregular mammograms, breast cancer mortality could be reduced by one-\nthird. The recommended screening guidelines reflect this, no matter \nwhat group's guidelines you read. The American Cancer Society, the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American \nMedical Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the \nAmerican College of Physicians all recommend that women over 50 receive \nannual mammograms.\n  Now, here's the problem. Women 65 and over have Medicare as their \nhealth insurance. The guidelines tell them--and their doctors are \ntelling them--to get a mammogram once a year. But, Medicare pays for \nmammograms only once every 2 years. This means that an elderly woman \nmust pay the cost of every other mammogram herself--or go without a \nmammogram every other year. And, even when Medicare pays for the \nmammogram, the woman is still responsible for at least 20 percent of \nthe cost.\n  The result, Mr. President, is that too many women are following \nMedicare's payment rules--and not getting tested--rather than following \nthe scientific guidelines--and being tested.\n  Two years ago, a study was published in the New England Journal of \nMedicine. It found that only 14.4 percent of women without Medicare \nsupplemental insurance--that is, women who do not have, on top of \nMedicare, private insurance that may cover mammograms on an annual \nbasis--only 14.4 percent of those women received even a mammogram once \nevery 2 years, let alone annually. Even among those women with \nsupplemental insurance, less than half had a mammogram over the course \nof 2 years. The study concluded that a woman's inability to pay a share \nof the costs for mammograms ``is an obstacle to the effective mass \nscreening of older women for breast cancer.'' And, I would add, an \nobstacle to saving thousands of lives.\n  So, Mr. President, today I am introducing the Medicare Mammography \nScreening Expansion Act. This bill does two things. First, it would \ncover mammograms under Medicare once every year, as recommended by the \nguidelines, instead of once every 2 years, which is now the law. \nSecond, it would eliminate the 20-percent copayment that is currently \ncharged to women when they receive a mammogram, so that women are not \ndiscouraged from obtaining this important preventive measure because of \nthe cost. I should note that eliminating the copayment is not \nunprecedented. Medicare already does not charge copayments for flu \nshots and most clinical laboratory tests.\n  Mr. President, we know that mammograms save lives. Yet, current \nMedicare policy creates barriers that are\n\n[[Page S2927]]\n\npreventing women from seeking this simple, life-saving procedure. I \nurge my colleagues to join me in making mammography screenings more \navailable and more affordable for American women.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD:\n  S. 541. A bill to provide for an exchange of lands with the city of \nGreeley, CO, and the Water Supply and Storage Co. to eliminate private \ninholdings in wilderness areas, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n              the rockwell ranch land transfer act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwould provide for a land exchange between the city of Greeley, the \nWater Supply and Storage Co., and the Forest Service. This legislation \nwas introduced last year and was passed by the House of Representatives \nas part of the Presidio package. It's my hope that we can pass this \nlegislation and have it signed into law before the session ends.\n  The city of Greeley and Water Supply and Storage operate eight \nreservoirs in the Arapaho-Roosevelt National Forest. Because of the \nlocation of the reservoirs they are operated under Forest Service \nsupervision. This supervision has at times been controversial due to \ndisputes concerning whether being located on Forest Service property \nallows them to divert water in the national forest for purposes other \nthan the benefit of the owners. The legislation I am introducing would \nbenefit Greeley and Water Supply and Storage by allowing them to \nprotect these significant investments. As an additional benefit this \nlegislation would put an end to a bitter dispute between Greeley and \nthe Forest Service. The national forest would also greatly benefit from \nthis legislation. It would receive 708 acres of inholdings within the \nforest and the wilderness area. This land has been sought by the Forest \nService for some time and this exchange would finally allow them to \nconsolidate valuable resources in Colorado.\n  I offered this same bill last year when I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. Unfortunately, it was caught up in election year \npolitics, specifically, my election. This year I want to put that \nbehind, and work toward passing this legislation as negotiated over the \npast several years with Greeley, and with Water Supply and Storage, and \nwith the Forest Service.\n  I believe that as introduced this legislation strikes a balance \nbetween protecting the rights of my constituents in Greeley and \nThornton and protecting the environment.\n  As currently drafted, Greeley and Thornton have not only agreed to \ntransfer their inholdings, they have also agreed to continue to \nparticipate in negotiations with a variety of governmental \norganizations and environmental groups to designate habitat for the \nwhooping crane. Furthermore, they have agreed to an improved stream \nflow in the Poudre River as a condition of the exchange and since many \nwesterners would rather part with blood than water, I think they've \ngone the extra mile.\n  This legislation is win/win for all involved. We should put all the \npolitics behind us, pass the legislation, and move on to matters that \nare less easily resolved.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. COVERDELL (for himself, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Santorum, and Mr. Ashcroft):\n  S. 544. A bill to provide certain protections to volunteers, \nnonprofit organizations, and governmental entities in lawsuits based on \nthe activities of volunteers; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                  The volunteer protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, in just a few weeks, on April 27-29, \nthe Presidents' Summit for America's Future will assemble in \nPhiladelphia, cochaired by President Clinton and President Bush. This \nis an effort to mobilize millions of citizens and thousands of \norganizations to ensure a bright future for our youth and make \neffective citizen service an integral part of the American way of life. \nA number of leading corporations and service organizations have made \nspecific commitments of resources and volunteers to achieve the \nsummit's goal.\n  The leaders at the summit will issue a great call to action for \nAmericans, asking them to volunteer their time and efforts in community \nservice. This is in the best tradition of America. The thread of \nhelping your neighbor and taking an active part of civic life runs all \nthrough the history of our Nation. It is woven deeply into the fabric \nof our communities. It is a tie that binds us together as a robust and \nhealthy society.\n  Yet many who would heed that call to participate in the great \ntradition of volunteerism will not do so. Not because they lack the \ndesire or the ability to help, but for fear of punitive litigation. In \na recent Gallup study one in six volunteers reported withholding their \nservices for fear of being sued. About 1 in 10 nonprofit groups report \nthe resignation of a volunteer over litigation fears.\n  That is why I am today introducing the Volunteer Protection Act of \n1997, a bill to grant immunity from personal civil liability, under \ncertain circumstances, to volunteers working for nonprofit \norganizations and governmental entities. Senators McConnell, Abraham, \nSantorum, and Ashcroft have joined me as original cosponsors.\n  This act provides that no volunteer of a nonprofit organization or \ngovernmental entity shall be liable for harm caused by the volunteer's \nacts or omissions on behalf of the organization. To enjoy this \nprotection, the volunteer must be acting within the scope of his or her \nresponsibilities in the organization and must not cause harm by willful \nor criminal misconduct, gross negligence, or reckless misconduct.\n  In other words, this act provides volunteers liability protection for \nsimple negligence only. It does not provide immunity from suit for \nmisconduct that includes violent crimes, hate crimes, sex crimes, or \ncivil rights violations. It does not apply where the defendant was \nunder the influence of drugs or alcohol.\n  It is intended to protect volunteers who make a simple, honest \nmistake. The injured party will still have the recourse of suing the \norganization itself to be made whole. Nonprofit organizations will \ncontinue to have the duty to properly screen, train, and supervise \ntheir volunteers. The organization's liability is not affected. But we \nwill free the volunteers from fear of crushing lawsuits for mistakes \nmade while trying to do a good deed.\n  Federalism concerns arise whenever Congress takes up tort law. Our \nbill gives States flexibility to impose conditions and make exceptions \nto the granting of liability protection. It allows States to \naffirmatively opt out of this law for those cases where both the \nplaintiff and defendant are citizens of the State.\n  This bill requires clear and convincing evidence of gross negligence \nbefore punitive damages may be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit \norganization, or governmental entity because of a volunteer's actions. \nIt also establishes a rule of proportionate liability rather than joint \nand several liability in suits based on the action of a volunteer.\n  Mr. President, the Volunteer Protection Act will encourage the spirit \nof civic involvement and volunteerism that is so crucial to a healthy \ncivil society and stronger communities. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 544\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Protection Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services \n     is deterred by the potential for liability actions against \n     them and the organizations they serve;\n       (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private \n     organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary \n     associations, social service agencies, educational \n     institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely \n     affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of \n     directors and service in other capacities;\n       (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities \n     is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost \n     programs\n\n[[Page S2928]]\n\n     than would be obtainable if volunteers were participating;\n       (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-\n     effective social service programs, many of which are national \n     in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and \n     represent some of the most successful public-private \n     partnerships, protection of volunteerism through \n     clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks \n     assumed by the volunteer in connection with such \n     participation is an appropriate subject for Federal \n     legislation;\n       (5) services and goods provided by volunteers and nonprofit \n     organizations would often otherwise be provided by private \n     entities that operate in interstate commerce;\n       (6) due to high liability costs and unwarranted litigation \n     costs, volunteers and nonprofit organizations face higher \n     costs in purchasing insurance, through interstate insurance \n     markets, to cover their activities; and\n       (7) reform efforts should respect the role of the States in \n     the development of civil justice rules, but recognize the \n     national Government's role.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the \n     interests of social service program beneficiaries and \n     taxpayers and to sustain the availability of programs, \n     nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities that \n     depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws to \n     provide certain protections from liability abuses related to \n     volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental \n     entities.\n\n     SEC. 3. PREEMPTION AND ELECTION OF STATE NONAPPLICABILITY.\n\n       (a) Preemption.--This Act preempts the laws of any State to \n     the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act, \n     except that this Act shall not preempt any State law that \n     provides additional protection from liability relating to--\n       (1) volunteers or to any category of volunteers in the \n     performance of services for a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity; and\n       (2) nonprofit organizations or governmental entities.\n       (b) Election of State Regarding Nonapplicability.--This Act \n     shall not apply to any civil action in a State court against \n     a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity \n     in which all parties are citizens of the State if such State \n     enacts a statute--\n       (1) citing the authority of this subsection;\n       (2) declaring the election of such State that this Act \n     shall not apply to such civil action in the State; and\n       (3) containing no other provisions.\n\n     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.\n\n       (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as \n     provided in subsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable \n     for harm caused by an act or omission of the volunteer on \n     behalf of the organization or entity if--\n       (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;\n       (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly \n     licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate \n     authorities for the activities or practice in the State in \n     which the harm occurred, where the activities were or \n     practice was undertaken within the scope of the volunteer's \n     responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity; and\n       (3) the harm was not caused by willful or criminal \n     misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a \n     conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of \n     the individual harmed by the volunteer.\n       (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers to \n     Organizations and Entities.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed to affect any civil action brought by any nonprofit \n     organization or any governmental entity against any volunteer \n     of such organization or entity.\n       (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization or Entity.--\n     Except as provided under subsection (e), nothing in this \n     section shall be construed to affect the liability of any \n     nonprofit organization or governmental entity with respect to \n     harm caused to any person.\n       (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the \n     laws of a State limit volunteer liability subject to one or \n     more of the following conditions, such conditions shall not \n     be construed as inconsistent with this section:\n       (1) A State law that requires a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity to adhere to risk management procedures, \n     including mandatory training of volunteers.\n       (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity \n     liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the \n     same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or \n     omissions of its employees.\n       (3) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     inapplicable if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, \n     vessel, aircraft, or other vehicle for which the State \n     requires the operator or vehicle owner to possess an \n     operator's license or to maintain insurance.\n       (4) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     inapplicable if the civil action was brought by an officer of \n     a State or local government pursuant to State or local law.\n       (5) A State law that makes a limitation of liability \n     applicable only if the nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for \n     individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a \n     volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A \n     financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance \n     policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a \n     risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative \n     arrangements that satisfy the State that the organization or \n     entity will be able to pay for losses up to a specified \n     amount. Separate standards for different types of liability \n     exposure may be specified.\n       (e) Limitation on Punitive Damages of Volunteers, Nonprofit \n     Organizations, and Governmental Entities.--\n       (1) General rule.--Punitive damages may not be awarded \n     against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental \n     entity in an action brought for harm because of the action of \n     a volunteer acting within the scope of the volunteer's \n     responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or governmental \n     entity unless the claimant establishes by clear and \n     convincing evidence that the harm was proximately caused by \n     an action of such volunteer which constitutes willful or \n     criminal misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to \n     the rights or safety of the individual harmed.\n       (2) Construction.--Paragraph (1) does not create a cause of \n     action for punitive damages and does not preempt or supersede \n     any State law to the extent that such law would further limit \n     the award of punitive damages.\n       (f) Exceptions to Limitations on Liability.--The \n     limitations on the liability of a volunteer, nonprofit \n     organization, or governmental entity under this section shall \n     not apply to any misconduct that--\n       (1) constitutes a crime of violence (as that term is \n     defined in section 16 of title 18, United States Code) or act \n     of international terrorism (as that term is defined in \n     section 2331 of title 18) for which the defendant has been \n     convicted in any court;\n       (2) constitutes a hate crime (as that term is used in the \n     Hate Crime Statistics Act (28 U.S.C. 534 note));\n       (3) involves a sexual offense, as defined by applicable \n     State law, for which the defendant has been convicted in any \n     court;\n       (4) involves misconduct for which the defendant has been \n     found to have violated a Federal or State civil rights law; \n     or\n       (5) where the defendant was under the influence (as \n     determined pursuant to applicable State law) of intoxicating \n     alcohol or any drug at the time of the misconduct.\n\n     SEC. 5. LIABILITY FOR NONECONOMIC LOSS.\n\n       (a) General Rule.--In any civil action against a volunteer, \n     nonprofit organization, or governmental entity based on an \n     action of a volunteer acting within the scope of the \n     volunteer's responsibilities to a nonprofit organization or \n     governmental entity, the liability of each defendant who is a \n     volunteer, nonprofit organization, or governmental entity for \n     noneconomic loss shall be determined in accordance with \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Amount of Liability.--\n       (1) In general.--Each defendant shall be liable only for \n     the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to the defendant in \n     direct proportion to the percentage of responsibility of the \n     defendant (determined in accordance with paragraph (2)) for \n     the harm to the claimant with respect to which the defendant \n     is liable. The court shall render a separate judgment against \n     each defendant in an amount determined pursuant to the \n     preceding sentence.\n       (2) Percentage of responsibility.--For purposes of \n     determining the amount of noneconomic loss allocated to a \n     defendant under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     determine the percentage of responsibility of each person \n     responsible for the claimant's harm, whether or not such \n     person is a party to the action.\n\n     SEC. 6. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) Economic loss.--The term ``economic loss'' means any \n     pecuniary loss resulting from harm (including the loss of \n     earnings or other benefits related to employment, medical \n     expense loss, replacement services loss, loss due to death, \n     burial costs, and loss of business or employment \n     opportunities) to the extent recovery for such loss is \n     allowed under applicable State law.\n       (2) Harm.--The term ``harm'' includes physical, \n     nonphysical, economic, and noneconomic losses.\n       (3) Noneconomic losses.--The term ``noneconomic losses'' \n     means losses for physical and emotional pain, suffering, \n     inconvenience, physical impairment, mental anguish, \n     disfigurement, loss of enjoyment of life, loss of society and \n     companionship, loss of consortium (other than loss of \n     domestic service), hedonic damages, injury to reputation and \n     all other nonpecuniary losses of any kind or nature.\n       (4) Nonprofit organization.--The term ``nonprofit \n     organization'' means--\n       (A) any organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under \n     section 501(a) of such Code; or\n       (B) any not-for-profit organization organized and conducted \n     for public benefit and operated primarily for charitable, \n     civic, educational, religious, welfare, or health purposes.\n       (5) State.--The term ``State'' means each of the several \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, the Northern \n     Mariana Islands, any other territory or possession of the \n     United States, or\n\n[[Page S2929]]\n\n     any political subdivision of any such State, territory, or \n     possession.\n       (6) Volunteer.--The term ``volunteer'' means an individual \n     performing services for a nonprofit organization or a \n     governmental entity who does not receive--\n       (A) compensation (other than reimbursement or allowance for \n     expenses actually incurred); or\n       (B) any other thing of value in lieu of compensation,\n\n     in excess of $500 per year, and such term includes a \n     volunteer serving as a director, officer, trustee, or direct \n     service volunteer.\n\n     SEC. 7.

Mr. President, volunteer service has become a high \nrisk venture. Our ``sue happy'' legal culture has ensnared those \nselfless individuals who help worthy organizations and institutions \nthrough volunteer service. And, these lawsuits are proof that no good \ndeed goes unpunished.\n  In order to relieve volunteers from this unnecessary and unfair \nburden of liability, I am pleased to join in the introduction of the \nVolunteer Protection Act.\n  The litigation craze is hurting the spirit of voluntarism that is an \nintegral part of American society. From school chaperones to Girl Scout \nand Boy Scout troop leaders to unpaid rural doctors and nursing home \naides, volunteers perform valuable services. And, these volunteers are \nbeing dragged into court and needlessly and unfairly sued. The end \nresult? Too many people pointing fingers and too few offering a helping \nhand.\n  So, this bill creates immunity from lawsuits for those volunteers who \nact within the scope of their responsibilities, who are properly \nlicensed or certified where necessary, and who do not act in a willful, \ncriminal or grossly negligent fashion.\n  The bill recognizes that the States may enact their own form of \nvolunteer protection and provides that State laws may permit the \nfollowing:\n  A requirement that the organization or entity adhere to risk \nmanagement procedures, including the training of volunteers;\n  A requirement that the organization or entity be accountable for the \nactions of its volunteers in the same way that an employer is liable \nfor the acts of its employees;\n  An exemption from the liability protection in the event the volunteer \nis using a motor vehicle or similar instrument;\n  An exemption from the liability protection if the lawsuit is brought \nby a State or local official; and\n  A requirement that the liability protection applies only if the \nnonprofit organization or government entity provides a financially \nsecure source of recovery, such as an insurance policy for those who \nsuffer harm.\n  I look forward to the Senate's prompt consideration of this bill. Our \ncommunities are depending upon us to enact this pro-volunteer \nlegislation. The time has come for us to help those who have given so \nmuch to all of us.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to rise today to \njoin my colleagues, Senator Coverdell and Senator McConnell, in \nintroducing the Volunteer Protection Act of 1997. I commend Senators \nCoverdell and McConnell for their leadership in encouraging and \nsupporting the voluntarism that is so important to communities in \nMichigan and across this country.\n  This long overdue legislation will provide volunteers and nonprofit \norganizations with desperately needed relief from abusive lawsuits \nbrought based on the activities of volunteers. Those are precisely the \nactivities that we should be protecting and encouraging.\n  Last Congress, I spoke on the floor many times concerning the need \nfor litigation reform and describing the litigation abuses that plague \nour small businesses, our consumers, our schools, and others. I came to \nCongress as a freshman Senator intending to press for lawsuit reforms, \nand I did. I supported the securities litigation reform legislation, \nwhich Congress successfully enacted over the President's veto, and I \nalso supported the product liability reform bill, which the President \nunfortunately killed with his veto. I also introduced legislation with \nSenator McConnell to provide broader relief in all civil cases, and \noffered floor amendments that would do the same.\n  I continue to support broader civil justice reforms and I \nparticularly look forward to considering product liability reform \nlegislation both in the Commerce Committee and on the floor. But I \nbelieve that our voluntary, nonprofit organizations urgently need \nprotection from current lawsuit abuses. I encourage my colleagues to \nconsider the problems facing our community groups and their volunteers, \nand to support this legislation. I hope that in this instance President \nClinton will support this litigation reform bill, recognize the value \nof volunteers and nonprofit groups, and give them the protection they \nneed to keep doing their good deeds.\n  Nonprofit organizations hold our Nation together. In them we learn to \ncare for our neighbors. They are key to our survival as a nation and we \nmust protect them with systemic reforms.\n  America has a vast interstate network of 114,000 operating nonprofit \norganizations, ranging from schools to hospitals to clinics to food \nprograms.\n  This network's revenues totaled $388 billion in 1990. Meanwhile, \nrevenues for the 19,000 support institutions, which raise money to fund \noperating organizations came to $29 billion. And total revenues for \nreligious congregations were $48 billion. That's $465 billion worth of \nnonprofit activity we enjoyed in 1990 alone, Mr. President.\n  Nonprofit organizations rely heavily on volunteers, and Americans \ngladly comply. According to a 1993 report from the Independent Sector, \na national coalition of 800 organizations, Americans donated 9.7 \nbillion hours of their time to nonprofit organizations that year. This \nvolunteer time produced the equivalent of 5.7 million full time \nvolunteers, worth an estimated $112 billion.\n  Unfortunately voluntarism is declining nationwide. According to the \nIndependent Sector report, the percentage of Americans volunteering \ndropped from 54 percent in 1989 to 51 percent in 1991 and 48 percent in \n1993. Americans also are giving less money. The average household's \ncharitable donation dropped from $978 in 1989 to $880 in 1993.\n  The decline of giving and volunteering spells danger for our \nvoluntary organizations, for the people who depend on them, and for the \nsocial trust that is based on the spirit of association.\n  But why is voluntarism on the decline? Obviously there are a number \nof relevant factors, not least among them the need so many people today \nfeel to work ever-harder and ever-longer to bear our growing tax \nburden. But one major reason for the decline is America's litigation \nexplosion. Nonprofit organizations are forced to spend an \nincreasing amount of time and resources preparing for, avoiding, and/or \nfighting lawsuits. Thus litigation has rendered our nonprofit \norganizations less effective at helping people, and allowed Americans \nto retreat more into their private lives, and away from the public, \nsocial activity that binds us together as a people.\n\n  The litigation costs facing voluntary associations are many. John \nGraham, on behalf of the American Society of Association Executives \n[ASAE], gave testimony last year arguing that liability insurance \npremiums for associations have increased an average 155 percent in \nrecent years. Some of our most revered nonprofit institutions have been \nput at risk by increased liability costs.\n  Dr. Creightin Hale of Little League Baseball reports that the \nliability rate for a league increased from $75 to $795 in just 5 years. \nMany leagues cannot afford this added expense, on top of increasing \ncosts for helmets and other equipment. These leagues operate without \ninsurance or disband altogether, often leaving children with no \norganized sports in their neighborhood.\n  What kind of suits add to insurance costs? ASAE reports that one New \nJersey umpire was forced by a court to pay a catcher $24,000. Why? \nBecause the catcher was hit in the eye by a softball while playing \nwithout a mask. The catcher complained that the umpire should have lent \nhim his.\n  Organizations that try to escape sky-rocketing insurance costs must \nself-insure, and Andrea Marisi of the Red\n\n[[Page S2930]]\n\nCross will describe self-insurance costs only as ``huge.'' The result? \nObviously, we have fewer funds available for providing services than \nwould otherwise be the case.''\n  Outside insurance generally comes with significant deductibles. \nCharles Kolb of the United Way points out that insurance deductibles \nfor his organization fall into the range of $25,000-30,000. When, as \nhas been the case in recent years, the organization is subjected to \nthree or four lawsuits per year, $100,000 or more must be diverted from \ncharitable programs.\n  And there are even more costs. Mr. Kolb reports that the costs in \nlost time and money spent on discovery, for example going through files \nfor hours on end to establish who did what when, can run into the \nthousands of dollars. Further, as the Boy Scouts' William Cople puts \nit: ``We bear increased costs from risk management programs of many \nkinds--[including] those to prevent accidents. We have higher legal \nbills as well. But even more of a problem is the need to find pro-bono \nhelp to quell possible lawsuits. The Scouts must spend scarce time, and \nuse up scarce human capital in preventing suits. For example, 5 years \nago the General Counsel's office, a pro-bono operation, committed less \nthan 100 hours per year on issues relating to lawsuits. Last year we \ndevoted about 750 hours to that duty.'' The Boy Scouts must do less \ngood so that they can defend themselves from lawsuits.\n  Frivolous lawsuits also increase costs by discouraging voluntarism. \nDottie Lewis of the Southwest Officials Association, which provides \nofficials for scholastic games, observes, ``Some of our people got to \nthe point where they were just afraid to work because of the threat of \nlawsuits.'' What makes this fear worse is the knowledge that one need \ndo no harm in order to be liable.\n  Take for example Powell versus Boy Scouts of America. While on an \nouting with the Sea Explorers, a scouting unit in the Boy Scouts' \nCascade Pacific Council, a youth suffered a tragic, paralyzing injury \nin a rough game of touch football. Several adults had volunteered to \nsupervise the outing, but none observed the game. The youth filed a \npersonal injury lawsuit against two of the adult volunteers. The jury \nfound the volunteers liable for some $7 million, which Oregon law \nreduced to about $4 million--far more than the volunteers could \npossibly pay.\n  What is more, as Cople points out, ``the jury seemingly held the \nvolunteers to a standard of care requiring them constantly to supervise \nthe youth entrusted to their charge, even for activities which under \nother circumstances may routinely be permitted without such meticulous \noversight.''\n\n  One child's tragedy led a jury to impose an unreasonable standard of \ncare on individuals who, after all, had volunteered their time and \neffort for an outing, not a football game.\n  No one can provide the meticulous oversight demanded by the jury. \nThus volunteers are left at the mercy of events, and juries, beyond \ntheir control.\n  Such unreasonable standards of care also penalize our nonprofit \norganizations. Len Krugel of the Michigan Salvation Army reports that \nregulations and onerous legal standards often keep his organization \nfrom giving troubled youths a second chance. Because the organization \nis held responsible for essentially all actions by its employees and \nvolunteers, it can take no risks in hiring. Thus the Salvation Army can \nneither hire nor accept voluntary services from any individual with any \ndrug conviction, including a 0.3 reading on a breathalyzer test for \nalcohol consumption. As Mr. Krugel observes, ``If we can't give these \nkids a second chance, who can?''\n  Then there is the problem of joint and several liability, in which \none defendant is made to pay for all damages even though responsible \nfor only a small portion. Such findings are a severe burden on the \nUnited Way, a national organization that sponsors numerous local \nnonprofit groups. Although it cannot control local operations, the \nUnited Way often finds itself a defendant in suits arising from \ninjuries caused by the local entity.\n  Such holdings result from juries' desire to find someone with the \nfunds necessary to pay for an innocent party's injuries. But this \nsearch for the deep pocket leads to what Ms. Marisi calls a ``chilling \neffect'' on Red Cross relations with other nonprofits. The Red Cross is \nnow less willing to cooperate with smaller, more innovative local \nagencies that might make it more effective.\n  Thus nonprofits forbear from doing good because they cannot afford \nthe insurance, they cannot afford the loss of volunteers, they cannot \nafford the risk of frivolous lawsuits.\n  The Volunteer Protection Act will address the danger to our nonprofit \nsector, Mr. President. It will not solve all the problems facing our \nvolunteers and nonprofits, but it will provide voluntary organizations \nwith critical protection against improper litigation, at the same time \nthat it recognizes the ability of the States to take additional or even \nalternative protections in some cases. By setting the standard for the \nprotection of volunteers outright, this bill provides much-needed \nlawsuit relief immediately to volunteers and nonprofits wherever they \nmay be. Let me briefly describe what this bill does.\n  The bill protects volunteers from liability unless they cause harm \nthrough action that constitutes reckless misconduct, gross negligence, \nwillful or criminal misconduct, or is in conscious, flagrant disregard \nfor the rights and safety of the individual harmed. This ensures that \nwhere volunteers truly exceed the bounds of appropriate conduct they \nwill be liable. But in the many ridiculous cases I have discussed--\nwhere no real wrongdoing occurred--the volunteer will not be forced to \nface and defend a lawsuit.\n  In lawsuits based on the actions of a volunteer, the bill limits the \npunitive damages that can be awarded. It is unfortunate that charities \nand volunteers have punitive damages awarded against them in the first \nplace, but they do--Congressman John Porter reports that in August of \n1990 a Chicago jury awarded $12 million to a boy who was injured in a \ncar crash. The ``negligent'' party? The estate of the volunteer who \ngave his life attempting to save the boy.\n  Under this bill, punitive damages in cases involving the actions of a \nvolunteer could be awarded against a volunteer, nonprofit organization, \nor government entity only upon a showing by the claimant that the \nvolunteer's action represented willful or criminal misconduct, or \nshowed a conscious, flagrant disregard for the rights and safety of the \nindividual harmed.\n\n  This should ensure that punitive damages, which are intended only to \npunish a defendant and are not intended to compensate an injured \nperson, will only be available in situations where punishment really is \ncalled for because of the egregious conduct of the defendant.\n  The bill also protects volunteers from excessive liability that they \nmight face through joint and several liability. Under the doctrine of \njoint and several liability, a plaintiff can obtain full damages from a \ndefendant who is only slightly at fault. I have spoken many times \nbefore about the unfairness that may result from the application of \nthis legal doctrine. The injustice that results to volunteers and \nnonprofits is often even more acute, because they lack the resources to \nbear unfair judgments.\n  This bill strikes a balance by providing that, in cases based on the \nactions of a volunteer, any defendant that is a volunteer, nonprofit \norganization, or government entity will be jointly and severally \nresponsible for the full share of economic damages but will only be \nresponsible for noneconomic damages in proportion to the harm that that \ndefendant caused. That is a fair approach.\n  Finally, I would like to speak for a moment about how this \nlegislation preserves important principles of federalism and respects \nthe role of the States. First, the bill does not preempt State \nlegislation that provides greater protections to volunteers. In this \nway, it sets up outer protections from which all volunteers will \nbenefit and permits States to do more. Second, the bill includes an \nopt-out provision that permits States, in cases involving only parties \nfrom that State, to affirmatively elect to opt out of the protections \nprovided in the Volunteer Protection Act. A State can do so by enacting \na statute specifically providing for that. I suspect that no States \nwill elect to do so, but I feel that, as a matter of principle, it is \nimportant to include that provision.\n\n[[Page S2931]]\n\n  In short, these reforms can help create a system in which plaintiffs \nsue only when they have good reason--and only those who are responsible \nfor their damages--and in which only those who are responsible must \npay. Such reforms will create an atmosphere in which our fear of one \nanother will be lessened, and our ability to join associations in which \nwe learn to care for one another will be significantly greater.\n  And that, Mr. President, will make for a better America.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n\n

Res. 19\n\n       Whereas Fascist and Communist dictatorships have caused \n     immeasurable human suffering and loss, degrading not only \n     every conceivable human right, but the human spirit itself;\n       Whereas the villainy of communism was dedicated, in \n     particular, to the organized and systematic destruction of \n     private property ownership;\n       Whereas the wrongful and illegal confiscation of property \n     perpetrated by Fascist and Communist regimes was often \n     specifically designed to victimize people because of their \n     religion, national or social origin, or expressed opposition \n     to the regimes which repressed them;\n       Whereas Fascists and Communists often obtained possession \n     of properties confiscated from the victims of the systems \n     they actively supported;\n       Whereas Jewish individuals and communities were often twice \n     victimized, first by the Nazis and their collaborators and \n     then by the subsequent Communist regimes;\n       Whereas churches, synagogues, mosques, and other religious \n     properties were also destroyed or confiscated as a means of \n     breaking the spiritual devotion and allegiance of religious \n     adherents;\n       Whereas Fascists, Nazis, and Communists have used foreign \n     financial institutions to launder and hold wrongfully and \n     illegally confiscated property and convert it to their own \n     personal use;\n       Whereas some foreign financial institutions violated their \n     fiduciary duty to their customers by converting to their own \n     use financial assets belonging to Holocaust victims while \n     denying heirs access to these assets;\n       Whereas refugees from communism, in addition to being \n     wrongly stripped of their private property, were often forced \n     to relinquish their citizenship in order to protect \n     themselves and their families from reprisals by the \n     Communists who ruled their countries;\n       Whereas the participating states of the Organization for \n     Security and Cooperation in Europe have agreed to give full \n     recognition and protection to all types of property, \n     including private property, as well as the right to prompt, \n     just, and effective compensation in the event private \n     property is taken for public use;\n       Whereas the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, as \n     well as the Caucasus and Central Asia, have entered a post-\n     Communist period of transition and democratic development, \n     and many countries have begun the difficult and wrenching \n     process of trying to right the past wrongs of previous \n     totalitarian regimes;\n       Whereas restrictions which require those whose properties \n     have been wrongly plundered by Nazi or Communist regimes to \n     reside in or have the citizenship of the country from which \n     they now seek restitution or compensation are arbitrary and \n     discriminatory in violation of international law; and\n       Whereas the rule of law and democratic norms require that \n     the activity of governments and their administrative agencies \n     be exercised in accordance with the laws passed by their \n     parliaments or legislatures and such laws themselves must be \n     consistent with international human rights standards: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate \n     concurring). That the Congress--\n       (1) welcomes the efforts of many post-Communist countries \n     to address the complex and difficult question of the status \n     of plundered properties;\n       (2) urges countries which have not already done so to \n     return plundered properties to their rightful owners or, as \n     an alternative, pay compensation, in accordance with \n     principles of justice and in a manner that is just, \n     transparent, and fair;\n       (3) calls for the urgent return of property formerly \n     belonging to Jewish communities as a means of redressing the \n     particularly compelling problems of aging and destitute \n     survivors of the Holocaust;\n       (4) calls on the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, \n     Romania, Slovakia and any other country with restrictions \n     which require those whose properties have been wrongly \n     plundered by Nazi or Communist regimes to reside in or have \n     the citizenship of the country from which they now seek \n     restitution or compensation to remove such restrictions from \n     their restitution or compensation laws;\n       (5) calls upon foreign financial institutions, and the \n     states having legal authority over their operation, that \n     possess wrongfully and illegally property confiscated from \n     Holocaust victims, from residents of former Warsaw Pact \n     states who were forbidden by Communist law from obtaining \n     restitution of such property, and from states that were \n     occupied by Nazi, Fascist, or Communist forces, to assist and \n     to cooperate fully with efforts to restore this property to \n     its rightful owners; and\n       (6) urges post-Communist countries to pass and effectively \n     implement laws that provide for restitution of, or \n     compensation for, plundered property.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, at the close of last Congress, I \nsubmitted a concurrent resolution addressing property claims issues in \nCentral and Eastern Europe. Representative Christopher H. Smith, the \ncochairman of the Commission, submitted an identical resolution in the \nHouse. Today, we are resubmitting this measure, and are joined by all \nthe members of the Helsinki Commission as original cosponsors.\n  Mr. President, I wish I could report to you that there has been \nimprovement in this area since our concurrent resolution was submitted \nlast September. Regrettably, there has not. Let me give you just two \nexamples of the kinds of cases that moved me to submit this concurrent \nresolution.\n  In 1991, Latvia passed a restitution law after regaining its \nindependence from the Soviet empire. This law raised the hope that \nthose forced from their homes by the 1940 Soviet invasion, and kept out \nby a 50-year occupation, would finally be able to return. And this is \nwhat Eso Anton Benjamins thought, too, when in 1995 a Latvian municipal \ncourt ordered that the current occupants of the Benjamins' family home \nvacate the property.\n  Unfortunately, the current occupant is none other than the Russian \nAmbassador to Latvia. The Russian Government has refused to move its \nrepresentative from the private property of Mr. Benjamins, \nnotwithstanding the Latvian court's legal order to do so, and the \nLatvian authorities have not evicted them.\n  In the Czech Republic, things are not much better. Under laws adopted \nafter the Velvet Revolution, Susan Benda is theoretically eligible for \nthe restitution of her family property, which had been confiscated by \nthe Nazis but which her family had been unable to reclaim at the end of \nWorld War II. Notwithstanding this eligibility under the law and the \nCzech Government's purported intention to restore Jewish properties \nthat had been seized by the Nazis, the Czech Ministry of Finance has \narbitrarily imposed onerous and burdensome conditions for restitution \nwhich appear to be designed to defeat the intent of the law.\n  So while Czech officials may tell us they have properly addressed \nthis issue, those seeking the return of wrongfully confiscated property \nin Prague find that an entirely different reality awaits them.\n  I am also deeply troubled by recent reports that some $50 million may \nhave been embezzled from the funds received by Ukraine from Germany for \nthe victims of Nazi prosecution. It is imperative that the Ukrainian \nGovernment make an investigation into this matter an urgent priority. \nNot only must this\n\n[[Page S2933]]\n\nmoney be found and returned to the rightful recipients, but immediate \nmeasures should be taken to ensure that this cannot happen again.\n  Americans who came to this country to escape persecution are \ndiscovering that, in many Central and East European countries, they are \nonce again being penalized, this time by discriminatory laws that \nrestrict restitution or compensation to those who currently hold the \ncitizenship of or residency in the country in question. This is the \ncase in the Czech Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, and Slovakia.\n  Mr. President, this status quo cannot continue. I know it is not \npossible to turn back the clock completely or erase the wrongs that \nhave been done. I commend the many emerging democracies attempting to \naddress this complex issue, acting on both a moral obligation to \nredress past wrongs and a desire to underscore the differences between \ntheir new and old systems of government. But more can and should be \ndone--and this resolution calls for concrete steps. It deserves our \nsupport, and the victims of past wrongs in this region deserve our \nhelp.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me and the other cosponsors of this \nconcurrent resolution in pressing for a fair, just, and timely property \nrestitution and compensation process so that the victims of the \nHolocaust and subsequent Communist oppression are not denied what is \nrightfully theirs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2932-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SENATE RESOLUTION 69--RELATIVE TO CAMBODIA\n\n  Mr. McCain (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Helms, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Robb, \nMr. Roth, and Mr. Thomas) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 69\n\n       Whereas Cambodia continues to recover from more than three \n     decades of recent warfare, including the genocide committed \n     by the Khmer Rouge from 1975 to 1979;\n       Whereas Cambodia was the beneficiary of a massive \n     international effort to ensure peace, democracy, and \n     prosperity after the October 1991 Paris Agreements on a \n     Comprehensive Political Settlement of the Cambodia Conflict;\n       Whereas more than 93 percent of the Cambodians eligible to \n     vote in the 1993 elections in Cambodia did so, thereby \n     demonstrating the commitment of the Cambodian people to \n     democracy;\n       Whereas since those elections, Cambodia has made \n     significant economic progress which has contributed to \n     economic stability in Cambodia;\n       Whereas since those elections, the Cambodia Armed Forces \n     have significantly diminished the threat posed by the Khmer \n     Rouge to safety and stability in Cambodia;\n       Whereas other circumstances in Cambodia, including the \n     recent unsolved murders of journalists and political party \n     activists, the recent unsolved attack on party officials of \n     the Buddhist Liberal Democratic Party in 1995, and the \n     quality of the judicial system--described in a 1996 United \n     Nations report as ``thoroughly corrupt''--raise international \n     concern for the state of democracy in Cambodia;\n       Whereas Sam Rainsy, the leader of the Khmer Nation Party, \n     was the target of a terrorist grenade attack on March 30, \n     1997, during a demonstration outside the Cambodia National \n     Assembly;\n       Whereas the attack killed 19 Cambodians and wounded more \n     than 100 men, women, and children; and\n       Whereas among those injured was Ron Abney, a United States \n     citizen and employee of the International Republican \n     Institute who was assisting in the advancement of democracy \n     in Cambodia and observing the demonstration: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) extends its sincerest sympathies to the families of the \n     persons killed, and the persons wounded, in the March 30, \n     1997, terrorist grenade attack outside the Cambodia National \n     Assembly;\n       (2) condemns the attack as an act of terrorism detrimental \n     to peace and the development of democracy in Cambodia;\n       (3) calls upon the United States Government to offer to the \n     Cambodia Government all appropriate assistance in identifying \n     and prosecuting those responsible for the attack; and\n       (4) calls upon the Cambodia Government to accept such \n     assistance and to expeditiously identify and prosecute those \n     responsible for the attack.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on March 30, 1997, there was a political \nrally outside the Cambodian National Assembly in the capital city of \nPhnom Penh. One of the participants in this rally was Sam Raimsy, a \nprominent opposition figure and leader of the Khmer Nation Party.\n  In the course of the demonstration, someone lobbed grenades into the \ncrowd. Nineteen people were killed, including one of Sam Raimsy's \nbodyguards. More than a 100 others were injured, one of which was an \nAmerican citizen, Mr. Ron Abney. Ron works for the International \nRepublican Institute, of which I am proud to be chairman. For years, \nRon has worked with all political parties to promote free and \ndemocratic institutions in Cambodia. We all hope for his prompt and \ncomplete recovery from his injuries.\n  Mr. President, this was a particularly cowardly and brutal act of \npolitical terrorism. Among the killed and injured were many women and \nchildren. In addition, the real target of this attack was Cambodia's \nefforts to build a peaceful and democratic future on the ruins of the \ndevastation wrought by decades of war and tyranny.\n  Immediately after the attack, I wrote to Cambodia's two Co-Prime \nMinisters, Norodom Ranariddh and Hun Sen, expressing my outrage and \ndemanding that the perpetrators of this attack be brought to justice. I \nhave received a response from Prince Ranariddh, in which he calls the \nMarch 30 atrocity a ``most heinous and savage criminal act committed on \ninnocent and peace-loving people.'' He also said that he had ordered \n``immediate measures to be taken to arrest, try and sentence the \ncriminal(s) and all those involved.''\n  I believe, however, that it is also important for the Senate to make \nclear its outrage at this attack. The resolution that I have just \nintroduced extends the Senate's sympathy to the victims of the grenade \nattack, condemns the bombing itself as an act of terrorism, and calls \nupon the governments of Cambodia and the United States to cooperate in \nidentifying and prosecuting those individuals responsible for the \nattack.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2933-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2933-S2945]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  THE NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT OF 1997\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       MURKOWSKI AMENDMENT NO. 26\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI proposed an amendment to the bill (S. 104) to amend the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982; as follows:\n\n       Beginning on page 1, strike all after the enacting clause \n     and insert the following:\n       That the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 is amended to \n     read as follows:\n\n     ``SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor \nCongregation Kol Haverim of Glastonbury, CT, in recognition of the \ngroundbreaking for its new synagogue building held on April 13, 1997. \nThrough sheer determination, a singleness of purpose and spirit, as \nwell as the considerable generosity of its members and the community at \nlarge, this congregation of 200 families is now realizing a dream that \nno one would have thought possible only a few short years ago.\n  Congregation Kol Haverim was formed only 13 years ago by a handful of \nJewish families in the Glastonbury area, worshiping initially in the \nback-room of a local grocery store, and later purchasing a former \nKnights of Columbus hall that serves as its present one room home. Over \nthe past 2 years, the congregation has raised over $1.3 million and its \narchitects have designed a new building, to be added as an addition to \nthe existing facility, that has been praised by local town planning and \nzoning officials as a model of design for new construction in the area.\n  In addition to attending to the spiritual needs of its members \nthrough worship services and its ever-growing religious school, \nCongregation Kol Haverim has always tried to attend to the needs of the \nlocal community and Greater Hartford, as well, through its various \nadult education, community outreach, and other programs. Whether \nthrough sponsoring a lecture or the volunteers it regularly provides to \nlocal soup kitchens or its participation in area-wide food or clothing \ndrives, Congregation Kol Haverim, like other houses of worship in the \narea, has always strived to give of itself to the surrounding \ncommunities from which it draws its strength. The new building will \nprovide a pleasant and welcoming new home for sacred study, communal \nworship, and social action.\n  I congratulate Congregation Kol Haverim, as it begins this new \nchapter in its existence. I thank its members for their initiative and \nall the good work they have done over the past 13 years, and I \nencourage them to continue to address all the good work that remains to \nbe done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2946-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2946-S2947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        IN HONOR OF THE FALLEN AIRMEN OF THE 440TH AIRLIFT WING\n\n Mr. KOHL. Today, Mr. President, I would like to take a moment \nto remember the men and women of the 440th Airlift Wing, based at \nMitchell Field in Milwaukee, who died and were injured in the course of \ntheir duty on April 1, 1997. At a treacherous airport in Honduras, far \nfrom home, three airmen made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. \nOn a routine resupply mission, their C-130 skidded off the end of the \nrunway while attempting to land at Tocontin International Airport in \nTegucigalpa. The plane burst into flames killing Senior M. Sgt. Leland \nRassmussen, S. Sgt. Vicki Clifton, and Senior Airman Samuel Keene. Also \ninjured in the crash were T. Sgt. Joseph Martynski, Capt. Ian Kincaid, \nM. Sgt. Steven Hilger, T. Sgt. Danny Formanski, Capt. Michael Butler, \nS. Sgt. Dean Ackmann, and Capt. Robert Woodard.\n  The 440th flies out of my hometown, Milwaukee, WI and I am proud of \ntheir commitment to excellence. Over the years they have been called on \nmany times to serve their country in foreign lands and dangerous \ncircumstances. They are an example of the best the Reserve system has \nto offer, and I was deeply saddened to hear of their loss.\n  Too often we take for granted the risks members of the military run \non a day-to-day basis. We assume that because the United States is at \npeace soldiers do not face danger. While in fact, everyday men and \nwomen in our armed services put their lives on the line. They do it \nquietly and without fanfare. It seems that only when tragedy strikes do \nwe take a moment to appreciate their courage and sacrifice.\n  I would also like to take a moment to thank those brave Honduran \ncitizens who risked their lives to help victims\n\n[[Page S2947]]\n\nof the crash. With the wreckage burning only 100 yards from two gas \nstations, these good Samaritans waded into the fiery crash site to \nrescue complete strangers. Because of their selfless courage, lives \nwere saved and crippling injuries avoided.\n  Those injured in the accident have my best wishes for a speedy and \ncomplete recovery. My heart goes out to the families of Leland, Vicki, \nand Samuel. Over the years these three airmen have foregone time with \ntheir families in order to serve their country, and now the Nation owes \nthem a debt it can never fully repay. All we can offer is our deepest \nsympathy and highest esteem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2946-4", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHRISTOPHER REEVE ON MEDICAL RESEARCH\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, on March 13, 1997, along with \nSenator Arlen Specter, I introduced bipartisan legislation, S. 441, the \nNational Fund for Health Research Act. This important bill would \nprovide additional resources for health research over and above those \nprovided to the National Institutes of Health in the annual \nappropriations process. The fund will help eradicate some of the \nillnesses that now strike millions of Americans.\n  At this time I would like to submit for the Record a letter from \nChristopher Reeve endorsing the National Fund for Health Research Act. \nChristopher Reeve has worked tirelessly since his accident to increase \nfunding for medical research. We all owe Christopher Reeve a debt of \ngratitude for bringing health care concerns to the attention of all \nAmericans. He and I both realize that the Fund for Health Research Act \ncould hold the key to finding successful treatments for hundreds of \ndiseases. In his letter, Christopher Reeve states that S. 441 will give \nour best researchers the funds they need to stay ahead of a developing \ncrisis. I agree wholeheartedly with his assessment and urge the Senate \nto move quickly on this legislation. I now ask that the text of \nChristopher Reeve's letter be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                            Christopher Reeve,\n\n                                                   March 20, 1997.\n     President Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Clinton. I was sorry to hear about your \n     unfortunate accident but glad to know you will make a full \n     recovery and that your activities won't be limited in the \n     future. The sight of you in a wheelchair was very moving but \n     also a helpful image for all Americans particularly the \n     disabled.\n       At the risk of becoming a pest, I'm taking this opportunity \n     to ask your support for legislation introduced last week by \n     Senators Specter and Harkin which would require insurance \n     companies to donate 1 penny out of every dollar they receive \n     in premiums to the NIH. It is estimated that this would \n     provide an additional $6 billion dollars annually for \n     research.\n       I feel it is an excellent proposal because it does not \n     raise taxes, the insurance companies can afford it and they \n     ultimately receive the additional benefit of having to pay \n     for fewer claims. And as I am sure you're aware, recent \n     studies have shown the cost effectiveness of research, is of \n     course a crucial factor in the balanced budget debate. As \n     America ages, the attendant health problems will not go away \n     unless we give our best researchers the funds they need to \n     stay ahead of a developing crisis.\n       Thank you again for all the helpful comments you have made \n     so far about research since the convention last year. Now is \n     the time for all of us to push into high gear.\n       With best wishes for a speedy recovery.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Christopher Reeve,\n\n                                   (Signed by Michael Manganiello,\n     Special Assistant to Christoper Reeve).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2947-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMEMORATING THE CITY OF NASSAU BAY'S ASTRONAUT DAY FESTIVAL\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to commend the city of \nNassau Bay for its efforts to celebrate the development of space \nexploration and the international cooperation associated with it. \nNassau Bay is hosting a special day of recognition for America's \nastronauts and their Russian counterparts on April 12, 1997. In \naddition, the State of Texas has proudly honored these brave men and \nwomen by declaring April 12th ``Space Explorers' Day'' in Texas. I rise \ntoday to appropriately recognize this day in the U.S. Senate.\n  Nassau Bay is located near NASA's Lyndon B. Johnson Center. The \ncommunity has been integrally involved in this Nation's space \nexploration activities since we began the space program a generation \nago. Nassau Bay residents were among those to walk on the Moon and \nprovide the technical and managerial support necessary for America's \nsuccessful space program. Today, Nassau Bay is still critical to NASA's \nmanned space mission. Nassau Bay rightfully celebrates the continuation \nof that mission by hosting ``Astronaut Day'' on April 12.\n  Astronaut Day celebrates the men and women who have expanded \nhumankind's horizons and recognizes the technological advances \nresulting from their work that have been incorporated into our everyday \nlives. I join Nassau Bay and the State of Texas in honoring the many \ndedicated men and women who devote their time and talents to helping \nthis Nation realize the cherished dream of space exploration. They have \ntruly broadened the frontiers of knowledge and their outstanding \naccomplishments are worthy of special recognition.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate this opportunity to give Nassau Bay the \nrecognition it deserves in the U.S. Senate. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me, the city of Nassau Bay, and the State of Texas in reflecting \non the important contributions our space pioneers and explorers have \nmade to history, science, and the quality of our lives on this \nplanet.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2947-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2947-S2948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            GIRL SCOUTS AND BOY SCOUTS OF RHODE ISLAND, 1996\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I \npresent to you Rhode Island's outstanding recipients of the highest \nhonors for Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts. They have distinguished \nthemselves as community leaders, service volunteers, and mentors for \ntheir peers.\n  For more than 50 years, artist Norman Rockwell captured in his \npaintings the spirit and sense of America and its people. A large \nnumber of these paintings portrayed Scouts and Scouting. Few other \nchildhood activities better represent the commitment to God, country, \nand community that is inherent in Scouting.\n  Providing girls and boys with tools and leadership skills that will \nbe useful throughout their lives, Scouting is indelibly linked with \ntransforming youths into able, educated, well-rounded adults. \nActivities like camping, service projects, and weekly meetings aim to \nbuild character, encourage responsible citizenship, and develop \nphysical, mental, and emotional fitness.\n  The highest honors that a Girl Scout can earn are the Gold and Silver \nAwards, which are presented to those girls who have shown exemplary \ncommitments to personal excellence and unwavering public service. \nLikewise, the Eagle Award is the highest honor that can be earned by a \nBoy Scout. Recipients have displayed the highest achievable skills in \noutdoor activities and incomparable service records.\n  Behind every Girl Scout and Boy Scout troop is a group of similarly \ndedicated parents and leaders who guide the youths through their \nachievements.\n  It is for all these reasons that I am proud to honor the recipients \nof Girl Scouts' Gold and Silver Awards and the Boy Scouts' Eagle Scout \nAward. The outstanding achievements of these young recipients warrant \nour praise, admiration, and thanks. So that we all may know who they \nare, I ask that the complete list of awardees be printed in the Record.\n  The list follows:\n\n                 Girl Scout 1996 Gold Award Recipients\n\n\n                             Cumberland, RI\n\n       Nicole Tetreault.\n\n\n                              Johnston, RI\n\n       Shannon Quigley, Sandra Shackford.\n\n\n                            Narragansett, RI\n\n       Kate Hohman, Renee Johnson, Jill Raggio.\n\n\n                          North Providence, RI\n\n       Marissa Borrelli.\n\n\n                            Saunderstown, RI\n\n       Angela Briggs.\n\n\n                             Smithfield, RI\n\n       Heather Harkness, Christina Riccio.\n\n\n                             Wakefield, RI\n\n       Meghan Higgins.\n\n\n                             Woonsocket, RI\n\n       Melissa Brin.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                Girl Scout 1996 Silver Award Recipients\n\n\n                              Bristol, RI\n\n       Sara Belisle, Kathleen Cahill, Sandra Koch, Afiya Samuel.\n\n[[Page S2948]]\n\n                              Cranston, RI\n\n       Robin Grady, Bethany Lavigne, Kathryn Mullican, Jessica \n     Sanchez.\n\n\n                             Cumberland, RI\n\n       Suzanne Gustafson, Elizabeth Rivard.\n\n\n                           East Greenwich, RI\n\n       Elissa Carter.\n\n\n                               Exeter, RI\n\n       Laura Moriarty.\n\n\n                               Kenyon, RI\n\n       Tracy Williams.\n\n\n                              Lincoln, RI\n\n       Johanna Simpson.\n\n\n                           Little Compton, RI\n\n       Ruth Gordon.\n\n\n                             Middletown, RI\n\n       Meredity Benvenuto, Meghan Franklin, Elizabeth Mack, \n     Heather Markman, Casey Serls.\n\n\n                            Narragansett, RI\n\n       Lucia Marotta.\n\n\n                              Newport, RI\n\n       Mary Ann Compton, Amanda Grosvenor, Jennifer Sawyer.\n\n\n                          North Kingstown, RI\n\n       Kelly Blinkhorn.\n\n\n                          North Providence, RI\n\n       Nicole Aiello, Beth Bader, Bonnie Bryden, Sarah Cardin, \n     Jenifer DeGrace, Laura Ann DiTommaso, Jean Ann Douglas, \n     Valeria Ferrara, Sabra Integlia, Alison Kole, Carissa Leal, \n     Candida Linares, Karen Linares, Summer Lockett, Pamela Ricci, \n     Dawn Shurtleff, Stephanie Swartz.\n\n\n                          North Smithfield, RI\n\n       Maureen McPherson, Laura Peach, Sarah Peach, Lisa Rowey, \n     Heather Senecal.\n\n\n                             Pawtucket, RI\n\n       Briana Fishbein, Nicole Gendron, Alyssa Nunes.\n\n\n                             Portsmouth, RI\n\n       Jennifer Lake, Carrie Miller, Elizabeth Nunes.\n\n\n                             Providence, RI\n\n       Arielle Ascrizzi, Mika Clark, Angela Fayerweather, Rita \n     McCartney, Stacy Montvilo.\n\n\n                            Saunderstown, RI\n\n       Karena Burnham.\n\n\n                               Warren, RI\n\n       April Lau, Nicole Peck, Jody Valente.\n\n\n                              Warwick, RI\n\n       Carolyn Beagan, Sara Berman, Amanda Cadden, Becky \n     Csizmesia, Justine Evans, Kristen Giza, Bethany Linden, \n     Amanda Marcoccio, Kerri McLaughlin, Lauren Ramieri, Catherine \n     Rousseau, Leah Wallick.\n\n\n                           West Greenwich, RI\n\n       Rachel Fontaine.\n\n\n                           West Kingston, RI\n\n       Audra Criscione.\n\n\n                            West Warwick, RI\n\n       Tracyjo Jorgensen, Jennifer Malaby, Kerrin Massey.\n\n\n                              Westerly, RI\n\n       Jamie Hanson, Karen McGrath, Heather Norman.\n\n\n                              Wyoming, RI\n\n       Kelly Marie Henry.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 Boy Scout 1996 Eagle Award Recipients\n\n\n                             Barrington, RI\n\n       John Eugene McCann IV, Curtis G.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \nsixth anniversary of the re-independence of the Republic of Georgia.\n  Georgia has a rich cultural heritage spanning over 2,000 years, and \nrecent history provides a remarkable story in the struggle against \ncommunism. First annexed by Russia in 1801, Georgia experienced a brief \nglimpse of independence in 1918 when Georgia relinquished its ancient \nmonarchy for a democratically elected government. In 1921, however, the \niron curtain descended on this small, yet proud country, and over the \nnext 70 years suffered terribly under the heavy hand of Soviet \ncommunism and its centrally planned economy. Through it all, the \nGeorgian people never gave up their hope or desire for freedom and \nindependence.\n  On April 9, 1989, violence erupted in the Georgian capitol of \nTbilisi, as Soviet troops swarmed the city and fell on 10,000 peaceful \ncitizens demonstrating for independence. During the ensuing violence, \nmore than 200 people were injured and 19 killed. Some, including women \nand children, were tragically beaten to death with shovels. This event \nmarked the beginning of the end of Soviet domination. Exactly 2 years \nlater, on April 9, 1991, Georgia officially declared its independence, \na day which is remembered as the anniversary on which Georgia's long \nfight for freedom was again realized.\n  Since then, under the leadership of President Eduard Shevardnadze, \nGeorgia has made remarkable strides toward a free market economy and \ndemocratic rule of law. A constitution founded on democratic principles \nand values has been adopted, and free and fair presidential and \nparliamentary elections were held. A new generation of young, energetic \ndemocratic leaders has emerged, led by 34-year-old Zurab Zhvania, \nChairman of the Parliament,\n\n[[Page S2949]]\n\nwho I recently met with. On the economic front, Georgia's new currency, \nthe lari, has remained stable since its introduction in 1995. The \nInternational Monetary Fund and the U.S. Department of State have \npraised Georgia's economic initiatives and their significant progress \nin developing a free-market economy. Several U.S. corporations have \nalready established a presence in Georgia, spurring jobs and economic \ngrowth in both nations.\n  Mr. President, I encourage everyone to note this historic day, and \ncongratulate Georgia on its extraordinary progress toward democracy and \nfree-market principles.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2948-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2949]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRAISING ACADEMIC STANDARDS AND LOWERING COLLEGE COSTS AT WEST MESA HIGH \n                        SCHOOL, ALBUQUERQUE, NM\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the achievements \nof the students and educators at West Mesa High School in Albuquerque, \nNM, and especially its growing Advanced Placement [AP] program.\n  On Tuesday, April 1, I had the opportunity to visit West Mesa and \nspeak with students and teachers participating in the school's AP \nprogram. Several State legislators and business leaders joined me in a \nshort but invaluable group discussion and class visit.\n  Perhaps most impressive was the visit to one of Mr. Tomas Fernandez' \nAP English classes, where students explained in their own words why AP \ncourses are so important. In this class, the students don't ask for \nless home work or ``dumbed-down'' classes; they are demanding more \nchallenging classes and higher academic expectations for all students. \nWhile AP classes are new to many, and set a very high standard, the \nstudents had found that they could succeed.\n  Principal Milton Baca and a growing number of West Mesa teachers are \nresponding to this demand by providing more and more challenging \nclasses in the school's growing AP program. For example, West Mesa \nrecently added an AP Calculus course in addition to its AP English \ncourse, and five teachers attended AP teacher training institutes last \nsummer. More teachers are planning to attend AP training courses this \nsummer so they can start an AP science course in the next school year. \nI applaud all of these efforts.\n  For college-bound students, taking AP courses and passing AP exams \ncan translate into valuable college credits for advanced high school \nwork. For those AP students who decide not to go to college, they and \ntheir prospective employers can be confident that they are better \nprepared academically and will have an advantage as they compete for \njobs and enter the work force.\n  Because AP programs are so beneficial to both work- and college-bound \nstudents, I have been working on efforts to expand these programs, as \npart of the solution to our State's clear need for immediate, \nmeasurable education reform. To show the importance of strong academic \nskills to employers, I am working with several businesses in New Mexico \nto develop employment incentives for students who take and pass AP \nexams, especially in the core academic areas of English, math, and \nscience. In addition, I am gratified that the State legislature \nincreased funding for the AP New Mexico program to $200,000 next year, \nas I requested in testimony before the relevant committees.\n  Despite this important progress, West Mesa High School and New Mexico \nhave a long way to go to more fully utilize the AP program as a way to \nchallenge high school students, raise academic achievement to higher \nlevels, and improve our long-term economic productivity. In New Mexico, \nroughly 5,000 students took AP classes in 1996--up 22 percent from 2 \nyears ago--with a 20-percent increase in AP tests taken, but this is \nstill below the national average.

Mr. President, I have read the report in the Wall \nStreet Journal that Federal Communications Commission Chairman Reed E. \nHundt proposes to implement only a portion of the new universal service \nfund rules by the statutory deadline of May 8. Specifically, he \nsuggests delaying the adoption of rules assuring reasonable rates for \ntelephone subscribers in rural and high-cost areas, although he would \nproceed to implement a new $3 billion yearly fund to wire schools, \nlibraries, and health care facilities through an unspecified tax on \ntelephone company revenues.\n  Last January I wrote to Chairman Hundt about his apparent desire to \nimplement these provisions prior to implementing the remainder of the \nuniversal service provisions of the statute. At that time, I stated \nthat sound implementation of the Telecommunications Act requires that \nthe Commission resolve all the related issues involved in universal \nservice carefully and contemporaneously.\n  Apparently Chairman Hundt has not changed his view, Mr. President, \nbut neither have I.\n  Implementing universal service funding in separate stages would be \nincompatible with the law. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 states \nclearly and unambiguously that the FCC ``shall initiate a single \nproceeding to implement the recommendations from the Joint Board . . . \nand shall complete such proceeding'' by May 8, 1997.\n  It would be consistent with this unequivocal statutory requirement \nfor the FCC to adopt specific new rules on May 8 and have them take \neffect in the future. It would also be consistent with the statute for \nthe FCC to adopt general outlines of new rules on May 8, and fill in \nspecific details by subsequent order. The FCC can, and in my judgment \nshould, avail itself of these courses of action if it finds, for \nwhatever reason, that it cannot adopt final rules on all aspects of \nuniversal service on May 8. But one thing the FCC cannot do by law is \npick and choose some statutory requirements to put into effect on May \n8, and delay the rest till later.\n  Let me be clear. I can understand the possible problem Chairman Hundt \nfaces: too much proposed subsidy, and not enough revenue to handle it \nwithout raising rates for telephone service. I emphatically am not \nsuggesting that he simply proceed to adopt final universal service fund \nrules and thereby raise telephone rates on May 8. But if, after \nstudying universal service as extensively as it has, the FCC has \nconcluded that it cannot implement the universal service provisions of \nthe statute without increasing telephone rates or incurring similar \nunacceptable outcomes, it must defer from implementing any universal \nservice rules until it can satisfactorily demonstrate to both the \nCongress and the public that any rate increases that would result are \ninevitable in fact and appropriate in amount.\n  Unless and until the FCC can do that, the Commission should take no \nfinal action on universal service. To try and evade the issue by \nimplementing the parts of universal service that may be politically \ndesirable while dodging the rest because it appears politically \nunpalatable would be a dereliction of the Commission's duty under \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2949-2", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2949-S2950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING LARA GREEN SPECTOR\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to honor Lara Green \nSpector, the Tobacco-Free Kids East Regional Youth Advocate of the \nYear. Lara is a ninth grader from Montclair High School in New Jersey \nwho truly exemplifies the old adage that one person can make a \ndifference.\n  Lara was the motivating force behind Montclair's recently passed \nordinance banning cigarette vending machines and self-service displays. \nWho knows how many Montclair teenagers and children may not take up \nsmoking because cigarettes are now more difficult to obtain. And local \npublic officials, school advisers and residents all agree that this \nordinance would never have\n\n[[Page S2950]]\n\nbecome a reality without Lara's initiative, leadership and tenacity.\n  Lara also organized a townwide program for the Great American \nSmokeout in November 1996. Her program included a poster contest in the \nlocal elementary schools and a quiz contest in the middle schools. She \nalso created and distributed a fact sheet to every Montclair student. \nFor years, tobacco companies have used youth oriented advertisements, \nlike Joe Camel, to send a false message to young people that smoking is \ncool and glamorous. Education campaigns like Lara's help blow away \ntheir smoke screens and demonstrate that cigarettes are addictive and \ndeadly.\n  Mr. President, for years, I have led the crusade in this Chamber \nagainst teenage and youth smoking. I am certainly happy to have an \nexceptional foot soldier like Lara join me in the fight.\n  By working to stop children and young people from smoking, Lara Green \nSpector is enhancing lives and saving lives. She is an outstanding \nstudent, activist, and citizen, and I have a feeling that we have not \nheard the last from her on Capitol Hill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2949-3", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMEMORATING THE 50th ANNIVERSARY OF JACKIE ROBINSON'S DEBUT \n                        IN PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, 50 years ago a true American \nhero walked onto Ebbets Field one afternoon and forever shattered the \ncolor barrier with one swing of his bat. His name was Jack Roosevelt \nRobinson.\n  On that day, 7 years before Brown versus the Board of Education \nallowed school children of all colors to sit in the same classroom, 16 \nyears before Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of his dreams at the foot of \nthe Lincoln Memorial, and 18 years before the Civil Rights Act became \nthe law of the land, Jackie Robinson did more for the equal rights \nmovement and the sport of baseball than had anyone before him.\n  Jackie Robinson on April 15, 1947, became the first professional \nblack athlete to play America's pastime, baseball. In his Brooklyn \nDodgers uniform, he not only broke the color barrier, but he also broke \nnumerous baseball records during his 10-year professional career.\n  By the end of his tenure as a player, Jackie Robinson would become \none of America's most celebrated and honored athletes. He became major \nleague baseball's first Rookie of the Year--an award now named after \nhim, the national league's Most Valuable Player, holder of the coveted \nbatting title, a six-time member of Dodgers' World Series teams, a \nmember of the 1955 world champion Dodgers, and a member of the Baseball \nHall of Fame.\n  As the senior U.S. Senator representing California, I am particularly \nproud of the fact that Jackie Robinson was from the Golden State, \nraised in Pasadena, and was a star athlete at the University of \nCalifornia at Los Angeles. At UCLA, Robinson became the first athlete \never to win varsity letters in four sports: baseball, basketball, \nfootball, and track.\n  Such an amazing and talented athlete, however, was not welcomed into \nthe arms of American baseball fans or of its players back in the spring \nof 1947.\n  Jackie Robinson fought prejudice and harassment with every base he \nran, every ball he hit, and every victory he helped win for his team. \nPlayers and coaches yelled racial slurs at him, and one team even \nthreatened to strike in protest of Robinson's presence in their city. \nBut Robinson, remembering how his mother refused to sell their family \nhome and move away amid protests from white neighbors, persevered.\n  He faced hatred and racism with courage and conviction, proving to \nteammates, opponents and fans alike that he had earned the right to \nplay professional baseball through his sheer athleticism. Along the \nway, Robinson became the role model for future baseball icons such as \nHank Aaron and Willie Mayes.\n  Shortly after his retirement from baseball in 1957, Jackie Robinson \nhelped to further the rights of all African-Americans by becoming a \nspokesman and fundraiser for the National Association for the \nAdvancement of Colored people [NAACP]. He traveled the country urging \nblack communities to work together for equal rights, educating and \nencouraging them to participate in the new civil rights movement. He \nbecame a role model all over again, this time to millions of men and \nwomen who saw inequality and wanted to change it.\n  Jackie Robinson represents everything good with baseball, and \neverything great with America. By commemorating his achievements and \nhis entrance onto the professional baseball fields, his legacy lives \non, inspiring yet another generation of fans to realize their dreams \nand break new ground along the way.\n  Jackie Robinson once said, ``A life is not important except in the \nimpact it has on other lives.'' By that standard, Jackie Robinson's \nlife was as important as America's greatest heroes throughout history, \nand we as a nation are all grateful and proud of his accomplishments.\n  Major league baseball has recognized Jackie Robinson's achievements \nby dedicating the 1997 season to his memory. As part of these \nfestivities, last week's opening day games were played in all major \nleague stadiums with a Jackie Robinson commemorative baseball. Just \nlast weekend, the Los Angeles Dodgers paid tribute to the Hall of Famer \nin a pregame ceremony attended by Rachel Robinson, Jackie's widow.\n  The Dodgers plan many other activities throughout the year such as a \nJackie Robinson poster distributed to all Los Angeles district schools, \na special section devoted to Robinson on the Dodgers' official web \nsite, a salute to Jackie Robinson scholarship winners, an historic \nRobinson display at Dodger Stadium and assistance with the Jackie \nRobinson Foundation Golf Classic. Additionally, President Clinton will \nhonor his memory with Rachel Robinson in an April 15 ceremony at Shea \nStadium during a game between the Dodgers and the New York Mets.\n  I salute the memory of Jackie Robinson on this, the 50th anniversary \nof his becoming the first black baseball player in the major \nleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/04/09/senate-section/article/S2950-1", "month": "04", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "09", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--S. 543\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
