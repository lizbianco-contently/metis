The able majority leader, Senator Lott, is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today, the Senate will be in a period of \nmorning business to allow a number of Senators to introduce legislation \nand make statements. I understand the Rules Committee is scheduled to \nmeet this afternoon to begin the markup of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee funding resolution. It is my hope that there will be an \nagreement reached on this for the consideration of the funding \nresolution. If an agreement is reached, the Senate may debate the \nresolution on Friday and on Monday, and, hopefully, complete action on \nthe resolution early next week. It clearly, though, is our intent to \ntake up the funding resolution for the Governmental Affairs Committee \nnext week, hopefully earlier in the week, but at some point we clearly \nwill want to bring it to a conclusion. We have had a lot of discussion, \na lot of efforts to find a reasonable arrangement for the committee to \ngo forward. I think we are close to accomplishing that.\n  Also, I might say that there had been some thought that we would \nbegin a discussion today, debate, if you will, on legislation involving \nthe independent counsel, and we have some legislation pending in that \nregard. But in my discussions with the Democratic leader yesterday, he \nindicated that he thought perhaps we could come to some bipartisan \narrangement to deal with independent counsel in the Judiciary \nCommittee. I had hoped the Judiciary Committee could act on that today. \nI understand that perhaps there was an objection lodged to going \nforward today, and therefore it may be a week before the Judiciary \nCommittee can act on that.\n  But the Judiciary Committee, as I understand the independent counsel \nlaw, can act in a couple of ways. One, the full committee can act in a \nbipartisan way to begin a process of looking at whether or not an \nindependent counsel is called for. Or a vote of the majority on the \ncommittee could also begin this process. We would like it to be \nbipartisan, and we will work to try to see if that can be accomplished. \nSince there was an indication that perhaps we could do that, I thought \nthat the good-faith thing to do would be to make that effort in the \nJudiciary Committee before we begin debate on forcing that action here \nin the full Senate.\n  Mr. President, there are a number of military nominations that the \nArmed Services Committee reported on Tuesday of this week. I am hopeful \nthe Senate will be able to confirm all or at least most of those during \ntoday's session.\n  Also, the Energy Committee has reported out the Pena nomination this \nmorning, and it is possible that the Senate could take action on the \nnomination sometime next week. I will be working with interested \nSenators to see what problems might exist, to see what time they need \nto address their concerns. It looks like we will not be able to get a \nvote on the Pena nomination today, but I intend to call it up next \nweek, at the very latest the middle of the week.\n  As is also usually the case, I will notify our colleagues of the \nvoting schedule as early as possible. I know they will be interested \nwhether or not there will be votes this afternoon or tomorrow. We will \nget that information to all Senators as soon as we can work through \nsome other scheduling issues with the minority.\n  I thank all Members for their cooperation and their attention. I \nyield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2005-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes today \nto talk about an issue that I have been looking at for some time. I \nrise today to discuss U.S. policy in regard to one of our most troubled \nneighbors in this hemisphere. Over the last several years, in my \ncapacity as a member of the Intelligence Committee, I traveled to Haiti \non three separate occasions to investigate the problems of that country \nand to assess the efforts of the United States to help the Haitians \ncope with these problems and to help them as they try to secure the \nsolid legal and economic infrastructure that has, frankly, eluded them \nnow for centuries.\n  I did this because I believe Congress and the administration must \nundertake a candid, realistic look at U.S. policy, what is working, \nwhat is not working, and where we go from here. The American taxpayers \nhave already invested a great deal in Haiti, contributing at least $2 \nbillion to the country's recovery, risking the lives of American \nservice personnel in the 1994 invasion, and leaving hundreds of them \nthere today to help keep an uneasy peace.\n  While Haiti is not of great strategic importance to the United \nStates, we do have a serious interest in what happens in this, the \npoorest country in our hemisphere. These interests stem from geography \nand are amply proven by history. I do not think most of us need to be \nreminded, for example, about the Haitian boat people. It is clear the \nonly thing preventing yet another explosion of refugees into the \nsouthern part of this country is a wise, multinational investment in \nthe stability of Haiti.\n  Fortunately, recent history has given us some good guidelines, some \ngood advice, if you will, on how to help secure such stability. One of \nthe great principles of the Reagan administration was that America's \nnational interest was best served by having neighbors that practiced \ndemocratic and free-market principles. In Latin America, the Reagan \ndoctrine certainly has worked.\n  As free elections and economic liberalization has taken place in \ncountry after country, the countries of South and Central America have \nbecome better neighbors for the United States. I believe these same \nprinciples apply to our national strategy in regard to Haiti.\n  Mr. President, we need to apply these principles to Haiti so that \nover the long term, Haiti can move out of the category of ``problem \ncountry'' and into a fuller economic and political participation in \nregional progress. The challenge for us, the challenge for Congress, \nthe challenge for the administration is to provide assistance that \nactually works, a do-good approach, not a feel-good approach. This \nmeans working with the Haitian people to determine the real roadblocks \nto democracy and to free enterprise and determine what form of United \nStates assistance will help overcome these obstacles.\n  Two years after the United States invasion, Haiti still is struggling \nby any reasonable measure. But a closer examination reveals several \nseeds of progress struggling to take root.\n  First, Let's start, Mr. President, with the justice system. For \ndemocracy to survive, it is not enough that Haitians have the power to \neffect change at the ballot box. They also must have a working judicial \nsystem. Frankly, Haiti has never had a functioning judiciary, certainly \nnot the way we understand it. There are sitting judges today who can't \nread or write. Others are just incompetent.\n  Understandably, the Haitian people are demanding change. \nSpecifically, they want to know if President Preval is committed to \nbuilding an independent and a competent judiciary. Since President \nAristide's return, there has been a series of commando-style killings \nof political opponents. The numbers have dropped off since the \ninauguration of President Preval, but, disturbingly, too many people in \nHaiti still think they can commit political murders with impunity.\n  Mr. President, there are two things you always need if you want to \nsolve high-profile crimes. First, you have to have the expertise, good \nsolid police work, good professional police investigation. And Second, \nyou also have to have the political will from the top so that everyone \nin the country, everyone in the judicial system, everyone in law \nenforcement understands the priority.\n  The good news is that the Haitian national police have established a \nspecial investigations unit, SIU, to investigate human rights crimes. \nThe bad news is that while I was there in November, my most recent \nvisit, the SIU consisted of one experienced United States police \nofficer and roughly 36 inexperienced Haitians. This has changed \nsomewhat since my visit, since two more U.S. police officers have been \nadded to the force.\n  This is one area in which American expertise can make a big \ndifference. Indeed, with some extra United States help, Haiti could \nsucceed in convicting some of the worst defenders, like the murderers \nof Mireille Bertin and Guy Malary. Mireille Bertin was an anti-Aristide \nlawyer. Guy Malary was Aristide's justice minister. To prosecute and \nconvict the killers in those kinds of cases would send an unmistakable \nmessage to Haitian society: Your chance of getting justice does not \ndepend on what side you are on.\n  Mr. President, these reforms will not happen without leadership from \nthe President of Haiti. President Preval needs to push judicial reform \nand make clear that the period of impunity from the left and from the \nright is now over.\n  These reforms will not take place either, Mr. President, without \nexpertise and without assistance from the United States. The SIU needs \nthe kind of know-how that U.S. law enforcement officials can provide; \nindeed, they can provide it better than anyone else in the world.\n  After my recent visit, I wrote to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe \nTalbott and told him that additional U.S. expertise is needed in this \narea. I am pleased to report that I have received a letter back from \nSecretary Talbott. He wrote me that two additional Creole-speaking U.S. \ncitizens, U.S. police officers, have been added to the SIU since my \nlast visit, and further, that the FBI has agreed to provide a medical \nexaminer to perform autopsies. Furthermore, he told me that the FBI \nwill visit Haiti with a view toward possibly helping to develop an \ninvestigation plan for the SIU.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Secretary Talbott's \nletter be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, it is my view that this would be a big \nstep forward for the progress of restoring civil society in Haiti. It \nwould help bring high-profile killers to justice and send a powerful \nmessage to the people of Haiti that they can count on law and order \nbecoming a reality in the future of their country.\n  Let me discuss a broader topic--topic No. 2--the ordinary day-to-day \noperation of the Haitian police as it deals with run-of-the-mill, \nnonpolitical crimes, the crimes that most people face the threat of \neach day.\n  The United States has already helped to train 5,000 young recruits as \na civilian police force to replace the discredited Haitian military. \nThis task was and remains daunting. Try to imagine, Mr. President, the \nWashington, DC police force fired one day, everyone fired en masse and \nreplaced by kids fresh out of the police academy who are then asked to \npatrol the city's most dangerous neighborhoods. Or think of any other \nbig city in this country.\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\n  As one would expect, there have been some pretty serious problems \nwith this police force. They are alleged to have killed innocent \npeople. In fact, even Pierre Denize, director general of the Haitian \nnational police has acknowledged these problems. He has a letter in \nTime magazine that reached the newsstands earlier this week, in which \nhe writes the following:\n\n       I take responsibility for the actions of my subordinates \n     and acknowledge that some HNP members have committed human \n     rights abuses, but the majority of these offenses have been \n     identified through the investigative efforts of HNP \n     officials. The HNP does not condone these acts. In addition, \n     the Haitian Government is working to ensure HNP officers face \n     criminal charges when warranted. Unfortunately, there is no \n     quick fix, as the problems did not originate with the \n     creation of HNP in 1996 but have developed over decades.\n\n  Mr. President, one major problem is that these Haitian recruits lack \nexperience, and they also lack the midlevel support that is essential \nto successful police work. I personally met with 10 of these United \nStates police officers who are mentoring these young Haitian recruits. \nThese Americans are veterans of big city police departments. They were \nborn in Haiti and speak Creole. They are United States citizens. They \nhave worked in some of the biggest, toughest cities and have great \npolice experience. I found them to be enthusiastic and doing a great \njob. I was very proud of them.\n  But, frankly, Haiti must have more of them. In his letter that I \nmentioned earlier, Secretary Talbott wrote me that in response to \ninterest on the part of the Haitian Government, there are now 10 more \nUnited States officers there, for a total of 32.\n  The expectation of law and order is always a prerequisite for a \nworking society, but it is also a prerequisite for a working economy. \nTherefore, let me turn now to the third major issue I would like to \ndiscuss, the state of Haiti's economy, and I have mixed news to report.\n  After a decade and a half of negative growth, the Haitian economy is \nfinally beginning to grow, very slowly. But if the Haitians do not move \nforward, if the Government does not move forward immediately on \nprivatizing their State industries, growth is going to stop. People \nneed to see real economic progress if they are going to support the \nfree market over the long run. If Haiti pays lip service to the free \nmarket while continuing its dead-or-dying state-run businesses, the \nprosperity will not be there for the Haitian people, and support for \nmarket reforms and support for democracy will erode very quickly.\n\n  The Haitian Parliament has taken a meaningful first step by passing \nprivatization legislation. But legislation is only a first step. To \nmake a difference in national prosperity, privatization has to be real. \nIt has to actually happen. President Preval must move forward quickly \nand forcefully on privatization.\n  Mr. President, another thing that absolutely must happen in Haiti is \nthe fundamental reform of Haiti's corrupt and inefficient ports. And \nthis brings me to my fourth topic.\n  My wife Fran and I visited an orphanage in Haiti, at which a nun \napproached us and told us that her orphanage had been expecting a \nvitally important x-ray machine. Where was it? She told us it was \nsitting on the docks for months. Then it was finally stolen. A second \nreplacement x-ray machine, estimated to be worth a great deal of money, \nsat on the docks for months and months awaiting the payment of a 30-\npercent tax.\n  Mr. President, a few weeks after returning to the United States, I \nmet with Joe Busken in Cincinnati, a private citizen. Mr. Busken has \nbeen involved for years with a different orphanage in Haiti. He \noutfitted a bakery for them and taught them to make highly nutritious \nbread. I found, in talking to Mr. Busken, that last July--last July--he \nhad shipped flour to that bakery, only to find that flour was also \nstuck on the docks since July. This was in November when I was talking \nto him. Once my office became involved, and with the help of the U.S. \nEmbassy and the USAID, the flour and the other orphanage's x-ray \nmachine were finally liberated, but that was 7 months later.\n  Mr. President, Haiti is an island. It is therefore very vulnerable to \nthe poor functioning of its ports. On an island such as Haiti, a badly \nrun and corrupt port can become a major chokepoint for imports and also \nexports. A vibrant assembly sector, for example, cannot hope to grow as \nlong as the port authority exacts a $750-per-container export fee.\n  The Inter-American Development Bank, Mr. President, is to spend \nliterally hundreds of millions of dollars to build roads in Haiti. The \nmain purpose of these roads is to allow farmers and others to get goods \nto the ports for export. But those roads will not do any good if Haiti \ncannot even get things in or out of the port to begin with.\n  Humanitarian aid, Mr. President, is just as vulnerable as are \nordinary commercial imports and exports. Because economic reform \nremains a long-term goal, continued humanitarian aid remains an \nimmediate need that must be met. Many concerned American volunteer \ngroups are sending food and other emergency aid to Haiti. But huge \ntariff or port entry fees are keeping aid sitting on the docks for \nmonths. Food shipments are simply left to rot, discouraging many from \neven trying.\n  Mr. President, here is an example of where American know-how can \nhelp. I am glad to report we have made some progress in making the \nhumanitarian-aid train run on schedule. United States Ambassador \nWilliam Swing has informed me that the Haitian Government has agreed to \nlet assistance from private voluntary organizations, PVO's, who are \naffiliated with the United States Government enter Haiti without having \nto pay the 4-percent so-called verification fee. Shipments of food, \npharmaceuticals and scholastic materials will be exempt from that \nverification fee for all PVO's, as well as United States Government \nagencies shipping aid to Haiti. That, Mr. President, is certainly a \nstep in the right direction.\n  Let me now turn to a related humanitarian matter, the current U.S. \nfood-aid policy. That policy is shifting from a general feeding program \nto one targeted to women and infants. That is a wise step. But, Mr. \nPresident, I believe it should be modified so that the children in \norphanages and the elderly in institutional care continue to receive \nthis food until there is an alternative feeding program in place.\n  In Port-au-Prince, my wife Fran visited an orphanage run by a nun who \ngoes to hospitals to gather as many children as her orphanage will \nhold. These children who have been abandoned as babies are simply left \nat the hospital. She now takes care of 50 babies and children, many of \nwhom came to the orphanage horribly malnourished. My wife had the \nopportunity to see some of these children, and it was a very pitiful \nsight.\n  Mr. President, if the proposed U.S. food-aid policy is left \nunchanged, it would harm the neediest and most vulnerable patients, \nsuch as these babies. USAID is evaluating this policy now. I would urge \nthem to reformulate the policy so that the most vulnerable people, \nchildren in orphanages and the elderly in institutions, are not left \nout.\n  Mr. President, there is another topic that I do not intend to address \ntoday. That is the issue of Haitian agriculture. Haiti cannot recover--\ntrue progress cannot be made--without a viable agricultural sector. But \nHaitian agriculture has been devastated. Haiti needs to do what it can \nto help themselves in this particular area. I intend to return to the \nfloor at some future date, Mr. President, to discuss this issue in \ngreater detail than time would permit today.\n  Let me conclude by underlying the central fact about today's Haiti. \nIt is an extremely troubled country. The road ahead is uphill, and it \nis very steep. Turning around two centuries of poverty and misrule is \nnot a task that can be accomplished by Haitians overnight.\n  That is why, Mr. President, it is important for Congress and the \nadministration to work out a realistic bipartisan consensus on Haiti. \nThe United States cannot make Haiti an island paradise. Only the people \nof Haiti can determine their own destiny. But we can help the Haitian \npeople transform their country into one that works, one that exports \ngoods and services, one where the people will come together to escape \nfrom their past rather than escaping from their homeland. That is their \nonly hope for a viable future. That is a goal worthy of America's \nsupport.\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\n  Mr. President, I will continue to work with the administration, with \nMembers of both parties here in Congress to make sure this goal gets \nthe attention that it needs.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                     U.S. Department of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Mike DeWine,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator DeWine: I read with interest your January 24 \n     OpEd article in the Wall Street Journal.\n       I wholeheartedly concur with you on the need for further \n     reforms in the police, judiciary and economy if Haiti is to \n     realize the full benefits from the restoration of democracy. \n     In this regard, I believe you would be interested in some \n     developments that have occurred since your November visit to \n     Haiti which address these shared concerns.\n       Police and Judicial Reforms: The Inspector General (IG) of \n     the Haitian National Police (HNP) has continued to crack down \n     on police officers implicated in malfeasance or other \n     improper activity, including during the last month the \n     detention of four HNP officers involved in a November 5 \n     shootout in the Delmas suburb of Port-au-Prince. Over the \n     last year, IG investigations have resulted in the dismissal \n     of dozens of police officers. As you note, one of the most \n     positive elements of our own effort to strengthen the \n     fledgling Haitian National Police has been the contribution \n     of U.S. police mentors working with their Haitian \n     counterparts. Responding to continued Haitian Government \n     interest in this program and to your recommendation that \n     additional U.S. civilian police officers be assigned to \n     Haiti, the current U.S. contingent of 22 officers will be \n     augmented this week with the arrival of ten new mentors.\n       I also believe that additional measures are needed to \n     ensure a thorough investigation of the murders of Haitian \n     political figures. Two additional experienced, Creole-\n     speaking U.S. investigators have been assigned to the Special \n     Investigation Unit (SIU), and in response to a formal request \n     from Haitian authorities, the FBI has agreed to provide a \n     medical examiner to perform autopsies. We will give positive \n     consideration to additional areas of support to the SIU that \n     might be identified during a forthcoming FBI visit to Haiti \n     to develop an investigation plan for the SIU.\n       In the area of judicial reform, strengthening prosecutorial \n     capabilities and the courts remain a priority USG effort, and \n     we will work with the Congress to provide adequate resources \n     for these efforts.\n       Economic reforms: I agree with you that progress on \n     privatization and tariff reform are essential to encourage \n     economic development and private-sector investment. The \n     Department remains committed to working closely with the \n     Congress to establish and apply realistic conditions that \n     will encourage sustainable economic development. We also plan \n     to target USAID safety-net programs toward those most in need \n     including, as you recommend, maintaining feeding programs \n     directed at vulnerable sectors such as mothers and their \n     infants.\n       Again, I wish to express my appreciation for your interest \n     in Haiti and your desire to work with the Administration in \n     pursuit of democratization, political security and economic \n     reform. Your visits have helped to galvanize a bipartisan \n     effort that, in turn, will help Haiti to help itself. \n     National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and I hope to visit \n     Haiti in the near future.

Mr. President, last week the Israeli leader, Prime Minister \nBenjamin Netanyahu, decided to authorize a politically volatile housing \nproject for Israeli settlers in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem. This \ndisappointing act has thrown into confusion the promising opening that \nwas generated by the long and difficult, but successful negotiations \nlast month, which culminated in an agreement returning control of the \nWest Bank city of Hebron to the Palestinians. The United States \ninvested very considerable efforts, negotiating talent and prestige to \nmove the peace process along. The agreement over Hebron gave the world \ngreat hope that a long-term peaceful settlement of the outstanding \nissues between Israel and the Palestinians was on an upward track.\n  Therefore, it is very unfortunate, in my view, that the reality of \nthe substantial success over Hebron prompted the right wing of Israeli \npolitics to pressure Prime Minister Netanyahu into this latest act on \nhousing settlements. According to the New York Times of March 2, 1997, \n``a powerful group of Mr. Netanyahu's conservative colleagues'' \n``leaned on him'' to prove his commitment to Jerusalem by building Har \nHoma, threatening to bring down the government if he failed. With new \nterritorial concessions to the Palestinians looming, Mr. Netanyahu told \nAmericans and Palestinians privately that he had to ``fill his right \nwing tank'' on Har Homa if he was to keep on the peace route.\n  This is a most disappointing situation. Progress on peace is regarded \nas a threat by the Israeli right wing and has resulted in efforts to \nforce the Prime Minister to retreat from his own success. The Israeli \nright wing should know that their behavior will have consequences in \nthe United States, and I for one will relate my support for their \nagenda to their support of that of the United States, which is a fair, \nequitable and just peace in Jerusalem and the Middle East. The process \nof American intermediations between the Israelis and Palestinians is a \nserious matter and we cannot stand by and watch the Israeli right wing, \nat their whim, pull the rug out from under whatever progress is \naccomplished. Such actions should be understood to have consequences \nfor support for Israel's various interests as they are considered by \nSenators.\n  I hope the Israeli Prime Minister will do better at withstanding the \npressure of his right wing and, that the considerable influence of \nAmerican groups will be exercised to counter those negative pressures. \nI hope, as I am sure my colleagues do, that the peace process will not \nbe derailed by the actions of an extreme right wing minority in Israel \nand that the settlements issue will be adjusted by the Prime Minister \nto reflect the opportunity that the successful Hebron agreement has \nprovided.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend from Indiana, Senator Coats, for his \ncourtesy in allowing me to proceed ahead of him. I thank him very much \nindeed.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is not difficult to yield to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia because the content of what he says is always \ninstructive, and I am always pleased to be on the floor when he is \nspeaking because I always learn something.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, troubling facts continue to surface in \nthe FBI crime lab issue. These facts are putting flesh on the bones of \nallegations that much of the lab's analysis is sloppy, not credible, \nfabricated, or all of the above.\n  The FBI has charged that these allegations are unfounded, and that \nthey are the musings of one Dr. Frederic Whitehurst. Dr. Whitehurst has \ncome forward as a whistleblower with serious charges against the lab \nand its management. The FBI chose to shoot the messenger instead of \ntaking Dr. Whitehurst seriously.\n  After a year of studying Dr. Whitehurst's claims and his information, \nI was not so sure the FBI took the wise course. Then, after a private \nbriefing by the Justice Department's inspector general on his \ninvestigation into these matters, I was even more convinced that the \nFBI has taken the wrong course. And now that the FBI has taken \npersonnel action against Dr. Whitehurst in retaliation for his telling \nthe truth, I am convinced that the Bureau is dead wrong.\n  The FBI's defense--some would say coverup--is slowly unraveling. Last \nweek, we discovered that it wasn't just Dr. Whitehurst that has raised \nserious concerns. Another respected scientist, Dr. William Tobin, had \nraised equally serious allegations in 1989. He alleged that an FBI \nagent tampered with evidence and made a series of false statements \nwhile testifying in court proceedings against then-Judge Alcee L.\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\nHastings. I discussed this before this body on February 26, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The FBI covered up this matter. There may be a missing document. Last \nweek, at my request, the Attorney General ordered that the FBI not be \ninvolved in the investigation. The investigation has been given instead \nto the IG. This is because there are major questions about the FBI's \nability to police itself. The Attorney General gets much credit for \nrecognizing the potential conflict involved when the FBI investigates \nthese issues.\n  In the past 2 weeks, two additional cases--in addition to the Alcee \nHastings case--appear to reveal similar improper behavior by FBI agents \ntestifying in Federal cases. If it sounds to you like a pattern is \ndeveloping, Mr. President, you have been paying close attention. Up to \nnow, the FBI's denials had been set in concrete. What you are hearing \nnow is the sound of concrete cracking.\n  Thus far, the IG has had remarkable success keeping the draft report \nunder wraps. But a few press stories about its contents have been \npopping out. Last week, the Miami Herald ran a story about a Florida \ncase reviewed by the IG. In that 1988 case, George Trepal was convicted \nof murdering his neighbor by poisoning her soft drink. Mr. Trepal was \nsentenced to death, and is still on death row.\n  But as the Herald reports, the testimony of evidence linking Mr. \nTrepal to this murder may have been tainted by an FBI lab supervisor. \nThe supervisor may not have had adequate scientific support to identify \nthe poison as he did. If the Herald is correct, this is another example \nof the problems found in the Hastings case.\n  And now there's a third case, Mr. President. The Associated Press \nreported yesterday that the IG found similar problems in the VANPAC \ncase. That is the case involving the 1991 conviction of Walter Leroy \nMoody for the murder of U.S. Circuit Judge Robert Vance and Georgia \ncivil rights attorney Robert Robinson. It was Justice Department \nattorney Louis J. Freeh who prosecuted the case.\n  Before I get into the specifics of the FBI's wrongdoing apparently \nuncovered by the IG in this case, let me provide some context.\n  More than a year before the bombing tragedy in Oklahoma City, \nDirector Freeh and his general counsel, Howard Shapiro, had been fully \nbriefed about Dr. Whitehurst's allegations of misconduct within the \nlab. They were aware of Whitehurst's charges of a systemic quality \ncontrol breakdown in the lab.\n  On February 7, 1994, Whitehurst's attorney wrote to Mr. Shapiro \ninforming him of the sensitive nature of the allegations, and how a \nthousand cases could be affected. Whitehurst asked that a special, \nindependent, or outside counsel review the matters.\n  But the FBI chose another course. It did not empanel an independent \nreview. Instead, the matter was assigned to two attorneys within the \nOffice of the general counsel. They reported directly to Mr. Shapiro \nand Mr. Freeh.\n  No scientist was placed in the decisionmaking chain of command. Mr. \nFreeh, in conjunction with his attorneys, decided they could perform a \ndiligent and thorough internal investigation. Mr. Shapiro's exact words \nin his February 14 reply--and remember these words, Mr. President, \nbecause I intend to refer to them liberally in the future--his exact \nwords were, ``The FBI has a long and proud history of performing \ndiligent and thorough internal investigations.''\n  What is amazing to me is that neither Mr. Freeh nor Mr. Shapiro \nrecused himself from the decisionmaking role with respect to the \nreview. After all, they had prosecuted one of the cases--the VANPAC \ncase--in which Dr. Whitehurst alleged misconduct had occurred.\n  In other words, nonscientists with a conflict of interest assumed the \nauthority to review significant allegations of scientific and \nevidentiary misconduct that could affect hundreds, if not thousands of \ncases.\n  I have now obtained a redacted copy of the results of that review, \nheaded by Mr. Freeh and Mr. Shapiro. The findings and recommendations \nwere approved by both.\n  The first thing they did was fire at the messenger. On the very first \npage, the FBI notes that Dr. Whitehurst could be disciplined for \nproviding information about the lab's misconduct to Congress.\n  You see, Mr. President, providing information to Congress--and I'm \nquoting the FBI--``violates FBI and DOJ regulations.'' Were you aware, \nMr. President, that FBI and DOJ regulations override the first \namendment guarantee of the people's right to petition Congress? If I \ncould anticipate your response, Mr. President, neither was I.\n  The second issue: During this 1994 review, Mr. Freeh and Mr. Shapiro \nlearned that the lab ``would not meet minimal accreditation \nstandards.'' The report notes that it was ``incredulous that the \npremiere forensic laboratory in the world'' was ``not accredited.''\n  Instead of asking how the failure to reach minimal accreditation \nstandards had impacted on past cases, or might impact on future cases, \nthe FBI took a different course. The FBI concluded, ``no further \ninvestigation or action'' was needed.\n  In other words, rather than evaluating the potentially serious \nramifications of the FBI's failure to meet minimal accreditation \nstandards, the Bureau circled the wagons and whitewashed the problem. \nThey set up a committee to come up with a timetable for accreditation. \nThat was 3 years ago. Now, the Bureau tells us they'll be accredited in \n18 months from now. And if you believe that, Mr. President--\n  This brings me back to the VANPAC matter. As I mentioned, Mr. Freeh \nhad been the lead prosecutor on that case. He got national recognition. \nMr. Shapiro was his cocounsel. Larry Potts--of Ruby Ridge infamy--was \nthe FBI's case agent.\n  Dr. Whitehurst had alleged that there were problems with the evidence \nin the VANPAC case. Despite the clear conflict, Mr. Freeh and Mr. \nShapiro did not recuse themselves. They recused themselves about a year \nand a half later--in September 1995. But at this point in time--\nFebruary 1994--they kept themselves at the top of the investigation \ninto misconduct in that case.\n  Instead of using real scientists to independently review the \nevidence--as the IG did, by the way--Mr. Freeh and Mr. Shapiro used \ntheir own subordinates. And what was their conclusion after reviewing \nthe VANPAC allegations, Mr. President? ``Whitehurst's allegations are \nnot supported by any facts.'' That's what it says in their report.\n  Now we have a new account--by the Associated Press--that gives us an \ninsight into what the IG found in VANPAC. And it seems to conflict with \nthe FBI's interpretation. Remember, the IG followed up on Dr. \nWhitehurst's suggestion, and did an independent review. And, the IG \nwent out and recruited five of the world's most renowned lab scientists \nfor his investigation. In other words, the IG did a proper review.\n  According to the AP, the IG report states that ``a lab witness \noverstated test results during the trial.'' And that's not all. Let me \nquote further from the AP story: ``In addition to overstated testimony \nin VANPAC, the report found the lab lacked databases to support its \nconclusions, used unvalidated tests, lacked written test procedures, \ninadequately documented why it discounted test results that undercut \nits conclusions and lacked any record for some tests.''\n  Now, this is interesting if true, Mr. President. Because less than 2 \nmonths ago, on January 23, Mr. Freeh told his deputy, Weldon Kennedy, \n``Based upon the VANPAC allegations investigated by the Office of the \nInspector General [OIG], and despite their findings that none of the \nallegations regarding VANPAC are substantiated, I have decided to \nrecuse myself from any of the Whitehurst-related disciplinary or \nadministrative matters contained in the OIG report regarding the FBI \nlaboratory.''\n  Mr. President, I'm not sure whose version is correct--Director \nFreeh's or the AP's. But if this AP story is correct, this is the \nsecond time Mr. Freeh has been misleading on what's in the IG report. \nOn February 26 I pointed out on this floor Mr. Freeh's other \ndiscrepancy. He said he had been unaware of the Tobin memo: Remember, \nhe's the other scientist I referred to earlier who lodged complaints. I \nquestioned how he could possibly say that when the IG report containing \nthe Tobin allegations had been on his desk for a full month.\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\n  In sum, Mr. President, we're beginning to see some patterns that back \nup Dr. Whitehurst, and contradict Mr. Freeh and the FBI. First, other \nscientists have surfaced with allegations--not just Dr. Whitehurst. \nSecond, it appears that three cases reviewed by the IG found misconduct \nand/or sloppiness.\n  When I was growing up back on the farm in Iowa, we had a saying. If \nyou reach into a barrel of apples for the first time and pull out a bad \none, the chances are pretty good there's more bad apples in there. \nMaybe a barrel-full of bad apples.\n  So far, based on press reports, that's three bad apples--three out of \nthree. Those are pretty high odds.\n  What's to be done? Director Freeh made a big splash yesterday \nannouncing a new way to handle internal reviews of alleged criminal \nbehavior and misconduct. He will increase the number of people working \non such reviews from 30 to 60.\n  The Director doesn't seem to get it, Mr. President. The issue is that \nthe FBI can't police itself. Doubling the number of self-policers won't \nchange the bottom line. Zero times two is still zero.\n  I'm beginning to think those 60 slots are a lot better off--from the \ntaxpayers' point of view--being moved to the IG instead. And I intend \nto discuss this with my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee.\n  The FBI does not have a long and proud history of self-policing \nnotwithstanding what Mr. Shapiro leads us to believe. Look at Ruby \nRidge. That case certainly doesn't inspire confidence in the FBI's \nability to self-examine.\n  Mr. President, I believe the American people are being mislead by the \nFBI on the problems we're seeing in its crime lab. And all that does is \ncontinue the erosion of confidence the people have in the FBI.\n  It's time the Bureau stopped its narcissistic infatuation with its \nown image. It's time to stop selling an inferior product with false \nadvertising. The American people deserve from its chief law enforcement \nagency a product with integrity. They deserve an FBI that does what it \nwould have you believe it does. This is an issue of leadership. Quite \nfrankly, I am beginning to join the ranks of those whose confidence in \nthe Bureau's leadership is diminishing.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I do not see any other Members \nready to speak, so I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized for up to 15 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2008-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2010-S2013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ANTHONY LAKE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to speak today on the nomination of \nAnthony Lake to be Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. This \nnomination has raised a troubling issue, an issue that has nothing to \ndo with the candidate's qualifications. Rather, that issue is the \ncredibility of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to conduct a \nfair, nonpartisan examination of this nominee.\n  That committee, of which I have been a proud member for 4 years, has \na well-earned reputation for bipartisanship. But that hard-won \nreputation is being jeopardized by the committee's conduct in this \nmatter.\n  In a speech before the Senate last night, Chairman Shelby said he \nwants to treat the Lake confirmation ``in a serious, thorough and fair \nmanner.'' That is a laudable goal. It is a goal I fully support. I \ncommend the chairman for establishing a high standard. The position of \nDirector of Central Intelligence is an extremely sensitive one. We have \na responsibility to the American people to subject the nominee to close \nscrutiny.\n  I accept and welcome the responsibility as a member of the committee. \nUnfortunately, it is a responsibility my colleagues and I have been \nunable thus far to exercise.\n  The reason for this failure is that the committee, although having \nofficially received this nomination on January 9, has yet to conduct \nits first hearing on the nominee. Meanwhile, the Senate has acted \njudiciously but swiftly on two other members of the President's foreign \npolicy team, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense.\n  Mr. Lake remains the exception. Indeed, his hearings have been \npostponed not once, but twice. In the first instance, the chairman \npostponed the hearings ``dependent upon the status of the Justice \nDepartment's investigation'' into Mr. Lake's stock transactions and his \nrole in the Iran-Bosnia arms sale.\n  The Department of Justice completed its investigation on February 7, \ngiving Mr. Lake a clean bill of health in regard to the arms sale and \ndetermining there was no evidence that he ever took any action to \nconceal or misrepresent his or his wife's financial holdings.\n  Nevertheless, the chairman again postponed the hearings, this time \nasserting that the Department of Justice investigation ``is only a \nsmall part of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee's overall, \nongoing investigation * * *'' He now cites new concerns.\n  After two delays, the chairman is now committed to a hearing on March \n11. I welcome that commitment.\n  Mr. President, I fear, however, that the March 11 hearing is only a \nprelude to what is turning into an extended fishing expedition. If \nanyone doubts that, they only have to read the February 27 issue of the \nWashington Post, which reported that the Senate Intelligence Committee \nhas now requested White House documents involving Haiti--documents \nwhich our House colleagues requested last year as part of their \nextensive investigations into the administration's Haiti policy.\n  Those investigations have so far produced rather paltry results, \ndespite extensive hearings, document reviews and testimony.\n  The International Relations Committee was able to generate only a \nmajority staff report. The members of that committee--neither \nRepublican or Democrat--signed the report--not exactly a vote of \nconfidence.\n  The Republican majority of the House Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence has yet to produce any report at all.\n  In each case, the administration made available literally hundreds of \ndocuments for congressional review.\n  Although withholding approximately 50 documents, citing executive \nprivilege, the administration did offer to brief House Members and \nprovide certain redacted versions of those documents. Republicans \nrejected the proposal.\n  The administration has made the same offer to our committee. It is a \nreasonable one that balances congressional rights and executive \nprivilege. I urge the chairman to accept it, rather than creating a \npretext for further delay.\n  Mr. President, the Haiti issue is just one of several the committee \nis pursuing.\n  The implication of the chairman's remarks are that the committee now \nintends to investigate the Department of Justice's investigation of Mr. \nLake's divesture of stock. The Justice Department, as I mentioned \nearlier, found no evidence that Mr. Lake ever took any action to \nconceal or misrepresent his or his wife's financial holdings. It found \nno fault in his conduct of the Iran-Bosnia matter.\n  With regards to Mr. Lake's FBI file and the Tower nomination, the \nchairman has requested Mr. Lake's complete FBI file, based on the \npurported precedent of the nomination of former Senator John Tower for \nSecretary of Defense in 1989. As my colleague from Michigan, Senator \nLevin, stated yesterday, ``neither the Armed Services Committee nor the \nfull Senate ever had access to the raw investigative files used by the \nFBI to compile its summary of the background investigation of Senator \nTower.''\n  In his statement, Senator Levin further cites Senator Nunn's comments \nin 1989. Senator Nunn stated on the Senate floor that, ``What we have \nin S-407 is the summary of interviews the FBI conducted. They prepare \nthe summary. We do not see nor do we have the underlying interviews.''\n  In the case of Mr. Lake, that summary has already been provided to \nthe chairman and vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n  I am concerned that we are engaged in a fishing expedition in which \nthe\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nhearings are being used to determine if some malfeasance can be found, \nrather than to develop information on a credible hypothesis of \ninappropriate behavior.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned that the goalposts are clearly \nbeing moved on this nominee. Questions are asked; responses are given; \nand then new, different questions are asked. If members of the \ncommittee have inquiries, we should all welcome the opportunity to \nquestion this nominee in the best possible forum, under oath, during \nhis confirmation hearings. He in turn has the right and the opportunity \nto respond. That is the purpose of a nomination hearing.\n  Unfortunately, there is a growing public perception, aptly expressed \nby one commentator, that the committee ``seems to be waiting for \nsomething scandalous to turn up to sink the nomination.'' The \nperception, right or wrong, is that we are leaving Mr. Lake to twist in \nthe wind. I am afraid that that says more about our committee than it \ndoes about Mr. Lake.\n  Some history. The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has a hard-\nearned and proud tradition of bipartisanship. It is the successor to \nthe Church committee of 1975-76, which was an investigative committee \nonly. The purpose of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is \nboth to oversee sensitive intelligence activities and to maintain and \nimprove intelligence capabilities and efficiency.\n  The issues that come before the committee, including the nomination \nof the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, are extremely \nsensitive. They demand a high level of bipartisanship. I fear that the \ncommittee's bipartisanship is fraying and that fair play is falling \nvictim to partisan gamesmanship.\n  That, Mr. President, should concern all of us, Republican and \nDemocrat alike. Intelligence activities, by their sensitive nature, run \ncounter to Democratic principles of openness. Yet, in my view, good \nintelligence is essential to our democracy's security.\n  Effective congressional oversight, in turn, is a critical ingredient \nto maintaining some balance between these two inherently contradictory \nforces--democratic openness and the necessary secrecy that surrounds \nintelligence procedures and operations. Oversight is a serious \nresponsibility. The public must have confidence that we are above \npolitics when we deal with intelligence issues.\n  In almost every other area of Federal Government, the public has \nmultiple sources of information. That is what freedom of speech and \nfreedom of press provide in a democratic society. But as it relates to \nthe operations of the intelligence community, the general public must \nrely on a handful of its representatives to provide the necessary \noversight and scrutiny to assure that the operations are being \nconducted in a manner that advances the public interest and assures \nthat the public interest is not being rendered vulnerable by \nclandestine operations.\n  So far, the committee has largely succeeded. One measure of the \ncommittee's success has been the impressive number of newly emerging \ndemocracies that have sought the Senate Intelligence Committee's advice \nover the past few years. Each of those countries is struggling to \nestablish an intelligence community that will safeguard democracy, not \nundermine it. They look to us as a model of bipartisan oversight and \nhave come to us for guidance.\n  That expression of confidence is our most valuable asset. We have \nearned it through hard work, diligence and a determination to play the \nhonest broker. We can ill-afford to fritter it away and give life to \nthe perception that the CIA is becoming an instrument of partisan \nwarfare, that the Lake nomination is simply an attempt to attack the \nPresident's foreign policy over the last 4 years.\n  The CIA, in turn, can ill-afford partisan bickering at a time when it \nis struggling with a painful transition from a cold war where we faced \none principal enemy to a new world in which we face multiple threats.\n  Those emerging threats run the gamut from terrorism and biological \nand chemical weapons proliferation to narcotics trafficking. Each in \nits own way is as serious and in some ways more challenging a threat \nthan that presented by the former Soviet Union.\n  In attacking these targets, we will need to be focused, creative, and \nopen to new ways of conducting intelligence operations.\n  Whether the CIA successfully meets this challenge of transition \ndepends in a large measure on stable leadership, something that has \nbeen in disgraceful short supply.\n  Whether the CIA successfully meets that challenge depends in large \nmeasure on stable leadership, something that has been in disgracefully \nshort supply. Four DCI's have rotated through the Agency in the last 5 \nyears.\n  The position of Director of Central Intelligence has become \nWashington's ultimate revolving door. That's got to stop, and I hope it \nwill with this nominee.\n  Success also depends in no small part on the actions the SSCI and \nthis Senate take in regard to Mr. Lake's nomination. This nomination \nprovides us a valuable opportunity to publicly discuss the role of \nintelligence and its future in our democracy.\n  A number of important questions call out for answers.\n  With the demise of the Soviet Union, does the CIA have a mission?\n  If so, what is it? And if it has a mission, has the Agency lost its \nway in pursuing it?\n  How effectively is the community protecting the interests of America \nand its citizens?\n  Is the culture of the Directorate of Operations hobbling the Agency's \neffectiveness. If so, how do we change it?\n  Is the Agency ready to be held accountable for its actions and its \nfailures?\n  What role should human rights play in Agency operations?\n  Is the Agency keeping congressional oversight committees and Members \nof Congress appropriately informed? How effective has it been in this \nregard?\n  An elevated debate, one marked not by partisan rancor but by honesty \nand openness, can help answer these questions and contribute to \nreaching a consensus about the intelligence community's role in our \nsociety as we enter the 21st century.\n  More important, such a debate will help educate ourselves and as well \nas the voters who sent us here about the appropriate role of \nintelligence in a democracy--its pluses and its minuses.\n  Having said that, there clearly are specific issues regarding this \nnominee that deserve the committee's scrutiny.\n  I question whether Mr. Lake's opponents have focused on the right \nones. His supposed connections with the left and his views as to Alger \nHiss' guilt or innocence obviously have enthralled some.\n  But as former Director of Central Intelligence Bob Gates under \nPresident Bush wrote in the January 29 issue of the Wall Street \nJournal, these issues are ``wholly irrelevant and silly.''\n  I certainly respect the right of any Member to purse these questions \nduring upcoming hearings. Indeed, I would hope that those who find \nthese issues troubling would urge the chairman to deal with this \nnomination expeditiously so that we can conclude committee hearings and \nmove to floor debate.\n  One question, I intend to ask of Mr. Lake is whether he can provide \nthe President objective intelligence analysis after serving as his \nNational Security Adviser the past 4 years.\n  I also intend to ask him whether, having attempted to curry favor \nwith representatives of the Directorate of Operations in an effort to \nbolster his nomination, he has weakened his ability to act decivisely \nas DCI on issues of accountability and reform.\n  I also plan to ask him whether the nomination process and the \ncriticism he has been subjected to will jeopardize his effectiveness if \nhe is confirmed. Has he been so bloodied that he will be unable to \nperform effectively?\n  Finally, I plan to question him about his management philosophy and \nskills, his attitude toward secrecy, and the role of human rights in \nintelligence operations.\n  I am confident that Mr. Lake will acquit himself well before the \ncommittee. He has shown himself to be a man of great ability and \nintegrity. Moreover, as National Security Adviser he has been an avid \ncustomer of intelligence and will bring that critical perspective to \nthe job.\n  Barring any stunning revelations that may arise during the hearings--\nand I see no indication of any\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\noccuring--I will vote for Tony Lake. In my view, he will make a fine \nDirector of Central Intelligence.\n  Mr. President, the issue for today is, will we protect the \ncredibility? Will we protect the now almost 20 years of investment that \nhas been made in a credible Senate oversight of this most sensitive of \nGovernment activities, or will we allow it to be frittered away and \ndegraded by partisan wrangling? That will be the challenge that our \ncommittee will face, commencing with the hearings that will begin on \nMarch 11. I trust that the committee will meet its high standard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a January 29, 1997, \ncolumn by former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Robert \nGates, as printed in the Wall Street Journal in support of Mr. Lake's \nnomination as well as a January 26, 1997, column by Reagan \nadministration official Richard Schifter, as printed in the Washington \nTimes, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 29, 1997]\n\n                  The Case for Confirming Anthony Lake\n\n                          (By Robert M. Gates)\n\n       I am barely acquainted with Tony Lake, the president's \n     national security adviser and nominee to become CIA director. \n     But I have read about his views on foreign policy for years \n     and disagree with him on a number of important issues. I \n     think that the administration's foreign policy, which he has \n     helped shape, has been erratically interventionist, \n     excessively tactical, insufficiently supportive of resources \n     for defense and intelligence, and lacking in strategic \n     priorities, coherence and consistency. Even so, I believe Mr. \n     Lake should be confirmed.\n       An ideal nominee for CIA director would have universally \n     recognized integrity, expertise in foreign affairs (but with \n     no controversies), experience managing large enterprises, \n     savvy in intelligence operations (with no failures), \n     analytical insight (with no mistakes), political skill, the \n     confidence of and ready access to the president, and a \n     winning personality. None of the 17 men who have been CIA \n     director have had that combination of credentials. Mr. Lake \n     has three of the most important, however.\n       First, he is broadly recognized as a man of integrity and \n     principle--and as a man with the courage to stand up for what \n     he believes is right. This offers reassurance that he will be \n     independent of the White House in which he served and will be \n     directed by a moral grounding most Americans would find \n     admirable. Second, whether or not one agrees with him on the \n     issues, he is thoroughly knowledgeable about foreign affairs. \n     Moreover, as national security adviser, he is clearly \n     familiar with current intelligence operations and analysis, \n     and will be able to improve both. Third, he has the \n     confidence of the president and knows well the rest of the \n     president's national security team, two assets without which \n     a CIA director is deeply, if not fatally, weakened.\n       Mr. Lake does have deficiencies. He has no relevant \n     intelligence background, but then neither did 13 of his 17 \n     predecessors. He has not managed a large (and difficult) \n     organization, but his power of appointment (and the incumbent \n     deputy) can compensate for that. As for a winning \n     personality, I am in no position to judge.\n       There are contentious issues surrounding Mr. Lake that will \n     doubtless be important in his confirmation hearings before \n     the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Most \n     significantly, the administration's failure to tell Congress \n     about its actions in at least tacitly encouraging Iran to arm \n     Bosnia was, at minimum, a serious mistake. Mr. Lake should \n     say so, and the committee should extract appropriate pledges \n     from him about keeping Congress informed--and his willingness \n     to resign if ordered by the president to keep lawmakers in \n     the dark, a pledge I made prior to my confirmation in 1991. \n     At the same time, primary responsibility for this mistake in \n     Bosnia rests more heavily with the president and the then-\n     secretary of state, and Mr. Lake should not be disqualified \n     as CIA director simply because others senior to him are \n     beyond the reach of the Senate.\n       Other issues that have been raised in connection with his \n     nomination are not, in my view, disqualifying. He obviously \n     must satisfactorily explain his tardy disposal of stock after \n     entering public office. But the charge that Mr. Lake was once \n     equivocal as to the guilt of Alger Hiss and allegations of \n     other manifestations of ``left-leaning'' views years ago \n     strike me--someone who was attacked in my own confirmation \n     hearings as too much of a Cold War hawk--as wholly irrelevant \n     and silly in 1997, even if true.\n       The committee must satisfy itself on Iran-Bosnia and Mr. \n     Lake's commitment to congressional oversight, as well as \n     other issues, such as the stock sale. But these should be \n     resolvable. Then perhaps the hearings can serve a positive \n     function by eliciting Mr. Lake's thinking on continued reform \n     and restructuring of U.S. intelligence, his views of its \n     strengths and weaknesses and the adequacy of resources in \n     light of the tasks assigned by the president and Congress. \n     The answers to these tough questions could prove \n     illuminating, not to mention highly relevant to his \n     confirmation.\n       The bipartisan nature of the Senate intelligence committee \n     since its early days under the leadership of Daniel Inouye \n     and Barry Goldwater has been one of its greatest assets, and \n     a source of its credibility. As Congress becomes more \n     polarized and partisan, it would be a tragedy if the \n     Republican and Democratic leadership of this very sensitive \n     committee were to allow its special nonpartisan character to \n     be weakened. I was nominated to be CIA director by President \n     Reagan in 1987 and again by President Bush in 1991, and \n     despite the struggles I went through in a Democratic-\n     controlled Senate, I never felt the disputes were partisan.\n       Mr. Lake's confirmation ought not become a matter of \n     partisan conflict, an opportunity to attack the \n     administration's foreign policy. There are other, more \n     appropriate forums for that, even in Congress--the Senate's \n     Foreign Relations and Armed Services committees, and the \n     House's equivalent committees. Republicans should not use \n     hearings for CIA director--a position that should be outside \n     of politics--to make Mr. Lake the designated partisan target.\n       Tony Lake isn't perfect for CIA director, but he is a \n     capable senior official of integrity who is the choice of the \n     president to head the U.S. intelligence community. As the \n     last CIA director nominated by a Republican president and \n     confirmed by a Democratic-controlled Senate, I strongly \n     believe that hard questions should be asked of Mr. Lake, and \n     then he should be confirmed expeditiously with broad \n     bipartisan support. This would be in the best interests of \n     the country and of the intelligence community.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 26, 1997]\n\n                      Close and Confident of Lake\n\n       For the last month, a stream of unsubstantiated charges \n     have been leveled against the nomination of Anthony Lake to \n     be the next director of central intelligence. These attacks \n     are based on inaccurate information.\n       I have worked closely with Tony Lake on the staff of the \n     National Security Council for the last three-and-a-half \n     years. I came to this job as a hard-liner on U.S. foreign \n     policy, a lifelong foe of communism, and one of the initial \n     members of the Committee on the Present Danger. I found Tony \n     Lake to be a kindred spirit in his devotion to the \n     enlargement of democracy and the global promotion of American \n     interests. Whether the issue was stopping aggression in \n     Bosnia or moving ahead with the expansion of NATO, Mr. Lake's \n     leadership, vision and competence played a vital role in the \n     formulation and success of these policies.\n       Some have asserted that Mr. Lake's April 1994 decision \n     neither to approve nor to object to Iranian arms shipments to \n     Bosnia facilitated creation of a radical Islamic foothold. \n     According to the intelligence community, the Iranian military \n     and intelligence services have been present in Bosnia since \n     1992. There was no significant increase in that presence \n     after April 1994. Tony Lake, we should note, was the main \n     architect of the president's August 1995 initiative that led \n     to the Dayton agreement. That agreement banned foreign forces \n     and led the Bosnian government to sever military and \n     intelligence links with Iran as a condition for the train and \n     equip program. Hundreds of Iranian Revolutionary Guards have \n     left Bosnia, Mujahideen units have disbanded, and the \n     Bosnians are looking to the United States and moderate \n     Islamic states for security assistance. Mr. Lake, thus, \n     played a key role in the reduction of Iranian influence on \n     Bosnia, not the opposite.\n       As for the issue of congressional consultation, Mr. Lake--\n     recently praised by Senator Majority Leader Trent Lott for \n     his efforts to keep Congress informed--has said, in \n     retrospect, that informing key members of Congress on a very \n     discreet basis would have been wise. The Senate Select \n     Intelligence Committee report later confirmed there was \n     nothing illegal about this diplomatic exchange.\n       Assertions that during Mr. Lake's tenure as national \n     security adviser CIA resources were massively diverted from \n     monitoring military threats to addressing global \n     environmental issues, and that this would continue with Mr. \n     Lake as the director of intelligence, are misguided. \n     Environmental issues are important--a Chernobyl reactor \n     disaster or a major oil spill in the Persian Gulf would have \n     major economic and security implications. However, Mr. Lake \n     and the CIA have, by no means, massively diverted \n     resources to look at the environment. In fact, the \n     agency's program on the environment, initiated during the \n     Bush administration, remains very modest. Mr. Lake's \n     intelligence priorities remain those previously decided \n     upon: critical support for military operations involving \n     U.S. forces, political, economic and military intelligence \n     about countries hostile to the United States, and \n     intelligence about transnational issues--weapons of mass \n     destruction, terrorism, organized crime, drug \n     trafficking--that affect national security and the lives \n     of Americans.\n       Allegations that Mr. Lake had ties to the ``extreme Left'' \n     are ridiculous and tend to subvert fair discussion of an \n     important nomination. This, too, is not the case. An initial \n     supporter of our effort to stem communism in Vietnam, Mr. \n     Lake volunteered to serve there as a State Department \n     official. Like\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\n     many other Americans, he later changed his mind as to whether \n     our continued military interest in Vietnam served the \n     national interest. After leaving the Foreign Service, he \n     supported, in 1971-72, the centrist presidential campaign of \n     Edmund Muskie. Mr. Lake was not a member of the Center for \n     National Security Studies, and did not ``help found'' it, as \n     has recently been charged. Mr. Lake's connection with the \n     Institute of Policy Studies was that at the invitation of an \n     acquaintance he delivered a single lecture to an IPS seminar \n     on Washington's government institutions.\n       We currently live in an extraordinarily complex world, in \n     which our national security concerns are no longer focused on \n     a single country and a single movement. In this world we need \n     a director of central intelligence who is able to see the \n     whole picture and can then identify the multiple concerns \n     which require our special attention. We also need a director \n     who can incisively analyze the material presented to him by \n     his staff, can spot the flaws and insufficiencies and see to \n     it that a superior, thoroughly reliable product emerges from \n     the process. Finally, we need a director who combines \n     professional integrity with personal decency. Having seen \n     Tony Lake at work, I am confident that he meets all of these \n     criteria.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 60) to commend students who have \n     participated in the William Randolph Hearst Foundation Senate \n     Youth Program between 1962 and 1997.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, before I begin my remarks on the sense-\nof-the-Senate resolution before us today, I would like to express my \nappreciation to my colleagues, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas \nand Senator Wyden of Oregon, who joined me in introducing this measure \nearlier this week.\n  I am also very grateful for the fact that a number of Senators from \nboth sides of the aisle have subsequently expressed their support for \nthis effort by cosponsoring this resolution.\n  I would like to finally thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy, the \nchairman and ranking minority members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, who have very graciously allowed us to bring this resolution \nto the Senate floor quickly while the 1997 U.S. Senate Youth Program \ndelegates are still here in Washington visiting.\n  Senate Resolution 60 pays tribute to the 3,600 students who have \nparticipated in the U.S. Senate Youth Program over the last 35 years.\n  Under this program, which has been very successfully administered by \nthe William Randolph Hearst Foundation, two students from every State \nof the Nation, the District of Columbia, and the Department of Defense \nschools abroad are selected to spend a week right here in Washington \nlearning about their Federal Government.\n  Typically, each year the delegates meet with Senators, \nRepresentatives, Supreme Court Justices, Cabinet members, White House \npersonnel, and other officials, and have the opportunity to ask them \nquestions directly and to offer comments or concerns on current events.\n  Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of addressing the 1997 \ndelegates. It was a very enjoyable and memorable event for me for two \nreasons. First, the questions and the comments raised by the delegates \nwere both timely and insightful. Their knowledge was impressive and \ntheir enthusiasm contagious.\n  Second, I have the honor and the privilege of being the first Senate \nyouth delegate who has gone on to actually serve in the Senate. I still \nremember vividly when I visited Washington, DC, in the spring of 1971, \nmore than 25 years ago. We met with various Representatives and \nSenators, including my colleagues, Senator Robert Byrd and Senator \nStrom Thurmond, both of whom I am now privileged to serve with in this \nbody. In fact, I brought out my journal and I read my notes on both \nSenators' speeches to us, and it was a wonderful experience to reread \nand relive that week.\n  The high point of my visit, however, was the time that I was \nfortunate to spend with Maine's Senator Margaret Chase Smith. She was \nvery much an inspiration and a role model for me and countless other \ngirls growing up in Maine and young women throughout the Nation who \naspire to public service.\n  While I am the first Senate youth delegate to serve in the Senate, I \nfully expect that there will be other delegates who will serve one day \nin the House, the Senate, on the Supreme Court, in the Cabinet, and \neven as President of the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this resolution, which \nrecognizes the value of this program, salutes the individual students \nwho have participated in it, and commends the William Randolph Hearst \nFoundation for its generous sponsorship over the years.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, that the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe resolution appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 60), with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 60\n\n       Whereas the continued success of our Nation's \n     constitutional democracy is dependent upon our Nation's youth \n     striving toward higher goals;\n       Whereas a student's intelligence, determination, \n     perseverance and continued interest in the workings of our \n     Nation's political processes must be nurtured and encouraged;\n       Whereas the pursuit of higher education, and participation \n     and interest in the political processes, remain priorities of \n     young citizens around our Nation; and\n       Whereas the United States Senate and the William Randolph \n     Hearst Foundation Senate Youth Program have provided high \n     school juniors and seniors who are leaders in education and \n     student government, as well as in their communities, with the \n     opportunity to travel to their Nation's capital and witness \n     the political process, supported solely by private funds with \n     no expense to the Federal Government since the program's \n     inception in 1962: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate hereby congratulate, honor, and \n     pay tribute to the 3,600 exemplary students who have been \n     selected, on their merit, to participate in the William \n     Randolph Hearst Foundation Senate Youth Program between 1962 \n     and 1997.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, we have had a lot of focus in the media \nabout money and politics, and we are involved in a debate here on the \nRules Committee about the Government Operations Committee and the scope \nof the inquiry. I thought I would speak in this Chamber for a few \nmoments about what I think is the most important issue in American \npolitics. I guess I want to start out by saying to colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans alike, and to people in the country, if what \nhappens in the Congress is that you just have accusations going back \nand forth and the climate becomes really poisonous, I fear we will not \ndo anything right.\n  I really do believe that this is the core issue of American politics. \nI think the ethical issue of our time is the way in which money has \ncome to dominate politics. I do not think it is so much the wrongdoing \nof individual officeholders. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, I have \nsaid it in debates, I have\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\nsaid it in interviews: The whole system is inappropriate. The whole \nsystem is inappropriate. It needs to be turned not upside down --it is \nupside down right now--but right side up.\n  If we are going to talk about any kind of corruption, it is not the \nwrongdoing of individual officeholders. We are talking about something \nfar more serious. It is systemic corruption. By systemic corruption, I \nmean we now have reached the point where too few people have way too \nmuch wealth, power and say, too much access, too much say by virtue of \ntheir economic resources and their big contributions, and the vast \nmajority of people feel left out of the loop.\n  That is the fundamental issue. To most people in the country, the \nvast majority of people in the country, it is really clear:\n  First, too much money is spent in these campaigns;\n  Second, there is too much special interest access and influence as a \nresult of the money spent;\n  Third, too much time is spent by all of us--all of us--in what can be \ndescribed as a money chase, trying to raise money because you are \nrunning for office; and\n  Fourth, regular people, ordinary citizens, which I do not use in a \npejorative sense but in a positive way, do not feel they can run for \noffice.\n  Mr. President, we are talking about nothing less than the question of \nwhether or not we are going to have a real representative democracy. We \nhave now really gotten to the point --and I am not going to use all the \nterms such as ``independent expenditures'' and ``soft money'' and \n``hard money.'' Let me just make a more basic point. We are talking \nmuch more about auctions than elections. We are not even talking about \nauthentic democracy anymore. It is a minidemocracy at best. If you \nbelieve that each person should count as one and no more than one, and \nyou believe in equality and you believe in fair and open elections, \npeople in the country know this is all trumped by big money.\n  It is time for reform. It is time for reform. It is time to get big \nmoney out of politics. There are a lot of proposals. Some of us really \nbelieve you ought not to have any private money in the system and that \nultimately, absolutely is the way to go. Some focus on other \nlegislation. Some focus on soft money.\n  I just want to make this clear, that we are going to be making a huge \nmistake, all of us are going to be making a huge mistake if we do not \npass a major reform bill this Congress. We are going to make a huge \nmistake if the only thing this boils down to is just sort of piling \nacquisitions on accusations and people going after one another. If this \nbecomes a kind of slash-and-burn politics, search-and-destroy politics, \nwe are going to get absolutely nowhere.\n  I will say this. I am only speaking for myself. I do not know how the \nChair feels. Actually, I believe, even though the argument is made \noften that the problem is that those in office do not really want to \nchange the system because the system is wired toward incumbents, \nbecause we are able to raise more money than our challengers--the \nstatistics bear that out--I think it has come to the point where all of \nus should hate the system, because when you are raising money and you \nare running for office and you have to be on television and you are \ntrying to figure out how you are going to go after your opponent and \ndestroy your opponent--that is the way some people view politics; they \nshould not but they do--or you are figuring out how to raise millions \nof dollars so you do not get ripped up into shreds, the fact is even if \nyou are absolutely sure in your head and your heart that not one time \nhas the compelling need to raise money ever affected any position you \nhave ever taken on any issue, it certainly does not look that way to \nthe public.\n  I am convinced that all the good things that could happen here are \ntrumped by money in politics. I am convinced that one of the reasons we \nare not responding to the very real concerns of citizens across this \ncountry, which have to do with affordable education and good jobs and \nthe standard of living and reducing violence in communities and all the \nrest of it, is because of this influence of money in politics.\n  This is the core issue. There is too much access for the big givers \nand the heavy hitters and the well connected, and the vast majority of \npeople feel left out of the loop and they are right. What concerns me \nis I have heard some colleagues say, ``But the fact of the matter is, \nthe polls do not show this. The polls do not show that the people seem \nto consider this a burning issue.''\n  I think what is sad is that people's expectations are so low in the \ncountry right now that they are not at all sure there is anything we \nare going to do about this. But we better prove ourselves to the people \nwe are asked to represent. We better pass a reform bill. We better make \nsure that we dramatically reduce the amount of money that is spent in \nthese campaigns. We better make sure we try to lessen--if you cannot \neliminate it, at least lessen--special-interest access. We better make \nsure we do something about this constant money chase. We better make \nsure our elections do look like elections and not like auctions. We \nbetter make sure that people in the country, whether they are Democrats \nor Republicans or independents, feel like they can run for office. We \nbetter do that, because this is all about democracy.\n  We keep spending more and more money every election cycle, and \nparticipation goes down, down, down. So I am hopeful, even though this \nis a tough time in the Senate. We have major divisions. People are \ndrawing the line. It seems to be an all-out battle. By the way, I am \nall for good debate. I do not like to hate but I like debate. But I am \ntelling you, every single one of my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans alike, are making a big mistake if we do not line up behind \nmajor reform.\n  We should want to do this. If we want people to at least have more \nconfidence in the political process than they have now, if we want \npeople to begin to believe in us, if we want people to believe in the \nlegislation that we pass, which is a product of this process, then \npeople have to believe that politics in Washington, DC, is not \ndominated by big money. People have to believe the Congress belongs to \nthem, that the Capitol belongs to them, that all of us, Democrats and \nRepublicans, belong to them.\n  I know I may sound melodramatic on the floor of the Senate, \nespecially since today there is no one to debate. But I came to the \nfloor to speak because I am absolutely convinced that this is the \npriority. There is nothing that we could do that would be more \nimportant than to try to move forward on a reform agenda. I am hoping \nthat, in this Congress, we will do that.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Given \nthat the Energy and Natural Resources Committee this morning reported \nout the nomination of Federico Pena to be the new Secretary of Energy \nand that full consideration by the Senate on his nomination is likely \nto occur soon, I find it both necessary and timely to reignite today \nthe debate on our Nation's nuclear waste storage problem.\n  Since 1982, our nuclear energy ratepayers have been required to pay \nover 12 billion of their hard-earned dollars to the Federal Government. \nAnd that was in exchange for the promise to transport and store \ncommercially generated nuclear waste in a centralized Federal facility \nby January 31, 1998.\n  Unfortunately, this obligation has never been met by the DOE, which \nhas already spent over 6 billion of those ratepayer dollars, yet has \nlittle to show in exchange for that massive investment. Today, our \nratepayers continue to pay into the Nuclear Waste\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nFund, as well as for on-site storage at commercial nuclear facilities \nacross the Nation, including the one at Prairie Island in southeastern \nMinnesota.\n  So now ratepayers are being asked to pay twice for the storage of \nnuclear waste.\n  Even as 41 States wait for the Department of Energy to fulfill its \npromise to begin accepting domestic nuclear waste, the Federal \nGovernment continues to accept, transport, and store spent nuclear fuel \nfrom Federal facilities and foreign research reactors. For national \nsecurity reasons, the Federal Government is even helping to pay for an \ninterim storage facility in Russia.\n  Yet, Mr. President, despite the strides we are making toward interim \nstorage of foreign and Federal waste, the situation has grown critical \nfor our own nuclear utilities and ratepayers.\n  For example, even though the Federal courts have ruled that the DOE \nwill be liable if it does not accept commercial nuclear waste by \nJanuary 31, 1998--thereby putting taxpayers at risk for the Federal \nGovernment's inaction--the DOE has shrugged off this legal mandate, \nclaiming that it will not be able to meet the deadline. Even worse, the \nDOE has yet to recommend the specific action it would take in order to \naccept any of our commercial nuclear waste.\n  So again, it can accept foreign or Federal nuclear waste, transport \nand even pay for interim storage in Russia, but yet our Government says \nit cannot handle what it is under contract and obligation to do for our \nnuclear waste.\n  I find this very troubling, particularly for my fellow Minnesotans, \nwho stand to lose up to 30 percent of their energy resources if a \nsolution is not found soon. Mr. President, the clock is ticking.\n  In 1994, the Federal Government's failure to live up to its promise \nof accepting nuclear waste sparked a prolonged and controversial debate \nin the Minnesota State Legislature over whether to continue on-site \nstorage at Prairie Island. While the legislature eventually voted to \nextend storage capacity until 2002, it would not have been forced to do \nso had the DOE met its legal obligation to begin accepting waste from \nMinnesota.\n  At every turn, the DOE's response to this growing problem has been \none of sheer arrogance and inaction. For example, when asked by me at \nan Energy Committee hearing how the DOE expected to resolve the \nsituation facing Minnesota, DOE Undersecretary Thomas Grumbly argued \nthat the problem was a State issue, in spite of the fact that the \nFederal government signed a contractual, legally binding agreement with \nutilities and the States to accept their waste by January 31, 1998.\n  He said, take that back to the States. That is your problem, not \ntheirs.\n  In other words, now that the DOE has elected not to meet its \nresponsibility, it has simply buried its head in the sand in a brazen \nattempt to avoid accountability. Instead of taking action, the Clinton-\nGore administration is making excuses--trying once again to take a \nnational policy problem and turn it into a crassly political debate. \nUnfortunately, the losers of this cynical gamesmanship are the American \npeople.\n  Maybe that is why 46 State agencies and 36 utilities recently sued \nthe Department of Energy to stop requiring future payments into the \nNuclear Waste Fund and to escrow over $600 million in current payments. \nIf the Clinton-Gore administration does not wake up and take action, \nthis lawsuit will mark only the beginning of a costly legal process to \nforce the Federal Government to own up to its responsibilities.\n  Because obviously, if a solution is not reached now, taxpayers, \nconsumers, and those who care about the environment will be left \nstranded. That is the reality--and some of those who once argued the \nloudest against resolving this issue have come to the very same \nconclusion.\n  For example, last month, former Department of Energy Secretary Hazel \nO'Leary contradicted Vice President Gore's longstanding objection to \nmeaningful action on this issue. Her comments on the need to move \nforward with a temporary nuclear waste storage site after the \ncompletion of a viability assessment at Yucca Mountain reflected the \nnational will to resolve this issue.\n  Although I am disappointed that Mrs. O'Leary's honest assessment came \nafter her tenure as Secretary, I strongly believe the next Department \nof Energy Secretary must provide the commitment, the leadership \nnecessary to immediately resolve this critical situation.\n  Again, it is not a technical problem. It is not a problem of science. \nIt is a problem of political will to be able to make that political \ndecision within the administration to accept this responsibility and to \nprovide the answers.\n  With that in mind, I, like many of my colleagues on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, took the time to ask Secretary-designate \nPena his views on resolving this issue. Unfortunately, he failed to \ngive specific and definitive answers to our questions during his \nconfirmation hearing.\n  Because I do not believe the Senate should confirm Mr. Pena's \nnomination before we have received specific answers, I sent a letter \nasking Mr. Pena for a detailed response outlining the exact steps the \ndepartment plans to take in order to meet the January 31, 1998, \ndeadline.\n  Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Pena that failed to \narticulate any specific solution. So in response, I again sent him \nanother letter reiterating my question, and I hope to hear back from \nhim today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that our correspondence be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 4, 1997.\n     Mr. Federico Pena,\n     Secretary-designate, Department of Energy, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Pena: As the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \n     Committee further deliberates on your nomination as Secretary \n     of the Department of Energy (DOE), I'm writing to solicit \n     your views on recent comments made concerning our nation's \n     failed commercial nuclear waste disposal program.\n       As you know, the DOE has announced that it will be unable \n     to meet its legal deadline of January 31, 1998 to begin \n     accepting commercial nuclear waste despite a mandate by a \n     federal court and the collection of over $12 billion in \n     ratepayer's funds. As a result of this failure, the Court of \n     Appeals will decide the appropriate amount of liability owed \n     by the DOE to certain utilities, possibly putting taxpayers \n     at risk because of the Department's lack of measurable \n     action. Meanwhile, the federal government continues to \n     collect and transport foreign-generated spent fuel for \n     interim storage without any apparent technical or \n     environmental risks.\n       In light of these activities, it was no surprise that \n     former DOE Secretary Hazel O'Leary recently contradicted the \n     Clinton Administration's longstanding objection to resolving \n     the centralized interim-storage impasse for our ratepayers \n     and, ultimately, our taxpayers. Her comments on the need to \n     move forward with a temporary waste storage site upon \n     completion of the viability assessment at Yucca Mountain \n     reflect the bipartisan, common-sense reforms contained in S. \n     104, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997. Unfortunately, the \n     Clinton Administration has ignored this reality by failing to \n     become a constructive player in this process.\n       Although I am disappointed that Mrs. O'Leary's comments \n     came after her tenure as Secretary, I applaud her courage in \n     expressing her views honestly and thoroughly. I strongly \n     believe that the next DOE Secretary must provide the \n     committed leadership necessary to resolve this critical \n     situation while in office. With this in mind, I want to know \n     your specific thoughts on Mrs. O'Leary's comments that the \n     DOE should move forward on a temporary nuclear waste storage \n     site next year at Yucca Mountain if a viability assessment is \n     completed at the permanent site. If you disagree with Mrs. \n     O'Leary, I want to know what specific alternatives you would \n     propose to meet the federal government's legal obligation to \n     accept nuclear waste by January 31, 1998.\n       For too long, our nation's ratepayers and taxpayers have \n     been held hostage to what has become a political debate. They \n     deserve better and, more importantly, deserve an immediate \n     solution to this issue. For that reason, I expect a specific, \n     constructive response to my questions before the Senate votes \n     to confirm your nomination.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 5, 1997.\n     Hon. Rod Grams,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grams: Thank you for your letter of March 4, \n     1997 concerning the Department of Energy's civilian nuclear \n     waste disposal program and the comments made recently by \n     former Secretary Hazel O'Leary. I have not spoken with \n     Secretary O'Leary about her remarks and, therefore, am not in \n     a position to comment on them.\n       As I stated when I appeared before the Committee on Energy \n     and Natural Resources, I am committed to working with the\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\n     Committee and the Congress toward resolving the complex and \n     important issue of nuclear waste storage and disposal in a \n     timely and sensible manner, consistent with the President's \n     policy, which is based upon sound science and the protection \n     of public health, safety, and the environment.\n       I am very cognizant of the Department's contractual \n     obligation with the utilities concerning the disposal of \n     commercial spent fuel, and, after confirmation, I also expect \n     to meet with representatives of the nuclear industry and \n     other stakeholders to discuss the Department's response to \n     the recent court decision and the consequences of the delay \n     in meeting that contractual obligation.\n       As Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles emphasized in his February \n     27 letter to Chairman Murkowski, the Administration believes \n     that the Federal government's long-standing commitment to \n     permanent, geologic disposal should remain the basic goal of \n     high-level radioactive waste policy. Accordingly, the \n     Administration believes that a decision on the siting of an \n     interim storage facility should be based on objective, \n     science-based criteria and should be informed by the \n     viability assessment of Yucca Mountain, expected in 1998. \n     Therefore, as the President has stated, he would veto any \n     legislation that would designate an interim storage facility \n     at a specific site before the viability of the Yucca Mountain \n     site has been determined.\n       In conclusion, I want to strongly emphasize again that I am \n     committed to working with you and other members of the \n     Committee and the Congress on these difficult issues.\n           Sincerely,\n     Federico Pena.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1997.\n     Mr. Federico Pena,\n     Secretary-designate, U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Pena: I received your letter, dated today, in \n     response to my most recent questions on our nation's nuclear \n     waste policy. Although I appreciate the timeliness of your \n     response, I am still concerned about the absence of specific \n     proposals from you on how best to resolve this important \n     issue.\n       In your letter, you wrote that the Clinton Administration \n     ``believes that a decision on the siting of a storage \n     facility should be based on objective, science-based criteria \n     and should be informed by the viability assessment of Yucca \n     Mountain, expected in 1998.'' Frankly, this response states \n     nothing more than the position you have taken in the past, \n     leaving questions about whether the viability study can be \n     completed in time for the DOE to realistically accept waste \n     by the legal deadline of January 31, 1998 and what can be \n     done to meet the deadline if the permanent site at Yucca \n     Mountain is not determined to be viable.\n       I certainly hope you can understand my concerns, given that \n     you yourself have publicly admitted that following this track \n     would make it impossible for the DOE to meet the January 31, \n     1998 deadline.\n       More importantly, you did not answer my central question \n     regarding what specific, constructive alternatives you would \n     propose in order for the DOE to begin accepting waste from \n     states by January 31, 1998, as outlined in statute and \n     ordered by the courts.\n       With that in mind, I would again request a specific \n     response from you--prior to the Senate vote on your \n     confirmation--to the following question: given that the \n     current Administration position would result in the failure \n     of the DOE to accept waste from states by January 31, 1998, \n     what specific, constructive alternatives would you propose to \n     guarantee that the DOE will meet this legal, court-imposed \n     deadline?\n       I look forward to your response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Rod Grams,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Today, when the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \ntook up Mr. Pena's nomination, I voted ``present,'' as I had announced \nI would several weeks ago.\n  As the author of legislation to eliminate the Department of Energy--\nlegislation prompted, in part, by the nuclear waste fiasco--I had \ndecided that I could not in good conscience vote for Mr. Pena's \nnomination to head up a department that should not continue to exist.\n  Yet, at the same time, I did not want to cast a vote that would be \nmisinterpreted as a vote against Mr. Pena personally.\n  Since then, I have grown increasingly troubled, however, for the \nreasons that I have outlined here today, by Mr. Pena's inability to \nprovide specific answers about how he and the Clinton-Gore \nadministration intend to resolve our Nation's nuclear waste storage \nproblem.\n  Again, he has to get these answers from the administration. And it is \nClinton-Gore that have to make these decisions.\n  We in the Senate have our own proposal, and that is our bill S. 104. \nThat is the Murkowski-Craig-Grams bill, which won the support of 63 \nSenators last year.\n  As a Senator representing Minnesota ratepayers who already have paid \nover $250 million in exchange for no tangible benefit, representing \ntaxpayers who may be held financially liable for the Federal \nGovernment's failure to act, and representing citizens concerned about \nprotecting our environment, I believe that the Senate must not rush \nahead in confirming Mr. Pena's nomination before we receive from him a \nspecific and constructive response to our questions.\n  Now, while I hold out hope that we will receive such answers from Mr. \nPena in the immediate future, I am willing to work with my colleagues \nin ensuring that a final vote is not taken before a specific, \nconstructive response is given. Accordingly, I would object to any \nunanimous-consent agreement to bring up Mr. Pena's nomination for a \nvote at this time.\n  The Senate cannot simply allow itself to be lulled by vague promises \nto work together on this issue. Fifteen years of unfulfilled promises \nshould have taught us that lesson.\n  Again, with the January 31, 1998, deadline fast approaching, we have \nour own responsibility to the American people to ensure that the \nobligations of the Federal Government are satisfied. We owe them \nnothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2014-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2016]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DR.

Mr. President, I rise today and ask my colleagues to \njoin me in extending condolences to the family and loved ones of Dr. \nPierce Blitch, Jr., of Augusta, GA, who passed away on Wednesday, \nFebruary 12, 1997. Dr. Blitch leaves a proud and indelible legacy for \nhis family, profession, and community. He spent his professional and \npersonal life dedicated to the field of medicine. After completing \nservice to his country in the Navy during World War II, he graduated \nfrom the Medical College of Georgia in 1952. Dr. Blitch embarked on his \nmedical career with an internship at University Hospital and a \ncardiology fellowship at Massachusettes General Hospital in Boston. He \nwas active on staff at University Hospital and St. Joseph Hospital from \n1956 until 1996. At University Hospital he served as a member of the \nexecutive committee and chief of staff and chairman of the department \nof medicine from 1976 until 1981. Dr. Blitch then went on to teach at \nthe Medical College of Georgia as an instructor in the department of \nmedicine in 1956, clinical professor of medicine in 1976 and ultimately \nawarded professor emeritus of medicine in 1992. He was truly a public \nservant and devoted leader of his field. He will remain a role model to \nthe medical community for generations to come. I am proud of this \nfellow Georgian, his achievements and his contributions to our State \nand country. His passing is a great loss for the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2016-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2016-S2017]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO FDA COMMISSIONER DAVID KESSLER\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute \nto an outstanding public servant who is leaving office as Commissioner \nof Food and Drugs, Food and Drug Administration, Dr. David Kessler. In \n1991, the Food and Drug Administration was at one of the lowest points \nin its history. The agency was recovering from the generic drug \nscandal. It was not consistently enforcing the law. Patients felt they \nwere not receiving the therapies they needed.\n  The appointment of David Kessler as commissioner changed all that. He \nlaunched an extraordinary period of reform and improvement in the \nagency's effectiveness. He began with the obvious--enforcing the law.\n  He initiated many other important reforms. He has worked tirelessly \nto provide improved treatments for cancer and AIDS, and to assure that \nlife-saving drugs move quickly from the laboratory to the marketplace. \nBecause of his leadership, the information supplied with prescription \nand over-the-counter drugs will soon be more user-friendly. He led the \nadministration's initiative to reduce teenage smoking.\n  He led the way to many other impressive achievements. The United \nStates is now as fast or faster than any other country in the world in \ngetting new drugs to patients. David Kessler achieved this result \nwithout sacrificing the FDA's high standards for safety and \neffectiveness.\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\n  For David Kessler, the first priority was always the public health. \nHe used his brilliant intellect, his boundless energy, and his \nunparalleled commitment to serve that great goal. He represents the \nbest in public service. It has been a great privilege to work with him, \nand I wish him well in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak about a series of \ninitiatives that I have introduced to try to address what I see as the \nmajor public policy concerns as we move into the next century, on the \nfiscal side of the ledger, that affect people in their lives.\n  As we move out of the 20th century, we have seen a period where, \ncertainly throughout most of the 20th century, there was a sense that, \nthrough a centralized Government, through an economy dominated by a \nGovernment, you could manage the lives and affairs of individuals and \nimprove their lifestyle. Of course, the most exaggerated example of \nthis was communism and the Russian revolution, which began the major \nCommunist state of this century or any time. And it did not work. One \nof the great truths of the 20th century, of which there have been about \nthree, one of the great truths is that communism--the concept that the \nstate can manage the marketplace and make people better off by \nrequiring that people function under a top-down system where their \nlives and their style of economic production is controlled by a central \nmechanism--simply does not function effectively. Instead of producing \nprosperity, it produced despair. Instead of producing freedom, it \nproduced totalitarianism.\n  So, one of the great truths that has come out of this century is that \ncapitalism works, that the free market works, that giving the \nindividual the incentive to be productive, by allowing the individual \nto retain a large amount of the product of their work, is something \nthat produces prosperity for the individual and, as a result, produces \nprosperity for society. And a prosperous society is a freer society, we \nhave also learned that. That is the second truth.\n  Yet, our Government continues to function, even here in the United \nStates, with a hybrid of the theory that a centralized decisionmaking \nprocess can handle major social and economic issues more effectively \nthan the marketplace can handle them or the individual can handle them. \nIn the 1930's and 1940's, we as a nation, our intellectual community, \nespecially the Northeastern intellectual community, was caught up in \nthe concept that you could manage almost every major social and \neconomic problem from the top down. We were caught up in the concept \nthat a few good minds put together in a room, thinking, could resolve \nissues of major concern for the society at large, especially fiscal \nissues.\n  This led to a centralization of decisionmaking here in Washington \nthroughout the 1950's, 1960's and 1970's, which reached its peak in the \nearly 1970's, and gained momentum from that peak throughout the 1970's \nuntil the arrival of Ronald Reagan, who said, ``Let's stop and think a \nminute as to what we have done here and whether it has been \nsuccessful.''\n  The conclusion was that many of the decisions to centralize the \nprocess of policymaking in the hands of a few here in Washington simply \nwas not working, that it was not producing a resolution to the problems \nthat were at the core of our society, and especially it was not helping \nthe prosperity of the Nation and individuals who lived in the Nation in \nmany ways. So, we have, as we move toward the end of this century, come \nto the conclusion that maybe a centralized Federal Government is not \nall that effective in solving all of our problems; maybe we should slow \nthe rate of growth of this Government and return authority to the \npeople and to the States. And that, really, is what the Republican \nrevolution has been about.\n  If we take that as true, and I do happen to believe that is one of \nthe things that has been proven by time, now--it is not a question of \nphilosophy or theory any longer, it is a time-tested, proven event--\nthen we still have some major issues to address, because some of the \nmost significant social/fiscal issues which we have as a country today \nare still being driven in their policies as to how they are resolved by \nthese concepts which came out of the thirties and the forties and the \nfifties of centralizing the decision in Washington and making the \nprocess of addressing those decisions a Washington-driven one.\n\n  The three issues that are at the core of this, the three concerns \nthat we as a society must have, from a fiscal policy standpoint--I am \nnot talking about social policy; there are a whole set of other issues \ndealing with social policy--but from a fiscal policy standpoint of how \nGovernment deals with major issues, the three core concerns which we \nmust have, as we head into the next century, are, one, how do we deal \nwith Social Security; two, how do we deal with Medicare, which is a \nhealth care component for our senior citizens, and Medicaid; and three, \nour tax laws, how do we structure our taxes?\n  All three of those issues, all three of those functions of Government \nwhich deal with the broad spectrum of the quality of life of a vast \nmajority of Americans, are now dominated by a philosophy which grew out \nof the thirties, which was that a centralized, Government-\ndecisionmaking process can better manage these systems than a \ndecentralized, marketplace-driven approach.\n  As a result, we have some chaos headed our way. We know that, under \nthe present Social Security system, as a function of its present rate \nof return on investment and as a function of demographics, the system \ngoes broke, taking the country with it, starting in about the year \n2010. It goes broke in about the year 2020, but gets into what one \nmight call a fiscal spiral beginning about the year 2017 which is not \nreversible.\n  This is driven by the fact that returns on investment in Social \nSecurity dollars put into the trust fund have been extraordinarily low. \nThey are basically a rate of return set by the Federal Government on \nspecial bonds given to the Social Security fund, which is where the \nGovernment borrows.\n  Second, we have a population shift in this country, which is a \nfunction of the postwar, baby-boom generation, where we now have 3\\1/2\\ \npeople paying into the system for every 1 person taking out, and in the \nyear 2012, we will have 2 people paying into the system for every 1 \nperson taking out, and this cannot support the present benefit \nstructure when you have such a change.\n  In addition, there is the fact that people are living longer. When \nSocial Security was first created, people lived to be 61. The time was \nset at 65. That was Franklin Roosevelt's choice. He was no slouch and \nunderstood actuarial tables. Today, people live to be, on the average, \nmale, 72, female 78, and it is going up.\n  So we have a Social Security system which we know is headed toward \nbankruptcy due to demographics and due to the fact there is no \nprefunded system. It is a pay-as-you-go system with a very low rate of \nreturn on the investment.\n  Then we have the Medicare system, which is going broke, managed by \nthe Federal Government. Basically, it is a Federal Government program, \nsingle manager, single opportunity for seniors. They have to buy fee-\nfor-service delivery. They have to buy a certain set of benefit \nstructures. That system is going to go broke in the year 2001 at the \nlatest; probably in the year 2000, only 3 years from now.\n  It is going to go broke because of the fact that it is a system which \nis using\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\na 1960's model of health care delivery in the 1990's. It is a system \nwhich still relies on fee for service when, in fact, we know that in \nthe marketplace today, very few people use fee-for-service health care. \nMost people choose some sort of fixed-cost, prepaid health care plan, \nwhether it is a HMO, PPO, PSO, or whatever. They choose some sort of \nalternative rather than going out to a doctor on a cost-plus basis who \nrefers you to another doctor on a cost-plus basis, then refers you to \nanother doctor, which is what the present system does.\n  It is a classic program which was designed by Government bureaucrats \nin the 1960's which was probably outdated even then, but which has \nclearly not been updated for the 1990's and is going to go broke in the \nyear 2000 because it is not structured for these times. That is the \nsecond system which represents a major issue of fiscal policy.\n  Between those two, Medicare and Social Security, they will be \naccounting, between them, for almost 50 percent of the Federal budget \nby the year 2000, and by the year 2017, if you throw in interest on the \nFederal debt, they will be counting for all the revenues of the Federal \nGovernment. That is their size and their impact under their present \nstructure.\n  The third issue, of course, is our tax laws. Our tax laws are, again, \na centralized decisionmaking process where we in Washington, a group of \nelite in the Government, choose winners and losers in the marketplace. \nWe choose that this type of market activity will be a benefit and that \ntype of market activity will be penalized because, for some reason, we \nthink we can think better than the marketplace and individuals can \nthink on how they should invest their money, and tax laws are \nstructured to be a top-down, centralized, essentially Government-driven \nexercise in managing the marketplace through the Government. Of course, \nnothing affects the prosperity of a country more than the level of \ntaxation and the manner in which you tax.\n\n  So my representation is this. I have put together a package of bills \nwhich I call the American productivity renewal package, which addresses \nthese three core issues of fiscal policy from a marketplace approach, \ninstead of using the dynamics which have dominated these policies since \nthe thirties, which is a Government-driven approach and which is a \ncentralized-planning approach. Instead of using that approach, which \nhas clearly failed and which is predicted to be a catastrophic failure \nas we move into the next century, I am acknowledging the fact, the \ntruism of the 20th century, which is that the marketplace, not the \nGovernment, is the primary provider of prosperity within a society.\n  These three proposals which I put forward involve, first, in the \nSocial Security area, that we recognize that you cannot have a pay-as-\nyou-go system with an unfunded liability of $3 to $4 trillion and an \naging population that is exceeding the ability of the working \npopulation to pay for it and expect that system to survive. So what we \nneed to do is to create a better return for those younger people who \nare now paying into the system on their savings. We need to be able to \nsay to the working American who is under the age of 45, ``In order for \nyou to get a decent Social Security retirement, we are going to have to \nhave you earn more money on the dollars that you pay into Social \nSecurity and, more important, we are going to have to give you the \nability to identify those dollars to yourself.''\n  Today under Social Security, if you pay a dollar in, the dollar goes \nout. You have no account. There is no savings account which says, ``Bob \nSmith'' or ``Mary Jones'' on it. It is basically a dollar in, dollar \nout, and, as a result, you have this huge unfunded liability.\n  We need to prefund that liability, No. 1, so that people can have \ntheir own savings account designated to themselves. And, second, we \nneed to allow people to get a better return than what is presently \noccurring under the present system, which is about a 3 percent rate of \nreturn, which is not inflation adjusted, so if inflation is more than 3 \npercent, it is no return at all. We need to allow people to get a \nbetter rate of return.\n  What my proposal does, in the Social Security area it says today \nSocial Security is running a surplus. It is running about a $29 billion \nactual surplus. It actually has about a $70 billion surplus, but half \nof that is interest which the Federal Government is paying on debt, so \nit is, basically, paying interest to itself. But there is actually \nabout a $29 billion real surplus in Social Security, which represents \nabout 1 percent of the 7.5 percent payroll tax people pay.\n\n  So what my proposal says is that, rather than paying a 7.5-percent \npayroll tax, people will only have to pay a 6.5-percent payroll tax. \nThey will get that percentage back, that percent difference back. They \nwill have the right to take that percentage difference and invest it in \na savings account or some other vehicle that allows them to produce \nincome for their retirement.\n  It will have to be a retirement account, like an IRA. And the \npractical implications of that are two: No. 1, people will start to \ngenerate a nest egg for retirement that will be real, that they will be \nable to look at every year when they get their statement; it will be \nthere, and it will be able to generate a better return than 3 percent. \nAnd, No. 2, it has no impact on present-day Social Security recipients \nor people who would be receiving Social Security who are over the age \nof 45, because we are now running a surplus and we could pay the cost \nof their Social Security benefits without impacting them with this type \nof private account. It is using the marketplace and recognizing that \nthe marketplace must be used to prefund the liability of Social \nSecurity.\n  In the area of Medicare, this package of bills does something called \nchoice, where essentially we say to the senior citizen, rather than \nhaving a program where the Government tells you who insures you, we \nwill give you a program where, like a Member of Congress or a Federal \nemployee, you can go out and choose who would insure you. They would \nhave to give you a certain set of benefits and the benefits will have \nto at least equal what you are presently getting under Medicare, but \nyou will be able to choose the benefit package you feel best meets your \nneeds--you, the senior citizen. You will not be limited to one choice \nor, at most, two choices, which, at present, the present Medicare \nProgram has.\n  Equally important, what we are going to say to the senior citizen is, \ntoday it costs, for example, $4,800 for a senior to be on Medicare. To \nthe extent that a senior can go out and find a health care plan which \ngives the basic benefits of Medicare, maybe even more benefits, but \ngives it to them for less than $4,800--say, $4,500--we will let the \nsenior keep the difference, or at least 75 percent of it, that $300 \nbetween $4,800 and $4,500.\n  What does this do? It creates three marketplace forces which will \nlead to making the Medicare system more solvent. No. 1, it means the \nsenior becomes a cost-incentive buyer of health care. They think about \nwhere they are going to buy their health care. Granted, people who are \nalready in the system who are in their late 70's or 80's probably are \nnot going to change. But you have a whole group of seniors coming into \nthe system who have been used to looking at a variety of health care \noptions, so they will be comfortable doing this. But getting that 75 \npercent back of your savings makes them cost-incentive buyers.\n  No. 2, it will create a marketplace which will compete for the \nseniors' dollars. Because, believe me, there are a lot of health care \nproviders who deliver high-quality health care who would be very \nexcited about the chance to buy into this.\n  And, No. 3, it gives the Federal Government a predictable rate of \ngrowth as to how much health care is going to increase in Medicare \naccounts. And we, in order to make the trust funds solvent, do not need \nto cut Medicare. All we need to do is slow its rate of growth to about \n7 percent, 6.5 percent--what is now a 10-percent rate of growth. That \nrate of growth, by the way, is still twice the rate of inflation and a \nmultiple of 5, possibly, the rate of health care inflation.\n  So this creates a marketplace atmosphere around which Medicare would \ncompete and around which seniors could participate in their health care \nsystem and which would control costs and which would give seniors more \nchoices than they have today, more options in health care than they \nhave\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\ntoday. It recognizes the fact that, you know, a 1960 system, where the \nFederal Government basically picks who you can have health care with, \nsimply does not work. You have to use the marketplace.\n  The third element of this American productivity renewal package is to \nlook at the tax laws and acknowledge the fact that the tax laws are \narbitrary. They are as arbitrary as some bureaucrat in Washington could \npossibly make them, or some Member of Congress could possibly make \nthem. Why should somebody be a winner and why should somebody else be a \nloser under the tax laws? Simply because a Member of Congress or \nsomebody at Treasury decided unilaterally to affect the marketplace by \nmaking the decision that this person will be a loser and this person \nwill be a winner, that is not right. That perverts the flow of capital; \nit perverts investment; it perverts the manner in which people go out \nand make decisions in the marketplace. It causes an inefficient use of \ndollars that are used to create capital and create savings.\n  So we need a flatter system. We need a system that eliminates the \nvast majority of the deductions and says to the taxpayer, ``You can \nfill your form out on one page, one postcard, and in doing that, we \nwon't control how you make decisions with your money. We'll take your \ntaxes still, but we won't control whether or not you invest in this \nitem or that item. That is simply a decision as to whether or not \nyou're going to get better or worse tax treatment.'' And, thus, capital \nwill flow much more efficiently to those items which are most \nproductive and those items which will create the most prosperity, \nbecause that is the way a capitalist system works and a marketplace \nsystem works.\n\n  So by addressing these three core issues of fiscal policy from a \nmarketplace approach as versus from a centralized planning approach, \nwhich is what has been done for the last half century, we can, I \nbelieve, ready ourselves for the next century, make this country more \ncompetitive, and, most importantly, put the country in a position where \nour children will be assured that we are going to be a fiscally solvent \nplace and a prosperous place for them to raise their children, rather \nthan a place subject to the vagaries of a huge Government debt and \ninflation that would cause a bankruptcy of the Social Security system.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your time.

Mr. President, in December, the Department of Health \nreleased annual figures on teenage drug use. As in the preceding 3 \nyears, what the numbers showed was a continuing, alarming increase in \nteenage drug use. The number of eighth graders using any illicit drug \nin the year before the survey has almost doubled since 1991, from 11 to \n21 percent. The proportion of increased use among 10th graders has \nrisen by almost two-thirds, from 20 to 33 percent. It has risen by \nalmost 50 percent among seniors in high school, from 27 to 39 percent. \nStop for a minute and think about the reality behind the numbers.\n  One in every five 13 year olds has used an illicit drug in the last \nyear. One in every three 15 year olds and close to two of every five \nseniors have used drugs. Marijuana use is leading the way. Regular use \nof marijuana by kids is on the rise. Nearly 1 in every 20 seniors now \nuses marijuana daily. We know from bitter experience, that marijuana \nuse, especially regular use, increases dramatically the likelihood of \nfurther, more serious drug use. We know only too well that such use \nleads to dramatic increases in addiction, violent crime, treatment \ndependency, and a cycle of hurt that can endure for years.\n  Moreover, the recent survey reveals that teenage attitudes about the \ndangers of drug use are also changing--for the worse. An increasing \nnumber of young people at younger ages no longer see drug use as \ndangerous.\n  Just this past Tuesday, the Partnership for a Drug Free America \nreleased information that showed that kids at younger ages, including \nkids in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades, are starting to try drugs.\n  We have not seen increases in use or changes in beliefs about the \ndangers of use like this since the late 1960's and 1970's. Those of us \nwho are adults today know what that increase in use and changes in \nattitudes did to this country. We are still living with the \nconsequences of social attitudes that legitimized drug use. We are \nstill paying the costs to treat the addicts that began as teenage users \nthen.\n  Let's remind ourselves of a simple truth. The most likely users of \ndrugs are kids. Not adults. Not grown men and women. Not our peers and \nfriends and colleagues. Not our business partners or professional \nassociates. Kids. It begins with kids. Most addicts today began as \nteenagers. Most addicts tomorrow will begin as teenagers or younger. \nAnd whom do the pushers of drugs target? Kids. Whom do the purveyors of \ndrug messages in our movies and popular music target? Kids.\n  You do not have to go very far to discover why. Young people are more \nvulnerable to messages that would have them test limits. They are less \naware of long-term consequences for present acts. They are more easily \ninfluenced by peers and fashions. It is our kids that are most at risk \nfor messages about drug use. It is in order to protect kids that we \ntake steps to control drugs in our society. Even the majority of the \nmost ardent legalization advocates do not advocate drug use by kids. \nMost of them draw the line at that. Most.\n  But our problem lies in this. We cannot be halfhearted and ambivalent \nin our counterdrug messages if we are to tell our kids not to use \ndrugs. We cannot, on the one hand, make drugs readily available and \ncondone their use by law and custom and keep them from our kids. We \nhave ample evidence of this in legal drugs, in the problems of teenage \nuse of alcohol and tobacco.\n  But I am talking about substances that are far worse and more \ndangerous. We cannot afford to make these drugs part of our daily \nlives. The public is aware of that. They oppose it. But what we see is \na growing effort by a few to get around that opposition. Ultimately \nthey are not likely to succeed. But they can and have so muddled the \npublic message as to send mixed signals to the very people we want to \nprotect. Kids.\n  From music to videos to movies and political campaigns, we are seeing \nefforts once again to glamorize drugs. We are seeing opinion leaders \nand members of our cultural elite portray drug use as simply a personal \nchoice that is harmless and benign. Many of these individuals act as if \nthe only issue is for responsible adults to decide for themselves. They \nspeak as if it is only adults that we need to think about. This, \nhowever, is not in fact the case.\n  If you do not believe this, talk to parents. Talk to teachers. Talk \nto the health and law enforcement professionals who daily see the \nconsequences. Most important, listen to what kids are telling us about \nwhat is happening in their schools. To their friends.\n  Like other Members here, I receive mail from many people. Among them \nare our young people. Their letters are full of concern and hope. One \nof the concerns is about drugs in school. Thus Byron, 14 years old, \nwrites, ``As I have\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\ngrown up, I have begun to notice more and more people I know using \nlegal and illegal drugs. Never before did I even know `Meth' existed. \nBut now, my school feels there is a need to take courses about it. I \nagree with you that drug use should stop, and fast.'' Or Christina, 12, \nwho writes about her concern for what's being done to stop underage \ndrug use. Or Heath, a senior, concerned about growing use in junior \nhigh and elementary schools. Or Jennie, a junior, who has seen peers \nusing PCP and crack or acid. Or the many others who have written \nconfused about what they should think or what our policy is.\n  It is to this and following generations that we are responsible for \nand to. They look to us for guidance. They rely on us to protect them \nand their futures. That is what is at issue here. The efforts that we \nundertake to keep our society drug free are the things that we do to \nprotect our kids. We do this because it is the responsible thing to do. \nWe do this because no sane or civilized society can long endure that \nfails its children.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this past Thursday the Senate Commerce \nCommittee held a hearing on the current television rating system. I \nwant to commend Senator McCain for calling that hearing. It was very \ninstructional for all of us. What was apparent from that hearing is the \nnear universal dissatisfaction with the current Hollywood rating \nsystem, the need for immediate change, the utter failure of the \nindustry to understand what parents want in a rating system, and the \nbasic\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nresponsibility that goes with using publicly owned broadcast spectrum.\n  Mr. President, we are beyond debate regarding the influence of \ntelevision programming on children, particularly the most vulnerable of \nour children, growing up in single-parent homes or homes where the \ndemand of work keep parents away and children unsupervised for long \nhours. This is, unfortunately, an increasing norm in our society.\n  It was a combination of these facts and the increasingly violent and \nexplicit nature of television programming that produced the ``V'' chip \nlegislation that passed last year and the demand for ratings that \nempower parents with content information so that they can exercise \ncontrol over the type of television programming invading their \nhouseholds and their children's minds that they believe is \ninappropriate.\n  I call attention to the 1995 study of children age 10 to 16 conducted \nby the Los Angeles polling firm of Fairbank, Maslin, Maulin & \nAssociates. In that poll, one-third of the children stated they would \nlike to try what they see others doing on television; two-thirds stated \nthat their peers are influenced by what they see on TV; 65 percent said \nprogramming like the Simpsons encouraged them to disrespect their \nparents; and an alarming 62 percent said that sex portrayed on \ntelevision influences kids to have sex when they are too young. These \nare the results of the study of children 10 to 16. These are their \nresponses to the questions that were asked by the poll.\n  Upon hearing the results of this poll, entertainer Steve Allen told \neditorialist Cal Thomas, ``My first reaction is that we should take \nthis information and beat (network TV executives) over the head with \nit.'' I think some of last week's hearing, for those who tuned in and \nthose who were there, may have had the same effect, because there was \nuniversal, near universal, dissatisfaction with the efforts, lack of \neffort, made by the broadcasters, Hollywood producers and others to \naddress some of these fundamental questions. That was a bipartisan \nresponse not confined to any one particular party.\n  Unfortunately, the system offered by the television industry to \naddress this is critically flawed. There are two fatal problems with \nthe system. First is the fact that the system does not provide program-\nspecific, content-based information. This is the critical point.\n  The Hollywood ratings system adopted by the television industry \nessentially hides the true content of programs behind a generic rating \nthat suggests to parents what may be in a program--I say what ``may \nbe'' in a program, not what actually is in a program. Take the TV \n``PG'' rating, which 61 percent of current television programs receive. \nIn a 52-word explanation of this rating, it is stated: ``This program \nmay contain infrequent coarse language, limited violence, some \nsuggestive dialog and situations.''\n  Mr. President, I suggest that telling a parent what a program ``may'' \ninclude does not tell them very much. I ask, what would be so \ndifficult, what is so hard about simply substituting the word ``does'' \nfor the word ``may.'' The program ``does'' contain infrequent coarse \nlanguage. The program ``does'' contain limited violence. This program \n``does'' contain some suggestive dialog and situations. In addition, \nwhy not provide parents with an audible explanation of content just \nprior to airing the programming and stating the information clearly and \nprominently on the screen.\n\n  The second fatal flaw in the current system proposed by Hollywood and \nadopted by the broadcasters is there is no standard format for how \nratings are arrived at. In other words, each station or channel uses \ntheir own methods and priorities in assigning ratings. Fox uses one \nmethod, NBC another and so on. What is recommended as a standardized \nsystem to parents is, in fact, completely unique from station to \nstation, channel to channel. In other words, it a rating in search of a \nmeaning.\n  The Hollywood system designed by the Motion Producers Association \nhead Jack Valenti was created to avoid giving parents information on \nthe content of programs. I do not think you can come to any other \nconclusion. It is so confusing, it is so imprecise, I think you have to \nconclude that it was designed not to give specific information. Why? \nWell, clearly, I think they were concerned about advertisers not \nwanting to advertise on programs that included offensive language. \nUltimately, it is the parents who turn off the sets, or the sets that \nare turned off because of the contents of programs, that will determine \nwhere those advertising dollars flow.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to make sure that we all understand that \nwe cannot and we should not be censors, but that our society depends on \ninformed choices. We need to provide informed information and informed \nchoices for parents. To do that requires information which the current \nHollywood-Valenti rating system refuses to give.\n  It had been my hope that the television industry would be responsive \nto the public outcry against their age-based rating system. Polls \nconducted in response to the industry proposal by the PTA/Institute for \nMental Health Initiatives demonstrated that 80 percent of parents \ndesire a content-based system and a Media Study Center poll found \nsimilar results. Ask any parent, ask any parent what they need in order \nto make a determination on what they think their children should watch, \nand they say tell us what is in it. Do not give us some rating scheme \nwhere we do not know what it relates to, that is not standardized, that \nchanges from station to station. Just tell us what is there.\n  Unfortunately, the industry has not simply ignored the American \npublic; it has defied them. Mr. Valenti, the architect and the \ncheerleader for the current system, claims the system must be simple so \nthat parents can understand it. Must be simple? Parents can understand \nit? The TV-Y rating requires a 47-word explanation; TV-Y7 requires 73 \nwords to explain what it means; TV-14, 61 words. All of these ratings \nexplanations are riddled with ambiguity. The only thing easy to \nunderstand about these ratings is who came up with them and why.\n  The system is not profamily, it is pro-Hollywood. It is designed to \nprotect the Hollywood production houses. It is designed to protect \nadvertisers who, confronted with content-specific ratings, would shun \nprograms that include explicit material.\n  Now, supposedly there was some miraculous coming together of \ntelevision executives and Hollywood for a commonsense rating of \nprograms. Well, I think there has been some confusion here in the \nstatement that they have refused to change, regardless of what the \npublic wants. Now, thankfully, under the pressure of the congressional \ninvestigation, the congressional hearing, and the outpouring of outrage \nand frustration and dissatisfaction and disgust with the current \nsystem, there have been expressions that, yes, the industry is willing \nto take another look at this. I hope they not only take another look, \nbut that they will do it quickly and do it effectively, because the \nindustry doesn't own the broadcast spectrum, the public owns the \nbroadcast spectrum. And because the public owns the spectrum, I think \nit is reasonable to ask that those who use the spectrum be responsive \nto the public's requests--again, not for censorship, but simply for \ninformation so they can make decisions about what is appropriate and \nnot appropriate for their children to watch. Therefore, I think \ncombining the request for granting or renewal of a license to broadcast \non that spectrum is a reasonable thing to ask for in return for a \ncontent-based, program-specific rating system. In other words, if you \nwant to use the public spectrum, if you have a responsibility--and the \nresponsibility is to provide parents with information.\n\n  I, therefore, am introducing legislation today that will ensure that \nthe changes the American people demand as a condition for license \nrenewal, for license granting, or for loan of spectrum for the \ntransition of digital broadcast--in return for that, we get broadcaster \nconsent to accurately label their programming. I don't create a \nGovernment rating system. I simply want to put some information in the \nhands of parents.\n  The spectrum that is going to be loaned to broadcasters for digital \ntransmission is extremely valuable. This resource also belongs to the \nAmerican public, a public that overwhelmingly supports a program-\nspecific, content-based rating system. The basic criteria for issuing a \nbroadcast license is service of the public good. If a\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\nbroadcaster can't comply with the basic will of the American people, by \naccurately labeling the product they seek to provide, on the taxpayers' \nspectrum, then I don't believe they deserve, nor should they receive, \nthe precious resource of broadcast spectrum.\n  Mr. President, we cannot use Government to force more family-friendly \nprogramming--as much as sometimes I wish we could, given what we \ncurrently see.\n  Mr. President, we can empower parents with information that they need \nto guide their children's viewing habits. In doing so, we empower them \nto send a message to the networks, and television advertisers to stop \nthe onslaught of the kind of programming that flows through our \ntelevision sets into the minds of our children.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, let me just say that in this age where \nit's harder and harder to protect children from information and from \nbehavior and from activities in our society that is damaging not only \nto their bodies, but to their minds and souls, the parents need tools; \nthey are crying out for weapons and tools to fight back against this \nonslaught of a hostile culture. They want to try to protect the \ninnocence of their children--even if just for a little while. I think \nthey have every right to demand the tool of accurate and responsible \ntelevision ratings in return for the use of the public broadcast \nsystem.\n  My legislation would ensure this end. I hope my colleagues will join \nme in support of this effort. With that, I send to the desk the \nlegislation designed to accomplish this very purpose.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Mr. Gramm, Mr. Sarbanes, and Mr. \n        Dodd):\n  S. 410. A bill to extend the effective date of the Investment \nAdvisers Supervision Coodination Act; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n        THE NATIONAL SECURITIES MARKETS IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, today, I introduce with Senator \nGramm, Senator Sarbanes, and Senator Dodd, a bill to extend for 90 days \nthe effective date of title III of the National Securities Markets \nImprovement Act of 1997.\n  The Investment Advisers Supervision Coordination Act enacted as part \nof the National Securities Market Improvement Act, divides the \nregulation of the Nation's 22,500 registered investment advisers \nbetween the SEC and State commissions. Under the new divided \njurisdiction, investment advisers entrusted with over $10 trillion in \ncustomer funds, will be subject to better regulation and regular \nexamination. As a result, consumers and investors will be better \nprotected.\n  The legislation we introduce today will extend the effective date of \nthe title III, section 308 of the National Securities Markets \nImprovement Act of 1996 90 days, from April 9, 1997 to July 8, 1997. \nThis extension was requested by the Chairman of the SEC, Arthur Levitt, \nin his letter to the committee dated February 12, 1997. The legislation \nis necessary to ensure that the proper rules are in place to carry out \nthe provisions of this title. While the Securities and Exchange \nCommission is working diligently to complete its rules by the original \neffective date, the Commission is concerned that investment advisers \nwill not have enough time to examine the final rules and to complete \nand submit the new forms required.\n  Mr. President, Congress intended for State commissions to regulate \ninvestment advisers with assets under $25 million. However, State law \nwill be preempted as it relates to all investment advisers who are \nstill registered with the SEC when the provision becomes effective, \nregardless of their asset value. This means that if the SEC rules are \nnot final or if investment advisers have not submitted forms to end \ntheir registration by April 9, 1997, State commissions will be unable \nto regulate the investment advisers who fall within their jurisdiction. \nExtending the effective date of the Investment Advisers Supervision \nCoordination Act would ensure that all investment advisers have \nsufficient time to register with the proper commission and prevent a \ngap in effective regulation.\n  I would like to thank the chairman of the Securities Subcommittee, \nand the ranking members of both the Banking Committee and the \nSecurities Subcommittee for their cosponsorship of this legislation. It \nis my hope that the Senate will pass this legislation without amendment \nor delay so that the SEC and the State commissions can continue to move \nforward with these important changes to improve the regulation of \ninvestment advisers and protect investors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nand the February 12, 1997 letter from Securities and Exchange \nCommission be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 410\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXTENSION OF EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Section 308(a) of the Investment Advisers Supervision \n     Coordination Act (110 Stat. 3440) is amended by striking \n     ``180'' and inserting ``270''.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               U.S. Securities and\n\n\n                                          Exchange Commission,\n\n                              Washington, D.C., February 12, 1997.\n     Hon. Alfonse M. D'Amato,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman D'Amato: I am writing to request that \n     Congress extend the effective date of Title III of the \n     National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 for 90 \n     days, from April 9 to July 8, 1997. Title III reallocates \n     regulatory responsibilities over investment advisers between \n     the states and the Commission.\n       The Commission has made substantial progress in completing \n     the many rulemaking directives given to the Commission in the \n     Improvement Act. In October, the Commission proposed a rule \n     providing a safe harbor to allow journalists access to off-\n     shore press conferences. In December, we proposed rules \n     implementing new exemptions from the Investment Company Act \n     for pools sold only to qualified investors. The Commission \n     also proposed, on December 18, 1996, rules to implement Title \n     III.\n       The Commission is making every effort to meet the \n     legislative deadlines of the Improvement Act. Our rule \n     proposals were issued only two months after the legislation \n     was enacted, and the comment period for the proposals ended \n     earlier this week. While we believe the Commission should be \n     able to finish work on the adoption of the proposed rules by \n     April 9, the effective date of Title III, we are very \n     concerned that this timetable is likely not to afford \n     investment advisers sufficient time to examine the new rules, \n     consult with counsel as to their continuing regulatory \n     status, and properly complete and submit the required forms.\n       We are also concerned about the effect of the April 9th \n     effective date on state regulatory programs. As you know, \n     Title III assigns important responsibilities for the \n     regulation of investment advisers to state regulators. \n     Because Title III will become effective on April 9th (whether \n     or not the proposed rules are adopted), state law will be \n     preempted as to all advisers still registered with the \n     Commission, including those advisers that will be exclusively \n     regulated by the states. If all (or most) advisers remain \n     registered with the Commission on April 9 because they have \n     not submitted the required forms, much of state investment \n     adviser laws will be preempted, compromising state regulatory \n     and enforcement programs.\n       By dividing jurisdiction over the 22,500 advisers currently \n     registered with the Commission, the Improvement Act promises \n     to provide more efficient and effective regulation of the \n     investment advisory industry. The Commission strongly \n     supported the enactment of the Act and has moved quickly to \n     implement its purposes. We believe that by providing an \n     additional 90 days, Congress will allow investment advisers \n     adequate time to meet their obligations under the new rules \n     and will avoid disrupting state regulatory efforts that are \n     important if the goals of Title III of the Improvement Act \n     are to be achieved.\n       If I or any of the Commission staff can answer any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arthur Levitt.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \n        D'Amato, Ms. Moseley-Braun and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 411. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for investment necessary to revitalize communities within \nthe United States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE COMMERCIAL REVITALIZATION TAX ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I stand today to sponsor, along with \nMr. Abraham, Mr. Campbell, Mr. D'Amato, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Specter, \nand Mr. Cochran, the introduction of the Commercial Revitalization Tax \nCredit\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\nAct of 1997. This bill is identical to the bipartisan and widely \nsupported legislation I sponsored during the last session.\n  This measure will create jobs, expand economic activity, and improve \nthe physical appearance and increase the value of residential and \ncommercial buildings in America's most distressed urban and rural \ncommunities. The bill provides a targeted tax credit to businesses to \nhelp defray the cost of construction, expansion, and renovation in \nthese areas, and in the process will generate billions in privately \nbased economic activity in those areas that need the most help in our \ncountry.\n  The Commercial Revitalization Tax Credit Act will fill in the gap \nbetween the broad range of tools our States and localities utilize to \nmake declining neighborhoods healthy places to do business, to work, \nand to raise families. This tax credit will help businesses form a \npartnership with the Government to help revitalize areas of our country \nthat have, in many cases, suffered from neglect and despair.\n  As we continue to look for ways to combat the decay of our inner \ncities and to raise the standard of living in many of our rural areas, \nI believe, and numerous studies demonstrate, that improving the \nphysical structures in our neighborhoods not only has economic benefits \nbut also tends to lift the hopes and expectations of the residents of \nthose neighborhoods. Indeed, one of the key recommendations of the \nrecent top-to-bottom review of law enforcement in this city, our \nNation's Capital, was to improve the many abandoned buildings in the \ncity that create an atmosphere conducive to crime and despair.\n  This legislation will build on local initiatives like this in the \nDistrict of Columbia, as well as many now underway in cities in Texas \nand throughout the country. The Commercial Revitalization Tax Credit \nAct will build upon the empowerment zone/enterprise community program \nthat is now unfolding in 109 communities in the United States. Texas \nhas five of these specially designated areas: Houston, Dallas, El Paso, \nSan Antonio, and Waco, as well as one rural zone in the Rio Grande \nvalley covering four counties. Not only will these cities qualify for \nthe credit under my bill, but so will the 400 communities in the United \nStates that sought such designation but were not selected. State-\nestablished enterprise zones and others specifically designated \nrevitalization districts established by State and local governments \nwill also be able to participate. In all, over 1,000 areas will qualify \nfor this credit nationwide.\n  Our bill contains the following main features: A tax credit that may \nbe applied to construction amounting to at least 25 percent of the \nbasis of the property, in designated revitalization areas; qualified \ninvestors could choose a one-time 20-percent tax credit against the \ncost of new construction or rehabilitation. For instance, if the \nexpansion of a supermarket in Brownsville, TX, in the Rio Grande \nvalley, in the empowerment zone there, cost $150,000, the tax credit \nagainst income would be $30,000. Alternatively, the business owner \ncould take a 5-percent credit each year over a 10-year period; And tax \ncredits totaling $1.5 billion would be allocated to each State \naccording to a formula, with States and localities determining the \npriority of the projects.\n  Mr. President, with a minimum level of bureaucratic involvement and \nthrough a proven tax mechanism, this initiative will make a significant \ndifference in the lives of thousands of families in need and for the \neconomies of hundreds of distressed urban and rural communities across \nthis Nation. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this sound \nand effective pro-growth initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 411\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a group \nof young Indiana students who have shown great educative achievement. I \nwould like to bring to the attention of my colleagues the winners of \nthe 1996-97 Eigth Grade Youth Essay Contest which I sponsored in \nassociation with the Indiana Farm Bureau and Bank One of Indianapolis. \nThese students have displayed strong writing abilities and have proven \nthemselves to be outstanding young Hoosier scholars. I submit their \nnames for the Congressional Record because they demonstrate the \ncapabilities of today's students and are fine representatives of our \nNation.\n  This year, Hoosier students wrote on the theme, ``Farming the New \nFrontier.'' Students were encouraged to consider and creatively express \nthe role of Indiana agriculture in our country and in the world \nmarketplace. I would like to submit for the Record the winning essays \nof Shannon McArtor of Monroe County and Kyle Roth of Pulaski County. As \nState winners of the Youth Essay Contest, these two outstanding \nstudents are being recognized on Friday, March 7, 1997, during a visit \nto our Nation's Capitol.\n  The essays are as follows:\n\n                        Farming the New Frontier\n\n                          (By Shannon McArtor)\n\n       Vegetables that grow in water? Seedless watermelon? \n     Miniature cobs of corn? Hearty soybeans? American farmers are \n     boldly going where no one has gone before!\n       Biotechnology is going through major changes that will \n     affect our lives as we approach the 21st century. \n     Biotechnology will help farmers grow more, and better, crops \n     such as corn, beans, alfalfa, and wheat. The future is bright \n     for forage producers, due in part to new technology that \n     allows industries to grow bigger, tastier, and better \n     vegetables and grains.\n       Biotechnology has created a hybrid of soybean that can \n     withstand certain harmful herbicides. The STS gene protects \n     soybeans from sulfonylurea herbicides only. Soybean varieties \n     with resistance to certain herbicides are now available. The \n     farmer has a choice in selecting programs to control weeds.\n       Because of advances in biotechnology there are corn hybrids \n     that can resist the harsh substance called glufosinate-\n     ammonium which is the active ingredient in New Liberty \n     herbicide. Biotechnology has also helped to find hybrids that \n     can resist the European corn borer. These hybrids produce a \n     gene that contains a protein that protects these plants from \n     damage caused by ECB (European corn borer). This gene \n     originated from a bacterium and originally placed in the corn \n     inbred line using techniques of biotechnology. The addition \n     of B+ gene enhances protection of crops because the plants \n     will achieve levels of insect resistance which are not \n     possible using traditional breeding methods.\n       These new discoveries in farming will keep our nation \n     healthy in more than one way. It will give us an ample supply \n     of corn and beans on less acres. It will protect the vitamins \n     contained in grains and vegetables thus providing better \n     foods to eat. Biotechnology is going to make life better!\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Farming the New Frontier\n\n                             (By Kyle Roth)\n\n       Hello! Welcome to Bio Tech Laboratories. My name is Dr. \n     Bio. Tech and I will be your tour guide today as we take a \n     walk through my laboratory. Follow me while I show you just a \n     few of the interesting things we have been working on. You \n     know, biotechnology research wants to make a crop production \n     more efficient and also create new varieties of crops.\n       Take a look at the tomato and potato. We have genetically \n     transferred a gene from an Arctic fish to the tomato \n     increasing its freeze tolerance. The potato has been crossed \n     with soil bacteria to make it insect resistant.\n       As we go outside, Keep in mind that the world population is \n     increasing and valuable farm ground is being gobbled up by \n     land developers. We try to help farmers by developing seeds \n     that will be resistant to weeds, insects, and disease. Every \n     number that you see by this corn test plot has a different \n     ``specialty''. This one is drought resistant. Another one has \n     long full ears. That one prefers a certain soil type. Because \n     farmers feed the world, we want them to have access to global \n     positioning-farming by computer-so that they will produce \n     more food.\n       Trying not to be scientific, I must say genetic engineering \n     is a very powerful tool in biotechnology. We are developing \n     new traits into crops and livestock. Vegetable crops can be \n     altered to produce vegetables that taste and look better. \n     Don't those green beans look appetizing? They also have \n     improved nutritional quality.\n       Feast your eyes on that bread! The yeast has been altered \n     to make the bread taste better. With the wide variety of food \n     we have to offer, consumers can have a greater choice; and \n     because we have improved the quality and nutrients, these \n     food products are also healthier. Thanks for stopping by, and \n     try a slice of our great tasting bread on your way out!\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        1996-97 District Winners\n\n       District 1: Kyle Roth, Melissa Lichtenbarger\n       District 2: Ryan Johnson, Heather Butts\n       District 3: Ryan Frey, Julia Pokorney\n       District 4: Shawn Smith, Trisha Penner\n       District 5: Timothy Heck, Marni Yeagley\n       District 6: Cory Bohlander, Melissa Winebarger\n       District 7: Brandon Roe, Shannon McArtor\n       District 8: Thomas Naylor, Christine Jeffrey\n       District 9: John Saalweachter, Christa Rentehler\n       District 10: Allen Haberthier, Katrina Madden\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         1996-97 County Winners\n\n       Bartholomew: Peter Reichenbach, Christine Jeffrey\n       Boone: Timothy Heck, Charlotte Orr\n       Cass: Shawn Baker, Julia Pokorney\n       Carroll: Lance Hofmann\n       Dearborn: Nathan Lehn, Claire Cradler\n       Decatur: David Stewart\n       Delaware: Joel Rossol, Melissa Winebarger\n       Fayette: Thomas Naylor\n       Fulton: Johanna Martin\n       Gibson: Carolyn Moseley\n       Hamilton: Sam Tischfield, Natalie Templeton\n       Hancock: Jimmy Asher, Heather Hobbs\n       Henry: John Sweigart\n       Huntington: Nathan Scheiber, Jennifer Stetzel\n       Jackson: Christopher Lambring, Cheyenne Hackman\n       Jay: Dustin Knipp, Tarra Rothburn\n       Kosciusko: Isaac Wildman, Heather Butts\n       Lake: Wesley Gordon, Mary Owen\n       Madison: Cory Bohlander, Jessica Landess\n       Marion: Bob Cook, Christy Utnage\n       Miami: John Einselen\n       Montgomery: Wes Ambrose, Marni Yeagley\n       Newton: Ryan Haste\n       Portor: Bryan Martinez, Allison Payer\n       Posey: John Saalweachter, Jennifer Symanski\n       Randolph: Wade Chalfant\n       St. Joseph: Andrew Callan, Melissa Lichtenbarger\n       Spencer: Carmen Dominquez\n       Vanderburgh: Bradley Painter, Leslie Rudolph\n       Wabash: Shawn Smith, Trisha Penner\n       Warrick: Benfamin Baker, Christa Rentchler\n       Wells: Jenni Mason.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2027-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2027-S2028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NATIONAL SPORTSMANSHIP DAY\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise in honor of National \nSportsmanship Day, which was observed on March 4, in over 8,000 schools \nin all 50 States and 75 countries throughout the world.\n  National Sportsmanship Day was conceived by the Institute for \nInternational Sport, located in my home State of Rhode Island. The \nInstitutes slogan, ``Dare to Play Fair,'' challenges athletes, coaches, \nadministrators, and parents to reflect on the true meaning of \ncompetition and to discuss the importance of ethics and fair play in \nsport, the classroom, and everyday life.\n  The centerpiece of this years National Sportsmanship Day was a \nseminar and town meeting at the University of Rhode Island discussing \nthe issue of violence in sport. This day long event included panels \ncomposed of professional athletes, coaches, and journalists who \ndiscussed the many different aspects of this issue.\n  In addition, the Institute has enlisted the help of several Sports \nEthics Fellows, including the winner of baseball's\n\n[[Page S2028]]\n\nRoberto Clemente Man of the Year Award and 10 time All-Star for the \nMinnesota Twins, Kirby Puckett, Rhode Island's own Brad Faxon, one of \nthe top golfers on the PGA tour and the cofounder of the Billy Andrade-\nBrad Faxon Charities for Children Program. These men and women are \nwonderful role models who can be admired for more than just their \nathletic prowess. They have consistently demonstrated an interest in \nfurthering the principles of honesty and integrity in sport and \nsociety.\n  Indeed, the Sports Ethics Fellows are helping to teach the important \nlessons of National Sportsmanship Day by writing articles on \nsportsmanship and developing programs for National Sportsmanship Day. \nThrough competition, young athletes can learn that while winning is a \nworthy goal, honor, discipline, and hard work are more important. \nIndeed, these values will guide them in all aspects of everyday life.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join the President's Council on \nPhysical Fitness and Sports and the Rhode Island congressional \ndelegation in recognizing this day and the principles it \nembodies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2027-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOME OFFICE TAX DEDUCTION\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as an original cosponsor of the home \noffice tax deduction bill introduced today by Senator Hatch, I rise in \nstrong support of this measure and urge its expeditious passage in the \nSenate.\n  Today, home-based business is the new workplace. The new workplace is \ninteractive video, the Internet, and digital documents. Telecommuting \nis now common, saving travel costs and time. But it's not just a matter \nof cost, it's a matter of lifestyle. With technology, the new workplace \nmeans you can live anywhere you want and still make a living doing what \nyou love. And spend a few extra hours with the kids. In my State of \nMontana, where there's a lot of dirt between light bulbs, those extra \nhours really add up.\n  Back in 1993, shortly after the Supreme Court's Soliman decision, I \nintroduced the home office tax deduction bill, and I've been pushing \nfor it ever since. We must allow a tax deduction for essential \nactivities, such as billing, performed in the home when that is the \nonly available place for such activities. As the law now stands, \nworkers like Dr. Soliman who spend 15 hours per week doing billing in \nan exclusive home office are denied the deduction. That's not right. \nHome offices that are used regularly and solely for business purposes--\nwhether it's by physicians, salespeople, or mothers working at home--\nshould be an allowable deduction.\n  A few weeks ago the Senate Small Business Committee, of which I am a \nmember, held a hearing on women-owned and home-based businesses. We \nheard from small businesspeople who expressed their frustration with \nFederal tax laws that hinder their ability to succeed. Some of today's \nlargest companies started as home businesses, and the potential for job \nand economic growth is unlimited, provided the tax code is not a \nbarrier to that growth.\n  I thank Senator Hatch for introducing this measure today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2028-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING THE WOMEN'S BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to \nrecognize the achievements of the Women's Business Development Center \n[WBDC]. Today, they are celebrating their 10th anniversary, and I truly \nwish I were able to join their celebration in person.\n  Currently, there are over 8 million women-owned businesses in the \nUnited States, generating $2.3 trillion in sales. In my home state of \nIllinois alone, there are over 350,000 women business owners. Women \nbusiness owners across the country employ one of every four U.S. \ncompany workers, and women in business are contributing to economic \ngrowth both at home and abroad. The story of women in business is one \nof unqualified success, and that success is thanks in no small part to \norganizations like the Women's Business Development Center.\n  For the past decade, the WBDC has dedicated itself to providing \nservices and programs that support and accelerate women's business \nownership and strengthen the impact of women on the economy. Founded in \n1986 by Carol Dougal and Hedy Ratner, the WBDC is currently active in \nsix States--Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Florida, Massachusetts, and \nPennsylvania, and has served over 30,000 women business owners. The \nhighly successful programs and services of the WBDC are many in number, \nincluding counseling, workshops, entrepreneurial training, the women's \nbusiness finance programs, the women's business enterprise initiative, \nthe entrepreneurial women's conference and women's business and buyer's \nmart.\n  I wish to commend the WBDC for their vital role in the growing \neconomic impact of women business owners on our Nation's economy. I am \nproud that the WBDC was founded in Illinois, and that the effects of \ntheir good works are felt far beyond the borders of my State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2028-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION BAN ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor S. 6, the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1997. As a cosponsor of \nthis bill, I want to take a moment to discuss why it is so important \nthat we act on it as soon as possible.\n  Mr. President, as my voting record shows, I have always voted pro-\nlife on issues concerning abortion. However, my support for S. 6 and my \nvote on the partial birth abortion ban during the 104th Congress was \nnot simply a moral judgment on abortion. This debate is not about \nreproductive choice; it's not even about abortion. Partial birth \nabortion is a cruel procedure and is abhorrent to most Americans. In \nfact, most physicians believe it is never medically necessary. This \nprocedure is far beyond human decency.\n  Mr. President, it is shocking to me that the debate over partial \nbirth abortion is even necessary. A procedure whereby a child is partly \ndelivered and then its brains are suctioned out has no place in a \ncivilized society. It certainly has no place in America. Let's join \ntogether, pro-life and pro-choice, and do the right thing. Let's put an \nend to this cruel procedure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2028-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2028-S2029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING THE GLEANERS COMMUNITY FOOD BANK OF GREATER DETROIT\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I have the distinct honor of paying \ntribute to the Gleaners Community Food Bank of Greater Detroit, which \nthis year celebrates its 20th year of providing food to needy people in \nsoutheastern Michigan.\n  On March 12, 1997, the Gleaners annual Women's Power Breakfast will \nbring together more than 200 of southeast Michigan's civic, \nprofessional, and corporate leaders to help lead the fight against \nhunger. The power breakfast was created 4 years ago by Gleaners board \nmember Dulcie Rosenfeld and is led this year by honorary co-chairs \nMichelle Engler and Judge Trudy Archer, and by breakfast co-chairs Irma \nElder, Barbara Levin, Helen Love, and Amanda Van Dusen. Knowing the \nconsiderable talent and commitment of these women, I have no doubt that \nbreakfast participants will meet their challenge of raising money and \nawareness to help Gleaners find solutions to hunger in southeastern \nMichigan.\n  Gleaners Community Food Bank was founded in 1977 with a mission of \nbringing together food, resources, and manpower into a single \ncollection, storage, and distribution center to help feed southeastern \nMichigan's hungry. Since its creation, Gleaners has collected surplus \nfood from the region's farmers, food distributors and processors, \nsupermarkets, grocery stores, and individuals. Each year, this vital \norganization collects, stores, and distributes more than 12 million \npounds of food to more than 200 agencies, including soup kitchens, \nchurch pantries, and shelters for homeless or battered women.\n  Since its inception, Gleaners has been able to rely on the generosity \nof the people of southeastern Michigan. Each Saturday, approximately \n100 volunteers from church groups, schools, unions, and corporations \ncome together to assemble food packs for distribution to various \nagencies. Food drives, fundraising events, corporate donations, \nfoundation grants, and donations from individuals contribute greatly to \nGleaners success.\n\n[[Page S2029]]\n\n  Hunger is faced by people of all ages, races, and socio-economic \nlevels in communities throughout our Nation. I am proud to have such a \ndedicated and successful organization leading the fight against this \nproblem in my home State. We should all take inspiration from the \nexample we see here and recommit our efforts to eradicate hunger in \nthis country and around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2028-4", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FAMILY FRIENDLY WORKPLACE ACT\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, as a co-sponsor of S. 4, the Family \nFriendly Workplace Act of 1997, I rise to express my strong support for \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, Americans have always struggled to balance the \nconflicting demands of work and family, but today, more than ever, \nfamilies, especially double earners, are finding the old, rigid \nworkplace structure of a different era to be the main barrier to a \nfamily friendly schedule. This is ironic because today's technology \nmakes telecommuting from home common through the Internet and \ninteractive video, allowing the flexibility many workers need to spend \nmore time with their families.\n  The problem is that in the eyes of our Federal laws the workplace has \nnot changed since the 1930's. Federal wage-and-hour laws were developed \nduring the New Deal era, when about one mother in six with school-aged \nchildren worked. But the workplace is vastly different today. Over 70 \npercent of mothers with kids in school work, and the rigid 8-hour-per-\nday, 40-hour-per-week work schedule is less rational or justifiable. \nSimply put, the wage-and-hour laws belong in a different era--one that \nended about 50 years ago.\n  Federal Government workers have had a flexible work schedule option \nfor three decades. Under a flextime arrangement, many Federal employees \nwork 10-hour days, 4 days per week. For a mother with a young child, \nthis means 1 less day per week she'll have to pay for daycare. You can \nbet that adds up.\n  Flextime has been a tremendous benefit for Federal workers, \nespecially women. Why shouldn't non-Federal workers have this benefit \nas well? The answer is that they should, and that's what S. 4 will do. \nUnder this bill, an employee will have three options: First, flexible \nscheduling--to work additional hours 1 week for credit, up to 50 hours, \ntoward a shorter work day or work week later at full pay; second, bi-\nweekly scheduling--to schedule 80 hours over a 2-week period in any \ncombination; or third, compensatory time off--to choose time-and-a-half \ncompensatory time off, up to 240 hours--160 hours at time-and-a-half, \nfor overtime hours worked in lieu of time-and-a-half pay. No employee \nmay be required to participate in these programs, and coercion or \nintimidation by the employer with respect to participation is \nprohibited.\n  This is commonsense legislation endorsed by Working Women and Working \nMother magazines. It's time to tear down the barriers to a family \nfriendly workplace and give hardworking Americans the flexibility to \nspend time with their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/06/senate-section/article/S2029-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2029-S2033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22\n                                            U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM OCT. 1 TO DEC. 31, 1996\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid W.
