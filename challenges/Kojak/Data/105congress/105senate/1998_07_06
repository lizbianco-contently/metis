We \npray together today, remembering the first prayer of dependence prayed \nfor the delegates to the Continental Congress in 1774 that eventually \nled to the Declaration of Independence in 1776. Now that the fireworks \nare over, work in us the fire of that same dependence on You that was \nthe secret of truly great leaders throughout our history. We pray for \nthe women and men of this Senate. Enlarge their hearts until they are \nbig enough to contain the gift of Your Spirit; expand their minds until \nthey are capable of thinking Your thoughts; deepen their mutual trust \nso that they can work harmoniously for what is best for this Nation. \nYou know all the legislation to be debated and voted on before the \nAugust recess. Grant the Senators an unprecedented dependence on You, \nan unreserved desire to seek Your will, and an unlimited supply of Your \nsupernatural strength.\n  Now we move forward into this 223d year of our history as a nation \nwith renewed dependence on You and renewed interdependence on one \nanother as fellow patriots. Help us to be willing, in the spirit of our \nfounders, to stake our reliance on You and pledge our lives, fortunes, \nand sacred honor for the next stage of Your strategy for America.\n  Lord of all life, we ask You to intervene and extinguish the fires \nthat are sweeping throughout the State of Florida. Be with Senators \nMack and Graham as they personally comfort and care for the thousands \nwhose homes have been destroyed and whose lives have been disrupted. In \nthe Name of our Lord and Savior.

I now ask that the Senate stand in recess \nuntil 2:30 p.m. today following the remarks of the Senator from Oregon.\n  Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon, Mr. Wyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, every Member of this body has watched horrified these \nlast few months at the outbreak of gun violence that has struck \nAmerica's schools. Now, with the new school year just a few weeks away, \nit is time for this body to respond to America's parents who are \nfrightened for their youngsters and are asking, what can be done to \nprotect their children when they are at school?\n  Frankly, a lot of those parents don't believe that this Congress will \nproduce very much. They know there has been considerable acrimony about \nthe whole debate over guns in America. Certainly there are many areas \nwhere reasonable people can differ. There are constitutional \nprotections with respect to the right to bear arms, and at the same \ntime we are also concerned about the safety of those youngsters when \nthey are away at school.\n  Senator Gordon Smith, my colleague from Oregon, and I believe it is \ntime to set politics aside with respect to this issue of gun violence \nin our schools. That is why we have teamed up on important legislation \nwhich we believe ought to be enacted by the time school starts in the \nfall. We don't think this is the complete answer to this scourge of \nschool violence, gun violence, that our youngsters face, but we think \nit can make a real difference.\n  We propose this legislation after the tragedy in Springfield, OR. As \nthe Presiding Officer of this body knows, there has been a rash of \nthese violent incidents at our schools. The problems have literally \nbeen seen in schools from coast to coast. Senator Smith and I have \nintroduced legislation which I believe would lay out the beginnings of \na rational policy to control school violence in America.\n  What we have proposed--we did it after consulting with families, law \nenforcement officials, educators, people who are for gun control, \npeople who are against gun control--we have proposed legislation which \nwould stipulate that when a young person brings a gun to school, that \nwould, in effect, be a five-alarm warning to society. It would make it \nvery clear that at that point there is a real threat to young people, \nto teachers, and our society. And young people who bring a gun to \nschool, under our legislation, would be detained for up to 72 hours for \na comprehensive evaluation, from the standpoint of mental health \nconsiderations, law enforcement issues, family questions, the whole \ngamut of concerns that ought to be looked at when a young person brings \na gun to school.\n  The alleged killer at Thurston High School, in Springfield, OR, was \napprehended at school with a gun the day before he shot more than 20 of \nhis classmates. That day, the police made a decision which is \nduplicated each day across our Nation, a decision that seemed \nreasonable at the time. The youngster was released to his parents, \nparents who were themselves teachers and who were known to be concerned \nand involved in the lives of their children. Currently, many police \ndepartments across America have complete discretion to treat young \npeople caught with a gun at school in the manner they deem appropriate. \nAs Springfield's own police chief has argued, the evaluation that needs \nto occur in these situations is beyond the means and capacity of most \npolice forces across our country.\n  So Senator Smith and I have introduced legislation which would \nprovide an incentive for each State to enact a law requiring a \nmandatory 72-hour detention for any child caught with a gun at school. \nIf a State passes such a law, it will be eligible for an additional 25 \npercent in funding under the Juvenile Justice Act. The cost of this \nlegislation is small, perhaps $25 million a year, and certainly modest \nwhen you look at the State's overall requirements in the effort to \nprevent school violence.\n  Now, Mr. President, we are not suggesting that this is all that needs \nto be done. Certainly, though, our first responsibility when a child \nbrings a gun to school is to protect all of the kids who come to that \nschool armed only with their books and their calculators. Children \ncaught with a gun at school ought to be detained for a sufficient \nperiod to protect the other children and to evaluate the degree to \nwhich they are a threat to themselves and those around them.\n  I believe this legislation can win the support of every Member of \nthis body, be enacted in time for the opening of the fall school \nyear and should be acted on as soon as possible. Mr. President, Bill \nClinton has spoken favorably of this legislation during his visit to \nSpringfield, OR. The Nation's mayors--Democrats, Republicans, liberals, \nconservatives--have spoken favorably of this legislation. I am very \nhopeful that even though this body has an extremely busy schedule in \nthe weeks ahead, there will be time, on a bipartisan basis, to ensure \nthat this legislation moves forward.\n\n  According to Larry Bentz, principal of Thurston High School in \nSpringfield, OR, the Thurston High community is slowly returning to \nsome semblance of normalcy. The kids are engaged in the traditions of \nsummer--swimming, playing basketball, summer jobs. With the memories of \nthe brutal shooting at the high school seared into their memories, the \nparents are trying to push ahead and return to family routines and \nresponsibilities. But they want to make sure that this body, and \nelected officials everywhere, don't forget about the gun violence that \nhas shattered young lives and families in Springfield, OR--and, in \nfact, in five States over the last school year. Senator Smith and I \nurge that this body not let that happen. We ought to listen and learn \nfrom the lessons of Springfield and commit to doing our part to end \nschool gun violence now as the schools look to opening their doors for \na new school year.\n  Now, the Thurston community is still processing the tragedy at \nThurston High. They are debating a variety of approaches and ideas for \nreducing school violence. Senator Smith and I don't pretend to have all \nof the answers, but we know there are some practical steps that the \nU.S. Senate can take, and take promptly, to make our schools safer in \nAmerica.\n  There are other steps that need to be taken, Mr. President. We have \nto make certain that communities have the resources to evaluate kids in \ntrouble. I heard again and again, as I visited with families in \nSpringfield, from hard-working, middle-class families, that they simply \ncould not get any help until their youngster was violent. That is just \nnot acceptable in America, Mr. President. It is not right to say that \nthere will be no response until a young person is actually violent. We \nhave to get there early. We have to get there with preventive \nstrategies.\n  Senator Smith and I hope to be back before the U.S. Senate with other \nconstructive approaches in the days ahead. But let us make a strong \nbeginning, Mr. President. Let us make a strong effort in the U.S. \nSenate to take the first step to averting further school tragedies. In \nOregon alone, young people were apprehended with guns at school 100 \ntimes in the last school year--and those were simply the ones who were \ncaught. So as our country goes about the business of the pleasures of \nsummer, and as the U.S. Senate deals with what we know is going to be a \nvery hectic schedule over the next few weeks, let's not forget about \nwhat happened in Springfield, OR, in Kentucky, in Arkansas and in \nMississippi. Let us remember that our young people will be back in \nschool in just a few weeks. Let us do our part to make sure that school \nviolence ends here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7342-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7342-S7343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, and to all who are with us in the \nproceedings today, I rise with melancholy to pay tribute to a great \nMarylander who passed away over this weekend, our beloved and endeared \ncomptroller, Louie Goldstein. Louie, indeed, was a Maryland treasure--\nand he was--to the State, and the State treasured him. Like all \nMarylanders, I will miss Louie Goldstein and mourn his passing. As \nMaryland's comptroller, he always stood steadfast sentry over the State \npurse. He helped make sure that the economy was booming, and he fought \nfor the economy of our State. He fought for the State to have a triple-\nA bond rating. He also was out there absolutely on the side of his \nconstituents.\n  It is hard to believe that the State tax collector was the most \npopular elected official in the State. This man collected the State \ntaxes for 40 years. And every tax season he would say ``Don't delay. \nFile today.'' He crisscrossed the State often going close to 100,000 \nmiles reaching out to rotaries, senior citizen clubs, and League of \nWomen Voters gatherings always talking about the State's economy, what \nthe tax dollars went for, and he was beloved.\n  He ran a tight ship, and Maryland benefited from it for more than 39 \nyears. In his 10 terms as the comptroller, he always made sure that \nMaryland kept its triple-A bond rating, which was an indication of our \nfiscal soundness.\n  As the State's tax collector, he prided himself on getting tax \nreturns back quickly and efficiently to Marylanders. There was no IRS-\ntype heavy hand on Louie Goldstein's watch.\n  We always knew that the tax collector's office was run efficiently, \nfairly, and a taxpayer could get a hearing and get their refund early \nand on time.\n  Louie was a man of the old school. He was a gentleman. His word was \nhis bond. He believed in high-tech and reach-out politics. But also he \nwas a very shrewd businessman. Under his very folksy style in which he \nwould reach out and always had a laugh and a word of encouragement, he \nalso knew the power of high-tech. He came from an era of pen and paper. \nHe would joke about himself, and was maybe even a stylist. But quickly \nhe saw the power and utility of new technology and worked diligently to \nbring high-tech efficiency to the comptroller's office.\n  Under his leadership, Maryland was the first State to computerize its \ntax records. At the time of his death, he was working on a system that \nwould allow Marylanders to file their taxes electronically.\n  He also realized the magnitude of the Year 2000 problem. He got a \njump-start on fixing it.\n  Imagine an 85-year-old comptroller who had served 10 terms doing the \njob, had more new ideas and was more farsighted than many of the young \npeople who want to come into government. He was reshaping Maryland's \ncomputers so they would be ready by 1999.\n\n  Now, anyone who met him knew there was much more to Louie Goldstein \nthan his position as comptroller. When he came up to you, he would \nshake your hand, give you his trademark little imitation gold coin that \nsaid ``God bless you, real good.'' He radiated warmth that was truly \ngenuine. Louie was a tremendous public speaker and, unlike most \npoliticians, people looked forward to his southern Maryland accent. \nHowever, when other politicians found out he was scheduled to speak, \nthey always got a little nervous, including yours truly.\n  Louie Goldstein was a dedicated Democrat and worked tirelessly for a \nDemocratic ``Team Maryland,'' but would work on a bipartisan basis for \nfiscal soundness and business attraction to the State.\n  Early on, he campaigned for me. He knocked on doors, and he believed \nin me, when I was a little upstart politician before I got to be one of \nthe fortunate 100. All Maryland Democrats owe Louie Goldstein a debt of \ngratitude for showing us how to stay in touch with constituents, \nwhether it was at a church supper or in a business boardroom.\n  Louie Goldstein was tremendously warm and kind. He loved to laugh and \nloved to be on the sunny side of life. I am proud to call him a friend, \na colleague, and a mentor. There was and will be no one like him. We \nwill find a successor, but we will never find a replacement, nor should \nwe seek one. He was unique in Maryland politics, and I think he was \nunique in American history.\n  On the day of his death, he was in five different parades, came home, \nread the Declaration of Independence to his gathered family, as he had \ndone for so many years, took a swim, and then God called him to glory.\n  We salute him. As Louie would say to one and all, I say to him, \n``Louie, God bless you, real good.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Baltimore Sun tributes to Louie \nGoldstein be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, July 4, 1998]\n\n                     Louis L. Goldstein, 1913-1998\n\n       What can you write about Louis L. Goldstein that hasn't \n     been recorded numerous times during his 60-year career in \n     public service?\n       He was truly a legend in his own time, the best-known and \n     best-liked Maryland politician of the last four decades.\n       Call him ``Mr. Maryland.'' Or as one speaker put it at a \n     fund-raiser last year, our ``state fossil.'' Up until his \n     death last night at age 85, Mr. Goldstein could--and did--run \n     lesser-aged politicians ragged on the campaign trail and in \n     the hallways of state government.\n       Voters elected Louie Goldstein state comptroller a record \n     10 times. His love of people and his perpetual optimism made \n     him one of the few tax collectors in America who drew cheers, \n     not jeers, from constituents.\n       But Mr. Goldstein was far more than a popular campaigner. \n     He ran one of the best tax-collection departments in the \n     nation, receiving awards for keeping his office on the \n     cutting edge of technology. His latest success: A vast \n     increase in computerized tax filings this year.\n       It was on the Board of Public Works, though, that Mr. \n     Goldstein may have performed his greatest service. This \n     largely unknown panel--the governor, the comptroller and the \n     state treasurer--holds immense power over billions of dollars \n     of state contracts.\n       It was Mr. Goldstein who acted as board skeptic, grilling \n     bureaucrats mercilessly on the merits of projects. What a \n     ferocious fiscal watchdog he was! He poured over voluminous \n     reports to the point where he knew as much about them as \n     those making the presentations.\n       Often, proposals were pulled even before the public \n     hearing--after Mr. Goldstein had brutally dissected the plan \n     at the panel's pre-board sessions.\n  Given the immense power granted the governor in Maryland, the need \nfor checks and balances is critical. Louis L. Goldstein performed that \nrole brilliantly. But he did so with a smile on his face and a keen \nunderstanding of the benefits of government when it is made to work in \nfavor of the best interests of its citizens.\n       God bless Louie Goldstein, real good.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Baltimore Sun, July 5, 1998]\n\n                   ``There Will Be No One Like Him''\n\n                       (By William F. Zorzi Jr.)\n\n       Louis Lazarus Goldstein was the total package: \n     indefatigable campaigner, skilled financial watchdog and \n     accessible public servant, a 40-year incumbent who was \n     unbeatable by challengers of either party.\n       It seemed as if he had been comptroller of Maryland's \n     treasury forever. When Goldstein was first elected in 1958, \n     Dwight D. Eisenhower was president, J. Millard Tawes was \n     stepping up to be governor and the Baltimore Colts were still \n     a month away from winning their first national championship.\n       When he died Friday night after a heart attack at his \n     Calvert County home, a chapter of Maryland's history was \n     closed. A career ended that stretched back 60 years, to when \n     he was first elected to the House of Delegates.\n       Goldstein, a Democrat who was 85, helped usher Maryland \n     government into the modern era, overseeing the \n     computerization of the state's tax and payroll systems. He \n     fought\n\n[[Page S7344]]\n\n     fiercely to protect the state's AAA bond rating, calming \n     jittery New York bond houses during the state's various \n     financial crises. And he earned the trust of a public that he \n     never lost touch with, consistently winning high marks among \n     Marylanders for a job well done.\n       ``He truly represented the state of Maryland,'' said Robert \n     A. Marano, a tractor dealer who was watching Towson's Fourth \n     of July parade yesterday. ``He loved what he was doing and it \n     showed.''\n       Said U.S. Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski: ``There was and will be \n     no one like him.''\n       In a singular honor, Goldstein's body will lie in state for \n     public viewing tomorrow in the Rotunda of the Maryland State \n     House. A funeral service is scheduled for 11 a.m. Tuesday at \n     Trinity United Methodist Church in Prince Frederick.\n       Gov. Parris N. Glendening, who ordered state flags to half \n     staff to mark Goldstein's passing, said the comptroller's \n     ``personal touch would be missed very, very much.''\n       Glendening, who was to appear with Goldstein in three \n     parades yesterday, said he found it ``really weird'' not to \n     see the comptroller in the car behind him.\n       Goldstein was one of three members--Glendening and Maryland \n     Treasurer Richard N. Dixon being the other two--of the Board \n     of Public Works, the powerful panel that oversees billions of \n     dollars in expenditures each year.\n\n\n                            fiscal watchdog\n\n       It was as a member of that board that he earned his \n     reputation as the state's watchdog, a stickler for detail who \n     often would grill bureaucrats--at times mercilessly--over \n     even the smallest of contract awards. It was not unusual for \n     him to impatiently scold them at the crowded meetings, as he \n     looked up over half-lens glasses balanced on the end of his \n     nose.\n       Of particular interest to him were school roofs--a subject \n     on which he became an expert because the state replaced so \n     many of them.\n       ``Governors and treasurers have come and gone . . . but \n     he's been the constant,'' said Dixon, who thought of \n     Goldstein as the board's ``General Overseer.''\n       ``He ran the show,'' Dixon said. ``He read every page of \n     those big agenda books before the meetings. He must have \n     spent the weekend going through the items.''\n       In fact, before his heart attack Friday evening, Goldstein \n     spent a portion of the day reviewing the agenda for this \n     week's board meeting.\n       State Sen. Robert R. Neall, an Anne Arundel Republican who \n     as a county executive and legislator has put in time before \n     the Board of Public Works, praised Goldstein for his work \n     there.\n       ``You had someone who was very competent at his job, \n     someone who was very sharp fiscally,'' Neall said. ``He would \n     be cautioning a governor not to make a mistake that some \n     governor, like Governor O'Connor, made 50 years ago,'' he \n     said. ``He just understood state government like no one \n     else.''\n       His knowledge of matters financial was such that six weeks \n     prior to the stock market crash in October 1987, he advised \n     the Maryland Retirement and Pension Board, which he chaired, \n     to moved $2 billion in investments out of stocks and into \n     bonds. The board followed his advice, saving the pension \n     system from huge losses and bolstering further his national \n     reputation.\n\n\n                              born in 1913\n\n       Goldstein was born March 14, 1913, in Prince Frederick to \n     immigrant merchant Goodman Goldstein and his wife, Belle.\n       He was first elected to public office in 1938, the year \n     Herbert R. O'Conor became Maryland's governor and Franklin \n     Delano Roosevelt was president.\n       He served one four-year term in the House of Delegates \n     before entering the Marine Corps during World War II. In \n     1946, a month after returning stateside, he was elected to \n     the Maryland Senate, where he spent 12 years, including four \n     years as president.\n       In 1958, he ran for comptroller in what would be the first \n     of 10 terms. Though his state service was uninterrupted, he \n     did lose one election--to Joseph D. Tydings in the 1964 \n     Democratic primary for U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                         successful in business\n\n       His distinctive Southern drawl and country-boy manner \n     belied just how shrewd he was. He was a successful \n     businessman as a real estate investor, tree farmer and former \n     Calvert County newspaper publisher.\n       Over his career, primarily in the 1950s and early 1960s, \n     Goldstein bought thousands of acres of land in Southern \n     Maryland and on the Eastern Shore. He advised friends and \n     acquaintances to do the same, ``because the Good Lord isn't \n     making any more of it.''\n       Some of those deals were questioned, particularly when he \n     sold some of the land at a high profit, but he protested that \n     he had done nothing wrong.\n       Goldstein traded on his charm and affable ways, \n     crisscrossing the state and seeming to turn up at every \n     rally, fund-raiser or Rotary meeting to which he was invited.\n       He put as many as 100,000 miles a year on his state car, \n     which was driven by Maryland State Police bodyguards.\n       ``He was very much a retail, press-the-flesh politician,'' \n     said Marvin A. Bond, Goldstein's long-time assistant and \n     friend. ``He never had the benefit of a machine or vast \n     organization, and he believed that Maryland was a small \n     enough state that people still expected to see you.''\n       Some of Goldstein's detractors complained privately that he \n     was an unabashed publicity seeker with a penchant for taking \n     the politically easy vote.\n       If true, voters across the state never seemed to notice; \n     they returned him to office time and again by impressive \n     margins. He consistently outscored other politicians in polls \n     that measured name recognition and voter satisfaction--an \n     unusual occurrence for a state's tax collector.\n       Goldstein had a remarkable memory, for figures as well as \n     faces.\n       Glendening recalled the first time he met Goldstein--at a \n     Prince George's County crab feast -- just after coming to \n     Maryland from Florida in 1967. There ``must have been 600 or \n     700 people there,'' the governor said, and at the time, \n     Glendening was a mere political science professor at the \n     University of Maryland, College Park.\n       ``I saw him about a year later, and he said to me, `Hi \n     professor, how are you?'''\n       Shocked, Glendening asked Goldstein if he remembered him, \n     to which the comptroller responded, ``Sure I do, Parris.''\n\n\n                          ``The state fossil''\n\n       Goldstein had been around for so long that in introducing \n     him, other politicians could not resist making some crack \n     about his being in Maryland when the colony was founded. \n     Recently, he was referred to affectionately in an \n     introduction as ``the state fossil.''\n       ``Louis had become an institution . . . a sort of goodwill \n     ambassador,'' Neall said. ``He had gone beyond the sort of \n     typical pol looking to renew his lease.''\n       At the Towson parade yesterday, J. Kevin Wight, 38, said he \n     did not remember much about Goldstein's politics, but he did \n     remember his personality.\n       ``He was always going up to people, waving,' Wight said. \n     ``He always had a smile on his face.''\n\n\n                         ``God bless you all''\n\n       Goldstein's name became synonymous with his trademark \n     phrase, ``God bless you all real good.'' The expression was \n     emblazoned on one side of gold-painted coins he handed out \n     everywhere he went. The other side read simply ``Louis L. \n     Goldstein, State Comptroller, Maryland.''\n       After an event, he followed up quickly with thank-you \n     notes, often dictating them to his secretary over the car \n     phone as he left.\n       Goldstein was so popular that Democratic candidates had all \n     but stopped running against him, and state Republicans put up \n     only token opposition.\n       The GOP future brightened for a short time after the 1994 \n     election, when Goldstein announced that he would not seek an \n     11th term. But that changed after Goldstein's wife of 48 \n     years, Hazel, died in April 1996. With only state business to \n     turn to, he announced in June of that year that he would run \n     again. His decision sent virtually everyone who had \n     considered a bid out of the race.\n       On Tuesday, Goldstein will be buried next to his wife at \n     the Trinity churchyard cemetery.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

The clerk will report S. 2168.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2168) making appropriations for the Departments \n     of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and \n     for sundry independent agencies, commissions, corporations, \n     and offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1999, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that full floor \nprivileges be granted to Carrie Apostolou, a member of the subcommittee \nstaff, during the consideration of S. 2168, the fiscal year 1999 VA-HUD \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the fiscal year \n1999 VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill, S. 2168. \nThis legislation provides a total of $69.986 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority and $80.78 billion in outlays, and an additional $23 \nbillion in mandatory spending for veterans programs.\n  The Subcommittee allocation was about $750 million below the \nPresident's request in budget authority. In\n\n[[Page S7345]]\n\naddition, there were some significant shortfalls in the President's \nbudget in such areas as veterans medical care and elderly housing. In \nattempting to balance all the competing demands, we were forced to make \na number of tough decisions.\n  The committee did its best to provide the needed funding for the \nimportant priorities within the bill, with the highest priority given \nto veterans programs and elderly housing. Other priorities included \nmaintaining environmental programs at or above current year levels, \nensuring adequate funds for our nation's space and science programs, \nand providing adequate funding for disaster relief. The committee also \nmet the commitment we made to provide the necessary funding to cover \nall expiring section 8 contracts.\n  On balance, I believe the recommendation is fair and balanced. Not \neveryone is happy, but I believe it is equitable. Clearly, we were not \nable to provide fully what each member requested--and I should note \nthat we received about 1,000 requests from Members of this body for \nitems in this bill--but we attempted to meet the priorities.\n  Before describing what is included in this legislation for each \nagency, I want to thank Chairman Stevens for all his support, and I \nparticularly thank my ranking member, Senator Mikulski, for all of her \nhard work and cooperation in putting this legislation together. This is \nalways a difficult task, and it is made for easier and more efficient \nby the professional and wholehearted cooperation of Senator Mikulski \nand her staff--Andy Givens, David Bowers, and Bertha Lopez. I extend my \nthanks to them. Their contributions to this process have been \ninvaluable.\n  Mr. President, for the Department of Veterans Affairs, the committee \nrecommendation totals $42.5 billion, including $19.2 billion in \ndiscretionary spending. This is an increase of $373 million above the \nPresident's request. The amount recommended includes $222 million more \nfor medical care, $53 million more for the state home construction \nprogram to reduce the large backlog of priority projects, and $79 \nmillion in additional funds for other construction programs.\n  The additional funds are intended to ensure VA medical care is the \nbest possible quality, and that it is available to as many eligible \nveterans as possible. The funds are also intended to ensure VA \nfacilities are adequately maintained, safe, and seismically secure, and \nthat the final resting places for our fallen heroes are maintained in \nan appropriate and dignified manner.\n  The recommendation also includes an increase of $10 million above the \nPresident's request for VA research, for a total of $310 million.\n  This is a critical program, veterans research, in improving the \nquality of VA care, in furthering our understanding of such illnesses \nas gulf war syndrome, in developing prosthetic devices and other items \nwhich will improve the quality of life to veterans and others, and in \nseeking cures to diseases which veterans and the Nation at large face. \nThe programs is also key in the recruitment and retention of top-notch \nmedical staff at VA hospitals.\n  For the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the committee \nrecommendation totals $24.1 billion, an increase of $2.66 billion over \nthe fiscal year 1998 level.\n  This means we have been able to fund HUD programs fairly while \nmeeting our commitment to provide the needed funding for all expiring \nsection 8 contracts and by more than fully funding the section 202 \nelderly housing program at $676 million, an increase of $31 million \nover the fiscal year 1998 level and an increase of $576 million over \nthe President's request of $109 million.\n  I emphasize that the section 202 Elderly Housing Program is the most \nimportant housing program for elderly, low-income Americans, providing \nboth affordable, low-income housing and supportive services designed to \nmeet the special needs of the elderly. This combination of supportive \nservices and affordable housing is critical to promoting independent \nliving, self-sufficiency, and dignity while delaying the more costly \nalternative of institutional care. Section 202 elderly housing is more \nthan just housing--it is a safety net for the elderly, providing both \nemotional and physical security and a sense of community. I am very \ndisappointed and puzzled by the administration's failure to propose the \nneeded funding for the section 202 program.\n  Moreover, at the direction of the Senate and House VA/HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittees, GAO conducted a very thorough budget \ninvestigation of the HUD section 8 accounts. Based on the GAO budget \nscrub and after discussions with HUD, we discovered that the \nadministration's request for $1.3 billion in section 8 amendment \nfunding is unnecessary for fiscal year 1999 and that a further $1.4 \nbillion in section 8 project-based recaptures may be considered excess \nfunding, which means we are actually above the President's request for \nHUD.\n  These additional funds have provided us with needed flexibility to \nfund HUD programs as well as to fund other priorities throughout this \nbill. As a result, the committee has provided additional funding for \nHUD programs such as the HOME program, CDBG, Youthbuild, the HOPE VI \nprogram, and the Homeless Assistance Grants program. I think these all \nare needed additions that were made available as a result of this \nreview by GAO and work with HUD.\n  Nevertheless, HUD continues to be a troubled agency with GAO \ndesignating the entire agency as ``high-risk.'' In fact, HUD is the \nonly agency ever to have received a ``high-risk'' designation agency-\nwide. Now, Secretary Cuomo has begun implementing the HUD 2020 \nmanagement reform plan as his first step to agency reform and \ndownsizing. Many of our future funding recommendations will depend on \nthe success of this plan and I want to state my support of the \nSecretary in his efforts to reform the Department. Nevertheless, we \nexpect to see tangible and quantifiable results. We need to know that \nHUD programs work, that HUD staff are capable of effectively \nadministering HUD programs, and that there is accountability within HUD \nprograms.\n  Further, we also do not look to fund new HUD programs and initiatives \nuntil HUD can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Congress its \nability to administer effectively its primary programs. I want to make \nit very clear that self-serving press releases by HUD that announce \nsuccess carry little weight. I am from Missouri and I want to be shown.\n  Finally, for the first time in a number of years, this bill would \nprovide modest increases in the FHA mortgage insurance limits, raising \nthe floor from 38 percent of the Freddie Mac conforming loan limit, or \nsome $86,000, to 48 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some \n$109,000, and establishing a new ceiling for high-cost areas from the \nexisting 75 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some $170,000, to \n87 percent of the conforming loan limit, or some $197,000.\n  I know for some that this is considered controversial, but we have \ntried to strike a reasonable balance and I believe that the new limit \nis needed especially in non-urban areas where the price of new housing \nhas escalated beyond the capacity of first-time homebuyers to use FHA \nmortgage insurance to buy a house. In my own state I have seen many \nareas where, because of the FHA lower limits, financing is not \navailable for construction of first homes for families of workers with \nlower wages.\n  Nevertheless, I remain concerned about HUD'S capacity to manage the \nFHA mortgage insurance programs and will be looking for additional ways \nto ensure the solvency of the mutual mortgage insurance fund.\n  For EPA, the bill includes $7.4 billion. This is about $50 million \nmore that the fiscal year 1998 level. The bill maintains level funding \nor provides some increases to all EPA programs, reflecting the priority \nwe have placed on environmental protection activities. Included in the \nrecommendation is $350 million more than the President requested for \nstate revolving funds, which he had proposed to cut by $275 million. \nThe SRFs help to meet a need in excess of $200 billion nationally for \nwater infrastructure financing. Cleaning up waste water and assuring \nsafe drinking water should be at the top of our environmental priority \nlist.\n  The committee has provided 80 percent of the administration's request \nfor the clean water action plan, including $180 million for nonpoint \nsource grants\n\n[[Page S7346]]\n\nand $106 million for water quality grants. The committee's action \nrecognizes the importance of addressing polluted runoff and seeks to \nensure that our Nation's rivers, lakes, and streams are protected from \npolluted runoff, and are clean for recreation and for wildlife. These \nfunds gives the states the tools they need to improve the quality of \nour Nation's water. I promised Administrator Browner I would try to \nfind more funds for this critical program, and I have.\n  The bill includes level funding for Superfund. Given the myriad \nproblems with this program, coupled with the lack of a reauthorization \nbill, an increase simply was not warranted. I remind my colleagues, \nwith respect to the fiscal year 1999 advance that was provided in last \nyear's bill for Superfund, those funds were to be made available only \nif the program was reauthorized. We had a deal with the administration \non this, and unfortunately the administration conveniently seems to \nhave forgotten this deal.\n  Further, the program continues to be listed by GAO as high risk, \nsubject to fraud, waste and abuse. Such abuse recently was demonstrated \nin an IG report which found that Superfund was being used to rebuild \nhomes at several times their market value. Finally, experts agree that \nfunds invested in Superfund yield less reduction in risk to human \nhealth and the environment compared to other EPA programs.\n  Our recommendation totals $13.6 billion for NASA, an increase of $150 \nmillion above the request to ensure adequate funds for space station \nand other critical NASA programs. It also includes a restructuring of \nthe NASA appropriation accounts to improve fiscal accountability.\n  In particular, we have included a new account for the International \nSpace Station to ensure that Congress and this subcommittee gets honest \nfigures for the ISS from the administration\n  While I strongly support the ISS and the many important programs \nadministered by NASA, the long history of space station overruns \nreached a new and unprecedented level with the recent release of the \nreport by the independent cost assessment and validation team headed by \nJay Chabrow. The Chabrow report estimates that the ISS will cost some \n$24.7 billion instead of $17.4 billion and will take up to 38 months \nlonger to build than NASA's current estimates.\n  For NSF, the recommendation includes $3.6 billion, an increase of \nabout $220 million above the 1998 level. NSF is an investment in the \nfuture and this additional funding is intended to reaffirm the strong \nand longstanding support of this subcommittee to scientific research \nand education.\n  Finally, for FEMA, there is a total of $1.3 billion, including $846 \nmillion in disaster relief and about $500 million in nondisaster relief \nprograms. The amount recommended for disaster relief, coupled with the \n$1.6 billion provided in the fiscal year 1998 supplemental, \napproximates the 5-year historical average cost of disaster relief in \n1999 dollars.\n  The recommendation includes the restoration of $11 million in state \nand local assistance grants to state emergency management agencies. It \nalso includes $25 million in the new pre-disaster mitigation program.\n  Mr. President, as you know, the administration last month submitted a \nbudget amendment to increase funds for FEMA counterterrorism \npreparedness activities.\n  I intend to work with my ranking member, Senator Mikulski, to offer \nan amendment to increase funds for such activities in FEMA by $8 \nmillion, in addition to the $9 million currently included in the \ncommittee mark. These are critical activities. I think it is important \nwe accommodate the administration's request, and I ask for my \ncolleagues' attention to this very important measure. We think not only \nthe work that goes on in FEMA, but the work that goes on elsewhere in \nthe Federal Government, needs to take account of the risks that we face \nin these areas.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my statement. It is a pleasure to turn \nto my ranking member, Senator Mikulski. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that during consideration of S. 2168, the \nfiscal year 1999 VA-HUD appropriations bill, Ms. Bertha Lopez, a \ndetailee from HUD serving with the committee, be provided the privilege \nof the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, once again, we are on the floor to \nbring to the U.S. Senate for its consideration the appropriations on \nVA, HUD, and independent agencies. I thank Senator Bond for his very \nhard work and the bipartisan approach to producing this bill.\n  I also acknowledge his professional staff and the collegial and \ncooperative way in which they have worked with my staff to bring this \nbill to the floor. It is this type of bipartisan effort that I think \nfocuses on results, not rhetoric, meeting our obligations to important \nconstituencies, like veterans and the elderly, and yet creating \nopportunities for people, like we are in FHA and VA mortgages, national \nservice, and various other empowerment things we do. No one Member or \nparty will get everything they want in this bill, but we do believe \nthat this really does meet compelling human needs. Given the spartan \nallocation for the subcommittee and the need to make up cuts in \nprograms, like housing for the elderly, I believe that this legislation \nis very solid. I strongly support it and encourage those on my side of \nthe aisle to do so.\n  This bill shows our commitment to both high touch and high tech. We \nhave kept our high-touch commitment to our veterans and the elderly and \nthe high-tech commitment to science in agencies like National Science \nFoundation, the space agency, and EPA.\n  Let me talk a minute, though, just after the Fourth of July, about a \nconstituency that truly does rely on the U.S. Senate for promises made, \npromises kept, and that is the veterans. The veterans of America rely \non us, and I believe that Senator Bond and I have worked to scour every \nline item to be sure that the promises made to the veterans of the \nUnited States of America for their health care have been promises kept.\n  This year, we will be funding veterans health care at the amount of \n$17.2 billion. That is ``b'' like in Barbara, not million, like ``m'' \nin Mikulski--$17.2 billion, and with the way we have been able to view \nthe bill, this is a $200 million increase.\n  Also, we want to improve VA medical research. The Veterans' \nAdministration, through their excellent medical services, does an \nastounding amount of medical research, particularly the applied \nresearch that goes to hands-on clinical practice. In this budget, we \nhave increased VA medical research by $38 million, to the tune of $310 \nmillion, and this will go to focus on research affecting aging \npopulations, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, special needs of \nveterans, particularly those related to orthopaedic injury, surgical \npractice, and other improvements in clinical practice, to improve \nhealth care and shorten stays and not skimp.\n\n  Also, as everyone here knows, as a champion of the women's health \nagenda, I wanted to be sure, working with Senator Bond, that we did not \nforget the men of this country. There is a special set-aside in here \nfor research on prostate cancer, so that we can find a cure and we can \nfind better early detection methods. We, the women of the Senate, as I \nknow the Presiding Officer feels, want to show the men of America we \nare squarely on their side.\n  I thank Senator Bond for going over this budget so that we could work \nto establish VA medical care, VA medical research, and also, at the \nsame time, increase funding for something called veterans State homes. \n``State home'' is an old-fashioned word. It comes out, really, of the \nSpanish-American War and out of World War I, where we had ``old-age \nhomes'' for veterans. We are now at the end of the old century and \nmoving to a new one, and State homes really now are long-term care and \nrehabilitation facilities for our veterans, but they are unique \npartnerships between the Federal Government and the State government, \nforming Federal-State partnerships to establish long-term care \nfacilities, maximizing our dollars to operate it and even help build \nit, but State resources in purchases of land. This way, we stretch out \nthe Federal dollar and the State\n\n[[Page S7347]]\n\nbecomes a stakeholder. I think this is a unique way of meeting the \nlong-term care needs of our veterans population.\n  While we were working to make sure promises made to the veterans were \nkept, we also, I think, had an excellent approach to the Housing and \nUrban Development Department. Particularly, I am impressed with the \nfact that we worked very hard, again, on a bipartisan basis in \nrestoring the $489 million cut to elderly housing. HUD's elderly \nhousing program is one of the more successful housing programs at the \nagency. It works with nonprofit organizations and faith-based \norganizations. The HUD 202 Program leverages those community resources \nthat help provide safe and decent housing for the elderly and a sense \nof community in many communities around the country.\n  The agency proposed close to a half-billion-dollar cut, and I am \npleased that in the budget deliberation and now in our own \nappropriations, Senator Bond and I joined hands, joined forces, to make \nsure that we restored that cut so that the elderly of this country can \nhave the 202 Program building housing for them and operating those \nprograms.\n  We also rejected with vigor the desire to take a substantial part of \nthe housing for the elderly and convert that into vouchers.\n  The Presiding Officer, I know, is on the Select Committee on Aging, \nand I know both in her home State of Maine and in her role in the \nSenate, she has been devoted to the cause of the elderly. She knows, as \nSenator Bond and I, that you cannot take an 80-year-old lady with a \nwalker who is frail elderly and give her a voucher to go out in a \ncommunity to find her own housing.\n  Can you see her going up three flights of stairs with her voucher and \nher walker to see if the bathroom is fit for duty? We are not going to \nhave the elderly of America going door-to-door with vouchers trying to \nfind housing to meet their needs. That should be done through housing \nfor the elderly, the 202 funding, housing for the elderly that is run \nprimarily by nonprofit and faith-based organizations--Jewish charities \nand Catholic Charities in my own community. That is what the elderly \nwant.\n  Guess what? In this bill, we restored the $489 million, and I am \nreally proud of the way we did that.\n  In addition to looking out for the elderly, we wanted to look out for \nthe young people of our community.\n  We wanted to promote first-time home ownership. That is why we also \nlooked at the FHA loan limit, recognizing that some parts of our \ncountry are very high cost. And we raised the FHA loan limit to \n$197,000 in high-cost areas and $108,000 in more modest areas. The \nadministration proposed raising the limit to $227,000 for all \ncommunities. We believe that that is too high.\n  We were deeply concerned about FHA foreclosures, that people would \nget into too much debt too early in their lives and end up not with an \nopportunity but with a heartbreak, and leaving the taxpayer with the \nliability. So we did not want heartbreak for the family and we did not \nwant heartburn for the taxpayer. So we believe that this is a \nreasonable compromise, to raise it at this rate. It is critical that we \nensure that FHA is able to meet the new market realities without \nsetting ourselves up for this big buck unfunded liability in the event \nof FHA foreclosures.\n  We also included language directing HUD to consult with Congress \nfurther before beginning its bulk sale of foreclosed properties. We do \nnot want these houses to go at fire-sale prices or to end up adding \nblight to a community. We want to make sure that FHA is a tool for \nfirst-time home buyers, not a tool for neighborhood deterioration.\n  We are also pleased that in this bill we really tackle the issue of \nbrownfields. Brownfields funding is both in the HUD part of the bill as \nwell as in the environmental protection part. The President requested \n$90 million for EPA's brownfields program. And $25 million of the \nrequest is provided for HUD's brownfields program.\n  I happen to be a strong supporter of brownfields programs, and I \nthink they are important tools to communities. They enable us to take \ncare of areas that have a level of contamination and move them to clean \nup and redevelop them. My concern is that we will not get a Superfund \nauthorization. And while we are waiting for Superfund funding--a great \nopportunity in our communities--brownfields that are not nearly as \ncontaminated, with good gall and good appropriations, we can move \nbrownfields to green fields, opening up opportunities for economic \ndevelopment.\n  This then takes me to talking about EPA. Our bill provides critical \nresources for the Environmental Protection Agency at $7.4 billion. This \nis an increase of $51 million over last year. This is primarily in the \nareas of improving water quality, which are very important to a State \nlike my own. It also includes last year's level of $1.5 billion for \nSuperfund.\n  This bill also contains money for State and tribal assistance grants, \nproviding critical resources for States' efforts to maintain clean and \nhealthy water.\n  Madam President, water quality is absolutely crucial, and part of the \nfunding is $20 million for the Chesapeake Bay program to continue our \ncommitment to protect this natural resource. This Chesapeake Bay \nprogram was started by my predecessor, Senator Charles McC. Mathias, a \ndistinguished Republican from the State of Maryland. Senator Sarbanes \nand I have kept that commitment. And we thank Presidents Ronald Reagan, \nGeorge Bush, and Bill Clinton, and now the Republican leadership of \nthis committee, for working to keep that commitment going.\n  We were also hit by something called an algae bloom. Now an algae \nbloom in my State is called pfiesteria. I understand that the Senator \nfrom Maine, the Presiding Officer, has also been hit by algae bloom in \nher own State. We know Senator Faircloth and Senator Helms have had it \nin North Carolina. We have had pfiesteria in Maryland; you have had \nproblems in Maine; the Louisiana Senators have had it.\n  This algae bloom is now a national problem, and we have put over $37 \nmillion in the EPA budget to begin to do the water quality monitoring \nand the research so that we can solve not only our problem in Maryland, \nbut we also look forward to working with our colleagues, like yourself, \nin really dealing with this, because this could destroy our waters and \nit could destroy our mutual economies. Again, we look forward to \nworking with you. This $37 million we think is a very important step in \nresearch and monitoring and trying to get good science and the best \npractices from EPA and environmental agencies in this.\n  I regret that this year we do not have the authorization for the \nSuperfund. Year after year, people want to reauthorize the Superfund \nsite on appropriations and leave it to us to solve a problem that the \nauthorizing cannot. I join in agreement with Senator Bond that we need \nthe reauthorization of the Superfund site before we can move ahead on \nthis bill.\n  I know the administration is looking at additional sites for us to be \nable to clean up while we are waiting for authorization. I talked to \nAdministrator Browner, and I said, if you have the sites, show us the \nmoney and get us also the authorization so that we can see how we could \nmove forward.\n  In the area of science and technology, I thank the chairman for \nworking to increase both the funding of the national space agency as \nwell as the National Science Foundation. In addition to increasing \nfunding for the National Science Foundation, I am particularly pleased \nwith the increases in informal education programs that will be \nimportant and also those in K through 12.\n\n  Now, why is this important? Because so much of getting our young \npeople excited about science goes on through informal education \nprograms. These are not spontaneous playground programs; these are \nstructured afterschool activities.\n  In my own State, they are going on in the Maryland Science Center, \nthe aquarium. I wish you had been with me during the break. I was at \nsomething called the Christopher Columbus Center, a marine biotech \ncenter. We have second graders there every day from 9 until 2. They do \nscience in the morning; they do reading in the afternoon; and they are \nso excited. And when they go back then to the classroom, they are going \nto be much more reading ready and they are going to be excited about \nscience. And, by the way, I got to do a few experiments myself.\n  In terms of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA has been\n\n[[Page S7348]]\n\ndoing an outstanding job. I think FEMA has been doing an outstanding \njob, and we provided $1.3 billion to the agency, $500 million over the \nrequest. We also have provided a modest amount for predisaster \nmitigation, which I hope, as the bill moves forward through conference, \nwe can actually increase because of the approach to preventing \ndisasters.\n  In my own State, Allegheny County has gotten a $700,000 grant, and we \nhave worked with the Corps of Engineers and the Governor. We are well \non our way to protecting communities that normally are hit.\n  Now, in this legislation also there is $9 million for FEMA to have \nresources to do the training necessary to prevent us from terrorist \nattacks due to weapons of mass destruction. Senator Bond and I are \nworking to increase that funding. I know it started out even more \nspartan than this. But, Madam President, we really have to worry that \nthe predators in the world--be they nations or terrorists--are really \ngoing to once again try to spread weapons of mass destruction on the \nUnited States of America. I know that the military is standing sentry, \nour intelligence agencies will give us the warning, but we need to look \nout for our civilian population. I think we need to have the type of \ntraining at the local level that we can be able to move in this bill.\n  Let me also thank the chairman for including money for national \nservice, which does provide the opportunity for so many people to \nvolunteer in our own communities, at the rate of $425 million, last \nyear's request.\n  And let me close by saying there are two independent agencies--the \nNeighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, which we funded at $60 million, \nthat I think specific amounts of money are absolutely out there in poor \ncommunities and near-poor communities doing a good job. Also, our \nConsumer Product Safety Commission has gotten out of the rhetoric \nbusiness under its able administrator Ms. Brown and really is giving \nmuch needed advice on consumer product safety. Most recently, she has \nbeen helping with the whole issue of a particular type of blanket which \ncould cause the death of preschoolers.\n  This is our bill. It goes from funding Arlington Cemetery and the \nConsumer Product Safety Agency, to protecting us against national \ndisasters, to honoring our commitment to veterans, to protecting the \nenvironment, and promoting science. This is one of the most interesting \nand exciting bills and subcommittees in the U.S. Senate. I believe the \nchairman and I have done an outstanding job in trying to get real value \nfor the taxpayer and for the Nation in this bill. I hope that this bill \nmoves forward and that our arguments have been so compelling that there \nwon't be any amendments and we can pass this bill by tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I thank my distinguished ranking member \nfor her very cogent and persuasive arguments. She makes an excellent \ncase for the bill.\n  I note when she says this is an interesting bill that there is an old \ncurse that one should live in interesting times. But we are very \nfortunate to be able to work on a bill that has so many important \nprograms and is of such great interest among our colleagues.\n  I want to begin the debate. Before I turn the floor over to our \ncolleague from Ohio, who I understand has other business, I urge all of \nour colleagues to please come forward if they have amendments, if they \nhave colloquies. It would really help us if we could get as many of \nthose in today as possible in order for us to complete work on this \nmeasure by tomorrow afternoon, which would be my hope.\n  I know we have two amendments that are going to be argued with some \nenthusiasm and with great feeling on both sides. I hope we can complete \nthose. In order for us to do that, I ask that all Senators who have \namendments that might be cleared or colloquies which they wish to enter \nwith us, they provide them by no later than the Tuesday lunches \ntomorrow so we may have an opportunity to look at them. If we get near \nthe end it would be my desire to finish up, once we have dealt with the \ncontroversial amendments, and I would hate to have to turn down an \namendment that might otherwise be agreed to because it is not presented \nin a timely fashion. In order for us to move forward with this bill so \nwe can expedite the work of the Senate, I ask colleagues bring to us \nthis afternoon, if possible, and tomorrow morning in any event, any \namendments or colloquies or other matters it wishes to consider so we \ncan complete work on them in as quick a fashion as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to echo the request of Senator \nBond. I say to all my Democratic colleagues, if you have an amendment, \nplease let us know by noon tomorrow, preferably even by 10 o'clock \ntomorrow morning so we could have discussions with you and perhaps find \nother ways to resolve their, I am sure, very legitimate concerns.\n  Also, we ask our colleagues to cooperate with us in a time agreement. \nThere are many bills waiting to come to the floor. We have very few \ndays left in July. We are ready to move our bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, I want to compliment Senator Bond and \nSenator Mikulski for the hard work they have done on this bill. I know \npersonally of their efforts in this regard. I certainly support the \ntack they have taken and look forward to taking part in the debate as \nit continues over the next couple of days with regard to this matter.\n  I wish to speak today on a different matter. I ask unanimous consent \nwe proceed as in morning business for the duration of my speech, which \nwill not be beyond about 15 minutes, and then revert back to VA and \nHUD.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GLENN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7344-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7348-S7351]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND SANCTIONS\n\n  Mr. GLENN. Madam President, if we go back in history, we see that the \ndevelopment of weapons of war have become more and more hideous as time \ngoes on.\n  One of the biggest steps forward in that direction--or steps \ndownward, depending on how you look at it--was the development of \nnuclear weaponry near the end of World War II. I was involved in World \nWar II and in the Korean war. I have been through combat. I know what \nit is like. When I came to the Senate, I could not imagine anything \nmore horrible than the use of nuclear weaponry in future wars, if they \never came up. The horrors of conventional war are bad enough without \nimposing nuclear weaponry into that scenario.\n  My desire to do something in this area motivated much of my work here \nin the Senate, and I have taken a leading position on this issue \nthrough the years. Some of it has been very controversial. There have \nbeen various approaches to this issue. I want to discuss just a few of \nthose today.\n  We have been hearing much talk in this body lately about the use and \nthe value of sanctions, which is one of the tools we have applied to \nprevent the spread of nuclear weapons to more and more countries around \nthe world. This tool has been applied in many other foreign policy \ncontexts as well, and I am the first to agree with those who say that \nwe may have gone too far in the application of some of these \ninstruments of foreign policy--some of them. There have been successes \nand there have been failures. It has been a rather spotty record all \nthe way through.\n  When you consider this whole issue, it seems to revolve mainly around \ntwo questions: First, in our international relationships, where do we \nuse carrots and where do we use sticks, to put it in those terms. Where \ndo we use enticements to people, to try and entice them into a certain \nbehavior we would like to see, and where do we use sticks? Where do we \nthreaten the punishments that they may consider ahead of time that \nmight cause them not to go into certain areas of behavior we would like \nto see them avoid?\n  Second, what role should sanctions play as an expression of \ndisapproval or punishment in cases where it is manifest that behavior \nwill not be significantly altered as a result of the imposition of \nsanctions?\n  Now, the debate in Congress and in most of the think tanks around \ntown and across the country has been most\n\n[[Page S7349]]\n\ncurious because they seem to want it both ways. They want sanctions in \nsome areas and not in others, but not necessarily with regard to \nnonproliferation.\n  If we consider some other areas, for example, probably the most \nsalient example of the failure of sanctions from every perspective is \nthe drug war. Now, all of us are against drug use. We want to cut out \ndrug use, whether by cutting the flow from abroad or at our borders or \nwithin our communities or whatever. We have those sanctions on, but no \none in Congress is standing up to proclaim that sanctions against \npersons or countries which are contributing to the illegal use of drugs \nought to be eliminated. We want to keep those sanctions on. Why? In \npart, because the drug war is politically popular. The war against \ndrugs is politically popular, and its effect on commercial activity by \nAmerican business is mixed. We have some businesses in this country \nactually flourishing because of the drug war--manufacturing of \nequipment used in surveillance, construction of jails, so on. So those \npeople are not about to go to the National Association of Manufacturers \nor the Chamber of Commerce to complain about unilateral U.S. \nsanctions. But the complaints about sanctions are now legion when \nsanctions are applied in other contexts, like the one I am addressing \ntoday--nonproliferation. This is not to say that the critics of \ncongressionally mandated sanctions have no case. I agree with some of \nthe points that they make. But there are extremists who take the \nposition that sanctions are never effective and are therefore always \ninappropriate. There are also extremists who insist on taking a \npunitive approach to every vexing foreign policy problem. These folks \nnever saw a sanction they didn't like, and any approach to an issue \nthat doesn't take the hardest line is denounced as some sort of \nappeasement. I might add that quite often there are political points as \nmuch as public policy points trying to be made by some of the tacks \nthat these people seem to take.\n\n  Well, as the author of numerous pieces of legislation on nuclear \nproliferation that have included both carrots and the sticks of \nsanctions as tools for achieving certain nonproliferation objectives, I \nhave tried to forge a balanced approach to the proliferation problem. \nMost recently, my 1994 legislation, which has been referred to as the \nGlenn amendment, was used by President Clinton to impose a variety of \neconomic sanctions against both India and Pakistan because of their \nrecent nuclear tests. Those sanctions were tough. We didn't pull any \npunches with those sanctions. Those sanctions mandated that military \nsales and any aid programs had to stop. It said we would block credits \nand loan guarantees by U.S. Government agencies. We would oppose any \nloans or cooperation with those countries under sanction from the World \nBank, or IMF, the so-called IFITs, International Financial Institution \nTransactions. We would also block credit from private banks, and we \nwould prohibit the export of dual-use technology to those countries \nwhich might be used for military purposes.\n  Now, that is tough legislation. We didn't give a waiver authority at \nall. We had rather spotty experiences with Presidents in the past and \nwe said we were going to make this tough; the President could delay the \nimposition of those sanctions for 30 session days if he wanted, but the \nPresident didn't have the authority to waive those sanctions, as is the \ncase with some other legislation. That was done very intentionally. \nThese sanctions now require congressional legislation in order to \nremove them.\n  Let's look at the history behind the 1994 legislation--I think it is \nimportant to know--in order to understand why this legislation took the \nform that it did. It is tied up with the history of the cold war and \nU.S. nonproliferation policy. We could go back to the days of Hiroshima \nand Nagasaki. Most people realized since those days that we needed to \nprevent a nuclear holocaust by somehow, some way reducing nuclear \nweapons. Now, that has remained through the years a long-term \nobjective. And through many of those years it was very disappointing to \nsee the spread of nuclear weapons go on, or nations trying to gain \nnuclear weapons capabilities.\n  While nuclear reductions and ultimately nuclear disarmament remained \nour long-term objective, it would become even more difficult if more \nand more nations developed a nuclear weapons capability. And with that \nlong-time objective in mind, we passed legislation over a period of \nmore than 20 years trying to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, while \nat the same time holding out the hope for eventual weapons control.\n  In 1978, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act, which I coauthored, was \nenacted. It provided for carrots on nuclear cooperation for countries \nthat adhered to certain nonproliferation principles, and it provided \nthe stick of sanctions--cutoffs of nuclear cooperation for countries \nengaged in dangerous nuclear activities related to bomb making, \nincluding nuclear detonations. The Presidential waiver was provided \nwithin that legislation. A year earlier than that--in 1977--I authored \nan amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act that provided for cutoffs of \neconomic and military assistance to countries that received or exploded \na nuclear device, or were engaged in--and this is important--either the \nimport or export of dangerous nuclear technologies involving plutonium \nproduction and separation--either import or export, either way, whether \nthe country was supplying the stuff or receiving it.\n  I provided a Presidential waiver in this case also. This legislation, \nalong with the so-called Symington amendment on nuclear enrichment \ntechnology transfers, resulted in a cutoff of economic and military \nassistance for Pakistan in 1979. While the Glenn amendment could have \nbeen waived, the Presidential waiver attached to the Symington \namendment was impossible to exercise; only congressional action could \nremove the Symington sanction. Then we came to Afghanistan. After the \nAfghanistan war erupted--which coincided almost very similar in time to \nthe installation of a new administration--the Reagan administration \ndecided they could not provide military assistance to the mujahedin in \nAfghanistan without lifting the ban on assistance to Pakistan. The \nreason was that the material had to flow to Afghanistan through \nPakistan. We could hardly get them to transport material through the \nPakistani border area and across their territory to Afghanistan if we \nhad sanctions on against Pakistan. So there was a waiver.\n  The Administration went to Congress and asked for a repeal of the \nSymington amendment, but Congress wasn't willing to do that. We were \nunwilling to give the Pakistanis total relief from pressure to halt \ntheir evident nuclear weapons development program, so a compromise was \nstruck. Congress agreed to a legislated 6-year waiver of the Symington \nsanctions, but at the same time passed an amendment that I offered to \nremove the ability of the President to waive a cutoff of economic and \nmilitary assistance to any nonweapon state like Pakistan that explodes \na nuclear device.\n  In effect, the line in the sand on sanctions had been pulled back. My \npurpose in removing the waiver was simple. I didn't know how long in \nfact the Afghanistan war would proceed. I believed that just as long as \nit went on, the Pakistanis would count on the Reagan administration not \nto put nonproliferation policy ahead of cold-war policy. My amendment \ndid provide for a possible 30-session-day delay of sanctions by the \nPresident following a detonation, but no waiver without congressional \naction.\n  Now, turn over the calendar a little bit. In 1985, when it was clear \nthat the Pakistanis were still going for the bomb--something we had \nknown for a long time--which they consistently denied at all levels of \ntheir government, Congress moved the line in the sand a bit closer by \npassing the Pressler amendment, which also carried no Presidential \nwaiver. It mandated a cutoff to Pakistan, unless the President \ncertified that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device. \nNote the wording: The President could not certify they did not possess \na nuclear explosive device. It was under this amendment that Pakistan \nwas cut off from economic and military assistance in 1990, after the \nAfghanistan war ended--and I should add about 3 years after the \nPakistanis actually had made the bomb that we knew they were working on \nall that time.\n\n[[Page S7350]]\n\n  But other international developments were going on all through this \nsame period. In terms of world events at this point, we were witnessing \nthe demise of the cold war and the beginning of the collapse of the \nSoviet Union. This brought new hope for really, truly, and finally at \nleast gaining control of nuclear weaponry, after going through years \nupon years upon years of what we call MAD--mutually assured \ndestruction--on both sides if anybody set off a nuclear weapon. Those \nwere long years where we thought that nuclear nonproliferation was dead \nand wasn't something with which we really were going to succeed. But \nfinally, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, this brought new hope \nfor really gaining control of nuclear weaponry. In a comparatively \nshort period of time there was real optimism that control over these \nweapons could be gained. I was one of those who changed my views on \nthis completely during that time period, because I had been very \npessimistic through the years. Even though I am the author of much \nlegislation, as I just recounted, on this, I didn't feel that we were \nreally gaining much in the world, and we were starting to move in \nplace. And other nations were really trying to get nuclear weaponry. So \nwe weren't really accomplishing much.\n\n  But all at once I began to feel very optimistic at this time, because \nat the end of the cold war and the agreement with the Soviet Union we \nsaw missiles being taken out of silos; weapons being taken down; \nfissile material being taken out; the cores of nuclear weapons being \ntaken out and used for other purposes, for stockpile, or whatever. But \nthey were no longer in the weapons aimed at each other halfway around \nthe world. Real progress was being made. I began to feel pretty good \nabout this.\n  With U.S. leadership, we then worked to obtain progress on arms \ncontrol and nonproliferation. Over a period of time we had 185 nations \nsign up under the nonproliferation treaty. Progress was being made on \nthe Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, also, which currently has 149 \nsignatories. If anyone had come to me and told me a few years ago that \nwe would have that many signatories, that we would have 185 sign up \nunder NPT and 149 for CTBT, I would have told them they were crazy to \neven contemplate such a thing. But that is what has happened. So things \nare moving in the right direction.\n  Indeed, so much progress was being made on the test ban treaty and so \nmuch progress had been made on computer simulation of nuclear weapon \ntests that it was unclear whether any further nuclear explosions would \nhave to take place anywhere.\n  Back in the old days it was quite apparent that if a nation was going \nnuclear they didn't say they were a nuclear nation unless they had gone \nout and really tested a weapon. They couldn't just say their \nengineering was good, that they will rely on engineering and claim they \nwere a nuclear state and that they knew the thing would go off. That \nwasn't the way it went. You had to take it out and test it. And if you \ndidn't, you couldn't rely on nuclear weapons. What has happened with \nthe supercomputer and supercomputer simulation is that the need for \ntesting is no longer clear. The way it is now is we think probably you \ncould have a nuclear weapons capability without doing any testing.\n  So the hope was at that point--the hope we had in 1994--that much \ntougher sanctions would put the final nail in the coffin for nuclear \ntests. There wouldn't be any nuclear testing if we could just make this \na tough law. So although the circumstances in 1994 were much different \nthan those of 1981, the Glenn amendment of 1981 was updated with tough \nsanctions. It became the Glenn amendment of 1994. I thought it was \nworking. And it was working until just a few months ago. Unfortunately, \nthe hope on which the amendment was based went down the drain when \nIndia's extreme Hindu Nationalist Party overrode what most of the world \nthought should have been more responsible behavior and set off a \nnuclear weapon. And Pakistan responded in kind with their demonstration \nalso to make sure they were not left out of things, too.\n  So we are now faced with a situation which will test the mettle of \nour diplomacy in south Asia like few times in history, I guess we could \nprobably say like never before. The sanctions that are being imposed \nbecause of the Indian and Pakistani tests will fall on both of them, \nand may help us--I hope it does--move the Indians and Pakistanis toward \nmore responsible behavior in the aftermath of the tests.\n  We must admit that the sanctions did fail in their primary purpose, \nwhich was to prevent a test in the first place. But I look at this as a \nsetback, not the end of our efforts. One could only speculate if this \nfailure was due to the sanctions' unilateral nature or whether the \nIndians would have tested under any circumstance. This is not to say \nthat unilateral sanctions are never to be imposed as nonproliferation \nthreats. Quite the contrary. For example, the threat of such sanctions \nwas helpful in the special cases of Taiwan and South Korea, when both \nof those countries were taking steps toward proliferative activity some \nyears ago. We could also indicate that there were other nations that we \nthought were moving perhaps in that direction, too, and who ultimately \ngave up their programs--like Argentina and Brazil, and South Africa.\n  But anyway, to go back to Taiwan and South Korea, both of those \ncountries were heavily dependent on the United States. So unilateral \nsanctions worked, and they worked well. I think our sanctions also \nworked for a while in maybe holding back some of Pakistan's advance in \ntheir nuclear weapons program, because we made it more difficult for \nother nations to cooperate with Pakistan as they were trying to achieve \ntheir nuclear weapons capability.\n  But in general I believe it has been increasingly clear that with the \ndramatic expansion of the world community--sources of information, \nsources of equipment, sources of trade around the world--I believe that \nsanctions become really effective only if they have multilateral \nsupport.\n  Let me repeat that because that is the basis of some of these things \nthat I want to elaborate on just a little bit further. Sanctions become \nreally effective only if they have multilateral support, whether \nthrough our allies or through the United Nations. Unilateral sanctions \nare not as effective as we would like to see them. That is the \nunderstatement of the day. And there are situations where the \nimposition or continuation of mandated unilateral sanctions may make a \nproblem even worse.\n  So I have come to believe that except in very special circumstances, \nsuch as those we faced in 1981, sanctions legislation that give the \nPresident no role in their implementation or continuation should be \navoided, and laws which have been constructed in such fashion should be \namended. That is the reason I am here on the floor today.\n  In my 1994 legislation, the President has no role in the process of \nimplementation or the continuation of sanctions. And the Congress, \nbecause of the tradition of no limit on Senate debate, can be hamstrung \nby a determined minority of Senators who wish to retain sanctions \nbecause of considerations that may have nothing to do with the original \ntransgression. So we don't want to permit that to happen, either.\n  So, accordingly, on June 26, just before the recess, I introduced the \nSanctions Implementation Procedures Act of 1998, which is labeled \nSenate bill 2258, which, if passed, will be applicable to all country \nsanctions laws that do not contain a Presidential waiver which the \nPresident may exercise on the grounds of protecting the national \ninterest. I want to, in order to give the President more leeway, get \nmultilateral support, which is what I would like to see happen either \nwith our major allies or through the United Nations. This bill would \ngive the President the option of delaying any imposition of \ncongressionally mandated sanctions for a period not to exceed the \ncombination of 45 calendar days, followed by 15 session days of \nCongress. The President, if he chooses to delay the sanctions, must \nprovide a report to Congress no later than the end of the 45-day period \nin which he discusses the objectives of the sanctions, the extent of \nmultilateral support for the sanctions, and the estimated costs and \nbenefits, both tangible and intangible.\n  If in this report the President recommends that we don't go ahead \nwith the sanctions--he recommends nonimplementation of the sanctions--\nthen\n\n[[Page S7351]]\n\nexpedited procedures are triggered for 15 session days in both the \nSenate and the House of Representatives--both Houses of Congress--for \nthe purpose of approving or disapproving the President's \nrecommendation--in other words, expedited procedures which provide for \nno filibuster. We take it up in preference to other legislation. We \ngive it priority. So it could not be delayed.\n  Equally important, if the sanctions go into effect--let's say that \nthe Congress says, ``OK. Yes. Mr. President, we think this should go \ninto effect,'' or if the President just chooses to put it into effect \nand says, ``Yes, we do have multilateral support, and, yes, we do have \nenough support to make the sanctions really bite to make them \nmeaningful''--if the sanctions go into effect, they remain so for two \nyears and then this procedure is repeated on the sanctions' second \nanniversary, and each anniversary thereafter. In other words, there \nwould be a time certain after every sanction in which the \nadministration would have to consider the effectiveness of it, a report \nto the Congress, and Congress then would either take appropriate action \nas they saw fit at that time or we let the sanctions continue on for \nanother year.\n  For sanctions already in effect at the time of enactment of this \nbill, this procedure is triggered at the next anniversary of the \nsanction if it has been in place for 2 years or more, or at the second \nanniversary for sanctions less than 2 years old.\n  So this proposed legislation is retrospective and prospective both. \nWe are trying to set down rules here that would apply and make sense on \nhow we will operate in the future with existing sanctions that are in \nthere now and ones that might be applied in the future under current \nand future laws of our land.\n  Madam President, this bill does not give the President carte blanche \nto waive congressionally mandated sanctions, as some bills do, and does \nnot allow a minority of the Senate to prevent sanctions from being \nlifted as is the case with some of our laws.\n  We have worked on this very hard, and I believe this bill provides a \nbalance of responsibilities between the President and the Congress. We \ndo not cut the President out of the equation. We do not cut the \nCongress out of the equation. We recognize our constitutional \nresponsibilities at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. This would apply \nin the imposition and removal of sanctions, and I urge the support of \nmy colleagues for this bill.\n  I know that a task force has been formed to look at some of the \nsanctions legislation, and I will be presenting this to that task force \nalso for its consideration. There are several bills that will address \nthis particular problem, but I think this bill really establishes a \nbalance, and I hope I can rely on my colleagues for support when this \nsubject comes to a vote.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7348-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7351-S7354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1999\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3056\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for the Federal Emergency Management \n                    Agency antiterrorism activities)\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Mikulski and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond], for himself and Ms. \n     Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 3056.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 73, line 11, strike ``$231,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$239,000,000, including $11,000,000 for assisting state and \n     local governments in preparing for and responding to \n     terrorist incidents''.\n       On page 42, line 14, strike ``$1,000,826,000'' and insert \n     ``$992,826,000''.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask it be considered en bloc as it \namends the bill in two places.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, this amendment responds to the critical \nrequirement of enhancing antiterrorist activities at the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. In our budget hearings with the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency, Senator Mikulski and I raised the question \nof whether this country is ready to respond and take all appropriate \nactions to deal with the threat of terrorist activities in our country. \nThe administration has submitted a budget amendment on June 8 to \nincrease spending in several agencies for antiterrorism activities, \nincluding $11 million more than the original budget request for FEMA's \nemergency planning and assistance. With this amendment we will meet the \nrequest.\n  The bill as reported by the committee adds $3 million above the \ninitial request for such activities, and this amendment now pending \nbefore the Senate would add another $8 million, for a total of $11 \nmillion in this key area. These funds are to be used for such critical \nactivities as planning at the Federal, State, and local level for the \nunique aspect of terrorist-related incidents.\n  I note this is part of a larger proposal for $249 million to \nstrengthen our ability to defend against and respond to terrorist \nincidents involving the use of biological or chemical weapons. I \nwholeheartedly support this effort. I think it is vitally important and \nI think this is a vital first step.\n  In a recent self-assessment by the States, they rated themselves as \nbeing unprepared in this critical area. The funds we are adding today \nshould go a long way in helping State and local governments prepare for \nthese instances that we hope they never have to face. But, as in all \nemergency management agencies' activities, we have to be prepared for \nthings that could happen that we hope never happen.\n  With this amendment, FEMA funding would total almost $18 million. The \nFEMA program, as I said, complements a broader initiative involving the \nDepartment of Defense, Department of Justice, and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services. That effort includes building a civilian \nstockpile of antidotes to respond to any large-scale attack, improving \nthe public health surveillance system, and providing special equipment \nto first responders.\n  We have already included in this bill assistance for first responders \nin dealing with a problem that is particularly acute in my State of \nMissouri, and that is the explosion of methamphetamine clandestine labs \nin our State. We have recognized in this bill the need to prepare first \nresponders--emergency personnel, firefighters, police--when they go \ninto a methamphetamine lab. These are very dangerous facilities that \ncan blow up with any kind of heat or light, or even the discharge of a \ngun. So we recognize that the people who do the vitally important work \nresponding to emergencies, whether they are firefighters or police or \nsheriffs units, the first responders as they are often called, need to \nbe prepared. In this amendment, we are going to provide additional \nassistance to the people who will come on the scenes first.\n  These are very frightening issues. The terrorism issue--we have \nalready experienced domestic acts of terrorism in Oklahoma City and at \nthe World Trade Center, so we know they can occur. We need to be \nprepared. We need to make our country as safe as possible. It is all \ntoo easy to ship weapons of mass destruction, be they explosives or \nchemical or biological weapons, even in a suitcase. This risk is not \nacceptable, and I strongly support the amendment as an important first \nstep towards dealing with these problems.\n  Our country has to be prepared to protect its citizens from the \ndangers of a hostile world. Unfortunately, the constant threat we face \nfrom rogue states makes it vital that Congress provide the funding for \nFEMA to use\n\n[[Page S7352]]\n\ntowards counterterrorism measures on a local level. Our amendment gives \nFEMA the funding it needs to enhance the training of emergency \npersonnel in the event that a terrorist attack occurs.\n  Madam President, I urge adoption of the amendment and I yield the \nfloor to my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I am pleased to join with Chairman \nBond in offering this FEMA amendment. As he has indicated, it provides \nan additional $8 million for the antiterrorist activities of FEMA, \ncombined with a $3 million increase provided in the full committee \nmarkup.\n  Now, this is really important. There are rogues, bums, and predators \nout there who want to destroy the United States of America. The United \nStates of America can be attacked and it can be attacked by another \nnation by a weapon of mass destruction, or it can be attacked by an \nexternal terrorist, or even someone within our own country.\n  What are weapons of mass destruction? They are, of course, nuclear \nweapons. They are, in addition to nuclear, chemical, biological, and \neven cybermanipulation.\n  The issues around chemical and biological weapons present new and \nunique threats to the United States of America. I am fortunate to have \ntwo outstanding military installations in my State, Fort Detrick as \nwell as Aberdeen, whose whole approach is to look into the research \nactivities on what could be the possible weapons used against us, \nwhether it be nerve gas or a despicable virus that could bring a city's \npopulation to its knees.\n  We were concerned in our hearing and raised this issue. Mr. James Lee \nWitt, the head of FEMA, said he did need to have more resources. In \nPresident Clinton's speech at the U.S. Naval Academy, he said that he \nhad directed the administration to undertake a concerted effort to \nprotect our people in the event of biological or chemical weapons being \nunleashed either by a rogue state, an international criminal \norganization, or a terrorist group. The key elements of this directive \nare, for the first time, a civilian stockpile of antidotes and \nantibiotics, protecting the population by public health surveillance to \ndetect biological or chemical agents, and analyzing the results of \ndiseases.\n  The President wants an additional $294 million to go to the Justice \nDepartment, the FBI, the Department of Health and Human Services, but \ncertainly to FEMA.\n  We support the FEMA request because it is very important. It is \nconsistent with its overall mission. They receive tasking under the \nNunn-Lugar-Domenici legislation that it protect us from all hazards, \nincluding weapons of mass destruction, and they need to do several \nthings: They need to play an important role in coordination, and they \nneed to do preparedness by working with States for planning and for \ntraining.\n  It is not only planning--we are not talking about endless summers of \nplanning--but actual exercises to prepare local agencies, from city \nfire departments to police departments to emergency medical personnel, \non what will be the way to both contain the attack and contain the \npanic around the attack. If we are hit by something from a rogue state \nor from an international criminal organization, one of the first \ninstances will be to contain the chemical attack or identify the \nbiological one. But people will be scared, they will be panic-stricken. \nThis is an unknown situation. It is FEMA's job to work with the \ncivilian population around the preparedness to do this.\n  We know that our colleagues in the Department of Defense, like at \nFort Detrick, we know that the National Institutes of Health and FDA \nwill be working on the antidotes and the vaccines to protect our \ncivilian population.\n  We believe that this amount of $17 million enhances the preparedness, \nwhich is to coordinate with the Department of Defense and the National \nGuard, with the Department of Health and Human Services, as well as \nState and local governments.\n  DOD, except through the National Guard, doesn't have a relationship \nwith State and local governments. They come in after the first \nresponders. So these funds are very important in developing a new \nmanual, in developing training in the State and local communities, \nparticularly in the high-risk areas that we know would be targeted by \nrogue states, to deal with their predatory acts.\n  We believe that this legislation will provide them with a downpayment \nto prepare. We have been so focused on moving FEMA from a cold-war \nagency to responding to the tremendous number of civilian natural \ndisasters we have had, and they have done an outstanding job. We now \nhave the infrastructure for them to respond to any risk that the United \nStates of America faces. Now when the ugly head of someone like Saddam \nHussein is raised or the ugly tentacles of international crime \norganizations try to do their predatory acts, we need to stand sentry \nwith our military and our intelligence agencies.\n  But for anyone who is thinking about doing harm in any way to the \nAmerican people, know we are well on our way to being prepared. We are \nprepared now, so don't think, if you are listening out there on CNN, \nwhere Saddam Hussein is, don't think we are not prepared. We are \nprepared, but we are even going to be better prepared. So don't even \nthink about doing it, because if you do, you will face us in return and \nknow we will take any and all means possible to protect our people and \nwe, the Federal emergency management appropriators, are ready to make \nsure they have the resources to begin the planning and the drills to \nprotect our people.\n  I support this amendment, and if there is no objection, I urge \nadoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

VA has no objection to this language, and it is in \nkeeping with the conveyance of land from Tuscaloosa authorized in the \nfiscal year 1997 VA-HUD bill.\n  Second, the amendment makes a technical correction to a provision \nunder the American Battle Monuments Commission.\n  Third, the amendment clarifies that States, in administering their \nclean water State revolving fund program, may charge borrowers loan \norigination fees. This language has been reviewed and approved by both \nEPA and the authorizing committee.\n  Fourth, the amendment would make a number of technical amendments to \nthe mark-to-market legislation enacted as part of the VA-HUD fiscal \nyear 1998 Appropriations Act with the concurrence of the administration \nand the Senate Banking Committee.\n  Fifth, on behalf of Senator Harkin, the amendment would require that \nEPA recognize the differences between the environmental effects caused \nby spills of animal fats and vegetable oils, as opposed to petroleum \noil, and issue regulations to accomplish this commonsense \ndifferentiation.\n  Finally, the amendment would clarify the owner's right to prepay \nunder the Preservation Program, as requested by the administration and \ncleared by the Senate Banking Committee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I think this is an outstanding \nmanagers' amendment. I think it resolves several issues related to the \nTuscaloosa Hospital, the American Battle Monuments Commission, as well \nas clarifying certain things with EPA.\n  I am particularly gratified that we will recognize the differences of \nthe environmental effects between animal fats and vegetable oils and \npetroleum oil. And I think this will be an important clarification for \nEPA to issue this commonsense differentiation. I have been at oil \nspills and I have also spilled some oil on my floor cooking those \nMaryland crab cakes, and I know the difference, and it will help EPA \nknow as well.\n\n[[Page S7354]]\n\n  So I am prepared to accept the amendment.\n  Mr. BOND.

RICHARDSON\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I welcome this opportunity to recognize \nthe valuable service given to Massachusetts by our state District Court \nJudge Maurice H. Richardson, who retired in June after serving the \ncitizens of Norfolk County with great distinction for nearly a quarter \ncentury.\n  Judge Richardson dedicated his career in the law to serving the \npeople of our state. As a judge he applied the law with great wisdom \nand compassion. He was well known for his ability to distinguish \nbetween hardened, habitual criminals and those who could take advantage \nof opportunities for rehabilitation. He encouraged many to seek \ncounseling, enter a drug or alcohol treatment program, or take other \nsteps to put their lives and their families back together.\n  During his years on the bench, Judge Richardson was also a skillful \nand tireless advocate for mental health. For many years he presided \nover mental health commitment hearings for several Massachusetts \nfacilities. He was dedicated to finding the most effective assistance \nfor the mentally ill, and often worked closely with doctors, patients \nand their families.\n  Judge Richardson also took the lead in the state judicial system and \nstate legislature to improve the way the mentally ill and the mentally \nretarded are treated by the state courts, and his efforts enhanced the \nquality of life for countless individuals and their families.\n  Judge Richardson has earned well-deserved recognition for his \nleadership and his achievements. Throughout his distinguished career, \nhe received numerous awards, including the District Court Award for \nJudicial Excellence from the Massachusetts Judges' Conference, the \nAnnual Award from the Bar Association of Norfolk County, and the \nCommissioners Award from the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health.\n  I am sure that my colleagues join me in commending Judge Richardson \nfor his distinguished service. We congratulate him on his extraordinary \ncareer and we extend our warmest wishes to Judge Richardson and his \nfamily on his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7354-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7354-S7355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              FIVE WINNERS PICKED TO ``CELEBRATE AMERICA''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, a few months ago, the American \nImmigration Lawyers Association held its second annual essay contest, \nentitled ``Celebrate America'' for fifth grade children across the \ncountry. The children were asked to write essays on the subject, ``Why \nI am Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants.''\n  Thousands of children entered the contest, and I congratulate all the \nparticipants. Five winners were selected, and were judged by a panel \nthat included our colleague Senator Abraham, Washington State Governor \nGary Locke, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Minnesota Supreme \nCourt Justice Alan Page, and myself.\n  The winner of this year's contest is Jaclyn Mals, from Decatur \nClassical School in Chicago, who wrote about her great-grandfather's \nimmigrant experience. In addition, four other students were honored for \ntheir essays--Tony Kudron of Livonia, MI, Samantha Fonseca-Moreira of \nLexington, MA, Mandi Steiner of West Hills, CA, and Kayla Weinstein of \nEncinitas, CA. All of the essays are an expression of the pride that we \nall share in our immigrant heritage, and emphasize what the nation \ngains from immigrants.\n  I congratulate each of these students, and I ask unanimous consent \nthat the five winning essays from the ``Celebrate America'' contest be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the essays were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            (By Jaclyn Mals)\n\n                          Miss Liberty and Me\n\n     This man, I'm told, was an immigrant,\n     arrived when he was young,\n     seven dollars in his pocket,\n     Spoke only a foreign tongue.\n\n     Miss Liberty greeted him at the shore,\n     and he smiled with great relief,\n     a new beginning was ahead,\n     in freedom, her torch did reach.\n\n     The years ahead were an adventure,\n     new language, new customs, and ways,\n     his children were his tutors,\n     to prosper in his days.\n\n     This man was my great grandpa,\n     and if you look around,\n     his story is quite familiar now,\n     in this multi-cultural crowd.\n\n     He gave us inspiration,\n     to welcome all who roam,\n     and light the way like Miss Liberty,\n     for those with no land to call home.\n\n     So whenever you meet a person,\n     who comes from a land that's not free\n     show them all they can be in freedom,\n     like Great Grandpa, Miss Liberty, and me.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Why I'm Glad America Is a Nation of Immigrants\n\n                            (By Tony Kudron)\n\n       Immigration has played a very important part in our \n     country's history. Many of our past immigrants passed through \n     Ellis Island from 1892 to 1943. It has been part of the \n     Liberty National Monument since 1965. Many of today's \n     immigrants come to the United States to be reunited with \n     their families. Others come here seeking employment, while \n     others look for political freedom.\n       My story of immigration is about my sister, Mia. She was \n     adopted from Seoul, Korea. One of the steps in the adoption \n     process was to petition the Department of INS. The \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service is our country's \n     government agency that administers our country's immigration \n     laws and procedures. Our social worker helped us with the \n     forms and procedures. There were several things that needed \n     to be done, but the two most important were that my parents \n     had to have their finger prints sent to the INS, and the \n     other was to fill out Form I-600 to Petition to Classify \n     Orphan as an Immediate Relative. The citizenship process took \n     six months. The next step was to go to the INS office in Port \n     Huron, Michigan. So, on November 15, 1996 my family went to \n     Port Huron.\n       We started the afternoon off by enjoying lunch at the \n     Thomas Edison Inn on the St. Clair River. After lunch we went \n     to our scheduled appointment at the INS office located by the \n     Blue Water Bridge. Mia was dressed in a red, white and blue \n     dress and was holding the American flag. There my parents \n     went over the paperwork with the officers and turned in Mia's \n     green card. They gave us a copy of her green card for her \n     baby book. Since Mia was just under two years\n\n[[Page S7355]]\n\n     old, my dad signed her certificate of U.S. Citizenship for \n     her. Now was the final step. With a very serious look on his \n     face the INS officer read Mia the Oath of Allegiance. Mia \n     stood on a chair in front of the officer's desk and listened \n     carefully as if she understood, nodding her head when \n     appropriate. It brought tears and smiles to all of our faces. \n     She also received a letter from President Clinton \n     congratulating her on becoming a U.S. citizen. So, I'm glad \n     America is a nation of immigrants because without immigration \n     to the U.S., I wouldn't have my beautiful little sister.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Why I Am Glad America Is a Nation of Immigrants\n\n                     (By Samantha Fonseca-Moreira)\n\n       America without immigrants, would be like a patchwork quilt \n     without the patches. Without immigrants there would be no \n     colors. The immigrants bring the colors to the quilt because \n     of their different cultures, religions and skin color. They \n     came to this country for different reasons; freedom, starting \n     a new life, making money and worshiping any way they choose. \n     Without immigrants America would not have become the great \n     nation that it is today.\n       The thread that sews the quilt together is made from the \n     struggles and hard times that many immigrants had to go \n     through when they came to the United States. One of the \n     reasons that the quilt is so strong and beautiful is that we \n     have worked hard together to make America a better country by \n     creating rules that are fair for everyone. The individual \n     patches are needed to create the beauty of the quilt. \n     Together they combined to form the patterns that make the \n     quilt complete.\n       The stuffing is made up of generations and generations of \n     new Americans that met and married, a German with an Irish, a \n     Chinese with a Portuguese, a Greek with a French, for a \n     Brazilian with a Canadian. Only in the United States could \n     this be possible. They bring stories and heritages that \n     become part of America. The quilt is a never ending project. \n     New immigrants arrive every day creating their own patches of \n     the American quilt.\n                                  ____\n\n\nWhy I Am Glad America Is a Nation of Immigrants--I Can Be Me in America\n\n                           (By Mandi Steiner)\n\n     I am who I am, and you are who you are\n     If you believe in me, and I believe in you,\n     We each can be a shining star\n     In our land of the red, white, and blue.\n\n     You are my sister, and you are my brother\n     It doesn't matter if you are Italian or Greek,\n     Let's remember to be kind to each other,\n     And respect the language we happen to speak.\n\n     We can learn so many new things,\n     About all the cultures that we meet\n     That we can travel without wings\n     By talking to new friends on our street.\n\n     I greet you with ``Hola'', and you say ``Bon Jour,''\n     But I know what you mean by the smile on your face.\n     So hand in hand we walk down the block to the store,\n     Not ever caring about color or race.\n\n     I feel lucky to sample the flavors we share\n     Chop suey, chili, and falafels galore\n     We sing, we eat, we show that we care.\n     We enjoy and then come back for more.\n\n     I am who I am, and you are who you are\n     We have roots to keep us proud without fear\n     Although we may have come from very far,\n     In America our voice will be heard loud and clear.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Immigrants Are the Key\n\n                          (By Kayla Weinstein)\n\n     Do you always think the grass is green,\n     Morning, evening, in-between?\n     Look much closer and you'll see\n     So many colors blend to be.\n\n     So many fishes in the sea\n     Designs and colors running free\n     But all are one and come together\n     Making life there so much better.\n\n     Blue's not the color of the sky\n     Both day and night I'll tell you why,\n     Pinks, oranges, purples must be seen\n     And all the colors in-between\n\n     And what about the pot of soup?\n     Beans, broccoli, peas and more to scoop\n     Each has a flavor of its own.\n     Together's when its name is known.\n\n     Our country's something of the same\n     All people share their county's fame\n     Were richer when we come together\n     Learning, sharing makes us better.\n\n     Difference makes our nation richer\n     Like juice for punch in one big pitcher\n     Like grass, like sky, like soup, like sea\n     Our land of immigrants is key!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7354-4", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bills were read the first time:\n\n       H.R. 2431.

A bill to amend chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, \nto increase the amount of leave time available to a\n\n[[Page S7358]]\n\nFederal employee in any year in connection with serving as an organ \ndonor, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n\n                        ORGAN DONOR LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. LEVIN: Mr. President, I introduce legislation which would \nincrease the amount of leave time available to a Federal employee who \nserves as an organ donor. Presently, Federal employees are allowed a \nmaximum of 7 days when serving as an organ or bone-marrow donor. \nAlthough a 7 day recovery period is sufficient for bone-marrow donors, \noften times, the donation of an organ requires a lengthier period for \nrecovery. This bill seeks to address this need.\n  Under this bill, Federal employees that serve as organ donors would \nbe allowed to take up to 30 days of leave for recovery. Thus, this \nlegislation provides Federal employees the security of knowing that \nthey can take sufficient leave time when considering the option of \norgan donation. This will also serve as a guide for both public and \nprivate employers who may wish to provide similar benefits to their \nemployees.\n  Medical technology and improved surgical techniques have improved the \nsurvival rate of persons needing an organ transplant. It is important \nthat the Federal Government continues to do whatever it can to assist \nthe medical community in encouraging citizens to become organ donors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a bill summary be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       The bill would increase the current limit of 7 days to 30 \n     days for organ donation. Recent surveys of doctors and \n     hospitals show that the current limit, while sufficient time \n     for bone-marrow donation, is an insufficient amount of time \n     for organ transplant procedures, where recovery time is \n     lengthier. This change would properly differentiate the two \n     types of donations to reflect that difference in the time it \n     takes to recuperate.\n       I would also amend the table of sections at the beginning \n     of chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, by adding after \n     the item relating to section 6327 a second section 6328 which \n     relates to absence due to funerals of fellow Federal law \n     enforcement officers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 2262 A bill to amend chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, \nrelating to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, to enable \nthe Federal Government to enroll an employee and the family of the \nemployee in the program when a State court orders the employee to \nprovide health insurance coverage for a child of an employee but the \nemployee fails to provide the coverage, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n    Federal Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 1998\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefit Children's Equity Act of 1998.\n  This legislation concerns Federal employees who are under a court \norder to provide health insurance to their dependent children. If a \nFederal employee is under such a court order and his dependent children \nhave no health insurance coverage, the Federal government would be \nauthorized to enroll the employee in a ``family coverage'' health plan. \nIf the employee is not enrolled in any health care plan, the Federal \ngovernment would be authorized to enroll the employee in the ``family \ncoverage'' plan of the standard option of the service benefit plan, \ntypically Blue Cross/Blue Shield. The bill would also prevent the \nemployee from canceling health coverage for his children for the term \nof the court order.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1 provides the bill's short title, the ``Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits Children's Equity Act of 1997.''\n       Section 2 would amend 5 U.S.C. Sec. 8905 by adding a new \n     subsection (f) to allow an employee who is not enrolled in an \n     FEHB plan to enroll in a plan for self and family coverage if \n     the employee is required by a court order or administrative \n     order to provide health insurance coverage for a child who \n     meets the definition of ``member of family'' under 5 U.S.C. \n     8901(5). Moreover, if such an employee fails to enroll and \n     cannot show that the child is covered by other health \n     insurance, this section would require the employing agency to \n     enroll the employee for self and family under the low-option \n     Service Benefit Plan (currently Blue Cross/Blue Shield).\n       Section 2 also prescribes similar treatment for a \n     similarly-situated employee who is enrolled as an individual \n     in an FEHB plan. The amendment would ensure that, under the \n     circumstances described in the preceding paragraph, the \n     employee's enrollment would be changed to a self and family \n     enrollment that would cover the child. An employee who did \n     not so change his or her enrollment voluntarily would be \n     enrolled for self and family in the same plan in which the \n     employee was already covered as an individual, unless that \n     plan does not provide full benefits and services where the \n     child resides. In the latter event, the employee would be \n     enrolled for self and family under the low-option Service \n     Benefit Plan.\n       Finally, Section 2 would create the new section 8905(f) of \n     title 5 that would bar the employee from discontinuing the \n     self and family enrollment as long as the order remains in \n     effect and the child continues to meet the definition in \n     section 8901(f), unless the employee can show that the child \n     has other health insurance.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. \n        Harkin, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2263. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \nthe expansion, intensification, and coordination of the activities of \nthe National Institutes of Health with respect to research on autism; \nto the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              advancement in pediatric autism research act\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, today, I join with my colleagues \nSenators Lieberman, Faircloth, Harkin, and Boxer to introduce \nlegislation that will build on current scientific advances in \nunderstanding autism and will promote additional research in this \npromising field. Many think autism is rare. In fact, it is the third \nmost prevalent childhood disability, affecting an estimated four \nhundred thousand Americans and their families. It is also a condition \nthat doctors and scientists believe can be cured. It is not something \nthat we simply must accept.\n  When people think of autism they might remember the character played \nby Dustin Hoffman in the movie ``Rainman.'' Yet autism has many faces; \nit affects people from every background, social and ethnic category. \nChildren with autism may be profoundly retarded and may never learn to \nspeak, while others may be extremely hyperactive and bright. Some may \nhave extraordinary talents, such as an exceptional memory or skill in \nmathematics. However, all share the common traits of difficulty with \ncommunication and social interaction. And for reasons we do not yet \nunderstand, eighty percent of those with autism are males.\n  But autism is not about statistics or medical definitions--it is \nabout children and families. The Kruegers, from Washington state, have \nan all too typical story. Their little girl Chanel developed like any \nother child--she happily played with her parents, took her first steps, \nlearned some of her first words and then she started to regress. In \nfour short months, by the time she was two, Chanel had become almost \ncompletely enveloped in her own private world. Chanel's mother told me \n``it was like somebody came in the middle of the night and took my \nchild.''\n  Like many children with autism, the Krueger's daughter no longer \nresponded when her parents called her name; words she once spoke \nclearly became garbled; and socializing became more and more difficult. \nFortunately, due to her parents dedication and intervention Chanel \nKrueger at age 5, is doing remarkably well.\n  But, many autistic children completely lose the ability to interact \nwith the outside world. The hours these kids should be spending in \nlittle league or playing with their friends are often spent staring out \nthe window, transfixed by the dust floating in the sunlight or the \npattern of leaves on the ground.\n  Even today, with advances in therapy and early intervention, few of \nthese children will go to college, hold a regular job, live \nindependently or marry. More than half never learn how to speak.\n  The facts about autism can be sobering--but there is hope. Early \nintervention and treatment has helped many\n\n[[Page S7359]]\n\nchildren. Science has also made great strides in understanding this \ndisorder. We now know that autism is a biological condition, it is not \nan emotional problem and it is not caused by faulty parenting. \nScientists believe that autism is one of the most heritable \ndevelopmental disorders and is the most likely to benefit from the \nlatest advances in genetics and neurology. Once the genetic link is \ndiscovered, the opportunitis for understanding, treating, and \neventually curing autism are endless.\n\n  The promise of research is exactly why I am introducing this \nlegislation and my colleague Representative Jim Greenwood has \nintroduced similar legislation in the House. This bill will increase \nthe federal commitment to autism research. Its cornerstone is \nauthorization for five Centers of Excellence where basic researchers, \nclinicians and scientists can come together to increase our \nunderstanding of this devastating disorder.\n  I also want to encourage the collaboration beginning to take place \nbetween the various Institutes at the HIH conducting autism research. \nThe bill formalizes the current autism coordinating committee and \nincludes a mechanism to ensure public input.\n  While we are hoping to advance our understanding and treatment of \nautism through research, it is also important that pediatricians and \nother health professionals have the most current information so that \nchildren and their families can receive help as early as possible. The \nbill includes authorization for an Autism Awareness Program to educate \ndoctors and other health professionals about autism.\n  Finally, the bill includes a provision to fund a gene and brain \ntissue bank developed from families affected with autism to be \navailable for research purposes. This library of genetic information \nshould be a valuable tool for researchers trying to identify the \ngenetic basis for the disorder.\n  While the focus of this bill is on autism, advances in this area are \nalso likely to shed light on related problems such as attention deficit \ndisorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and various seizure disorders \nand learning disabilities.\n  Research is the key to unlocking the door and freeing those with \nautism from the isolation and loneliness of their private world. This \nbill is intended to give the NIH the resources to take advantage of the \ntremendous opportunity before us to find more effective treatments and \nultimately a cure for autism. The promise is real. Fulfillment of that \npromise only requires our commitment. I urge my Senate colleagues to \nsupport this important investment in the future of our children and our \nNation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 2264. A bill to revise, codify, and enact without substantive \nchange certain general and permanent laws, related to patriotic and \nnational observances, ceremonies, and organizations, as title 36, \nUnited States Code, ``Patriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, \nand Organizations''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n   PATRIOTIC AND NATIONAL OBSERVANCES, CEREMONIES, AND ORGANIZATIONS \n                            CODIFICATION ACT\n\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nPatriotic and National Observances, Ceremonies, and Organizations \nCodification Act.\n  This legislation will codify as title 36, United States Code, certain \ngeneral and permanent laws related to various Federally chartered \npatriotic and national observances, ceremonies, and organizations. \nWithout making substantive changes, this bill restates existing law to \nremove ambiguities and inconsistencies and repeals obsolete, \nunnecessary, and superseded provisions.\n  Some of the important organizations whose charters will be codified \nwith this legislation include, among other: The American Legion, The \nAmerican Society of International Law, Army and Navy Union of the \nUnited States of America, Boy Scouts of America, Boys & Girls Clubs of \nAmerica, Congressional Medal of Honor Society of the United States of \nAmerica, Girl Scouts of the United States of America, Jewish War \nVeterans of the United States of America, Incorporated, Little League \nBaseball, Incorporated, National Academy of Sciences, National Fund for \nMedical Education, United States Olympic Committee, The American \nNational Red Cross.\n  The bill was drafted by the Office of the Law Revision Counsel under \nthe Office's statutory mandate to prepare and submit periodically to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, one \ntitle at a time, a restatement and revision of the general and \npermanent laws of the United States for enactment into positive law (2 \nU.S.C. 285b).\n\n

Mr. President, on Friday, June 26th, the day the \nSenate adjourned for the July 4th recess, I introduced the Trade Law \nEnforcement Improvement Act of 1998. This bill would clarify an \nambiguity in an important U.S. antitrust law and thereby ensure that \nU.S. law will be effectively utilized to combat anticompetitive foreign \ncartels, acts, and conspiracies designed to unfairly exclude American \nproducts from overseas markets.\n  The principal aim of my bill is to codify the U.S. Department of \nJustice's (DOJ) current--and correct--interpretation of the Foreign \nTrade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA) which is currently \nembodied in Footnote 62 of the International Antitrust Guidelines. This \nfootnote makes it clear that there are no unnecessary jurisdictional \nobstacles to challenging anticompetitive acts and conspiracies that \ntake place outside our borders.\n  The FTAIA authorized the U.S. to assert jurisdiction over \nanticompetitive conduct abroad that has a ``direct, substantial and \nreasonably foreseeable'' effect on export trade or commerce or those \nengaged in export trade or commerce with foreign nations. However, in \n1998 DOJ issued International Enforcement Guidelines which included \nFootnote 159, a new interpretation of FTAIA confining U.S. enforcement \nefforts solely to anticompetitive conduct that affected U.S. consumers, \nwithout regard to its effect on U.S. exporters. Specifically, the \nfootnote announced that henceforth ``the Department [would be] \nconcerned only with adverse effects on competition that would harm U.S. \nconsumers * * * .''\n  Fortunately, in 1992, DOJ announced that Footnote 159 would be \nsuperseded by a policy which recognized that harm to U.S. exporters was \nsufficient to trigger an antitrust enforcement action regardless of \nwhether there were harmful effects on U.S. consumers. Thus, the \ninterpretation was revised to affirmatively permit DOJ to enforce ``our \nantitrust laws against anticompetitive practices that harm U.S. \ncommerce.'' That interpretation now appears in Footnote 62 of the \ncurrent International Enforcement Guidelines.\n  While the correction to Footnote 159 was drafted by Assistant \nAttorney General Jim Rill in the Bush Administration, it is important \nto note that it has been fully endorsed by the Clinton Administration. \nAssistant Attorneys General Rill, Bingaman, and Klein should all be \nrecognized and commended for their strong leadership in strengthening \ninternational antitrust enforcement and for bringing cases under the \nauthority of the FTAIA.\n  Let me describe why this provision in our trade law is so important \nand why it is crucial that it be properly interpreted and enforced.\n  The opening of global markets has advanced America's current economic \nprosperity, but it also poses fundamental challenges for U.S. antitrust \nlaws. One example is the U.S. flat glass industry. For the better part \nof a decade, America's leading flat glass producers have been seeking \naccess to the Japanese market, the largest and richest in Asia. \nAmerican companies are already leaders in producing and selling high-\nquality innovative glass products around the world. U.S. firms have \nbeen very successful in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Latin \nAmerica--but not yet Japan. The fact is that securing effective \ndistribution channels for American glass has not proved to be a \nsignificant barrier to entry in any country other than Japan.\n  It is not for a lack of trying. In 1992, President Bush and Japanese \nPrime Minister Miyazawa negotiated an agreement in which Japan \ncommitted that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) would study \nanticompetitive practices in the flat glass sector. For over a quarter-\ncentury, the Japanese market has been controlled by a cartel, \nconsisting of the three leading Japanese producers--Asahi, Nippon, and \nCentral. Because of the cartel, market shares for the three companies \nhave been remarkably constant: Asahi has had a 50% market share, Nippon \nhas had 30%, and Central has had 20% for nearly three decades, while \nother major markets in Europe and North America have undergone dramatic \ncompetitive shifts.\n  When the JFTC, one year later, issued its report, it found a long-\nstanding history of anticompetitive practices in the Japanese flat \nglass industry, but concluded that enforcement action was \n``inappropriate.''\n\n[[Page S7363]]\n\n  In 1995, the Clinton Administration concluded a new trade agreement \nin the U.S.-Japan Framework talks. Japan committed to ``deal with \nstructural and sectoral issues in order substantially to increase \naccess and sales of competitive foreign goods and services.'' For their \npart, Japanese flat glass manufacturers and distributors pledged \npublicly that the market would be open on a non-discriminatory basis \nfor competition by all suppliers, foreign and domestic alike. It was \nagreed that the U.S. and Japanese Governments would jointly monitor \nprogress to verify that Japanese distributors would deal in imported \nglass, ``recognizing that token dealings or use does not demonstrate \ndiversification of supply sources.''\n  So what happened? Trade agreements have done nothing to shake the \nglass cartel's stranglehold on Japan's distribution system. Instead, \ndespite a remarkable series of U.S.-Japan trade agreements, \ncommitments, and undertakings, the market share of U.S. producers has \nincreased from 1.0% to 1.5%, even though imported foreign-affiliated \nglass costs about 30% less. In short, despite years of intensive \nefforts by U.S. negotiators, an illegal cartel continues to control the \nJapanese glass market to the exclusion of U.S. producers.\n  Two weeks ago, Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Richard Fisher \npresented the latest U.S. proposal to the Government of Japan. The \nproposal was drafted by the Antitrust Division of DOJ. USTR is asking \nthe Japanese Government to establish antitrust-type compliance plans \nfor its glass sector that would be modeled on the compliance plans \ncurrently in effect at most major U.S. corporations. In other words, we \nare not asking anything from Japanese companies that we do not already \nexpect of U.S. companies. But reportedly senior Japanese officials \nflatly rejected the U.S. proposal, making it clear that they have \nlittle regard for robust compliance plans that would deter \nanticompetitive conduct on the part of management and sales personnel.\n  Mr. President, it is precisely such intractable trade disputes that \nthe FTAIA was intended to address, and it is vital that we make use of \nthe one instrument we currently have at our disposal to rectify such \nproblems. Given the confusion and uncertainty that has surrounded this \nprovision of our antitrust trade law due to the conflicting \ninterpretations that various administrations have attached to it, it is \nimportant for us to eliminate any vestige of ambiguity that may still \nremain even after we have gone back to its original interpretation.\n  By clarifying the jurisdictional requirements of the FTAIA, it is my \nhope that we can encourage DOJ and injured U.S. industries to make \nbroad use of this important power by challenging cartels, such as those \nblocking distribution of U.S. flat glass in Japan, in the U.S. courts, \nbefore U.S. juries, under U.S. law. My bill makes simply a \nstraightforward point: anticompetitive foreign cartels and conspiracies \nare subject to U.S. antitrust laws, and foreign companies who engage in \nsuch activities will be held accountable and dealt with accordingly. We \nmust ensure that American firms and workers have a timely and effective \nremedy against those who would engage in anticompetitive acts designed \nto exclude American products or services from the international \nmarketplace.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord, and I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and to \ncosponsor and support it.\n  The text of the bill follows:\n\n                                S. 2252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to commend the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Armed Services Committee for their fine \nwork on the Strom Thurmond Defense Authorization Bill which passed the \nSenate by a vote of 88-4 on June 25th of this year. The nearly \nunanimous support by this body for this $270 billion authorization bill \nis a real tribute to their diligence and foresight.\n  This bill will deservedly bear the name of my good friend Chairman \nThurmond in recognition of his life-long commitment to the defense of \nthis nation. Some may think that the Chairman s devotion to national \ndefense began with his assignment to the Armed Services Committee some \nforty years ago, but they would be mistaken. In fact, Senator Thurmond \njoined the Army reserves in 1924. Shortly after the United States \ndeclared war against Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany in 1941, at the \nage of 39, Senator Thurmond resigned his judgeship and joined the Army. \nAs a member of the elite 82nd Airborne Unit, he worked behind enemy \nlines in advance of the D-Day invasion force which landed 54 years ago \nthis month. He won a Legion of Merit and rose to the rank of Major \nGeneral in the Army Reserve. So Senator Thurmond has not only played a \nmajor role in developing national defense policy, but he has literally \nstood at the vanguard in the defense of this nation.\n  The bill bears the imprint of his strong commitment to the national \ndefense. In addition to procuring world-class weapons systems and \npreserving troop readiness, the bill includes a 3.6% pay increase for \nour soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. The men and women who serve \non the front lines deserve that increase for their determination and \ncommitment in defending this nation.\n  For the retirees who served in the Armed Forces for most of their \nlives, this bill includes three health care demonstration projects. The \ngoal is to provide the best possible health care to the protectors of \nthis nation by eliminating the weaknesses of the present system.\n  The bill provides $2.7 billion for the second New Attack Submarine \nwhich will be built by Electric Boat and Newport News Shipbuilding. \nThese two shipyards, the finest in the nation, will continue to build \nthe world s most capable submarines.\n  I am concerned, however, by reports that the Navy's strength may drop \nbelow 300 ships and the attack submarine force below 50 submarines. \nRecent events in the Persian Gulf and on the Indian subcontinent should \nserve as reminders that we face an uncertain future. We must not allow \nourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security that would have \nus cut the number of submarines to less than half of Cold War levels. \nAfter all, a couple of submarines can cut off the world's supply of oil \nfrom the Persian Gulf. We have worked too hard during two world wars \nand the Cold War to let our guard down now, and I believe we must \nremain vigilant.\n  The Senate Armed Services Committee deserves praise for adding eight \nUH-60 Blackhawk helicopters to the President's request for a total of \n34 Blackhawk-type helicopters. Four of these versatile aircraft will be \ndelivered to the Navy, twelve will be delivered to the Army, and \neighteen will go to the National Guard. Most of the Blackhawks will \nreplace Vietnam-era Huey helicopters that cannot meet everyday \ncommitments. I hope that we will see a larger request from the \nPresident next year in recognition of the needs of all three services.\n  Finally, this bill fully funds other vitally important defense \nprograms, including the Comanche helicopter, the C-17 cargo aircraft, \nthe F-22 fighter and the JSTARS aircraft. These systems will be \nelements in this nation's\n\n[[Page S7364]]\n\narsenal for decades to come. The Committee's careful consideration of \nthese programs led them to decisions that I whole-heartedly support.\n  As a whole, the bill is good for this nation's defense and it is \nvitally important in the less-predictable world of today. I am proud to \nstand with my colleagues on the Committee and the vast majority of the \nSenate in supporting this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7363-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CBO COST ESTIMATE--S. 1403\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI.

Because the bill could increase direct spending, \n     pay-as-you-go procedures would apply. CBO estimates, however, \n     that any such effects would be negligible. The bill contains \n     no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in \n     the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on \n     state, local, or tribal governments.\n       S. 1403 would create two programs related to historic \n     lighthouses. The first of these would be a program to \n     preserve national historic lighthouses, under which the \n     National Park Service (NPS) would collect information about \n     such facilities and would support related education and \n     research projects. The second would be a process under which \n     the federal government--acting through the NPS and the \n     General Services Administration (GSA--would convey or sell \n     surplus lighthouses to nonfederal entities. The bill would \n     authorize the appropriation of whatever amounts are necessary \n     to carry out these programs. In addition, proceeds from any \n     sales of lighthouses under the bill could be spent without \n     further appropriation for the NPS's national maritime \n     heritage grant program. Under existing law, proceeds from \n     sales of property such as lighthouses are treated as \n     offsetting receipts and cannot be spent without appropriation \n     action.\n       The NPS, GSA, and other federal agencies, such as the U.S. \n     Coast Guard, already perform many of the duties that would be \n     required by S. 1403, including both preserving historic \n     lighthouses and disposing of surplus stations. Based on \n     information provided by the NPS, CBO estimates that the \n     federal government would spend less than $500,000 annually in \n     appropriated funds to carry out the more formal preservation \n     program required by this legislation and to process \n     lighthouse conveyances under the new disposal process.\n       CBO estimates that any effect on direct spending would be \n     insignificant because the government would be as unlikely to \n     sell any lighthouses under this legislation as it is under \n     existing authorities. Entities eligible to receive title to \n     historic lighthouses under this bill would include state and \n     local agencies. Participation by such agencies and any \n     related costs would be voluntary on their part.\n       The CBO staff contacts are Deborah Reis (for federal costs) \n     and Marjorie Miller (for the state and local impact). This \n     estimate was approved by Robert A. Sunshine, Deputy Assistant \n     Director for Budget Analysis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7364-1", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REMARKS HONORING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CHILDREN'S PROGRAM OF \n                            NORTHERN IRELAND\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to mark a \nsignificant milestone: the Minnesota-based Children's Program of \nNorthern Ireland is celebrating its 25th anniversary this summer.\n  This important program began in 1973 when one nine-year-old from \nBelfast, David Hughes, traveled to Minnesota and stayed with Roy and \nRuth Lerud of Twin Valley.\n  From this simple beginning, wondrous things have happened.\n  During the following summer, Rotary Clubs in Hibbing, Minnesota, and \nBelfast, Northern Ireland, joined together to bring 120 children, ages \n10-11, to Minnesota host families.\n  And now, 25 years later, the program can boast that more than 4,000 \nchildren have come to Minnesota and neighboring states. These children \nhave had their lives touched in immeasurable ways. And they have \ntouched the lives of untold thousands of Minnesotans.\n  The Children's Program of Northern Ireland was the first of its kind \nin the nation. It is now the blueprint of 25 other, similar programs \nthroughout America which bring children to Minnesota for a summer of \npeace and understanding.\n  Something important is at work here--Minnesotans are working to bring \nabout peace, one child at a time. When the good people of Minnesota got \ninvolved in this program 25 years ago it was because they saw the need \nand stepped in to fill it. There were no Presidential Commissions or \ncalls by Congress asking citizens to become involved. Rather, there \nwere everyday heroes and heroines who tried to make their world better \nby opening their homes to a child from a troubled part of the world.\n  And they have succeeded.\n  Rotary is proud, and rightly so, of its motto ``Service Above Self.'' \nThe Hibbing Rotary Club and the Belfast Rotary Club, in 1974, were \nliving embodiments of this motto, as are all the people throughout \nMinnesota and Northern Ireland whose hard work and dedication have made \nthis program such an enduring success.\n  From the beginning these selfless efforts have been driven by \nvolunteers. I would like to recognize, on the floor of the United \nStates Senate, two of those volunteers. Hazel Busby is the coordinator \nin Belfast. She has been a tireless and enthusiastic volunteer for \nmany, many years. I also would like to recognize Kathy Schultz, who is \nthe current American board president. Both of these women merit the \nhighest recognition for their contributions toward achieving peace in \nour time.\n  None of us can know exactly how significant these Minnesota efforts \nhave been in bringing peace and understanding to our world. However, we \ncan know that the work of these fine people has brought a large measure \nof peace and understanding to untold thousands on both sides of the \nAtlantic. And that, in and of itself, merits recognition and highest \npraise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7364-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7364-S7441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n STROM THURMOND NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 1999\n\n  The Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n1999 (S. 2057), passed by the Senate on June 25, 1998, is as follows:\n\n                                S. 2057\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina first became a \n     member of the Committee on Armed Services of the United \n     States Senate on January 19, 1959. His continuous service on \n     that committee covers more than 75 percent of the period of \n     the existence of the committee, which was established \n     immediately after World War II, and more than 20 percent of \n     the period of the existence of military and naval affairs \n     committees of Congress, the original bodies of which were \n     formed in 1816.\n       (2) Senator Thurmond came to Congress and the committee as \n     a distinguished veteran of service, including combat service, \n     in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n       (3) Senator Thurmond was commissioned as a reserve second \n     lieutenant of infantry in 1924. He served with great \n     distinction with the First Army in the European Theater of \n     Operations during World War II, landing in Normandy in a \n     glider with the 82nd Airborne Division on D-Day. He was \n     transferred to the Pacific Theater of Operations at the end \n     of the war in Europe and was serving in the Philippines when \n     Japan surrendered.\n       (4) Having reverted to Reserve status at the end of World \n     War II, Senator Thurmond was promoted to brigadier general in \n     the United States Army Reserve in 1954. He served as \n     President of the Reserve Officers Association beginning that \n     same year and ending in 1955. Senator Thurmond was promoted \n     to major general in the United States Army Reserve in 1959. \n     He transferred to the Retired Reserve on January 1, 1965, \n     after 36 years of commissioned service.\n\n[[Page S7365]]\n\n       (5) The distinguished character of Senator Thurmond's \n     military service has been recognized by awards of numerous \n     decorations that include the Legion of Merit, the Bronze Star \n     medal with ``V'' device, the Army Commendation Medal, the \n     Belgian Cross of the Order of the Crown, and the French Croix \n     de Guerre.\n       (6) Senator Thurmond has served as Chairman of the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate since 1995 and as \n     the ranking minority member of the committee from 1993 to \n     1995. Senator Thurmond concludes his service as Chairman at \n     the end of the One Hundred Fifth Congress, but is to continue \n     to serve the committee as a member in successive Congresses.\n       (7) This Act is the fortieth annual authorization bill for \n     the Department of Defense for which Senator Thurmond has \n     taken a major responsibility as a member of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the Senate.\n       (8) Senator Thurmond, as officer and legislator, has made \n     matchless contributions to the national security of the \n     United States that, in duration and in quality, are unique.\n       (9) It is altogether fitting and proper that this Act, the \n     last annual authorization Act for the national defense that \n     Senator Thurmond manages in and for the United States Senate \n     as Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate, \n     be named in his honor.\n       (b) Short Title.--This Act shall be cited as the ``Strom \n     Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     1999''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

It is estimated that there \n     are approximately 39,000 patients, ranging in age from babies \n     to those in retirement, awaiting transplants of kidneys, \n     hearts, livers, and other solid organs.\n       (3) The Department of Defense has made significant progress \n     in increasing the awareness of the importance of organ and \n     tissue donations among members of the Armed Forces.\n       (4) The inclusion of organ and tissue donor elections in \n     the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) \n     central database through the Real-time Automated Personnel \n     Identification System (RAPIDS) represents a major step in \n     ensuring that organ and tissue donor elections are a matter \n     of record and are accessible in a timely manner.\n       (b) Responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the advanced systems \n     developed for recording Armed Forces members' personal data \n     and information (such as the SMARTCARD, MEDITAG, and Personal \n     Information Carrier) include the capability to record organ \n     and tissue donation elections.\n       (c) Responsibilities of the Secretaries of the Military \n     Departments.--The Secretaries of the military departments \n     shall ensure that--\n       (1) appropriate information about organ and tissue donation \n     is provided to each recruit and officer candidate of the \n     Armed Forces during initial training;\n       (2) members of the Armed Forces are given recurring, \n     specific opportunities to elect to be organ or tissue donors \n     during service in the Armed Forces and upon retirement; and\n       (3) members of the Armed Forces electing to be organ or \n     tissue donors are encouraged to advise their next of kin \n     concerning the donation decision and any subsequent change of \n     that decision.\n       (d) Responsibilities of the Surgeons General of the \n     Military Department.--The Surgeons General of the Armed \n     Forces shall ensure that--\n       (1) appropriate training is provided to enlisted and \n     officer medical personnel to facilitate the effective \n     operation of organ and tissue donation activities under \n     garrison conditions and, to the extent possible, under \n     operational conditions; and\n       (2) medical logistical activities can, to the extent \n     possible without jeopardizing operational requirements, \n     support an effective organ and tissue donation program.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than September 1, 1999, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives a report on the status of the \n     implementation of this section.\n\n     SEC. 706. JOINT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS REVIEWS RELATING TO \n                   INTERDEPARTMENTAL COOPERATION IN THE DELIVERY \n                   OF MEDICAL CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The military health care system of the Department of \n     Defense and the Veterans Health Administration of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs are national institutions that \n     collectively manage more than 1,500 hospitals, clinics, and \n     health care facilities worldwide to provide services to more \n     than 11,000,000 beneficiaries.\n       (2) In the post-Cold War era, these institutions are in a \n     profound transition that involves challenging opportunities.\n       (3) During the period from 1988 to 1998, the number of \n     military medical personnel has declined by 15 percent and the \n     number of military hospitals has been reduced by one-third.\n       (4) During the two years since 1996, the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs has revitalized its structure by \n     decentralizing authority into 22 Veterans Integrated Service \n     Networks.\n       (5) In the face of increasing costs of medical care, \n     increased demands for health care services, and increasing \n     budgetary constraints, the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs have embarked on a variety of \n     dynamic and innovative cooperative programs ranging from \n     shared services to joint venture operations of medical \n     facilities.\n       (6) In 1984, there was a combined total of 102 Department \n     of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense facilities with \n     sharing agreements. By 1997, that number had grown to 420. \n     During the six years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal \n     year 1997, shared services increased from slightly over 3,000 \n     services to more than 6,000 services ranging from major \n     medical and surgical services, laundry, blood, and laboratory \n     services to unusual speciality care services.\n       (7) The Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs are conducting four health care joint \n     ventures in New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, and are \n     planning to conduct four more such ventures in Alaska, \n     Florida, Hawaii, and California.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs are to be commended for the cooperation \n     between the two departments in the delivery of medical care, \n     of which the cooperation involved in the establishment and \n     operation of the Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Executive Council is a praiseworthy example;\n       (2) the two departments are encouraged to continue to \n     explore new opportunities to enhance the availability and \n     delivery of medical care to beneficiaries by further \n     enhancing the cooperative efforts of the departments; and\n       (3) enhanced cooperation is encouraged for--\n       (A) the general areas of access to quality medical care, \n     identification and elimination of impediments to enhanced \n     cooperation, and joint research and program development; and\n       (B) the specific areas in which there is significant \n     potential to achieve progress in cooperation in a short term, \n     including computerization of patient records systems, \n     participation of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the \n     TRICARE program, pharmaceutical programs, and joint physical \n     examinations.\n       (c) Joint Survey of Populations Served.--(1) The Secretary \n     of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     jointly conduct a survey of their respective medical care \n     beneficiary populations to identify, by category of \n     beneficiary (defined as the Secretaries consider \n     appropriate), the expectations of, requirements for, and \n     behavior patterns of the beneficiaries with respect to \n     medical care. The two Secretaries shall develop the protocol \n     for the survey jointly, but shall obtain the services of an \n     entity independent of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs for carrying out the survey.\n       (2) The survey shall include the following:\n       (A) Demographic characteristics, economic characteristics, \n     and geographic location of beneficiary populations with \n     regard to catchment or service areas.\n       (B) The types and frequency of care required by veterans, \n     retirees, and dependents within catchment or service areas of \n     Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs medical facilities \n     and outside those areas.\n       (C) The numbers of, characteristics of, and types of \n     medical care needed by the veterans, retirees, and dependents \n     who, though eligible for medical care in Department of \n     Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs treatment \n     facilities or other federally funded medical programs, choose \n     not to seek medical care from those facilities or under those \n     programs, and the reasons for that choice.\n       (D) The obstacles or disincentives for seeking medical care \n     from such facilities or under such programs that veterans, \n     retirees, and dependents perceive.\n       (E) Any other matters that the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs consider appropriate for the \n     survey.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall submit a report on the results of the survey to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress. The report shall \n     contain the matters described in paragraph (2) and any \n     proposals for legislation that the Secretaries recommend for \n     enhancing Department of Defense and Department of Veterans \n     Affairs cooperative efforts with respect to the delivery of \n     medical care.\n       (d) Review of Law and Policies.--(1) The Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall jointly \n     conduct a review to identify impediments to cooperation \n     between the Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs regarding the delivery of medical care. The \n     matters reviewed shall include the following:\n\n[[Page S7389]]\n\n       (A) All laws, policies, and regulations, and any attitudes \n     of beneficiaries of the health care systems of the two \n     departments, that have the effect of preventing the \n     establishment, or limiting the effectiveness, of cooperative \n     health care programs of the departments.\n       (B) The requirements and practices involved in the \n     credentialling and licensure of health care providers.\n       (C) The perceptions of beneficiaries in a variety of \n     categories (defined as the Secretaries consider appropriate) \n     regarding the various Federal health care systems available \n     for their use.\n       (2) The Secretaries shall jointly submit a report on the \n     results of the review to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress. The report shall include any proposals for \n     legislation that the Secretaries recommend for eliminating or \n     reducing impediments to interdepartmental cooperation that \n     are identified during the review.\n       (e) Participation in TRICARE.--(1) The Secretary of Defense \n     shall review the TRICARE program to identify opportunities \n     for increased participation by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs in that program. The ongoing collaboration between \n     Department of Defense officials and Department of Veterans \n     Affairs officials regarding increasing the participation \n     shall be included among the matters reviewed.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall jointly submit to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress a semiannual report on the status of the review and \n     on efforts to increase the participation of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs in the TRICARE program. No report is \n     required under this paragraph after the submission of a \n     semiannual report in which the Secretaries declare that the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs is participating in the \n     TRICARE program to the extent that can reasonably be expected \n     to be attained.\n       (f) Pharmaceutical Benefits and Programs.--(1) The Federal \n     Pharmaceutical Steering Committee shall--\n       (A) undertake a comprehensive examination of existing \n     pharmaceutical benefits and programs for beneficiaries of \n     Federal medical care programs, including matters relating to \n     the purchasing, distribution, and dispensing of \n     pharmaceuticals and the management of mail order \n     pharmaceuticals programs; and\n       (B) review the existing methods for contracting for and \n     distributing medical supplies and services.\n       (2) The committee shall submit a report on the results of \n     the examination to the appropriate committees of Congress.\n       (g) Standardization of Physical Examinations for \n     Disability.--The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs shall submit to the appropriate committees \n     of Congress a report on the status of the efforts of the \n     Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     to standardize physical examinations administered by the two \n     departments for the purpose of determining or rating \n     disabilities.\n       (h) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--For the \n     purposes of this section, the appropriate committees of \n     Congress are as follows:\n       (1) The Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the Senate.\n       (2) The Committee on National Security and the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives.\n       (i) Deadlines for Submission of Reports.--(1) The report \n     required by subsection (c)(3) shall be submitted not later \n     than January 1, 2000.\n       (2) The report required by subsection (d)(2) shall be \n     submitted not later than March 1, 1999.\n       (3) The semiannual report required by subsection (e)(2) \n     shall be submitted not later than March 1 and September 1 of \n     each year.\n       (4) The report on the examination required under subsection \n     (f) shall be submitted not later than 60 days after the \n     completion of the examination.\n       (5) The report required by subsection (g) shall be \n     submitted not later than March 1, 1999.\n\n     SEC. 707.

MILITARY AVIATION ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In February 1996, the Government Accounting Office \n     released a report highlighting a 75 percent reduction in \n     aviation Class A mishaps, a 70 percent reduction in aviation \n     mishap fatalities and a 65 percent reduction in Class A \n     mishap rates from 1975-1995 (Military Aircraft Safety--\n     Significant Improvements since 1975).\n       (2) In February 1998, the Government Accounting Office \n     completed a follow-up review of military aircraft safety, \n     noting that the military experienced fewer serious aviation \n     mishaps in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 than in previous fiscal \n     years (Military Aircraft Safety: Serious Accidents Remain at \n     Historically Low Levels).\n       (3) The report required by section 1046 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 (Public Law \n     105-85; 111 Stat. 1888) concluded, ``DoD found no evidence \n     that changing existing investigation processes to more \n     closely resemble those of the NTSB would help DoD to find \n     more answers more quickly, or accurately''.\n       (4) The Department of Defense must further improve its \n     aviation safety by fully examining all options for improving \n     or replacing its current aviation accident investigation \n     processes.\n       (5) The inter-service working group formed as a result of \n     that report has contributed to progress in military aviation \n     accident investigations by identifying ways to improve family \n     assistance, as has the formal policy direction coordinated by \n     the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n       (6) Such progress includes the issuance of Air Force \n     Instruction 90-701 entitled ``Assistance to Families of \n     Persons Involved in Air Force Aviation Mishaps'', that \n     attempts to meet the need for a more timely flow of relevant \n     information to families, a family liaison officer, and the \n     establishment of the Air Force Office of Family Assistance. \n     However, formal policy directions and Air Force instructions \n     have not adequately addressed the failure to provide primary \n     next of kin of members of the Armed Forces involved in \n     military aviation accidents with interim reports regarding \n     the course of investigations into such accidents, and the \n     Department of Defense must improve its procedures for \n     informing the families of the persons involved in military \n     aviation mishaps.\n       (7) The report referred to in paragraph (3) concluded that \n     the Department would ``benefit from the disappearance of the \n     misperception that the privileged portion of the safety \n     investigation exists to hide unfavorable information''.\n       (8) That report further specified that ``[e]ach Military \n     Department has procedures in place to place to provide \n     redacted copies of the final [privileged] safety report to \n     the families. However, families must formally request a copy \n     of the final safety investigation report''.\n       (9) Current efforts to improve family notification would be \n     enhanced by the issuance by the Secretary of Defense of \n     uniform regulations to improve the timeliness and reliability \n     of information provided to the primary next of kin of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents during and following \n     both the legal investigation and safety investigation phases \n     of such investigations.\n       (b) Evaluation of Department of Defense Aviation Accident \n     Investigation Procedures.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a task force to--\n       (A) review the procedures employed by the Department of \n     Defense to conduct military aviation accident investigations; \n     and\n       (B) identify mechanisms for improving such investigations \n     and the military aviation accident investigation process.\n       (2) The Secretary shall appoint to the task force the \n     following:\n       (A) An appropriate number of members of the Armed Forces, \n     including both members of the regular components and the \n     reserve components, who have experience relating to military \n     aviation or investigations into military aviation accidents.\n       (B) An appropriate number of former members of the Armed \n     Forces who have such experience.\n       (C) With the concurrence of the member concerned, a member \n     of the National Transportation Safety Board.\n       (3)(A) The task force shall submit to Congress an interim \n     report and a final report on its activities under this \n     subsection. The interim report shall be submitted on December \n     1, 1998, and the final report shall be submitted on March 31, \n     1999.\n       (B) Each report under subparagraph (A) shall include the \n     following:\n       (i) An assessment of the advisability of conducting all \n     military aviation accident investigations through an entity \n     that is independent of the military departments.\n       (ii) An assessment of the effectiveness of the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process in \n     identifying the cause of military aviation accidents and \n     correcting problems so identified in a timely manner.\n       (iii) An assessment whether or not the procedures for \n     sharing the results of military aviation accident \n     investigations among the military departments should be \n     improved.\n       (iv) An assessment of the advisability of centralized \n     training and instruction for military aircraft investigators.\n       (v) An assessment of any costs or cost avoidances that \n     would result from the elimination of any overlap in military \n     aviation accident investigation activities conducted under \n     the current so-called ``two-track'' investigation process.\n       (vi) Any improvements or modifications in the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process that the \n     task force considers appropriate to reduce the potential for \n     aviation accidents and increase public confidence in the \n     process.\n       (c) Uniform Regulations for Release of Interim Safety \n     Investigation Reports.--(1)(A) Not later than May 1, 1999, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations that \n     provide for the release to the family members of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents, and to members of \n     the public, of reports referred to in paragraph (2).\n       (B) The regulations shall apply uniformly to each military \n     department.\n       (2) A report under paragraph (1) is a report on the \n     findings of any ongoing privileged safety investigation into \n     an accident referred to in that paragraph. Such report shall \n     be in a redacted form or other form appropriate to preserve \n     witness confidentiality and to minimize the effects of the \n     release of information in such report on national security.\n       (3) Reports under paragraph (1) shall be made available--\n       (A) in the case of family members, at least once every 30 \n     days or upon the development of a new or significantly \n     changed finding during the course of the investigation \n     concerned; and\n       (B) in the case of members of the public, on request.\n\n[[Page S7398]]\n\n                      TITLE X--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                     Subtitle A--Financial Matters\n\n     SEC. 1001.

compliant, would cause a significant potential national \n     security risk to the United States.\n       (10) A discussion of the cooperative arrangements between \n     the United States and other nations to assist those nations \n     in identifying and correcting (to the extent necessary to \n     meet national security interests of the United States) any \n     problems in their communications and strategic systems, or \n     other systems identified by the Secretary of Defense, that \n     make the systems not year 2000 compliant.\n       (11) A discussion of the threat

BUDGETING FOR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION OF UNITED \n                   STATES FORCES IN NATO OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA AND \n                   HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Funding levels in the Department of Defense budget have \n     not been sufficient to pay for the deployment of United \n     States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina that \n     began in fiscal year 1996.\n       (2) The Department of Defense has used funds from the \n     operation and maintenance accounts of the Armed Forces to pay \n     for the operations because the funding levels included in the \n     defense budgets for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 have not been \n     adequate to maintain operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (3) Funds necessary to continue United States participation \n     in the NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to \n     replace operation and maintenance funds used for the \n     operations, have been requested by the President as \n     supplemental appropriations in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. \n     The Department of Defense has also proposed to reprogram \n     previously appropriated funds to make up the shortfall for \n     continued United States operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (4) In February 1998, the President certified to Congress \n     that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, was necessary in order \n     to meet national security interests of the United States.\n       (5) The discretionary spending limit established for the \n     defense category for fiscal year 1998 in the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 does not take into \n     account the continued deployment of United States forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998. Therefore, the \n     President requested emergency supplemental appropriations for \n     the Bosnia and Herzegovina mission through September 30, \n     1998.\n       (6) Amounts for operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina were \n     not included in the original budget proposed by the President \n     for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999.\n       (7) The President requested $1,858,600,000 in emergency \n     appropriations in his March 4, 1998 amendment to the fiscal \n     year 1999 budget to cover the shortfall in funding in the \n     fiscal year 1999 for the costs of extending the mission in \n     Bosnia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should include in the budget for the \n     Department of Defense that the President submits to Congress \n     under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, for \n     each fiscal year sufficient amounts to pay for any proposed \n     continuation of the participation of United States forces in \n     NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina for that fiscal \n     year; and\n       (2) amounts included in the budget for that purpose should \n     not be transferred from amounts that would otherwise be \n     proposed in the budget of any of the Armed Forces in \n     accordance with the future-years defense program related to \n     that budget, or any other agency of the Executive Branch, \n     but, instead, should be an overall increase in the budget for \n     the Department of Defense.\n\n     SEC. 1066.

and\n       (D) to lead the decisionmaking that identifies the most \n     cost-effective procurements of military equipment and \n     services.\n       (2) The laboratories and test and evaluation centers are \n     facing a number of challenges that, if not overcome, could \n     limit the productivity and self-sustainability of the \n     laboratories and centers, including--\n       (A) the declining funding provided for science and \n     technology in the technology base program of the Department \n     of Defense;\n       (B) difficulties experienced in recruiting, retaining, and \n     motivating high-quality personnel; and\n       (C) the complex web of policies and regulatory constraints \n     that restrict authority of managers to operate the \n     laboratories and centers in a businesslike fashion.\n       (3) Congress has provided tools to deal with the changing \n     nature of technological development in the defense sector by \n     encouraging closer cooperation with industry and university \n     research and by authorizing demonstrations of alternative \n     personnel systems.\n       (4) A number of laboratories and test and evaluation \n     centers have addressed the challenges and are employing a \n     variety of innovative methods, such as the so-called \n     ``Federated Lab Concept'' undertaken at the Army Research \n     Laboratory, to maintain the\n\n[[Page S7410]]\n\n     high quality of the technical program, to provide a \n     challenging work environment for researchers, and to meet the \n     high cost demands of maintaining facilities that are equal or \n     superior in quality to comparable facilities anywhere in the \n     world.\n       (b) Commendation.--Congress commends the Secretary of \n     Defense for the progress made by the science and technology \n     laboratories and test and evaluation centers to achieve the \n     results described in subsection (a)(4) and encourages the \n     Secretary to take the actions necessary to ensure continued \n     progress for the laboratories and test and evaluation centers \n     in developing cooperative relationships with universities and \n     other private sector entities for the performance of research \n     and development functions.\n       (c) Pilot Program.--(1) In conjunction with the plan for \n     restructuring and revitalizing the science and technology \n     laboratories and test and evaluation centers of the \n     Department of Defense that is required by section 906 of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Defense may carry out a pilot program \n     to demonstrate improved cooperative relationships with \n     universities and other private sector entities for the \n     performance of research and development functions.\n       (2) Under the pilot program, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     provide the director of one science and technology \n     laboratory, and the director of one test and evaluation \n     center, of each military department with authority for the \n     following:\n       (A) To explore innovative methods for quickly, efficiently, \n     and fairly entering into cooperative relationships with \n     universities and other private sector entities with respect \n     to the performance of research and development functions.\n       (B) To waive any restrictions on the demonstration and \n     implementation of such methods that are not required by law.\n       (C) To develop or expand innovative methods of operation \n     that provide more defense research for each dollar of cost, \n     including to carry out such initiatives as focusing on the \n     performance of core functions and adopting more business-like \n     practices.\n       (3) In selecting the laboratories and centers for \n     participation in the pilot program, the Secretary shall \n     consider laboratories and centers where innovative management \n     techniques have been demonstrated, particularly as documented \n     under sections 1115 through 1119 of title 31, United States \n     Code, relating to Government agency performance and results.\n       (4) The Secretary may carry out the pilot program at each \n     selected laboratory and center for a period of three years \n     beginning not later than March 1, 1999.\n       (d) Reports.--(1) Not later than March 1, 1999, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit a report on the \n     implementation of the pilot program to Congress.

RUSSIAN NONSTRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the 7,000 to 12,000 or more nonstrategic (or \n     ``tactical'') nuclear weapons estimated by the United States \n     Strategic Command to be in the Russian arsenal may present \n     the greatest threat of sale or theft of a nuclear warhead in \n     the world today;\n       (2) as the number of deployed strategic warheads in the \n     Russian and United States arsenals declines to just a few \n     thousand under the START accords, Russia's vast superiority \n     in tactical nuclear warheads--many of which have yields \n     equivalent to strategic nuclear weapons--could become \n     strategically destabilizing;\n       (3) while the United States has unilaterally reduced its \n     inventory of tactical nuclear weapons by nearly 90 percent \n     since the end of the Cold War, Russia is behind schedule in \n     implementing the steep tactical nuclear arms reductions \n     pledged by former Soviet President Gorbachev in 1991 and \n     Russian President Yeltsin in 1992, perpetuating the dangers \n     from Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile; and\n       (4) the President of the United States should call on the \n     Russian Federation to expedite reduction of its tactical \n     nuclear arsenal in accordance with the promises made in 1991 \n     and 1992.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than March 15, 1999, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the Congress a report on Russia's \n     nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including--\n       (1) estimates regarding the current numbers, types, yields, \n     viability, and locations of such warheads;\n       (2) an assessment of the strategic implications of the \n     Russian Federation's nonstrategic arsenal, including the \n     potential use of such warheads in a strategic role or the use \n     of their components in strategic nuclear systems;\n       (3) an assessment of the extent of the current threat of \n     theft, sale, or unauthorized use of such warheads, including \n     an analysis of Russian command and control as it concerns the \n     use of tactical nuclear warheads; and\n       (4) a summary of past, current, and planned efforts to work \n     cooperatively with the Russian Federation to account for, \n     secure, and reduce Russia's stockpile of tactical nuclear \n     warheads and associated fissile material.\n       (c) Views.--This report shall include the views of the \n     Director of Central Intelligence and the Commander in Chief \n     of the United States Strategic Command.\n\n     SEC. 1071.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONTINUED \n                   PARTICIPATION OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN \n                   OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The contributions of the people of the United States \n     and other nations have, in large measure, resulted in the \n     suspension of fighting and alleviated the suffering of the \n     people of Bosnia and Herzegovina since December 1995.\n       (2) the people of the United States have expended \n     approximately $9,500,000,000 in tax dollars between 1992 and \n     mid-1998 just in support of the United States military \n     operations in Bosnia to achieve those results.\n       (3) Efforts to restore the economy and political structure \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina have achieved some success in \n     accordance with the Dayton Agreement.\n       (4) In February 1998, the President certified to Congress \n     that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, was necessary in order \n     to meet national security interests of the United States.\n       (5) There is, however, no accurate estimate of the time \n     needed to accomplish the civilian implementation tasks \n     outlined in the Dayton Agreement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not remain in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina indefinitely in view of the world-wide \n     commitments of the Armed Forces of the United States;\n       (2) the President should work with NATO allies and the \n     other nations whose military forces are participating in the \n     NATO-led Stabilization Force to withdraw United States ground \n     combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina within a reasonable \n     period of time, consistent with the safety of those forces \n     and the accomplishment of the Stabilization Force's military \n     tasks;\n       (3) a NATO-led force without the participation of United \n     States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina might \n     be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     if the European Security and Defense Identity is not \n     sufficiently developed or is otherwise considered \n     inappropriate for such a mission;\n       (4) the United States may decide to provide appropriate \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force for Bosnia and Herzegovina, including command and \n     control, intelligence, logistics, and, if necessary, a ready \n     reserve force in the region;\n       (5) the President should inform the European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for establishing a \n     Western European Union-led or a NATO-led force as a follow-on \n     force to the NATO-led Stabilization Force if needed to \n     maintain peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (6) the President should consult closely with the \n     congressional leadership and the congressional defense \n     committees with respect to the progress being made toward \n     achieving a sustainable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \n     the progress being made toward a reduction and ultimate \n     withdrawal of United States ground combat forces from Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina.\n       (c) One-Time Reports.--The President shall submit to \n     Congress the following reports:\n       (1) Not later than September 30, 1998, a report containing \n     a discussion of the likely impact on the security situation \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on the prospects for \n     establishing self-sustaining peace and stable local \n     government there that would result from a phased reduction in \n     the number of United States military personnel stationed in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina under the following alternatives:\n       (A) A phased reduction to 5,000 by February 2, 1999, to \n     3,500 by June 30, 1999, and to 2,500 by February 2, 2000.\n       (B) A phased reduction by February 2, 2000, to the number \n     of personnel that is approximately equal to the mean average \n     of--\n       (i) the number of military personnel of the United Kingdom \n     that are stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina on that date;\n       (ii) the number of military personnel of Germany that are \n     stationed there on that date;\n       (iii) the number of military personnel of France that are \n     stationed there on that date;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the \n     unprecedented explosion of technological advances that could \n     fundamentally redefine military threats and military \n     capabilities in the future have generated a need to assess \n     the defense policy, strategy, and\n\n[[Page S7417]]\n\n     force structure necessary to meet future defense requirements \n     of the United States.\n       (2) The assessment conducted by the administration of \n     President Bush (known as the ``Base Force'' assessment) and \n     the assessment conducted by the administration of President \n     Clinton (known as the ``Bottom-Up Review'') were important \n     attempts to redefine the defense strategy of the United \n     States and the force structure of the Armed Forces necessary \n     to execute that strategy.\n       (3) Those assessments have become inadequate as a result of \n     the pace of global geopolitical change and the speed of \n     technological change, which have been greater than expected.\n       (4) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reacted to \n     the changing environment by developing and publishing in May \n     1996 a vision statement, known as ``Joint Vision 2010'', to \n     be a basis for the transformation of United States military \n     capabilities. The vision statement embodies the improved \n     intelligence and command and control that is available in the \n     information age and sets forth the operational concepts of \n     dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full-dimensional \n     protection, and focused logistics to achieve the objective of \n     full spectrum dominance.\n       (5) In 1996 Congress, concerned about the shortcomings in \n     defense policies and programs derived from the Base-Force \n     Review and the Bottom-Up Review, determined that there was a \n     need for a new, comprehensive assessment of the defense \n     strategy of the United States and the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces necessary for meeting the threats to the United \n     States in the 21st century.\n       (6) As a result of that determination, Congress passed the \n     Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996 (subtitle B of \n     title IX of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1997), which required the Secretary of Defense to \n     complete in 1997 a quadrennial defense review of the defense \n     program of the United States. The review was required to \n     include a comprehensive examination of the defense strategy, \n     force structure, force modernization plans, infrastructure, \n     and other elements of the defense program and policies with a \n     view toward determining and expressing the defense strategy \n     of the United States and establishing a revised defense \n     program through 2005. The Act also established a National \n     Defense Panel to assess the Quadrennial Defense Review and to \n     conduct an independent, nonpartisan review of the strategy, \n     force structure, and funding required to meet anticipated \n     threats to the national security of the United States through \n     2010 and beyond.\n       (7) The Quadrennial Defense Review, completed by the \n     Secretary of Defense in May 1997, defined the defense \n     strategy in terms of ``Shape, Respond, and Prepare Now''. The \n     Quadrennial Defense Review placed greater emphasis on the \n     need to prepare now for an uncertain future by exploiting the \n     revolution in technology and transforming the force toward \n     Joint Vision 2010. It concluded that our future force will be \n     different in character than our current force.\n       (8) The National Defense Panel Report, published in \n     December 1997, concluded that ``the Department of Defense \n     should accord the highest priority to executing a \n     transformation strategy for the United States military, \n     starting now.'' The panel recommended the establishment of a \n     Joint Forces Command with the responsibility to be the joint \n     force integrator and provider and the responsibility for \n     driving the process for transforming United States forces, \n     including the conduct of joint experimentation, and to have \n     the budget for carrying out those responsibilities.\n       (9) The assessments of both the Quadrennial Defense Review \n     and the National Defense Panel provide Congress with a \n     compelling argument that the future security environment and \n     the military challenges to be faced by the United States in \n     the future will be fundamentally different than the current \n     environment and challenges. The assessments also reinforce \n     the foundational premise of the Goldwater-Nichols Department \n     of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 that warfare, in all of \n     its varieties, will be joint warfare requiring the execution \n     of developed joint operational concepts.\n       (10) A process of joint experimentation is necessary for--\n       (A) integrating advances in technology with changes in the \n     organizational structure of the Armed Forces and the \n     development of joint operational concepts that will be \n     effective against national security threats anticipated for \n     the future; and\n       (B) identifying and assessing the interdependent aspects of \n     joint warfare that are key for transforming the conduct of \n     military operations by the United States to meet those \n     anticipated threats successfully.\n       (11) It is critical for future readiness that the Armed \n     Forces of the United States innovatively investigate and test \n     technologies, forces, and joint operational concepts in \n     simulations, wargames, and virtual settings, as well as in \n     field environments under realistic conditions against the \n     full range of future challenges. It is essential that an \n     energetic and innovative organization be established and \n     empowered to design and implement a process of joint \n     experimentation to develop and validate new joint warfighting \n     concepts, along with experimentation by the Armed Forces, \n     that is directed at transforming the Armed Forces to meet the \n     threats to the national security that are anticipated for the \n     early 21st century. That process will drive changes in \n     doctrine, organization, training and education, materiel, \n     leadership, and personnel.\n       (12) The Department of Defense is committed to conducting \n     aggressive experimentation as a key component of its \n     transformation strategy.\n       (13) The competition of ideas is critical for achieving \n     effective transformation. Experimentation by each of the \n     Armed Forces has been, and will continue to be, a vital \n     aspect of the pursuit of effective transformation. Joint \n     experimentation leverages the effectiveness of each of the \n     Armed Forces and the Defense Agencies.\n\n     SEC. 1202. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Designation of Commander To Have Joint Warfighting \n     Experimentation Mission.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress supports the initiative of the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to designate a \n     commander of a combatant command to have the mission for \n     joint warfighting experimentation, consistent with the \n     understanding of Congress that the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff will assign the designated commander the \n     tasks to develop and validate new joint warfighting concepts \n     and capabilities, and to determine the implications, for \n     doctrine, organization, training and education, materiel, \n     leadership, and personnel, of the Department of Defense \n     strategy for transforming the Armed Forces to meet the \n     national security threats of the future.\n       (b) Resources of Commander.--It is, further, the sense of \n     Congress that the commander designated to have the joint \n     warfighting experimentation mission should--\n       (1) have sufficient freedom of action and authority over \n     the necessary forces to successfully establish and conduct \n     the process of joint warfighting experimentation;\n       (2) be provided resources adequate for the joint \n     warfighting experimentation process; and\n       (3) have authority over the use of the resources for the \n     planning, preparation, conduct, and assessment of joint \n     warfighting experimentation.\n       (c) Authority and Responsibilities of Commander.--It is, \n     further, the sense of Congress that, for the conduct of joint \n     warfighting experimentation to be effective, it is necessary \n     that the commander designated to have the joint warfighting \n     experimentation mission also have the authority and \n     responsibility for the following:\n       (1) Developing and implementing a process of joint \n     experimentation to formulate and validate concepts critical \n     for joint warfighting in the future, including (in such \n     process) analyses, simulations, wargames, information \n     superiority and other experiments, advanced concept \n     technology demonstrations, and joint exercises conducted in \n     virtual and actual field environments.\n       (2) Planning, preparing, and conducting the program of \n     joint warfighting experimentation.\n       (3) Assessing the effectiveness of organizational \n     structures, operational concepts, and technologies employed \n     in joint experimentation, investigating opportunities for \n     coordinating the evolution of the organizational structure of \n     the Armed Forces compatibly with the concurrent evolution of \n     advanced technologies, and investigating new concepts for \n     transforming joint warfighting capabilities to meet the \n     operational challenges expected to be encountered by the \n     Armed Forces in the early 21st century.\n       (4) Coordinating with each of the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies regarding the development of the equipment \n     (including surrogate or real technologies, platforms, and \n     systems) necessary for the conduct of joint experimentation, \n     or, if necessary, developing such equipment directly.\n       (5) Coordinating with each of the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies regarding the acquisition of the materiel, \n     supplies, services, and surrogate or real technology \n     resources necessary for the conduct of joint experimentation, \n     or, if necessary, acquiring such items and services directly.\n       (6) Developing scenarios and measures of effectiveness for \n     joint experimentation.\n       (7) Conducting so-called ``red team'' vulnerability \n     assessments as part of joint experimentation.\n       (8) Assessing the interoperability of equipment and forces.\n       (9) Providing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the commander's \n     recommendations (developed on the basis of joint \n     experimentation) for reducing unnecessary redundancy of \n     equipment and forces.\n       (10) Providing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the commander's \n     recommendations (developed on the basis of joint \n     experimentation) regarding synchronization of the fielding of \n     advanced technologies among the Armed Forces to enable the \n     development and execution of joint operational concepts.\n       (11) Submitting, reviewing, and making recommendations (in \n     conjunction with the joint experimentation and evaluation \n     process) to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on \n     mission needs statements and operational requirements \n     documents.\n       (12) Exploring new operational concepts (including those \n     developed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and \n     Defense Agencies, other unified commands, the Armed Forces, \n     and the Joint Staff), and integrating and testing in joint \n     experimentation the systems and concepts that result from\n\n[[Page S7418]]\n\n     warfighting experimentation by the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies.\n       (13) Developing, planning, refining, assessing, and \n     recommending to the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff the most promising joint concepts \n     and capabilities for experimentation and assessment.\n       (14) Assisting the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prioritize joint requirements \n     and acquisition programs on the basis of joint warfighting \n     experimentation.\n       (d) Continued Experimentation by Other Defense \n     Organizations.--It is, further, the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Armed Forces are expected to continue to develop \n     concepts and conduct intraservice and multiservice \n     warfighting experimentation within their core competencies; \n     and\n       (2) the commander of United States Special Operations \n     Command is expected to continue to develop concepts and \n     conduct joint experimentation associated with special \n     operations forces.\n       (e) Congressional Review.--It is, further, the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) Congress will carefully review the initial report and \n     annual reports on joint warfighting experimentation required \n     under section 1203 to determine the adequacy of the scope and \n     pace of the transformation of the Armed Forces to meet future \n     challenges to the national security; and\n       (2) if the progress is inadequate, Congress will consider \n     legislation to establish a unified combatant command with the \n     mission, forces, budget, responsibilities, and authority \n     described in the preceding provisions of this section.\n\n     SEC. 1203.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FURTHER ROUNDS OF BASE \n                   CLOSURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) While the Department of Defense has proposed further \n     rounds of base closures, there is no need to authorize in \n     1998 a new base closure commission that would not begin its \n     work until three years from now, in 2001.\n       (2) While the Department of Defense has submitted a report \n     to the Congress in response to section 2824 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, that report--\n       (A) based its estimates of the costs and savings of \n     previous base closure rounds on data that the General \n     Accounting Office has described as ``inconsistent'', \n     ``unreliable'' and ``incomplete'';\n       (B) failed to demonstrate that the Defense Department is \n     working effectively to improve its ability to track base \n     closure costs and savings resulting from the 1993 and 1995 \n     base closure rounds, which are ongoing;\n       (C) modeled the savings to be achieved as a result of \n     further base closure rounds on the 1993 and 1995 rounds, \n     which are as yet incomplete and on which the Department's \n     information is faulty; and\n       (D) projected that base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 \n     would not produce substantial savings until 2008, a decade \n     after the Federal Government will have achieved unified \n     budget balance, and 5 years beyond the planning period for \n     the current congressional budget and Future Years Defense \n     Plan.\n\n[[Page S7430]]\n\n       (3) Section 2824 required that the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the General Accounting Office review the Defense \n     Department's report, and--\n       (A) the General Accounting Office stated on May 1 that ``we \n     are now conducting our analysis to be able to report any \n     limitations that may exist in the required level of detail. . \n     . . [W]e are awaiting some supporting documentation from the \n     military services to help us finish assessing the report's \n     information.'';\n       (B) the Congressional Budget Office stated on May 1 that \n     its review is ongoing, and that ``it is important that CBO \n     take the time necessary to provide a thoughtful and accurate \n     evaluation of DOD's report, rather than issue a preliminary \n     and potentially inaccurate assessment.''.\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office recommended that ``The \n     Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of \n     base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, however, \n     should follow an interval during which DOD and independent \n     analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have \n     been taken thus far.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) Congress should not authorize further rounds of base \n     closures and realignments until all actions authorized by the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 are \n     completed; and\n       (2) the Department of Defense should submit forthwith to \n     the Congress the report required by section 2815 of Public \n     Law 103-337, analyzing the effects of base closures and \n     realignments on the ability of the Armed Forces to \n     remobilize, describing the military construction projects \n     needed to facilitate such remobilization, and discussing the \n     assets, such as air space, that would be difficult to \n     reacquire in the event of such remobilization.\n\n               TITLE XXIX--JUNIPER BUTTE RANGE WITHDRAWAL\n\n     SEC. 2901.

AGENCY AGREEMENT\n\n       The Bureau of Land Management and the Air Force have agreed \n     upon additional mitigation measures associated with this land \n     withdrawal as specified in the ``ENHANCED TRAINING IN IDAHO \n     Memorandum of Understanding Between The Bureau of Land \n     Management and The United States Air Force'' that is dated \n     June 11, 1998. This agreement specifies that these mitigation \n     measures will be adopted as part of the Air Force's Record of \n     Decision for Enhanced Training in Idaho. Congress endorses \n     this collaborative effort between the agencies and directs \n     that the agreement be implemented: Provided, however, That \n     the parties may, in accordance with the National \n     Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, mutually agree \n     to modify the mitigation measures specified in the agreement \n     in light of experience gained through the actions called for \n     in the agreement or as a result of changed military \n     circumstances: Provided further, That neither the agreement, \n     any modification thereof, nor this section creates any right, \n     benefit, or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, \n     enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United \n     States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.\n\n     SEC. 2905. RIGHT-OF-WAY GRANTS.\n\n       In addition to the withdrawal under section 2902 and in \n     accordance with all applicable laws, the Secretary of the \n     Interior shall process and grant the Secretary of the Air \n     Force rights-of-way using the Department of the Interior \n     regulations and policies in effect at the time of filing \n     applications for the one-quarter acre electronic warfare \n     threat emitter sites, roads, powerlines, and other ancillary \n     facilities as described and analyzed in the Enhanced Training \n     in Idaho Final Environmental Impact Statement, dated January \n     1998.\n\n     SEC. 2906. INDIAN SACRED SITES.\n\n       (a) Management.--In the management of the Federal lands \n     withdrawn and reserved by this title, the Air Force shall, to \n     the extent practicable and not clearly inconsistent with \n     essential agency functions, (1) accommodate access to and \n     ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites by Indian religious \n     practitioners and (2) avoid adversely affecting the integrity \n     of such sacred sites. The Air Force shall maintain the \n     confidentiality of such sites where appropriate. The term \n     ``sacred site'' shall mean any specific, discrete, narrowly \n     delineated location on Federal land that is identified by an \n     Indian tribe, or Indian individual determined to be an \n     appropriately authoritative representative of an Indian \n     religion, as sacred by virtue of its established religious \n     significance to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian religion: \n     Provided, That the tribe or appropriately authoritative \n     representative of an Indian religion has informed the Air \n     Force of the existence of such a site. The term ``Indian \n     tribe'' means an Indian or Alaska Native tribe, band, nation, \n     pueblo, village, or community that the Secretary of the \n     Interior acknowledges to exist as an Indian tribe pursuant to \n     Public Law 103-454 (108 Stat. 4791), and ``Indian'' refers to \n     a member of such an Indian tribe.\n       (b) Consultation.--Air Force officials at Mountain Home Air \n     Force Base shall regularly consult with the Tribal Chairman \n     of the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley Reservation \n     to assure that tribal government rights and concerns are \n     fully considered during the development of the Juniper Butte \n     Range.\n\n     SEC. 2907. ACTIONS CONCERNING RANCHING OPERATIONS IN \n                   WITHDRAWN AREA.\n\n       The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized and directed \n     to, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the \n     Air Force considers just and in the national interest, \n     conclude and implement agreements with the grazing permittees \n     to provide appropriate consideration, including future \n     grazing arrangements. Upon the conclusion of these \n     agreements, the Assistant Secretary, Land and Minerals \n     Management, shall grant rights-of-way and approvals and take \n     such actions as are necessary to implement promptly this \n     title and the agreements with the grazing permittees. The \n     Secretary of the Air Force and the Secretary of the Interior \n     shall allow the grazing permittees for lands withdrawn and \n     reserved by this title to continue their activities on the \n     lands in accordance with the permits and their applicable \n     regulations until the Secretary of the Air Force has fully \n     implemented the agreement with the grazing permittees under \n     this section. Upon the implementation of these agreements, \n     the Bureau of Land Management is authorized and directed, \n     subject to the limitations included in this section, to \n     terminate grazing on the lands withdrawn.\n\n     SEC. 2908.

RENEGOTIATING MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING ON FORCED \n                   LABOR.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     determine whether any country with which the United States \n     has a memorandum of understanding with respect to reciprocal \n     trade that involves goods made with forced labor or \n     indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor \n     is frustrating implementation of the memorandum. If an \n     affirmative determination be made, the President should \n     immediately commence negotiations to replace the current \n     memorandum of understanding with one providing for effective \n     procedures for the monitoring of forced labor or indentured \n     labor, including forced or indentured child labor. The \n     memorandum of understanding should include improved \n     procedures for requesting investigations of suspected work \n     sites by international monitors.\n\n     SEC. 3705.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     systematically controls the flow of information to the \n     Chinese people.\n       (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     demonstrated that maintaining its monopoly on political power \n     is a higher priority than economic development by announcing \n     in January 1996 that its official news agency, Xinhua, will \n     supervise wire services selling economic information, \n     including Dow Jones-Telerate, Bloomberg, and Reuters \n     Business, and in announcing in February 1996 the ``Interim \n     Internet Management Rules'', which have the effect of \n     censoring computer networks.\n       (3) Under the May 30, 1997, order of Premier Li Peng, all \n     organizations that engage in business activities related to \n     international computer networking must now apply for a \n     license, increasing still further government control over \n     access to the Internet.\n       (4) Both Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, as a \n     surrogate for a free press in the People's Republic of China, \n     provide an invaluable source of uncensored information to the \n     Chinese people, including objective and authoritative news of \n     in-country and regional events, as well as accurate news \n     about the United States and its policies.\n       (5) Enhanced broadcasting service to China and Tibet can \n     efficiently be established through a combination of Radio \n     Free Asia and Voice of America programming.\n       (6) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, in working toward \n     continuously broadcasting to the People's Republic of China \n     in multiple languages, have the capability to establish 24-\n     hour-a-day Mandarin broadcasting to that nation by staggering \n     the hours of Radio Free Asia and Voice of America.\n       (7) Simultaneous broadcastings on Voice of America radio \n     and Worldnet television 7 days a week in Mandarin are also \n     important and needed capabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3903.

RENEGOTIATING MEMORANDA OF UNDERSTANDING ON FORCED \n                   LABOR.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     determine whether any country with which the United States \n     has a memorandum of understanding with respect to reciprocal \n     trade that involves goods made with forced labor or \n     indentured labor, including forced or indentured child labor \n     is frustrating implementation of the memorandum. If an \n     affirmative determination be made, the President should \n     immediately commence negotiations to replace the current \n     memorandum of understanding with one providing for effective \n     procedures for the monitoring of forced labor or indentured \n     labor, including forced or indentured child labor. The \n     memorandum of understanding should include improved \n     procedures for requesting investigations of suspected work \n     sites by international monitors.\n\n     SEC. 3705.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     systematically controls the flow of information to the \n     Chinese people.\n       (2) The Government of the People's Republic of China \n     demonstrated that maintaining its monopoly on political power \n     is a higher priority than economic development by announcing \n     in January 1996 that its official news agency, Xinhua, will \n     supervise wire services selling economic information, \n     including Dow Jones-Telerate, Bloomberg, and Reuters \n     Business, and in announcing in February 1996 the ``Interim \n     Internet Management Rules'', which have the effect of \n     censoring computer networks.\n       (3) Under the May 30, 1997, order of Premier Li Peng, all \n     organizations that engage in business activities related to \n     international computer networking must now apply for a \n     license, increasing still further government control over \n     access to the Internet.\n       (4) Both Radio Free Asia and the Voice of America, as a \n     surrogate for a free press in the People's Republic of China, \n     provide an invaluable source of uncensored information to the \n     Chinese people, including objective and authoritative news of \n     in-country and regional events, as well as accurate news \n     about the United States and its policies.\n       (5) Enhanced broadcasting service to China and Tibet can \n     efficiently be established through a combination of Radio \n     Free Asia and Voice of America programming.\n       (6) Radio Free Asia and Voice of America, in working toward \n     continuously broadcasting to the People's Republic of China \n     in multiple languages, have the capability to establish 24-\n     hour-a-day Mandarin broadcasting to that nation by staggering \n     the hours of Radio Free Asia and Voice of America.\n       (7) Simultaneous broadcastings on Voice of America radio \n     and Worldnet television 7 days a week in Mandarin are also \n     important and needed capabilities.\n\n     SEC. 3903.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON FURTHER ROUNDS OF BASE \n                   CLOSURES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that:\n       (1) While the Department of Defense has proposed further \n     rounds of base closures, there is no need to authorize in \n     1998 a new base closure commission that would not begin its \n     work until three years from now, in 2001.\n       (2) While the Department of Defense has submitted a report \n     to the Congress in response to section 2824 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998, that report--\n       (A) based its estimates of the costs and savings of \n     previous base closure rounds on data that the General \n     Accounting Office has described as ``inconsistent'', \n     ``unreliable'' and ``incomplete'';\n       (B) failed to demonstrate that the Defense Department is \n     working effectively to improve its ability to track base \n     closure costs and savings resulting from the 1993 and 1995 \n     base closure rounds, which are ongoing;\n       (C) modeled the savings to be achieved as a result of \n     further base closure rounds on the 1993 and 1995 rounds, \n     which are as yet incomplete and on which the Department's \n     information is faulty; and\n       (D) projected that base closure rounds in 2001 and 2005 \n     would not produce substantial savings until 2008, a decade \n     after the Federal Government will have achieved unified \n     budget balance, and 5 years beyond the planning period for \n     the current congressional budget and Future Years Defense \n     Plan.\n       (3) Section 2824 required that the Congressional Budget \n     Office and the General Accounting Office review the Defense \n     Department's report, and--\n       (A) the General Accounting Office stated on May 1 that ``we \n     are now conducting our analysis to be able to report any \n     limitations that may exist in the required level of detail. . \n     . . [W]e are awaiting some supporting documentation from the \n     military services to help us finish assessing the report's \n     information.'';\n       (B) the Congressional Budget Office stated on May 1 that \n     its review is ongoing, and that ``it is important that CBO \n     take the time necessary to provide a thoughtful and accurate \n     evaluation of DOD's report, rather than issue a preliminary \n     and potentially inaccurate assessment.''.\n       (4) The Congressional Budget Office recommended that ``The \n     Congress could consider authorizing an additional round of \n     base closures if the Department of Defense believes that \n     there is a surplus of military capacity after all rounds of \n     BRAC have been carried out. That consideration, however, \n     should follow an interval during which DOD and independent \n     analysts examine the actual impact of the measures that have \n     been taken thus far.''.\n       (b) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that--\n       (1) Congress should not authorize further rounds of base \n     closures and realignments until all actions authorized by the \n     Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 are \n     completed; and\n       (2) the Department of Defense should submit forthwith to \n     the Congress the report required by section 2815 of Public \n     Law 103-337, analyzing the effects of base closures and \n     realignments on the ability of the Armed Forces to \n     remobilize, describing the military construction projects \n     needed to facilitate such remobilization, and discussing the \n     assets, such as air space, that would be difficult to \n     reacquire in the event of such remobilization.\n\n               TITLE XXIX--JUNIPER BUTTE RANGE WITHDRAWAL\n\n     SEC. 2901.

INDIAN SACRED SITES.\n\n       (a) Management.--In the management of the Federal lands \n     withdrawn and reserved by this title, the Air Force shall, to \n     the extent practicable and not clearly inconsistent with \n     essential agency functions, (1) accommodate access to and \n     ceremonial use of Indian sacred sites by Indian religious \n     practitioners and (2) avoid adversely affecting the integrity \n     of such sacred sites. The Air Force shall maintain the \n     confidentiality of such sites where appropriate.

ACTIONS CONCERNING RANCHING OPERATIONS IN \n                   WITHDRAWN AREA.\n\n       The Secretary of the Air Force is authorized and directed \n     to, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the \n     Air Force considers just and in the national interest, \n     conclude and implement agreements with the grazing permittees \n     to provide appropriate consideration, including future \n     grazing arrangements. Upon the conclusion of these \n     agreements, the Assistant Secretary, Land and Minerals \n     Management, shall grant rights-of-way and approvals and take \n     such actions as are necessary to implement promptly this \n     title and the agreements with the grazing permittees.

It is estimated that there \n     are approximately 39,000 patients, ranging in age from babies \n     to those in retirement, awaiting transplants of kidneys, \n     hearts, livers, and other solid organs.\n       (3) The Department of Defense has made significant progress \n     in increasing the awareness of the importance of organ and \n     tissue donations among members of the Armed Forces.\n       (4) The inclusion of organ and tissue donor elections in \n     the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System (DEERS) \n     central database through the Real-time Automated Personnel \n     Identification System (RAPIDS) represents a major step in \n     ensuring that organ and tissue donor elections are a matter \n     of record and are accessible in a timely manner.\n       (b) Responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense.--The \n     Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the advanced systems \n     developed for recording Armed Forces members' personal data \n     and information (such as the SMARTCARD, MEDITAG, and Personal \n     Information Carrier) include the capability to record organ \n     and tissue donation elections.\n       (c) Responsibilities of the Secretaries of the Military \n     Departments.--The Secretaries of the military departments \n     shall ensure that--\n       (1) appropriate information about organ and tissue donation \n     is provided to each recruit and officer candidate of the \n     Armed Forces during initial training;\n       (2) members of the Armed Forces are given recurring, \n     specific opportunities to elect to be organ or tissue donors \n     during service in the Armed Forces and upon retirement; and\n       (3) members of the Armed Forces electing to be organ or \n     tissue donors are encouraged to advise their next of kin \n     concerning the donation decision and any subsequent change of \n     that decision.\n       (d) Responsibilities of the Surgeons General of the \n     Military Department.--The Surgeons General of the Armed \n     Forces shall ensure that--\n       (1) appropriate training is provided to enlisted and \n     officer medical personnel to facilitate the effective \n     operation of organ and tissue donation activities under \n     garrison conditions and, to the extent possible, under \n     operational conditions; and\n       (2) medical logistical activities can, to the extent \n     possible without jeopardizing operational requirements, \n     support an effective organ and tissue donation program.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than September 1, 1999, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed \n     Services of the Senate and the Committee on National Security \n     of the House of Representatives a report on the status of the \n     implementation of this section.\n\n     SEC. 706. JOINT DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE AND DEPARTMENT OF \n                   VETERANS AFFAIRS REVIEWS RELATING TO \n                   INTERDEPARTMENTAL COOPERATION IN THE DELIVERY \n                   OF MEDICAL CARE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The military health care system of the Department of \n     Defense and the Veterans Health Administration of the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs are national institutions that \n     collectively manage more than 1,500 hospitals, clinics, and \n     health care facilities worldwide to provide services to more \n     than 11,000,000 beneficiaries.\n       (2) In the post-Cold War era, these institutions are in a \n     profound transition that involves challenging opportunities.\n       (3) During the period from 1988 to 1998, the number of \n     military medical personnel has declined by 15 percent and the \n     number of military hospitals has been reduced by one-third.\n       (4) During the two years since 1996, the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs has revitalized its structure by \n     decentralizing authority into 22 Veterans Integrated Service \n     Networks.\n       (5) In the face of increasing costs of medical care, \n     increased demands for health care services, and increasing \n     budgetary constraints, the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs have embarked on a variety of \n     dynamic and innovative cooperative programs ranging from \n     shared services to joint venture operations of medical \n     facilities.\n       (6) In 1984, there was a combined total of 102 Department \n     of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense facilities with \n     sharing agreements. By 1997, that number had grown to 420. \n     During the six years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal \n     year 1997, shared services increased from slightly over 3,000 \n     services to more than 6,000 services ranging from major \n     medical and surgical services, laundry, blood, and laboratory \n     services to unusual speciality care services.\n       (7) The Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs are conducting four health care joint \n     ventures in New Mexico, Nevada, Texas, Oklahoma, and are \n     planning to conduct four more such ventures in Alaska, \n     Florida, Hawaii, and California.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs are to be commended for the cooperation \n     between the two departments in the delivery of medical care, \n     of which the cooperation involved in the establishment and \n     operation of the Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Executive Council is a praiseworthy example;\n       (2) the two departments are encouraged to continue to \n     explore new opportunities to enhance the availability and \n     delivery of medical care to beneficiaries by further \n     enhancing the cooperative efforts of the departments; and\n       (3) enhanced cooperation is encouraged for--\n       (A) the general areas of access to quality medical care, \n     identification and elimination of impediments to enhanced \n     cooperation, and joint research and program development; and\n       (B) the specific areas in which there is significant \n     potential to achieve progress in cooperation in a short term, \n     including computerization of patient records systems, \n     participation of the Department of Veterans Affairs in the \n     TRICARE program, pharmaceutical programs, and joint physical \n     examinations.\n       (c) Joint Survey of Populations Served.--(1) The Secretary \n     of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     jointly conduct a survey of their respective medical care \n     beneficiary populations to identify, by category of \n     beneficiary (defined as the Secretaries consider \n     appropriate), the expectations of, requirements for, and \n     behavior patterns of the beneficiaries with respect to \n     medical care. The two Secretaries shall develop the protocol \n     for the survey jointly, but shall obtain the services of an \n     entity independent of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs for carrying out the survey.\n       (2) The survey shall include the following:\n       (A) Demographic characteristics, economic characteristics, \n     and geographic location of beneficiary populations with \n     regard to catchment or service areas.\n       (B) The types and frequency of care required by veterans, \n     retirees, and dependents within catchment or service areas of \n     Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs medical facilities \n     and outside those areas.\n       (C) The numbers of, characteristics of, and types of \n     medical care needed by the veterans, retirees, and dependents \n     who, though eligible for medical care in Department of \n     Defense or Department of Veterans Affairs treatment \n     facilities or other federally funded medical programs, choose \n     not to seek medical care from those facilities or under those \n     programs, and the reasons for that choice.\n\n[[Page S7490]]\n\n       (D) The obstacles or disincentives for seeking medical care \n     from such facilities or under such programs that veterans, \n     retirees, and dependents perceive.\n       (E) Any other matters that the Secretary of Defense and the \n     Secretary of Veterans Affairs consider appropriate for the \n     survey.\n       (3) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall submit a report on the results of the survey to \n     the appropriate committees of Congress. The report shall \n     contain the matters described in paragraph (2) and any \n     proposals for legislation that the Secretaries recommend for \n     enhancing Department of Defense and Department of Veterans \n     Affairs cooperative efforts with respect to the delivery of \n     medical care.\n       (d) Review of Law and Policies.--(1) The Secretary of \n     Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall jointly \n     conduct a review to identify impediments to cooperation \n     between the Department of Defense and the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs regarding the delivery of medical care. The \n     matters reviewed shall include the following:\n       (A) All laws, policies, and regulations, and any attitudes \n     of beneficiaries of the health care systems of the two \n     departments, that have the effect of preventing the \n     establishment, or limiting the effectiveness, of cooperative \n     health care programs of the departments.\n       (B) The requirements and practices involved in the \n     credentialling and licensure of health care providers.\n       (C) The perceptions of beneficiaries in a variety of \n     categories (defined as the Secretaries consider appropriate) \n     regarding the various Federal health care systems available \n     for their use.\n       (2) The Secretaries shall jointly submit a report on the \n     results of the review to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress. The report shall include any proposals for \n     legislation that the Secretaries recommend for eliminating or \n     reducing impediments to interdepartmental cooperation that \n     are identified during the review.\n       (e) Participation in TRICARE.--(1) The Secretary of Defense \n     shall review the TRICARE program to identify opportunities \n     for increased participation by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs in that program. The ongoing collaboration between \n     Department of Defense officials and Department of Veterans \n     Affairs officials regarding increasing the participation \n     shall be included among the matters reviewed.\n       (2) The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs shall jointly submit to the appropriate committees of \n     Congress a semiannual report on the status of the review and \n     on efforts to increase the participation of the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs in the TRICARE program. No report is \n     required under this paragraph after the submission of a \n     semiannual report in which the Secretaries declare that the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs is participating in the \n     TRICARE program to the extent that can reasonably be expected \n     to be attained.\n       (f) Pharmaceutical Benefits and Programs.--(1) The Federal \n     Pharmaceutical Steering Committee shall--\n       (A) undertake a comprehensive examination of existing \n     pharmaceutical benefits and programs for beneficiaries of \n     Federal medical care programs, including matters relating to \n     the purchasing, distribution, and dispensing of \n     pharmaceuticals and the management of mail order \n     pharmaceuticals programs; and\n       (B) review the existing methods for contracting for and \n     distributing medical supplies and services.\n       (2) The committee shall submit a report on the results of \n     the examination to the appropriate committees of Congress.\n       (g) Standardization of Physical Examinations for \n     Disability.--The Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs shall submit to the appropriate committees \n     of Congress a report on the status of the efforts of the \n     Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs \n     to standardize physical examinations administered by the two \n     departments for the purpose of determining or rating \n     disabilities.\n       (h) Appropriate Committees of Congress Defined.--For the \n     purposes of this section, the appropriate committees of \n     Congress are as follows:\n       (1) The Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the Senate.\n       (2) The Committee on National Security and the Committee on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the House of Representatives.\n       (i) Deadlines for Submission of Reports.--(1) The report \n     required by subsection (c)(3) shall be submitted not later \n     than January 1, 2000.\n       (2) The report required by subsection (d)(2) shall be \n     submitted not later than March 1, 1999.\n       (3) The semiannual report required by subsection (e)(2) \n     shall be submitted not later than March 1 and September 1 of \n     each year.\n       (4) The report on the examination required under subsection \n     (f) shall be submitted not later than 60 days after the \n     completion of the examination.\n       (5) The report required by subsection (g) shall be \n     submitted not later than March 1, 1999.\n\n     SEC. 707.

MILITARY AVIATION ACCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In February 1996, the Government Accounting Office \n     released a report highlighting a 75 percent reduction in \n     aviation Class A mishaps, a 70 percent reduction in aviation \n     mishap fatalities and a 65 percent reduction in Class A \n     mishap rates from 1975-1995 (Military Aircraft Safety--\n     Significant Improvements since 1975).\n       (2) In February 1998, the Government Accounting Office \n     completed a follow-up review of military aircraft safety, \n     noting that the military experienced fewer serious aviation \n     mishaps in fiscal years 1996 and 1997 than in previous fiscal \n     years (Military Aircraft Safety: Serious Accidents Remain at \n     Historically Low Levels).\n       (3) The report required by section 1046 of the National \n     Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1998 (Public Law \n     105-85; 111 Stat. 1888) concluded, ``DoD found no evidence \n     that changing existing investigation processes to more \n     closely resemble those of the NTSB would help DoD to find \n     more answers more quickly, or accurately''.\n       (4) The Department of Defense must further improve its \n     aviation safety by fully examining all options for improving \n     or replacing its current aviation accident investigation \n     processes.\n       (5) The inter-service working group formed as a result of \n     that report has contributed to progress in military aviation \n     accident investigations by identifying ways to improve family \n     assistance, as has the formal policy direction coordinated by \n     the Office of the Secretary of Defense.\n       (6) Such progress includes the issuance of Air Force \n     Instruction 90-701 entitled ``Assistance to Families of \n     Persons Involved in Air Force Aviation Mishaps'', that \n     attempts to meet the need for a more timely flow of relevant \n     information to families, a family liaison officer, and the \n     establishment of the Air Force Office of Family Assistance. \n     However, formal policy directions and Air Force instructions \n     have not adequately addressed the failure to provide primary \n     next of kin of members of the Armed Forces involved in \n     military aviation accidents with interim reports regarding \n     the course of investigations into such accidents, and the \n     Department of Defense must improve its procedures for \n     informing the families of the persons involved in military \n     aviation mishaps.\n       (7) The report referred to in paragraph (3) concluded that \n     the Department would ``benefit from the disappearance of the \n     misperception that the privileged portion of the safety \n     investigation exists to hide unfavorable information''.\n       (8) That report further specified that ``[e]ach Military \n     Department has procedures in place to place to provide \n     redacted copies of the final [privileged] safety report to \n     the families. However, families must formally request a copy \n     of the final safety investigation report''.\n       (9) Current efforts to improve family notification would be \n     enhanced by the issuance by the Secretary of Defense of \n     uniform regulations to improve the timeliness and reliability \n     of information provided to the primary next of kin of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents during and following \n     both the legal investigation and safety investigation phases \n     of such investigations.\n       (b) Evaluation of Department of Defense Aviation Accident \n     Investigation Procedures.--(1) The Secretary of Defense shall \n     establish a task force to--\n       (A) review the procedures employed by the Department of \n     Defense to conduct military aviation accident investigations; \n     and\n       (B) identify mechanisms for improving such investigations \n     and the military aviation accident investigation process.\n       (2) The Secretary shall appoint to the task force the \n     following:\n       (A) An appropriate number of members of the Armed Forces, \n     including both members of the regular components and the \n     reserve components, who have experience relating to military \n     aviation or investigations into military aviation accidents.\n       (B) An appropriate number of former members of the Armed \n     Forces who have such experience.\n       (C) With the concurrence of the member concerned, a member \n     of the National Transportation Safety Board.\n       (3)(A) The task force shall submit to Congress an interim \n     report and a final report on its activities under this \n     subsection. The interim report shall be submitted on December \n     1, 1998, and the final report shall be submitted on March 31, \n     1999.\n       (B) Each report under subparagraph (A) shall include the \n     following:\n       (i) An assessment of the advisability of conducting all \n     military aviation accident investigations through an entity \n     that is independent of the military departments.\n       (ii) An assessment of the effectiveness of the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process in \n     identifying the cause of military aviation accidents and \n     correcting problems so identified in a timely manner.\n       (iii) An assessment whether or not the procedures for \n     sharing the results of military aviation accident \n     investigations among the military departments should be \n     improved.\n       (iv) An assessment of the advisability of centralized \n     training and instruction for military aircraft investigators.\n       (v) An assessment of any costs or cost avoidances that \n     would result from the elimination of any overlap in military \n     aviation accident investigation activities conducted under \n     the current so-called ``two-track'' investigation process.\n       (vi) Any improvements or modifications in the current \n     military aviation accident investigation process that the \n     task force considers appropriate to reduce the potential for \n     aviation accidents and increase public confidence in the \n     process.\n       (c) Uniform Regulations for Release of Interim Safety \n     Investigation Reports.--(1)(A) Not later than May 1, 1999, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations that \n     provide for the release to the family members of persons \n     involved in military aviation accidents, and to members of \n     the public, of reports referred to in paragraph (2).\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\n       (B) The regulations shall apply uniformly to each military \n     department.\n       (2) A report under paragraph (1) is a report on the \n     findings of any ongoing privileged safety investigation into \n     an accident referred to in that paragraph. Such report shall \n     be in a redacted form or other form appropriate to preserve \n     witness confidentiality and to minimize the effects of the \n     release of information in such report on national security.\n       (3) Reports under paragraph (1) shall be made available--\n       (A) in the case of family members, at least once every 30 \n     days or upon the development of a new or significantly \n     changed finding during the course of the investigation \n     concerned; and\n       (B) in the case of members of the public, on request.\n\n                      TITLE X--GENERAL PROVISIONS\n\n                     Subtitle A--Financial Matters\n\n     SEC. 1001.

compliant, would cause a significant potential national \n     security risk to the United States.\n       (10) A discussion of the cooperative arrangements between \n     the United States and other nations to assist those nations \n     in identifying and correcting (to the extent necessary to \n     meet national security interests of the United States) any \n     problems in their communications and strategic systems, or \n     other systems identified by the Secretary of Defense, that \n     make the systems not year 2000 compliant.\n       (11) A discussion of the threat

BUDGETING FOR CONTINUED PARTICIPATION OF UNITED \n                   STATES FORCES IN NATO OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA AND \n                   HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Funding levels in the Department of Defense budget have \n     not been sufficient to pay for the deployment of United \n     States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina that \n     began in fiscal year 1996.\n       (2) The Department of Defense has used funds from the \n     operation and maintenance accounts of the Armed Forces to pay \n     for the operations because the funding levels included in the \n     defense budgets for fiscal years 1996 and 1997 have not been \n     adequate to maintain operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (3) Funds necessary to continue United States participation \n     in the NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and to \n     replace operation and maintenance funds used for the \n     operations, have been requested by the President as \n     supplemental appropriations in fiscal years 1996 and 1997. \n     The Department of Defense has also proposed to reprogram \n     previously appropriated funds to make up the shortfall for \n     continued United States operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n       (4) In February 1998, the President certified to Congress \n     that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, was necessary in order \n     to meet national security interests of the United States.\n       (5) The discretionary spending limit established for the \n     defense category for fiscal year 1998 in the Balanced Budget \n     and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 does not take into \n     account the continued deployment of United States forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998. Therefore, the \n     President requested emergency supplemental appropriations for \n     the Bosnia and Herzegovina mission through September 30, \n     1998.\n       (6) Amounts for operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina were \n     not included in the original budget proposed by the President \n     for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 1999.\n       (7) The President requested $1,858,600,000 in emergency \n     appropriations in his March 4, 1998 amendment to the fiscal \n     year 1999 budget to cover the shortfall in funding in the \n     fiscal year 1999 for the costs of extending the mission in \n     Bosnia.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should include in the budget for the \n     Department of Defense that the President submits to Congress \n     under section 1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, for \n     each fiscal year sufficient amounts to pay for any proposed \n     continuation of the participation of United States forces in \n     NATO operations in Bosnia and Herzegovina for that fiscal \n     year; and\n       (2) amounts included in the budget for that purpose should \n     not be transferred from amounts that would otherwise be \n     proposed in the budget of any of the Armed Forces in \n     accordance with the future-years defense program related to \n     that budget, or any other agency of the Executive Branch, \n     but, instead, should be an overall increase in the budget for \n     the Department of Defense.\n\n     SEC. 1066.

and\n       (D) to lead the decisionmaking that identifies the most \n     cost-effective procurements of military equipment and \n     services.\n       (2) The laboratories and test and evaluation centers are \n     facing a number of challenges that, if not overcome, could \n     limit the productivity and self-sustainability of the \n     laboratories and centers, including--\n       (A) the declining funding provided for science and \n     technology in the technology base program of the Department \n     of Defense;\n       (B) difficulties experienced in recruiting, retaining, and \n     motivating high-quality personnel; and\n       (C) the complex web of policies and regulatory constraints \n     that restrict authority of\n\n[[Page S7511]]\n\n     managers to operate the laboratories and centers in a \n     businesslike fashion.\n       (3) Congress has provided tools to deal with the changing \n     nature of technological development in the defense sector by \n     encouraging closer cooperation with industry and university \n     research and by authorizing demonstrations of alternative \n     personnel systems.\n       (4) A number of laboratories and test and evaluation \n     centers have addressed the challenges and are employing a \n     variety of innovative methods, such as the so-called \n     ``Federated Lab Concept'' undertaken at the Army Research \n     Laboratory, to maintain the high quality of the technical \n     program, to provide a challenging work environment for \n     researchers, and to meet the high cost demands of maintaining \n     facilities that are equal or superior in quality to \n     comparable facilities anywhere in the world.\n       (b) Commendation.--Congress commends the Secretary of \n     Defense for the progress made by the science and technology \n     laboratories and test and evaluation centers to achieve the \n     results described in subsection (a)(4) and encourages the \n     Secretary to take the actions necessary to ensure continued \n     progress for the laboratories and test and evaluation centers \n     in developing cooperative relationships with universities and \n     other private sector entities for the performance of research \n     and development functions.\n       (c) Pilot Program.--(1) In conjunction with the plan for \n     restructuring and revitalizing the science and technology \n     laboratories and test and evaluation centers of the \n     Department of Defense that is required by section 906 of this \n     Act, the Secretary of Defense may carry out a pilot program \n     to demonstrate improved cooperative relationships with \n     universities and other private sector entities for the \n     performance of research and development functions.\n       (2) Under the pilot program, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     provide the director of one science and technology \n     laboratory, and the director of one test and evaluation \n     center, of each military department with authority for the \n     following:\n       (A) To explore innovative methods for quickly, efficiently, \n     and fairly entering into cooperative relationships with \n     universities and other private sector entities with respect \n     to the performance of research and development functions.\n       (B) To waive any restrictions on the demonstration and \n     implementation of such methods that are not required by law.\n       (C) To develop or expand innovative methods of operation \n     that provide more defense research for each dollar of cost, \n     including to carry out such initiatives as focusing on the \n     performance of core functions and adopting more business-like \n     practices.\n       (3) In selecting the laboratories and centers for \n     participation in the pilot program, the Secretary shall \n     consider laboratories and centers where innovative management \n     techniques have been demonstrated, particularly as documented \n     under sections 1115 through 1119 of title 31, United States \n     Code, relating to Government agency performance and results.\n       (4) The Secretary may carry out the pilot program at each \n     selected laboratory and center for a period of three years \n     beginning not later than March 1, 1999.\n       (d) Reports.--(1) Not later than March 1, 1999, the \n     Secretary of Defense shall submit a report on the \n     implementation of the pilot program to Congress. The report \n     shall include the following:\n       (A) Each laboratory and center selected for the pilot \n     program.\n       (B) To the extent possible, a description of the innovative \n     concepts that are to be tested at each laboratory or center.\n       (C) The criteria to be used for measuring the success of \n     each concept to be tested.\n       (2) Promptly after the expiration of the period for \n     participation of a laboratory or center in the pilot program, \n     the Secretary of Defense shall submit to Congress a final \n     report on the participation of the laboratory or center in \n     the pilot program.

RUSSIAN NONSTRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPONS.\n\n       (a) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the 7,000 to 12,000 or more nonstrategic (or \n     ``tactical'') nuclear weapons estimated by the United States \n     Strategic Command to be in the Russian arsenal may present \n     the greatest threat of sale or theft of a nuclear warhead in \n     the world today;\n       (2) as the number of deployed strategic warheads in the \n     Russian and United States arsenals declines to just a few \n     thousand under the START accords, Russia's vast superiority \n     in tactical nuclear warheads--many of which have yields \n     equivalent to strategic nuclear weapons--could become \n     strategically destabilizing;\n       (3) while the United States has unilaterally reduced its \n     inventory of tactical nuclear weapons by nearly 90 percent \n     since the end of the Cold War, Russia is behind schedule in \n     implementing the steep tactical nuclear arms reductions \n     pledged by former Soviet President Gorbachev in 1991 and \n     Russian President Yeltsin in 1992, perpetuating the dangers \n     from Russia's tactical nuclear stockpile; and\n       (4) the President of the United States should call on the \n     Russian Federation to expedite reduction of its tactical \n     nuclear arsenal in accordance with the promises made in 1991 \n     and 1992.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than March 15, 1999, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the Congress a report on Russia's \n     nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including--\n       (1) estimates regarding the current numbers, types, yields, \n     viability, and locations of such warheads;\n       (2) an assessment of the strategic implications of the \n     Russian Federation's nonstrategic arsenal, including the \n     potential use of such warheads in a strategic role or the use \n     of their components in strategic nuclear systems;\n       (3) an assessment of the extent of the current threat of \n     theft, sale, or unauthorized use of such warheads, including \n     an analysis of Russian command and control as it concerns the \n     use of tactical nuclear warheads; and\n       (4) a summary of past, current, and planned efforts to work \n     cooperatively with the Russian Federation to account for, \n     secure, and reduce Russia's stockpile of tactical nuclear \n     warheads and associated fissile material.\n       (c) Views.--This report shall include the views of the \n     Director of Central Intelligence and the Commander in Chief \n     of the United States Strategic Command.\n\n     SEC. 1071.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONTINUED \n                   PARTICIPATION OF UNITED STATES FORCES IN \n                   OPERATIONS IN BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The contributions of the people of the United States \n     and other nations have, in large measure, resulted in the \n     suspension of fighting and alleviated the suffering of the \n     people of Bosnia and Herzegovina since December 1995.\n       (2) the people of the United States have expended \n     approximately $9,500,000,000 in tax dollars between 1992 and \n     mid-1998 just in support of the United States military \n     operations in Bosnia to achieve those results.\n       (3) Efforts to restore the economy and political structure \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina have achieved some success in \n     accordance with the Dayton Agreement.\n       (4) In February 1998, the President certified to Congress \n     that the continued presence of United States forces in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina after June 30, 1998, was necessary in order \n     to meet national security interests of the United States.\n       (5) There is, however, no accurate estimate of the time \n     needed to accomplish the civilian implementation tasks \n     outlined in the Dayton Agreement.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) United States ground combat forces should not remain in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina indefinitely in view of the world-wide \n     commitments of the Armed Forces of the United States;\n       (2) the President should work with NATO allies and the \n     other nations whose military forces are participating in the \n     NATO-led Stabilization Force to withdraw United States ground \n     combat forces from Bosnia and Herzegovina within a reasonable \n     period of time, consistent with the safety of those forces \n     and the accomplishment of the Stabilization Force's military \n     tasks;\n       (3) a NATO-led force without the participation of United \n     States ground combat forces in Bosnia and Herzegovina might \n     be suitable for a follow-on force for Bosnia and Herzegovina \n     if the European Security and Defense Identity is not \n     sufficiently developed or is otherwise considered \n     inappropriate for such a mission;\n       (4) the United States may decide to provide appropriate \n     support to a Western European Union-led or NATO-led follow-on \n     force for Bosnia and Herzegovina, including command and \n     control, intelligence, logistics, and, if necessary, a ready \n     reserve force in the region;\n       (5) the President should inform the European NATO allies of \n     this expression of the sense of Congress and should strongly \n     urge them to undertake preparations for establishing a \n     Western European Union-led or a NATO-led force as a follow-on \n     force to the NATO-led Stabilization Force if needed to \n     maintain peace and stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina; and\n       (6) the President should consult closely with the \n     congressional leadership and the congressional defense \n     committees with respect to the progress being made toward \n     achieving a sustainable peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and \n     the progress being made toward a reduction and ultimate \n     withdrawal of United States ground combat forces from Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina.\n       (c) One-Time Reports.--The President shall submit to \n     Congress the following reports:\n       (1) Not later than September 30, 1998, a report containing \n     a discussion of the likely impact on the security situation \n     in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on the prospects for \n     establishing self-sustaining peace and stable local \n     government there that would result from a phased reduction in \n     the number of United States military personnel stationed in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina under the following alternatives:\n       (A) A phased reduction to 5,000 by February 2, 1999, to \n     3,500 by June 30, 1999, and to 2,500 by February 2, 2000.\n       (B) A phased reduction by February 2, 2000, to the number \n     of personnel that is approximately equal to the mean average \n     of--\n       (i) the number of military personnel of the United Kingdom \n     that are stationed in Bosnia and Herzegovina on that date;\n       (ii) the number of military personnel of Germany that are \n     stationed there on that date;\n       (iii) the number of military personnel of France that are \n     stationed there on that date;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the \n     unprecedented explosion of technological advances that could \n     fundamentally redefine military threats and military \n     capabilities in the future have generated a need to assess \n     the defense policy, strategy, and force structure necessary \n     to meet future defense requirements of the United States.\n       (2) The assessment conducted by the administration of \n     President Bush (known as the ``Base Force'' assessment) and \n     the assessment conducted by the administration of President \n     Clinton (known as the ``Bottom-Up Review'') were important \n     attempts to redefine the defense strategy of the United \n     States and the force structure of the Armed Forces necessary \n     to execute that strategy.\n       (3) Those assessments have become inadequate as a result of \n     the pace of global geopolitical change and the speed of \n     technological change, which have been greater than expected.\n       (4) The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff reacted to \n     the changing environment by developing and publishing in May \n     1996 a vision statement, known as ``Joint Vision 2010'', to \n     be a basis for the transformation of United States military \n     capabilities. The vision statement embodies the improved \n     intelligence and command and control that is available in the \n     information age and sets forth the operational concepts of \n     dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full-dimensional \n     protection, and focused logistics to achieve the objective of \n     full spectrum dominance.\n       (5) In 1996 Congress, concerned about the shortcomings in \n     defense policies and programs derived from the Base-Force \n     Review and the Bottom-Up Review, determined that there was a \n     need for a new, comprehensive assessment of the defense \n     strategy of the United States and the force structure of the \n     Armed Forces necessary for meeting the threats to the United \n     States in the 21st century.\n       (6) As a result of that determination, Congress passed the \n     Military Force Structure Review Act of 1996 (subtitle B of \n     title IX of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 1997), which required the Secretary of Defense to \n     complete in 1997 a quadrennial defense review of the defense \n     program of the United States. The review was required to \n     include a comprehensive examination of the defense strategy, \n     force structure, force modernization plans, infrastructure, \n     and other elements of the defense program and policies with a \n     view toward determining and expressing the defense strategy \n     of the United States and establishing a revised defense \n     program through 2005. The Act also established a National \n     Defense Panel to assess the Quadrennial Defense Review and to \n     conduct an independent, nonpartisan review of the strategy, \n     force structure, and funding required to meet anticipated \n     threats to the national security of the United States through \n     2010 and beyond.\n       (7) The Quadrennial Defense Review, completed by the \n     Secretary of Defense in May 1997, defined the defense \n     strategy in terms of ``Shape, Respond, and Prepare Now''. The \n     Quadrennial Defense Review placed greater emphasis on the \n     need to prepare now for an uncertain future by exploiting the \n     revolution in technology and transforming the force toward \n     Joint Vision 2010. It concluded that our future force will be \n     different in character than our current force.\n       (8) The National Defense Panel Report, published in \n     December 1997, concluded that ``the Department of Defense \n     should accord the highest priority to executing a \n     transformation strategy for the United States military, \n     starting now.'' The panel recommended the establishment of a \n     Joint Forces Command with the responsibility to be the joint \n     force integrator and provider and the responsibility for \n     driving the process for transforming United States forces, \n     including the conduct of joint experimentation, and to have \n     the budget for carrying out those responsibilities.\n       (9) The assessments of both the Quadrennial Defense Review \n     and the National Defense Panel provide Congress with a \n     compelling argument that the future security environment and \n     the military challenges to be faced by the United States in \n     the future will be fundamentally different than the current \n     environment and challenges. The assessments also reinforce \n     the foundational premise of the Goldwater-Nichols Department \n     of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986 that warfare, in all of \n     its varieties, will be joint warfare requiring the execution \n     of developed joint operational concepts.\n       (10) A process of joint experimentation is necessary for--\n       (A) integrating advances in technology with changes in the \n     organizational structure of the Armed Forces and the \n     development of joint operational concepts that will be \n     effective against national security threats anticipated for \n     the future; and\n       (B) identifying and assessing the interdependent aspects of \n     joint warfare that are key for transforming the conduct of \n     military operations by the United States to meet those \n     anticipated threats successfully.\n       (11) It is critical for future readiness that the Armed \n     Forces of the United States innovatively investigate and test \n     technologies, forces, and joint operational concepts in \n     simulations, wargames, and virtual settings, as well as in \n     field environments under realistic conditions against the \n     full range of future challenges. It is essential that an \n     energetic and innovative organization be established and \n     empowered to design and implement a process of joint \n     experimentation to develop and validate new joint warfighting \n     concepts, along with experimentation by the Armed Forces, \n     that is directed at transforming the Armed Forces to meet the \n     threats to the national security that are anticipated for the \n     early 21st century. That process will drive changes in \n     doctrine, organization, training and education, materiel, \n     leadership, and personnel.\n       (12) The Department of Defense is committed to conducting \n     aggressive experimentation as a key component of its \n     transformation strategy.\n       (13) The competition of ideas is critical for achieving \n     effective transformation. Experimentation by each of the \n     Armed Forces has been, and will continue to be, a vital \n     aspect of the pursuit of effective transformation. Joint \n     experimentation leverages the effectiveness of each of the \n     Armed Forces and the Defense Agencies.\n\n     SEC. 1202. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Designation of Commander To Have Joint Warfighting \n     Experimentation Mission.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     Congress supports the initiative of the Secretary of Defense \n     and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to designate a \n     commander of a combatant command to have the mission for \n     joint warfighting experimentation, consistent with the \n     understanding of Congress that the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff will assign the designated commander the \n     tasks to develop and validate new joint warfighting concepts \n     and capabilities, and to determine the implications, for \n     doctrine, organization, training and education, materiel, \n     leadership, and personnel, of the Department of Defense \n     strategy for transforming the Armed Forces to meet the \n     national security threats of the future.\n       (b) Resources of Commander.--It is, further, the sense of \n     Congress that the commander designated to have the joint \n     warfighting experimentation mission should--\n       (1) have sufficient freedom of action and authority over \n     the necessary forces to successfully establish and conduct \n     the process of joint warfighting experimentation;\n       (2) be provided resources adequate for the joint \n     warfighting experimentation process; and\n       (3) have authority over the use of the resources for the \n     planning, preparation, conduct, and assessment of joint \n     warfighting experimentation.\n       (c) Authority and Responsibilities of Commander.--It is, \n     further, the sense of Congress that, for the conduct of joint \n     warfighting experimentation to be effective, it is necessary \n     that the commander designated to have the joint warfighting \n     experimentation mission also have the authority and \n     responsibility for the following:\n       (1) Developing and implementing a process of joint \n     experimentation to formulate and validate concepts critical \n     for joint warfighting in the future, including (in such \n     process) analyses, simulations, wargames, information \n     superiority and other experiments, advanced concept \n     technology demonstrations, and joint exercises conducted in \n     virtual and actual field environments.\n       (2) Planning, preparing, and conducting the program of \n     joint warfighting experimentation.\n       (3) Assessing the effectiveness of organizational \n     structures, operational concepts, and technologies employed \n     in joint experimentation, investigating opportunities for \n     coordinating the evolution of the organizational structure of \n     the Armed Forces compatibly with the concurrent evolution of \n     advanced technologies, and investigating new concepts for \n     transforming joint warfighting capabilities to meet the \n     operational challenges expected to be encountered by the \n     Armed Forces in the early 21st century.\n       (4) Coordinating with each of the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies regarding the development of the equipment \n     (including surrogate or real technologies, platforms, and \n     systems) necessary for the conduct of joint experimentation, \n     or, if necessary, developing such equipment directly.\n       (5) Coordinating with each of the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies regarding the acquisition of the materiel, \n     supplies, services, and surrogate or real technology \n     resources necessary for the conduct of joint experimentation, \n     or, if necessary, acquiring such items and services directly.\n       (6) Developing scenarios and measures of effectiveness for \n     joint experimentation.\n       (7) Conducting so-called ``red team'' vulnerability \n     assessments as part of joint experimentation.\n       (8) Assessing the interoperability of equipment and forces.\n       (9) Providing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\n[[Page S7519]]\n\n     with the commander's recommendations (developed on the basis \n     of joint experimentation) for reducing unnecessary redundancy \n     of equipment and forces.\n       (10) Providing the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff with the commander's \n     recommendations (developed on the basis of joint \n     experimentation) regarding synchronization of the fielding of \n     advanced technologies among the Armed Forces to enable the \n     development and execution of joint operational concepts.\n       (11) Submitting, reviewing, and making recommendations (in \n     conjunction with the joint experimentation and evaluation \n     process) to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on \n     mission needs statements and operational requirements \n     documents.\n       (12) Exploring new operational concepts (including those \n     developed within the Office of the Secretary of Defense and \n     Defense Agencies, other unified commands, the Armed Forces, \n     and the Joint Staff), and integrating and testing in joint \n     experimentation the systems and concepts that result from \n     warfighting experimentation by the Armed Forces and the \n     Defense Agencies.\n       (13) Developing, planning, refining, assessing, and \n     recommending to the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff the most promising joint concepts \n     and capabilities for experimentation and assessment.\n       (14) Assisting the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of \n     the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prioritize joint requirements \n     and acquisition programs on the basis of joint warfighting \n     experimentation.\n       (d) Continued Experimentation by Other Defense \n     Organizations.--It is, further, the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Armed Forces are expected to continue to develop \n     concepts and conduct intraservice and multiservice \n     warfighting experimentation within their core competencies; \n     and\n       (2) the commander of United States Special Operations \n     Command is expected to continue to develop concepts and \n     conduct joint experimentation associated with special \n     operations forces.\n       (e) Congressional Review.--It is, further, the sense of \n     Congress that--\n       (1) Congress will carefully review the initial report and \n     annual reports on joint warfighting experimentation required \n     under section 1203 to determine the adequacy of the scope and \n     pace of the transformation of the Armed Forces to meet future \n     challenges to the national security; and\n       (2) if the progress is inadequate, Congress will consider \n     legislation to establish a unified combatant command with the \n     mission, forces, budget, responsibilities, and authority \n     described in the preceding provisions of this section.\n\n     SEC. 1203.

Madam President, I have come to the floor to talk a bit \nabout the crisis in agriculture, especially the crisis facing family \nfarmers in my State of North Dakota. But before I do that, I would like \nto talk just for a moment about a piece of legislation that I \nunderstand may be brought to the floor of the Senate tomorrow--probably \ntomorrow evening. It is the so-called IRS reform bill.\n  In my judgement, there is much in the IRS reform bill that has merit. \nThe hearings that were held in the Senate, which reviewed cases of \nharassment of taxpayers, some unacceptable behavior by Internal Revenue \nService agents, and some other items clearly made the case for the need \nfor some changes with respect to the Internal Revenue Service. Much of \nthis piece of legislation, as I indicated, has merit. But I want to \nobject to something that was done in legislative darkness in putting \nthis conference report together. It is a provision that was not in \neither the House or Senate bills. It is a provision that had never been \ndebated. It had not been put in either bill in the House or Senate. Yet \nat the last moment, in legislative darkness, it was stuck in this \nconference report in the conference committee. I don't understand by \nwhat rules they operate when they say we are going to stick something \nin the conference report that is not in either the House or Senate \nbill.\n  Here is what they did. They said in the conference report that they \nwill reduce the holding period of assets for capital gains from 18 \nmonths to 12 months. What does that mean? Well, it means that those \nwith incomes in this country of over $100,000 a year are going to get \n90 percent of the benefit of a $2 billion tax break. That is $2 billion \nin tax breaks. Ninety percent of it will go to people who make over \n$100,000 in income. In fact, 76 percent goes to people making over \n$200,000 a year or more. This was done without debate. This was one of \nthose little nuggets that was stuck in the bill. It was not debated by \nthe House or the Senate.\n  The same day they said we have $2 billion to give away to the upper-\nincome people, they said we don't have enough money to provide for low-\nincome heating assistance during the winter for low-income folks in the \nnorthern climates. This majority in Congress doesn't have enough money \nfor that. They don't have enough money for low-income people who are \ntrying to heat their homes. They say we are out of money, so we will \ncut that program off. They don't have enough money for summer jobs for \ndisadvantaged youth. Gee, there is not enough money for that. They say \nthere is not enough money for school construction in Indian schools, \nwhere the schools are falling apart and kids are walking through school \ndoors into classrooms of which we all ought to be ashamed. No, there is \nnot enough money for that.\n  But in the dark of the legislative night, there is enough money to \nstick $2 billion into the purses of the richest Americans. This is done \nwith no debate in this Congress. To the people who behave and operate \nlike that and carry those knapsacks full of money to the upper-income \nfolks, I just say that is a terrible way to legislate. On one hand you \nsay you can't afford to help people who really need help, and that you \nhave to abolish low-income energy assistance. Yet, on the other side \nthere is plenty of money to reduce the capital gains holding period, \nwithout even a discussion in Congress about who it is going to benefit. \nIt seems to me this is not a very happy day, when you talk about what \nshould be our legislative priorities around this Capitol Building. I \nwill talk more about that when the bill comes to the floor of the \nSenate tomorrow evening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7521-2", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7521-S7524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FAMILY FARM CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, for the Record, I want to read a letter \nfrom Joni Flaten from Langdon, ND. I visited with her this afternoon. \nShe sent me a letter some while ago. She is a farm wife. We have a huge \nfarm crisis not only in my State of North Dakota, but also in the \nentire wheat belt. Grain prices have collapsed. We have been hit with \nthe toughest, worst outbreak of crop disease in a century in North \nDakota. So you take crop disease that devastates the crop and then you \nadd collapsed prices, and you have a calamity for a lot of family \nfarmers.\n\n  Joni Flaten writes:\n\n       My husband has been farming now for 18 years. He is a third \n     generation farmer, and with my oldest son graduating last \n     Sunday, we were looking forward to some day having the fourth \n     generation. However, that will no longer be possible for we \n     have been unable to get an operating loan this season due to \n     low grain prices . . .\n       I have 3 children and have stayed home for 18 years to \n     raise them and help my husband on the farm. We are now going \n     to be forced into giving up the family farm, and I'm not sure \n     if there is a lot of need for a 38-year-old combine operator/\n     tractor driver/trucker/run for parts person and be a mother \n     in the work force in North Dakota. We have been a true family \n     operation since the boys were able to see over the steering \n     wheels . . . We have not been able to hire an extra man to \n     help us, but we have pulled together as a family at planting \n     and harvest times to get the job done. Now Farm Credit tells \n     us we are unable to get a loan to operate our farm. FAHS \n     tells us we can't have a loan and the sad truth is such a \n     blow to all of my family. Not that you or anyone can do \n     much about this but maybe somehow you can stop it from \n     happening to some other family in the future. It is a good \n     life here in ND but I think you will be 5 people less come \n     this winter!!!\n\n  This is from a woman named Joni Flaten, a farm wife, has been a farm \nwife for 18 years, and they are losing their livelihood, losing their \nfamily farm.\n  Let me show you a picture of Bev and Jim McAllister from Oriska, ND. \nJim McAllister came to a meeting that I had in Mandan, ND, a few months \nago. You can see Jim is a pretty big guy. He stood up at that meeting \nand began talking about his family farm. He said his granddad farmed \nit, his dad farmed it, and he has farmed it for 23 years. Then his chin \nbegan to quiver and he got tears in his eyes. Then he said he is going \nto have to quit farming. Jim and Bev McAllister love farming. They are \nfamily farmers. They have raised their family on the farm. It is a way \nof life they say they wouldn't have traded for anything, and yet they \nare having to leave the farm. There family farm will be history. No \nmore family farming for the McAllister family.\n  Why is this happening?\n  This is a picture of an auction sale in North Dakota. You can see \nwhat an auction sale looks like. There are a lot of folks standing \naround with an auctioneer auctioning off farm machinery. Here are pages \nfrom a North Dakota newspaper. It shows about 150 auction sales. It is \nall advertised in the same week's paper. These auction sales go out for \na good number of weeks. This listing includes some 150 auction sales.\n  They have had so many auction sales on North Dakota farms that they \nhave had to call retired auctioneers back from retirement to handle the \nauction sales. Every one of these auction sales represents a family \nfarmer who has tried to invest everything they have, and have worked \nhard, to run a family farm. And then they discover they can't make it.\n  Why can't they make it? Well, farmers are beset by a whole range of \nproblems these days. First, they wrote a new farm program in Congress \ntwo years ago. I didn't vote for it. I thought it was a terrible farm \nprogram. But those who voted for it--and the President reluctantly \nsigned it--essentially said we are going to pull the safety net\n\n[[Page S7522]]\n\nout from under family farmers. It doesn't matter what the circumstances \nare. If grain prices collapse, somehow we are going to still pull the \nsafety net out from under family farmers and instead set up a \ndecreasing scale of price supports, eventually hoping that family \nfarmers will deal in whatever is the open market. They called this \nprogram Freedom to Farm.\n  It would be like saying to the people in the workforce we are going \nto reduce the minimum wage to $1 an hour and we are going to call it \n``Freedom to Work.'' It is the same logic, exactly the same logic. If \nthey cut the minimum wage to $1 an hour and call it ``Freedom to \nWork,'' it would make as much sense as what they have done to family \nfarmers.\n  Here is what family farmers face in my State. Wheat costs somewhere \naround $4.50 to $5 a bushel to raise. When farmers plant it in the \nspring, in order to plant it they have to have equipment. They have to \nbuy fuel for the tractor. They have to buy seed to plant in the ground. \nThey have to buy fertilizer to fertilize it. They till and seed the \nground, and hope and pray and cross their fingers and hope they get \nenough moisture. If they get enough moisture for that, and if they grow \nwheat, barley, or corn, they hope it doesn't hail and destroy the crop. \nThen they hope the insects don't come and eat the crop. And, they hope \nthey don't experience crop disease that will in other ways ravage and \ndecimate the crop. If all of that is avoided, then maybe in the fall \nthey will have a crop that has come out of the ground and is high \nenough to harvest. Then they will buy fuel for the combine and they \nwill go harvest the crop. When all of that is done, if they have been \nvery lucky, they will have raised a crop that cost them $4.50 or $5 a \nbushel to raise, and they truck it to the county elevator, and they may \nget $3.10 a bushel for it. That means they go broke.\n  On top of the collapsed prices, in North Dakota and a couple of other \nStates, we have been ravaged by the worst possible crop disease. It is \ncalled scab. The technical name is fusarium head blight. I am told that \nthis is the worst crop disease in this century. So these family farmers \nare trying to fight a crop disease that decimates their crop and then a \nprice that is in the tank. The question is: Does anybody care? Does \nanybody care at all?\n\n  We had a group of Senators a week and a half ago who held a press \nconference that said, ``Gee, this farm bill is working just fine. We \nthink things are on the right track.'' What planet could they have \npossibly come from? Where on Earth did they get off the mother ship? \nHow could they say, ``This farm bill is working just fine?\"\n  I would encourage anyone who thinks that to go buy a quarter section \nof land and plant yourself a crop. After you plant it, raise the crop, \nand then sell it, then you will have the big loss that you are going to \nget under this farm program. After you have done that, then come and \ngloat about how the farm program is working. I dare you. See, if you \nhave the courage of your convictions. Any one of those who think this \nfarm program is working just fine, should go buy a farm and have the \nopportunity to lose some money for awhile. Then you will have your \nbanker tell you it is not working out. Only then should you come back \nand give us your theory and tell us how great the farm program is \nworking. Just do it. But don't come in here and preach these platitudes \nabout a program working when it is a disaster. Freedom to Farm has been \na disaster for family farmers.\n  Let me tell you what else is facing family farmers. There are \nhundreds of thousands of family farmers out there. There are almost two \nmillion of them out there. You see them with a yard light on at night \ndotting the countryside. They are raising a family and planting crops. \nLet s say they are raising livestock and they go to market. Let's \nassume they are taking some cows to market. What they find at the \nmarketplace is the neck of that bottle up through which they are trying \nto market is squeezed by four beef packing plants. Four beef packing \ncompanies in this country control 87 percent of the market. That is \nright. Four firms with 87 percent of the market. Ten years ago, it was \n67 percent. Now those four control 87 percent of the market. They set \nthe market. They tell somebody out there who is herding cows and \nraising cattle exactly what they are going to pay them. If they don't \nlike it, tough luck.\n  If you are not raising cows, maybe you are raising hogs. The top four \npork packers in this country control 60 percent of that market. If you \ngo into a packing house that slaughters hogs, 60 percent of the market \nis controlled by only four companies. With sheep, it is 73 percent of \nthe market that is controlled by the top four companies.\n  How about raising grain? The top four firms in flour milling in this \ncountry have 62 percent of the market. The top four grain elevator \nfirms control nearly 60 percent of the Nation's elevator facilities at \nour ports. The top four corn milling firms control 74 percent of the \nmarket. In soybean crushing, the top four firms have 76 percent of the \nmarket. When farmers try to market through the neck of this bottle, it \nis squeezed with an iron grip by increasing monopoly pricing power by \ncorporations that press down on these farm prices.\n  If that is not enough for our farmers to face, then they have to haul \ntheir grain to the markets on railroads that are increasingly \nmonopolistic. In 1980, there were 40 class-one railroads in this \ncountry. Now there are only four.\n  In our State, when they come through with the railroad cars, they \ncharge $2,300 to ship a carload of wheat from Bismarck, ND, to \nMinneapolis. The railroad charges $1,000 to ship a carload of wheat \nfrom Minneapolis to Chicago, which is the same distance. What is the \ndifference? The difference is that on one segment there is competition \nand, therefore, lower prices. In North Dakota, there is not. Therefore, \nthey charge us more than double. We get overcharged because there isn't \ncompetition.\n  If farmers aren't discouraged enough by prices that are in the tank \nor by markets that are controlled by increasingly monopolistic \ntendencies, then they are beset by trade problems.\n  The Canadian trade agreement that we have is unforgivable in the way \nit was negotiated. The United States negotiator went to Canada and \nnegotiated a United States-Canada trade agreement and fundamentally \nsold out agricultural interests. I say that understanding exactly what \nI am saying. I am sure the trade ambassador got other concessions. But \nfamily farmers had the rug pulled out from under them. Every day we \nhave carloads and carloads of grain coming across from Canada into our \nmarketplace. In my judgment this is in contravention of U.S. law. Yet, \nthe Canadians refuse to open their books to GAO audits. In fact, they \njust recently refused once again to allow the GAO at my request to go \nup and audit their books. I think they are guilty of violating American \ntrade laws. But they say, ``No. We are going to ship all of this \nproduct into your country and we don't intend to open our books to \nyou.''\n  The United States-Canada free trade agreement is an outrage. It takes \nmoney right out of the pockets of family farmers, and it has gone on \nfor a number of years, and nobody seems to care much. It is not just \ngrain that comes in from Canada. It is also truckload after truckload \nof livestock. But nobody seems to care much.\n\n  It seems to me that farmers are told in every way that somehow it is \na free market out there. They are told to go participate in that free \nmarket. Yet, when it comes to this country deciding that it wants to \nimpose sanctions on Cuba, farmers are told: Oh, by the way, you can't \nsell grain to Cuba. Or they are told, by the way, you can't sell grain \nto Iran; and, you can't sell grain to Iraq; and, you can't sell grain \nto Libya.\n  Farmers are told, you have to pay the cost of those markets that are \nclosed to you. Farmers are told they have to pay the cost of lost wheat \nsales to China, because we don't have the backbone to stand up to \nChina. We should say to China, if you send us your shirts, your \ntrousers, your shoes, and your trinkets, you then have to buy our \nwheat. Yet, because we don't have the backbone to say to China that as \na condition of our market absorbing all her products that China must \nbuy American grain. Farmers bear the consequences of those kinds of \nincompetent trade agreements and the lack of will and the lack of nerve \nand the lack of backbone. Farmers bear the consequence of that.\n\n[[Page S7523]]\n\n  Most people probably don't know much about farming. Most people \nprobably don't care much about farming. They probably in many cases \nthink that food comes from a carton somewhere at the grocery store.\n  I had a fellow come to North Dakota once. He was a Member of \nCongress, who had never been on a farm. I decided that since he votes \non farm policy issues that I should really take him out and show him a \nfarm. And we did. We went to a dairy barn. And the dairy business is as \ntough a business as there is. It is hard. You get up early in the \nmorning and milk cows. The last thing you do at the end of the day is \nmilk cows. There is no tougher job in the country.\n  My friend was standing there in a blue-striped suit, which is the \nuniform for Congress, and he saw how hard this was. This fellow and his \nwife were in the dairy barn on a little farm north of New Salem, ND, \nand they were milking about 90 cows. That is tough. It was about 5:30 \nin the evening. The light was shafting through the barn, and it was \nbeautiful. And my friend, this Congressman, watched this go on, and \nfinally he said to the farmer, ``How often do you have to do this?'' \nThe farmer was hooking up the milk machines. It is very tough work. He \nsays, ``How often do you have to do this?'' The farmer, whose name was \nGeorge, said, ``Well, you have to do it twice a day. You have to do it \nevery morning and you have to do it every evening.''\n  And my friend, the Congressman from out east, thought about that a \nbit, and then he said, ``George, do you have to do this on weekends, \ntoo?'' And he didn't know. Of course, you have to do it on weekends. \nYou milk 7 days a week twice a day. But he didn't know it. He had never \nbeen on a farm.\n  Family farmers work hard, risk everything they have. In every \ncircumstance, all they want to do is make a decent living. And what we \nare finding in North Dakota and across the farm belt these days is that \nwe have the goofiest, most detrimental farm program you can possibly \nconceive. What does our farm program say to our family farmers out \nthere? What does it say to some lonely farm family living on the farm \nwith a yard light on at night, 5 miles from the nearest neighbor?\n  What we say to them is that you are on your own. You fight the big \ngrain trade firms. You fight the railroad companies. You fight the meat \npacking plants. And, when you are done with those fights, which by the \nway you are going to lose, then you go ahead and fight the European \nUnion, because they are subsidizing their farmers. You fight China \nwhich keeps your wheat out. You fight Japan that doesn't buy enough \nbeef. You go ahead and fight Canada that floods your market and takes \nmoney out of your pocket.\n  We tell our farmers that they have to wage those fights alone, and we \nknow they are going to lose. Yet, we have people on the floor of the \nSenate who chant, ``Free market.'' All they can do is chant, ``Free \nmarket.'' There has never been a free market in agriculture. There \nnever has been, and there probably never will be.\n  Nobody would like it more than I would if farmers could go to the \ngrain elevator with their 2-ton truck, haul their wheat in and get a \ndecent price. Nobody would like that better than I would, because \nfarmers ought to be able to get a decent price from the marketplace. \nWhat if farmers can't? Does this country care whether there are any \nfamily farmers left? It is questionable whether at least some in the \nCongress care at all. But, if this country cares about whether there \nare family farmers left, then if farmers can't get the price at the \ngrain elevator because the market is a manipulated market that is not a \nfree market at all, then there has to be some mechanism, as other \ncountries have done, that says to family farmers, here is a support \nprice in the event you can't get a decent price at the marketplace. It \nis the only way we will keep family farmers on the farm.\n  Now, we don't have much choice, it seems to me, in the coming weeks. \nWe are going to have to decide that we are either going to do something \nto respond to this farm crisis or we are going to see wholesale farm \nbankruptcies all across the country. The very survival of family farms \nis what is at stake.\n  Let me just briefly go through a couple of charts.\n  Here is what has happened to wheat prices. Wheat prices have fallen \n53 percent in the 2 years since the farm bill was passed. That is what \nhas happened to wheat prices under Freedom to Farm. If you love Freedom \nto Farm, then vote Freedom to Farm. But here is what has happened to \nwheat prices. You can chant ``Freedom'' all you like, and it is not \ngoing to help families on the farm stay on the farm. As I said when I \nstarted, chanting ``Freedom to Farm'' and pulling the rug out from \nfamily farmers, would be the same thing as coming to the floor and \nsaying what we propose is to cut the minimum wage to a dollar an hour \nand we will call it freedom to work. It is exactly the same principle.\n  That is what has happened to grain prices. They have dropped from \n$5.75 per bushel to $2.72 per bushel. That is why farmers are in such \nsignificant trouble.\n  Secondly, in addition to that, there is no longer a disaster program. \nNow when you suffer disasters, we cannot respond to it. That is also \npart of the Freedom-to-Farm approach. I want to show you what has \nhappened to family farmers in North Dakota.\n  This is only one State. The red area means that these counties and \nthose farmers living in those counties have been living in a county \ndeclared a disaster area for 5 years in a row. The orange areas have \nhad disasters 4 out of 5 years. You can see that takes up the entire \neastern half of the State. Incidentally, this half of my State is equal \nto five times Massachusetts in land mass. North Dakota is 10 times the \nsize of Massachusetts in land size. But this half of North Dakota has \nhad a disaster declaration for every county 4 out of 5 years. A third \nof our counties have been declared a disaster every year. All of our \ncounties were declared a disaster area this past year.\n  Family farmers can't make it when they have disaster after disaster \nafter disaster. Yet, we have people in Congress saying to them, ``Well, \nso what. Go to the marketplace. It's a free market.'' It is not a free \nmarket.\n  When you have crop disease and disasters, resulting from the wet \ncycle, and collapsed prices, here is what happens to income: In 1 year, \nthere was a 98 percent reduction in net farm income. Family farmers as \na group in North Dakota lost 98 percent of their net income. Think of \nit. Can you think of anyone else in your neighborhood, anyone in your \ntown, who would still be on their feet if they lost 98 percent of their \nnet income? I don't think so; not with a 98 percent loss in net income.\n  Here is what happened to the production costs for family farmers. \nThey have to buy tractors, right? In 20 years, here is what happened to \nthe price of a tractor? In the past 20 years, here is what happened to \nthe price of a combine. Look at what has happened to the fertilizer \ncosts and what has happened to the price of diesel fuel. And then I \nshowed you what happened to wheat prices. All of those input costs \nincreased dramatically and wheat prices come down.\n  Well, there are a lot of solutions to this, some of which will \nappease no one in this Chamber, I suppose. Yet, we must decide as a \nCongress whether this matters.\n  If we have big corporations in this country that get into trouble, \ngosh, there are all kinds of friends there willing to fluff up their \npillow and give them an aspirin and get them to bed for a short nap, \nmaybe give them a transitional loan.\n  It is really interesting. While I am describing to you the problems \nin family farming, think of what has happened during this period of \ntime when family farmers like Jim McAllister and Joni Flaten and others \nare losing everything they have. Yes, absolutely everything. What is \nhappening on the front page of your newspaper? All the biggest \ncompanies in the country are finding romance once again. They are \ndating, and then they are getting married, and so we have these big \nmergers and combinations. Gosh, they love each other. The bigger, the \nbetter. At the upper end of this economic system, things are just \nswimming, I guess. There are record profits, and the largest mergers in \nthe history of humankind. And at the bottom, the folks who are out \nthere trying to raise a family \n\n[[Page S7524]]\n\nand keep a yard light on and run a family farm are going broke in \nrecord numbers.\n  There is something really wrong with that. There is something wrong \nwith a system that doesn't reward what this country should value most \nand that doesn't connect effort and reward. You talk about effort? You \nknow, family farmers are the ones who invest everything they have, work \nhard, risk everything they have, and then discover at the end of it \nthat they don't have the capability of continuing. And this country has \na policy that says that is fine; we don't care about that?\n  We are going to have a big fight in this Chamber this summer to see \nwho cares. Some people may say they don't care. Or they may say they \ncare, but they have constructed these goof-ball policies and they just \nwant to stand over in a corner and chant about free markets. That is \none solution, I guess. But that solution will simply continue this \ndecline, this spiral of failing our family farms.\n  But there are other ways to address this. One is for this Congress to \nwrite a simple farm plan that starts with one single sentence, and that \nsentence says: The purpose of this farm bill is to maintain a network \nof family farms in this country.\n  Otherwise, you will have corporate agrifactories farm from California \nto Maine. There won't be anybody living in the country, and the price \nof food will go up. That can happen and probably will happen unless \nthis country decides that family farmers are in this country's best \ninterests. Thomas Jefferson used to say that it is in this country's \nbest interests to maintain a broad network of ownership in this \ncountry. Broad-based economic ownership is critical to the success of \nthis country.\n  Even if one doesn't care about family farmers, one ought to care \nabout the disparity that exists here. We should care about the massive \nfailure at the bottom of the system affecting people who really produce \nreal things, and the orgy of mergers that is occurring at the top with \nthe big getting bigger.\n  One of the things that bothers me the most about all of this is the \npeople who are out there raising a kernel of wheat or corn or barley to \ntake it to the market are the very ones who are failing. And then \neverybody else who gets hold of that seems to be making record profits. \nGo to the grocery store and buy a box of cereal and look at the price. \nSomebody took that kernel of wheat or corn or grain of rice and they \nmight have puffed it. Now that it is made into puffed wheat, does its \nprice bear any relationship to the price that the farmer gets for the \nwheat? No, not at all. The farmer gets a pitiful price that is \ninsufficient to keep the farmer in business. But those who process it, \nthose who haul it, those who puff it, those who crisp it, those who \nshred it, they are all making record profits. There is something wrong \nwith that. There is something wrong with the method by which this \nsystem values what people contribute to our economic system.\n  Some people might say to me, ``Gee, you come from North Dakota and \nyou have a different view of economics. You didn't go to the University \nof Chicago, the School of Economics; you don't understand free \nmarkets,'' and so on. No, I understand it. I understand the difference \nbetween the theory, the chanting and all the nonsense and the reality \nthat exists every day confronting people who produce every day.\n  So I know there will be some in this Chamber who will be upset this \nsummer that we are going to push them very hard on these policies. \nThose of us who have other ideas and believe there is a better way and \ndifferent approach and believe there is a way for this Congress to \nstand up for family farming. We need to say to our family farmers, just \nas the Europeans have said to their family farmers and other countries \nhave said to theirs, that you matter. Your presence as a producer, as a \nfamily farmer in this country, makes a difference to us. It strengthens \nthis country. It nurtures this country.\n  The formation of family values in America always came from family \nfarms. The seed bed of family values came from family farms. They have \nrolled into small towns and rolled into the cities, nurturing and \nrefreshing the family values of this country. So, therefore, family \nfarming matters. It is more than just dollars and cents, and it is more \nthan just economics. Family farming, as an economic and social policy, \nmatters in this country.\n\n  Those who have currently gained the upper hand politically on this \nissue have constructed a farm policy that says, ``We are going to pull \nthe rug out from under you even as we negotiate bad trade agreements. \nWe are going to pull the rug out from under you on support and there \nwill be no disaster programs for massive crop disease.'' Those folks \nare not going to like what some of us feel we must do this summer to \ntry to force the issue to deal with family farming.\n  Mr. President, I think of Joni Flaten, a 38-year-old woman from \nLangdon, ND, who writes a letter with resignation. She and her husband \nhave invested in their farm and in fact they are losing their farm, and \nthey wonder what to do next. She says, ``. . . I'm not sure if there is \na lot of need for a 38-year-old combine operator/tractor driver/\ntrucker/run for parts person and be a mother in the workforce in North \nDakota.'' That is what you do to run a farm. Everybody does everything.\n  Some, I guess, as the old saying goes, understand the cost of \neverything and the value of nothing. That is what we have here, in my \njudgment. We went through this debate a couple of years ago on the \nFreedom to Farm bill and I was never made quite so despondent about a \nU-turn in public policy as I was by those who said, ``Gee, family \nfarmers really don't matter very much. We have this market system they \ncan work in.''\n  Everybody here knows. The statistics I have just used are not foreign \nto anybody here. They say to the family farmer: You operate in this \nmarket system. We understand the grain trading firms have a hammerlock \non price; we understand the railroads have a hammerlock on your \ntransportation; we understand that meat packing plants have a \nhammerlock on your marketing system, but, still, you go ahead and \noperate in the free market.\n  I think it would be perfectly understandable for farmers to start \ntheir tractors and gas them up and head them towards the byways and \nhighways that haul policy makers to legislative forums where they extol \nabout a free market that doesn't exist and see if they cannot persuade \nthem that family farming matters and that their futures and their \nfortunes matter as well.\n  We expect in the coming weeks to have discussions about a disaster \nprogram or an indemnification program, either one; about a price \nsupport program; about a range of other issues that need to be \naddressed, including the question of concentration in the meat packing \nindustry and other issues. But through it all, I expect we will debate \nthese issues in the month of July.\n  Now that the Senate will be back voting tomorrow, we will see work on \nappropriations bills. Will we see business as usual? Will we see the \nkind of legislative sleight of hand that I mentioned at the start of \nthis discussion? Will we see conference committees come to the floor of \nthe Senate in which a $2 billion item was offered in legislative \ndarkness that will butter the bread of the richest folks in America? \nThen the same people who decide they want to do that will say, ``Gee, \nwe don't have enough money to help poor people who can't afford home \nheating.''\n  We will see all that kind of thing that goes on around here because \npeople can do it, and they do do it, and that is unfortunate. That is \nnot the bright side of legislating. That is the dark side of \nlegislating. But, hopefully, enough of us will force enough of others \nof us in this Chamber to confront these questions. Does farm policy \nwork when farmers are told that whatever they get in the marketplace is \nall there is, and the marketplace collapses like a used accordion, and \nthe farmers are then told, well, it's tough luck; some big corporation \nwill come and farm all that land and America will be just as well off \nwith an agrifactory?\n  In my judgment, it won't. I recognize I come from a town of 300 \npeople in a small rural area of North Dakota. But the people who farm \nin North Dakota and up and down the farm belt are some of the best \npeople in this country. They don't deserve to be whipsawed by an \neconomic system that is unfair to them, that treats them fundamentally \nunfairly with respect to trade agreements and sanctions, and markets \nthat are unfair, markets that are clogged. It is not the right way for \nthis country to treat its family farmers.\n\n  So, again, Mr. President, in the coming couple of weeks, the \nleadership of the Senate should expect to confront these issues. I hope \nthose who feel strongly about the current farm policy will bring their \nnotebooks, bring their theory, and sharpen their chants, because they \nare going to have an opportunity to tell us about free markets once \nagain. We will have an opportunity to visit about farm families who are \ngoing broke under that very same set of circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/07/06/senate-section/article/S7521-3", "month": "07", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "06", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7524]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
