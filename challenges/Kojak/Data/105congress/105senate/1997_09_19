The clerk will report S. 830.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 830) to amend the Federal Food, Drug and \n     Cosmetic Act and the Public Health Service Act to improve the \n     regulation of foods, drugs, devices and biological products, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate resumed the consideration of the bill.\n  Pending:\n\n       Modified committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. \n     (The modification incorporated the language of Jeffords \n     amendment No. 1130, in the nature of a substitute.)\n       Harkin amendment No. 1137 (to amendment No. 1130), \n     authorizing funds for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2000 \n     to establish within the National Institutes of Health an \n     agency to be known as the National Center for Complementary \n     and Alternative Medicine.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor up to 1 hour.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 50 minutes.\n  Mr. President, this morning we continue the discussion of one of the \nmost important and one of the most controversial and I believe one of \nthe most dangerous provisions of S. 830. We are hopeful that we will be \nable to garner the attention of the Members of the Senate to support an \namendment that will be offered and voted on Tuesday next that will \naddress this dangerous provision that puts the American consumer at \nrisk.\n  At the outset, I want to mention that those of us who are concerned \nabout this particular provision are many. The Department of Health and \nHuman Services, which is the principal agency of our National \nGovernment responsible for the health and safety of the American \npeople, is strongly opposed to section 404, and supports the position \nthat I have taken here today.\n  Other groups opposed to section 404. Those groups that are opposed to \nthe provision also include the Patients' Coalition, which represents \npatients from all over this country, a real grassroots organization \nthat understands, at the grassroots level, or the Main Street level, \nthe dangers that this particular provision will mean unless we address\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\nit; the Consumer Federation of America; the National Women's Health \nNetwork; the National Organization for Rare Disorders; the American \nPublic Health Association, which is charged with protecting the public \nhealth of Americans; the Consumers Union, another grassroots \norganization that looks after the interests of the consumer for a range \nof different issues and has targeted this particular provision; the \nCenter for Women's Policy Studies; the National Parent Network on \nDisabilities; the National Association of Social Workers; the Policy \nCenter for Children, Youth and Families; the American Council on \nConsumer Awareness; and the TMJ Association, they are the victims of \nthe artificial jaw joint group. All of these organizations, and there \nare many more, are reflecting the anxiety and very deep concern and \nlegitimate concern that consumers have about a particular provision \nthat is included in this legislation, which will effectively handcuff \nthe FDA from looking beyond just the manufacturer's label to get to the \nbottom line, whether a particular device which has a manufacturer's \nlabel is really going to be both marketed and utilized in such a way as \nto pose a serious and grievous health hazard to the American consumer.\n  I think the National Women's Health Network states the situation very \nwell. I will just take a moment, before getting into the principal \nreasons for hoping that we will be able to alter and change this \nprovision on Tuesday next, to read it, because it really summarizes the \nconcerns of, in this case, the National Women's Health Network \nrepresenting the millions of women across this country.\n\n       On behalf of the 13,000 individual and 300 organized \n     members of the National Women's Health Network, I am writing \n     to express our continued opposition to S. 830 because of the \n     serious implications this legislation has for our Nation's \n     women. The network is extremely concerned that section 404 \n     prevents the FDA from requiring medical device companies to \n     perform complete reviews of the safety and effectiveness of a \n     medical device. This provision must be amended to give the \n     FDA the authority to verify that the label used is not false \n     or misleading.\n\n  That is what we are talking about this morning, labeling, by the \nmanufacturing company, of a medical device, that is false and \nmisleading. The amendment which we will offer next Tuesday will say \nthat when FDA finds that the medical device company is filing a false \nand misleading label, that the FDA will be able to look at the safety \nconsiderations of that device in order to protect the American \nconsumer.\n\n  The Food and Drug Administration has a staff of scientists and \nresearchers, individuals who have expert knowledge of different medical \ndevices, whose only purpose is to protect the public. It is that group \nof individuals that we entrust--we recognize that they are human and \nare capable of making mistakes, nonetheless, they are the principal \nagent to trust to protect the American public's health and safety. When \nwe have false and misleading labels by medical device industries, we \nneed to make sure that the FDA scientists and researchers, who are \ncharged with protecting the American public, are going to be able to \nmake a thorough determination as to the safety and the efficacy of the \ndevices. This is the issue. That is what the National Women's Health \nNetwork illustrates. The letter continues:\n\n       Women need the FDA to act as a safety sieve, screening out \n     drugs and devices which are hazardous or ineffective. If \n     section 404 were enacted, a device manufacturer could label \n     its product for a very simple use and the FDA would be \n     limited to asking for proof in safety and effectiveness about \n     that use only. Even if it were clear from the device's \n     technical characteristics that it might be used for other, \n     riskier purposes, the FDA would be prevented from looking \n     beyond the conditions of use on the label.\n\n  If we are concerned about protecting the American consumer, this \nmakes no sense. We should not be tying the hands of the FDA when we \nshould be protecting the health of the American consumer. Look at \nrecent history and the medical device disasters that this country has \nfaced. This bill opens the potential for those diasters to be \nreplicated. We all hope they will not be. But one of the principal \nsafeguards for preventing this is the FDA being able to examine the \nsafety of devices. The letter goes on:\n\n       Section 404 is a serious danger to women's health.\n\n  I repeat, this particular section, section 404--\n\n     is a serious danger to women's health, which must be fixed \n     before S. 830 is acted upon by the Senate. In light of \n     today's front page coverage of the fen/phen catastrophe, in \n     which women were the victims of off-label drug use, we find \n     it inconceivable that the Senate would pass a bill with this \n     provision.\n\n  There it is. They have it right. We just had the fen/phen disaster, \nin which scores of individuals have suffered--have perhaps lost their \nlives--as a result of off-label use. And here we have on the U.S. \nSenate floor a particular provision that will invite unscrupulous \nmedical device companies not to clearly and accurately state what their \nmedical device is going to be used for. This is the issue. We have \nscores of other letters, similar to the one I just read, expressing \nconcern about section 404.\n  The issues are clear. Will the Senate vote in favor of approving a \nmedical device based on false and misleading labels? Will the Senate \nallow dangerous medical devices that have not been tested for safety \nand effectiveness to be foisted on the American people? Will companies \nlike U.S. Surgical Corp. be rewarded for deceiving the FDA? Will the \nSenate put a higher value on the profits of the powerful than the \nhealth of the American people?\n  Mr. President, let me point out, that if U.S. Surgical Corp. is able \nto have their way--if they are allowed to misleadingly label their \nmedical device as being substantially equivalent--they will be \nvirtually guaranteed approval under the language of this bill. Because \nthis bill says that if the medical device is substantially equivalent \nto one that has been approved and meets those safety requirements, it \nmust be approved. Despite the fact that this corporation, U.S. Surgical \nCorp., has a device that is being advertised and will be used for an \nentirely different purpose. A purpose for which it has not been tested \nfor safety. What happens to the ethical companies? What happens to the \nother medical device companies that are trying to provide safe medical \ndevices?\n  They are going to be at a competitive disadvantage because they will \ncome up and say to the FDA, ``Look, our device is for this purpose and \nwe have conducted these expensive safety tests.'' That is going to cost \nthat company, and it means that their medical device is going to be \nmore expensive. What happens to these other companies when a company \nlike the U.S. Surgical Corp. is able to get in the door without \nproviding safety information, without doing that kind of testing? This \nis also an issue.\n  It is not the most important argument. The most important one is \nhealth and safety. If this language is not altered or changed, it will \nbe an invitation for medical device companies all over America to jump \nthrough this loophole in order to get their products on line. Will the \nSenate put a higher value on the profits of the powerful than the \nhealth of the American people?\n  Section 404 of the bill requires FDA to approve a medical device \nbased on the use claimed on the label submitted by the manufacturer--\neven if that label is false and misleading.\n  Think of it. The FDA will be required to give approval even though \nthe label is false and misleading. Whose interests are we protecting? \nAre we protecting the American consumers' interests, or are we \nprotecting the profits of the medical device company? The way this law \nis currently constructed, it will help protect the profits of companies \nlike U.S. Surgical Corp. It prevents the FDA from requiring \nmanufacturers to demonstrate that their product is safe and effective \nfor the purposes for which it will be used as opposed to the purpose \nfalsely claimed on the label.\n  It stands 20 years of progress toward safer and more effective \nmedical devices on its head. For 20 years, since 1974, we have tried, \nthrough the FDA, to make sure that medical devices are safe and \nefficacious. This is the first time in over 20 years that we are taking \na step backward. We take modest steps forward on the basis of \nexperience, at both the FDA and across the country, to provide \nadditional protections for the American consumer. Now we are faced with \nthe first significant and major step backward.\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\n  Mr. President, to illustrate that, the U.S. Surgical Corp., a large \nand successful manufacturer of medical devices, submitted a new machine \nto the FDA for approval. This machine was called the Advanced Breast \nBiopsy Instrumentation System. The company claimed that the machine was \nto be used only for taking biopsies of breast tumors suspected of being \ncancerous. Cancer is a word that any family in America hates to hear. \nMany Members of this body, many Members of the House of Representatives \nand so many American families have been touched by cancer. There are \nfew people listening today whose family has not been touched by cancer \nin some way. With the increasing number of breast cancers, this \nparticular medical device is the most offensive, because the principal \ndisaster is not only contracting cancer, but it is in the failure of \nbeing able to diagnose it and treat it effectively.\n  What has the U.S. Surgical Corp. done? The company claimed that the \nmachine was to be used only for taking biopsies of breast tumors \nsuspected of being cancerous, but the machine was designed to excise a \npiece of tissue 50 times as large as other biopsy devices already on \nthe market. It was obvious from the machine's design that it was \nintended to remove breast cancer tumors, not simply take samples for \nbiopsy.\n  Maybe it works. Maybe it is a major breakthrough. Maybe it can do all \nthe things that the U.S. Surgical Corp. says can be done. Wouldn't that \nbe wonderful? But we don't know. Maybe it doesn't. Maybe it doesn't \nwork. Maybe when the doctor says we have excised the tumor, it doesn't \ndo it completely. We don't know. Maybe when that woman walks out of the \ndoctor's office or leaves the hospital, she is still in danger. She \nbelieves she has been treated effectively, but maybe this device isn't \neffective at removing tumors. Then there is the possiblity that in 4 \nweeks, 5 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 1\\1/2\\ years, the cancer is still \npresent and life and health are still at risk.\n  Why are we taking a chance, Mr. President? Because the medical device \ncompanies want this provision.\n  It was obvious from the machine's design that it was intended to \nremove breast cancer tumors. In fact, we have obtained a videotape, \nmade in Canada, that demonstrates that the company knew it would be \nused for that purpose, despite their false claims to the FDA.\n  Here you have the U.S. Surgical Corp. saying to the FDA that we have \na small biopsy needle the size of the lead in a pencil, that will be \nused to check a tumor, returning to the FDA for approval of what they \nlabel as a substantially equivalent medical device. Under this \nlegislation--even though the company is out advertising that medical \ndevice for an entirely different purpose, for which they have not \nprovided any health or safety information to the FDA and under this \nlegislation--FDA would have to approve it. Despite the fact the FDA \nknows the device will be used for another purpose. Under this bill, the \nFDA could not say, ``Provide the information to show that this is safe \nand effective.''\n\n  This is the example, Mr. President. We are talking about cancer--\nbreast cancer. We are talking about 1 out of 7 women who are going to \nbe affected at some time in their lives. We know the enormous \nlegitimate concerns that women have, that mothers have, that daughters \nhave. And we are going to say we are prepared to allow them to have \nless than the best protections we can offer?\n  Mr. President, under this section of the FDA bill, the FDA would be \nforced to approve the new device without any evidence on the safety and \neffectiveness for new uses. American women do not want to die from \nbreast cancer because the companies are allowed to sell devices whose \nsafety and effectiveness have not been demonstrated.\n  No Senator would want their wife or mother or daughter to be \nsubjected to such an untested device solely because a greedy company \nwants higher profits. The issue goes far beyond the products to excise \nbreast cancer. It applies to lasers to treat prostate disease, stems to \nbe placed in carotid arteries, imaging systems to detect breast cancer, \nand a host of other treatments for dreaded diseases.\n  Public health professionals will tell you as we continue to develop \nnew technological advances this problem will only grow along with the \nthreats to public health and safety. We will be rolling the dice. How \nmany people are willing to roll the dice for a member of their family \nand use a medical device that has not been adequately tested? The \ncompanies are out there, Mr. President, and they won't mind if we roll \nthe dice. Are we going to permit that?\n  This provision will give unscrupulous companies incentives to lie to \nthe FDA. It will penalize ethical companies who are truthful and doing \nthe necessary testing to demonstrate that their products are safe and \neffective. Most of all, it will put the health of the American people \nat risk so that a greedy few can increase profits. Companies that hope \nto benefit by weakening the FDA are already powerful and profitable. \nThey believe they have the votes to push this disgraceful provision \nthrough the Senate--and this morning they probably would have. It is \nabsolutely untenable and outrageous and unnecessary that we would, \nexcept to provide additional profits for a company that will use this \nloophole to get their devices on market earlier.\n  If the American people truly understand what is at stake, I do not \nbelieve they will permit this dangerous provision to become law. When \nthe vote comes on Tuesday, we will see how many Senators are willing to \nstand with the American people and how many are willing to vote in \nfavor of false and misleading labels. Let me make it very clear that \nthe Tuesday vote will not be the end of the story. We will continue to \nfight to keep this provision from becoming law, and I believe we will \nsucceed in the end. The FDA bill has many constructive elements, but \nthis disgraceful provision should be eliminated. The false or \nmisleading label should have no place in the approval of medical \ndevices. Unscrupulous manufacturers do not deserve a free ride at the \nexpense of the public.\n  Mr. President, what we are talking about is S. 830, and section 404, \nwhich prohibits the FDA from reviewing the safety of a device for uses \nnot listed by the manufacturer.\n  This provision handicaps the principal agency of Government that is \ncharged with safety, and we are writing into the law language that will \nprohibit FDA--which is the agency charged with protecting the American \npeople from unsafe pharmaceutical drugs and medical devices--from doing \nits job. The FDA would be prohibited from reviewing the safety of a \ndevice for uses not listed by the manufacturer.\n  What our amendment says is, OK, we'll prohibit the FDA from reviewing \nthe safety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer--unless \nthe label is false or misleading. How can Members of this body say that \nthey will refuse to stand with those of us who support the Reed \namendment that says ``unless the label is false and misleading''?\n  We have the example of U.S. Surgical Corp.'s biopsy needle. A needle \ndesigned to extract a small amount of cancerous tissue, maybe the size \nof a pen or the lead of a pencil. Now what has the company done? It has \ndeveloped a much larger device that may be able to take a biopsy, but \nwhich, in fact, is primarily designed for tumor removal. But all they \nwill have to be able to do is show that they are substantially \nequivalent.\n  Under this proposal, the FDA will not be able to look at what the \nreal purpose of this medical device is. We know what the U.S. Surgical \nCorp.'s real purpose for this medical device is. We know because we \nhave seen the advertisement they have already prepared. This device \nwhich can take out 50 times more material than its predecessor--50 \ntimes more material--is not intended to be used for a biopsy, but is \ndesigned to excise the tumor. Maybe it can do it well, Mr. President. \nMaybe it is an important and major step forward. But any woman who has \na procedure done with this device, will not be able to judge from the \nsafety information that is provided to the FDA because there has been \nnone provided. They won't know the results of testing conducted on this \ndevice because there have been no tests submitted to the FDA. They \nwon't know whether this is a successful device because there is no \ninformation to indicate its success.\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\n  We are talking about women and breast cancer. We are talking about a \nmedical device that is put forward with virtually no intention for use \nfor biopsies. Where an earlier smaller, less intrusive device already \nexists for biopsies. A device that is going to be used to remove \ntumors, and is advertised to doctors as such.\n  What are the American doctors supposed to believe? They say, ``Well, \nwe have FDA approval.''\n  ``Well, isn't that fine. Then it must be all right, it must be \nsafe.''\n  But no doctor is able to give that kind of assurance to a woman who \nis going to have this particular medical device utilized to excise a \ntumor, because it has not been done. How would our amendment change \nthat? Our amendment would say that if the advertising is false or \nmisleading, that anyone would be able to see that this particular \ndevice is going to be used to excise a tumor--U.S. Surgical, show us \nyour studies, show us your information that would indicate that this is \nsafe for American women. Show us where you have tested it to show that \nit does the job. Show us that it will do what you are advertising will \nbe done. Let us examine that. And if that is the case, we approve it \nfor that particular purpose.\n\n  This provision is unconscionable, Mr. President, when you look at the \ntragedies that have resulted from device disasters. We are not talking \nabout Band-Aids and tongue depressors. We have seen medical device \ndisasters which have cost the lives of hundreds and thousands of \nAmerican consumers.\n  I was here and chaired the hearings on the Dalkon shield IUDs, which \ninjured tens of thousands of women. Their injuries included pelvic \ninflammatory disease, sterility and perforated uteruses. That is \nbecause, Mr. President, with the Dalkon shield we found out that \nbacteria crept through the string of the device and caused infections \nin American women.\n  As a result of this disaster in the mid-1970's we set up protections \nfor the American consumer with regard to medical devices to ensure that \nthey would be safe and efficacious. Prior to the mid-1970's we did not \ntest for safety and efficacy. We want to be able to make sure that the \nFDA is going to be able to test for safety and efficacy on a product \nthat is going to be the predominant use of a particular medical device.\n  In another example of a human and public health tragedy involving a \nmedical device, the firm Telectronics marketed a pacemaker wire for use \nin the heart. Twenty-five thousand of these pacemakers were marketed, \nbeginning in 1994, before it was discovered that the wire could break, \ncause damage to the wall of the heart, or even destroy the aorta.\n  Why are we being asked in the U.S. Senate to deny the FDA adequate \nauthority to protect the American people? Safe and effective medical \ndevices is what the American public deserve and it is what Senator \nReed's amendment to section 404 would ensure.\n  Mr. President, another example is patients with defective Shiley \nheart valves who died, underwent painful and dangerous surgeries to \nremove the valves.\n  The company increased the degree of a particular vent from 60 degrees \nto 70 degrees. But because FDA had the power to examine whether this \npresented any additional health hazards to the American people, the \nmodified valve was not marketed in the U.S. The company sold them in \nEurope. And the modified valve had six times the amount of disasters in \nthe hearts as a result of that 10-percent increase. Hundreds of deaths \nresulted in Europe and thousands and thousands of people put at risk.\n  Then we have the angioplasty catheters that failed causing dozens to \nsuffer emergency coronary bypass surgery, cardiac damage and death.\n  Mr. President, this is what we are talking about. We are talking \nabout S. 830 which allows false and misleading labels for medical \ndevices. S. 830 could result in the surgical needles that do not safely \nremove the breast cancer tumors.\n  FDA has been asked to clear surgical lasers for marketing despite the \nlack of safety data submitted to support the clear intent of the \nmanufacturer--to cut prostate tissue. What we have are laser \nmanufacturers that say, ``Well, all right, we want to use lasers in the \noperations on the prostate. And a certain amount of cutting is going to \nbe necessary.'' They effectively say, ``Our laser is substantially \nequivalent to lasers that are already approved for general cutting,'' \nwhen the intention of the company is to use the newer designed laser \nnot just in the ordinary cutting of tissues but for use in a prostate \noperation. Therefore, through this loophole, a device may be used for a \npurpose for which it was clearly designed but not adequately tested.\n  We have also, Mr. President, the example of contact lenses that may \ncause blindness. FDA can tell by the materials and design of a contact \nlens that it will be used for extended wear. But a company could submit \ndata only on a labeled use of daily wear and FDA would be prohibited \nfrom asking for additional information on extended wear. Extended wear \nlenses that are not adequately tested may cause ulcers on the cornea \nand can be sight-threatening.\n  Mr. President, we may see in the future digital mammography screening \nmachines that may misdiagnose breast cancer. We have seen enormous \nprogress being made in terms of mammography with all the benefits of \nearly detection of breast cancer which permits early treatment and \nsaves lives.\n  These advanced technologies, Mr. President, may be able to perform \ndiagnostic mammography but not mammography screening. There is an \nimportant difference. The screening is used to find out whether there \nare tumors as compared to examining a tumor for diagnostic purposes to \nmake a determination of the appropriate kinds of medical treatment. A \nmammography instrument labeled for use as a diagnostic machine could \nhave features specific to mammography screening and the safety data \nshould be submitted to support that use.\n  Why do we have to take a chance on it? What is the compelling need to \ntake a chance on women's health? Why shouldn't we say to FDA that if \nthey have reason to believe that the primary purpose of this new \nmachine is going to be for screening and the label is false and \nmisleading that they can ask for safety data for the intended use.\n  Why should we hamstring the FDA when we know that the purpose for \nthese new kinds of medical devices are not consistent with what is \nbeing labeled by the manufacturing company?\n  (Ms. COLLINS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Under this legislation, the FDA, even though they know \nthis might provide an important safety question for the American \npeople, are handcuffed from doing anything about it. Why are we doing \nthis to the American people? For what purpose? Are we that far behind \nin terms of online medical devices? We are not.\n  I can put in the Record the various publications of the medical \ndevice industry that show they have been making important progress over \nthe past several years, and the profits have gone up, and a different \natmosphere is out there to bring the various products on the market. A \nGAO report has shown that medical device review times are down.\n  So if that is the case, why, now, are we going to rush these devices \non through when their purposes are clearly different from the labeled \nuse and for which we do not have adequate safety data? This is a major \nstep back, and puts the public at risk.\n  Madam President, we can go through what some of the dangers are when \nwe find various devices are used for one purpose and then changed and \naltered for another purpose. In this diagram we have the long bone \nscrews that are used effectively to mend bones. I have a member of my \nfamily that has had those implanted and they have been enormously \neffective. A member of the family had a broken shoulder, and I went \nback to see her 5 days later and she was able to move her arm, move her \nshoulder. It was unbelievable when you think of what most of us \nunderstood would be a recovery time of several months.\n  We have seen how, when used properly, how they can help mend a bone, \ngive stability to bone, and be effective in helping and assisting those \npeople with that kind of a break to long bones. Then what happened? We \nfound out the screws were being sold to back surgeons for another \npurpose. They were marketed for use in the spinal column to give \nstability to the spine.\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\n  What happened? Madam President, the screws broke, and they were \ndisasters for many Americans who had the operation. Those screws were \nnot adequately tested for use in the back and should not have been used \nin that manner.\n  These examples are what is happening every day. We have the biopsy \nneedle, the contact lenses, we have the long bone screws, and the list \ngoes on. We ought to be very careful about denying the Food and Drug \nAdministration needed information in terms of their safety and \neffectiveness.\n  Now, Madam President, we cannot prohibit off-label use of medical \ndevices. We are not doing that in the proposed amendment. What we are \nsaying is that when you have on the face of it a clear intention that \nthe new proposal that is being submitted to the FDA is going to be used \nclearly as a dominant use for another purpose, such as the breast \nbiopsy instrumentation, that the FDA ought to be able to look at the \nsafety and efficacy of the device.\n  Why are we going through this, Madam President? Why are we tying the \nhands of the agency that has the skill and the knowledgeable people to \ntry to protect the public?\n  All we are saying is when there is a clear record on the use of a \ndevice, make sure the American public's interest is going to be \nprotected and not denied. All our amendment says is when the label is \nfalse and misleading, the FDA is going to be able to look behind it. \nThat does not seem to me to be a very dramatic or radical kind of \nresolution to this particular issue.\n  We have indicated four or five different types of compromises to this \nparticular measure to try to protect the public's interest. We are \nready to look at different language to protect the public's interest. \nBut the guiding light is, when we know a medical device is being \nsubmitted with false or misleading information and that the device is \nclearly designed for another purpose, the FDA should be able to look at \nthe safety and the efficacy of the device.\n  We have seen in recent years the dangers of simple changes like the \nabsorbency of tampon material. It looked like it was just a very modest \nkind of alteration or change. But women were injured, and subject to \ninfections that caused toxic shock syndrome sometimes leading to death.\n  Why are we doing less for the protection of our consumers? Why are we \nrestricting the protections of the American consumers? We are going to \nhave a difficult enough time trying to make sure that when medical \ndevices go through vigorous requirements for safety and effectiveness \nthat they are indeed safe and efficacious. Some mistakes may very well \nbe made. At least we will know we have given it our best shot. At least \nwe will know we have given to the American people the best we have, in \nterms of scientists and researchers, to try to make sure those products \nare safe.\n  On this particular provision, for the first time in 23 years, we will \nbe effectively rolling back public health protections at FDA. We will \nbe effectively handcuffing the FDA on a major matter that affects the \nhealth and the safety of the American people. It is unwise. It is \nunjust. There is absolutely no rationale or justification for this \nprovision other than the profits of the medical device industry.\n  Madam President, I cannot help but believe as the American people \nunderstand this issue, understand the health implications, understand \non the one hand we are risking the public health of the American people \nin favor of the profits of the medical device industry, that they will \nbe heard on this issue. This provision puts at serious risk the health \nof the American people--that is what the HHS says, that is what the \nWomen's Health Network says, that is what the principal consumers \ngroups that are out there to protect the American people say.\n  What is the benefit on the other side? The profits of unscrupulous \nmedical device manufacturers. It is not only going to be the profit of \nthose individual companies like U.S. Surgical, but it will be an \ninvitation to other medical device companies to go through a loophole, \nbecause otherwise they will be put at a competitive disadvantage. It \nmakes absolutely no sense.\n  I hope very much, that when the Senate addresses this issue in the \nnext week, we can have the support of our colleagues and we will have \nthe support of the House of Representatives and we can move forward \nwith an otherwise reasonable bill.\n  I see my friend and colleague, Senator Durbin, here on the floor. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding under the unanimous consent I am \nallotted 30 minutes, 15 minutes on each side, on two separate \namendments, amendments 1139 and 1140. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right under the agreement \nto call up either amendment 1139 or 1140. When he does so, he will have \n30 minutes on each amendment, equally divided.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank you, Madam President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1140\n\n   (Purpose: To require that entities and individuals accredited to \n conduct reviews of device notifications be subject to the conflict of \n    interest standards that apply to employees of the Food and Drug \n                            Administration)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I call up amendment 1140.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Feingold, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1140.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       In section 523 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, \n     as added by section 204, strike subsection (b) and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Accreditation.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Within 180 days after the date of \n     enactment of this section, the Secretary shall adopt methods \n     of accreditation that ensure that entities or individuals who \n     conduct reviews and make recommendations under this section \n     are qualified, property trained, knowledgeable about handling \n     confidential documents and information, and free of conflicts \n     of interest.\n       ``(2) Standards.--In adopting the methods of accreditation, \n     the Secretary shall ensure that the entities and \n     individuals--\n       ``(A) are subject to--\n       ``(i) the conflict of interest standards applicable to \n     employees of the Food and Drug Administration under subpart \n     E, H, and I of part 73 of title 45, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as in effect on January 1, 1996); or\n       ``(ii) if the standards described in clause (i) would be \n     inappropriate for the entities and individuals, conflict of \n     interest standards developed by the Secretary that are--\n       ``(I) based on the standards described in clause (i); and\n       ``(II) modified, as appropriate, to apply to the entities \n     and individuals; and\n       ``(B) are not subject to the conflict of interest standards \n     under subpart J of such part.\n       ``(3) Publication.--The Secretary shall publish the methods \n     of accreditation in the Federal Register on the adoption of \n     the methods.''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Before proceeding, I ask unanimous consent Senators \nFeingold and Johnson be added as cosponsors of amendment 1140.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the bill before the Senate is one of the \nmost important we will consider during the course of this Congress. I \ndon't believe that is an overstatement. This bill addresses the future \nof the Food and Drug Administration, an agency which we literally \nentrust with the safety and efficacy of thousands of drugs and \nprescriptions which we keep in our home and give to members of our \nfamily.\n  This agency has to be above reproach, it has to be efficient and \nresponsible. This amendment No. 1140 that I am offering is an attempt \nto make certain that the integrity of the Food and Drug Administration \nis not compromised by this bill. I think overall this is a good bill. \nThere are some areas Senator Kennedy and I and others feel need to be \naddressed. But the one part of this bill that I address with this \namendment is one of great concern.\n  We are now going to say that we will take outside of this Federal \nagency, outside of the Food and Drug Administration, the review of \nmedical devices. We will say to third parties, which are hired for the \npurpose of making these reviews, that they will decide whether or not a \nmedical device is safe for the American people and whether it's \neffective; and having made that decision,\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\nthat company will then have an opportunity to sell that device across \nAmerica. We as consumers will believe, as we should, that we can trust \nthat judgment.\n  The purpose of amendment No. 1140 is to address the question of \nwhether or not the third-party reviewers are credible. This bill \ndramatically expands the ability of medical device companies to \npurchase their own third-party reviewers. Senators Feingold and Johnson \nand I are offering this amendment so that it's clear that it's only \nreviews and not approvals themselves that can be bought under this \nsystem.\n  Up to 60 percent of medical devices going through the premarket \nnotification process could utilize the outside reviewing system. A \nprogram of this magnitude will not permit the same level of close \nmonitoring and oversight by the FDA as is currently undertaken. There \nare fewer than 10 firms that are credited for this purpose. That is why \nexplicit anti-conflict-of-interest standards need to be laid out in the \nlaw. We should not cut corners when it comes to the question of \nconflict of interest. If we are going to give to these companies the \nauthority to review and approve medical devices to be used across \nAmerica, let us have no question that they are doing it in a \nprofessional way.\n  The Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan, nonprofit \nGovernment watchdog group, described the bill's provisions in this area \nas grossly inadequate, and the Government Accountability Project, which \nis another watchdog group, described the current FDA regulations for \ntheir pilot program as ``inadequate to guard against conflict of \ninterest.'' Both groups, along with a long list of consumer and patient \ngroups, urge the Senate to adopt this Durbin amendment.\n  Given the importance to the public of keeping the approval process \nuntainted by monetary influence, we must ensure that there are strict \nanti-conflict-of-interest standards for product reviews.\n  Only the vaguest language possible on the issue of preventing \nconflicts of interest is currently contained within the bill. Let me \ntell you what it says on page 16:\n\n       The Secretary shall adopt methods of accreditation that \n     ensure that entities or individuals who conduct reviews and \n     make recommendations under this section are qualified, \n     properly trained, knowledgeable about handling confidential \n     documents and information and free of conflicts of interest.\n\n  Nowhere does the bill mention what we mean by ``free of conflicts of \ninterest.'' What are the standards that we will use? No reference point \nis given for a basic minimum that would satisfy and ensure unbiased \nreview.\n  Senator Harkin was successful in adding language that allows the FDA \nto look at contractual arrangements between an outside reviewing \nlaboratory or entity and the company whose product is being reviewed. \nWe would like to go a step further and add more protections against \napproval peddling.\n  FDA employees themselves are subject to a wide range of anti-\nconflict-of-interest regulations. This amendment seeks to establish \nbasic requirements, and it is very simple. It merely asks that outside \nreviewers not be allowed to have a financial interest in the company \nthey review.\n  Think about what I just said. The outside reviewer, which will decide \nwhether a medical device should go on the market, should not have a \nfinancial interest in the company that he is reviewing. That seems \nrather simple to me. Nor should they be allowed to receive gifts from a \ncompany that has products being reviewed, and they should not be \nactively looking for a job with that company while they are in the \nprocess of making their review. No gifts, no job offers, no stocks. It \nseems simple.\n\n  It is amazing to me that we are arguing over this provision. I would \nhave thought this would have been accepted long ago by the majority. \nBut instead, there is a fight as to whether or not we are going to \ndemand the highest level of integrity and honesty when it comes to \nthese third-party reviewers.\n  Let me tell you why this is critically important. The approval by the \nFDA of a device can have a dramatic positive or negative economic \nimpact on a company. If the FDA rejects a device and doesn't approve \nit, a stock can languish for months, if not years. If the FDA approval \ngoes through, it is the seal of approval, and that company knows that \nthere is money to be made.\n  Look at this chart indicating what happened in four different \ninstances with medical device companies when there was an FDA approval. \nQLT Phototherapeutics, Inc. Look at how the stock shot right up with \nFDA approval. ATL Ultrasound. After FDA approval, it skyrockets. \nThoratec Laboratories Corp., the same story; the stock is moving along \nslowly, and then, after FDA approval, it climbs dramatically, 50 or 60 \npercent in 1 day. It was the same thing with Integra LifeSciences Corp.\n  What we are trying to say is, the people making the decision on \nbehalf of us, as consumers, should make that decision without any \nconcern about the bottom line of that company. Would you think twice \nabout giving to a reviewer the decision to approve a product if you \nknew that reviewer owned a thousand shares of the company that made the \nproduct? I think most of us would. What if that reviewer and his family \nhad just come back from a Caribbean vacation, paid for by the company \nthat submits the medical device for approval, or if that reviewer \nhappens to have sent his resume to that company a week before, saying, \n``I would like to have a job with you and, incidentally, I am working \non your FDA approval,'' with a wink and a nod? That doesn't make me \nfeel any better about what we are dealing with here.\n  The Durbin amendment basically says, let's get rid of the doubt as to \nwhether or not people are going to use the highest professional \nstandards. We should not cut corners here when it comes to conflicts of \ninterest, when it comes to these outside laboratories. We have to \ndemand the highest standards of professionalism.\n  Time and again, companies have been shown to make dramatic profits \nwith FDA approval. Dr. Kessler, a former head of the FDA, said, ``Make \nno mistake, they talk a lot about approvals in Europe and in other \ncountries. They can be lucrative, they can be profitable. But if you \ncan get the approval of the Food and Drug Administration of the United \nStates of America, it is a seal of approval recognized worldwide. The \nproduct you are trying to sell becomes a winner overnight.'' Shouldn't \nthe people making the decision as to whether or not this product is \nsafe and efficacious be doing it on the basis of science, rather than \non the question of their own financial interest?\n  The medical device industry produces over $50 billion annually in \nsales. In fact, in a recent article in Medical Economics entitled ``Why \nMedical Stocks Belong in Your Portfolio,'' the medical device industry \nwas described as ``a hot market that's only getting hotter.'' It \ndoesn't take much imagination to see why we would not want to allow a \nreviewer to have stocks in the company they were reviewing. The \nconnection between FDA approval and stock gain is just too clear. The \nmoney stakes are high for investors; however, the stakes are even \nhigher for the patients who rely on these devices.\n  The approval of an unsafe drug or device can have a devastating \nimpact. Doctors, hospitals, nurses, and families rely on these \ndecisions. If a corner is cut, if this reviewer has a financial \ninterest and decides, well, I am just going to tip it a little bit \ntoward my own stock portfolio here, the losers ultimately are the \ninnocent people. Reviews must be of the most stringent nature and must \nbe carried out without any outside corrupting influence.\n\n  Surely, it is not too much to ask that a reviewer be prevented from \naccepting a gift or a loan from a company that he or she is reviewing. \nI can't imagine we are debating this. Should we allow the reviewer to \ntake a gift from the company he is reviewing? That is an obvious \nconflict of interest and one that we can address explicitly. The \nlanguage in the bill, unfortunately, is loaded with ``weasel'' words--\nweasel words about what a conflict of interest might be. We should make \nit crystal clear. It would give this bill more stature. It is an \nimportant bill and it should have that.\n  Furthermore, a reviewer or their spouse or minor child should not be \nallowed to have a financial interest in the company being reviewed. \nThat means owning stock or a mutual fund that has more than 10 percent \ninvested in the company. This is all laid out in subpart H of the \nregulations that we refer to in our amendment. A final restriction that \nwe are asking for is that\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\nthe reviewer may not be actively soliciting future employment within \nthe company they are reviewing.\n  Our amendment, which sets out guidelines to prevent tainted reviews, \nallows the Secretary to modify such guidelines where it would be \nappropriate for outside reviewers.\n  Therefore, if any provision included in these regulations would \nclearly not apply or not be appropriate, the Secretary can modify it. \nWe have that flexibility built into our amendment.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues argue for more flexibility. I \nbelieve our amendment gives enough. It sets out specific standards. I \nchallenge any of my colleagues to suggest that a gift ban or a \nfinancial interest ban would be unreasonable. It would be a sad day in \nAmerica if reviewers expect a gift, or a job offer, or some other \nfinancial gain in order to review a medical device and, worse, that we \nwere not willing to categorically repudiate a potential for such \n``approval peddling.''\n  This industry and their products are too important to the American \npeople. These are literally life-and-death products. We should take a \nfirm stand and specifically enumerate these basic standards within this \nlegislation to prevent even the potential for the corruption of this \nprocess.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time on this amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, first, let me very briefly review \nwhere we are. There has been considerable debate up to this point. I \nthink it is important for me as the chairman of the committee to remind \npeople as to where we are.\n  We have before us a 152-page bill, which is the first real overhaul \nof the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the last 30 years. We \nhave taken little tweaks here and there, but it has not been thoroughly \nreviewed and brought into the modern world.\n  Out of that 152 pages, we are now spending most of the time debating \non 2 or 3 pages. That is why the minority ranking member has praised \nthe bill, but then picked on one--basically, we are here because of one \nprovision, which is 404. On some standards, we cannot agree on the \nprecise wording.\n  So everybody agrees on almost all of this bill. The amendment that is \nbeing offered by the Senator from Illinois does get into a very, very \nimportant area, and we do not disagree with that. We praise him for \nhaving given us the opportunity to review, to restudy, and determine as \nto whether or not the provision he is striking with his amendment and \nreplacing is necessary or appropriate. We have concluded--I say ``we'' \nbecause I am sure that Senator Kennedy joins me in this statement--that \nwe adequately take care of the conflict of interest in this bill.\n  Let me go through what his amendment attempts to do and what the bill \nprovides. First of all, the Senator's amendment, at best, duplicates \nthe third-party provision that we have in the bill now and, at worst, \nit unnecessarily constrains the agency.\n  Section 204, conflict of interest protections, which is being \nstricken and replaced, provides a full statutory directive to the \nagency to prevent conflicts of interest that may be involved with both \nan individual reviewer and with the reviewing organization. As with \nSenator Durbin, this was a critical concern for members of the \ncommittee.\n  Section 204(b) reads:\n\n       Within 180 days after the date of enactment of this \n     section, the Secretary shall adopt methods of accreditation \n     that ensure that entities or individuals who conduct reviews \n     and make recommendations under this section are . . . free of \n     conflicts of interest.\n\n  Section 204 provides full discretion to the agency to develop \nappropriate standards. The agency will not be limited in any way in \ndeveloping these guidelines.\n  We believe the FDA is the one that can best understand what will be \neffective in this regard. The agency has already developed extensive \nconflict of interest guidelines as a part of its existing third-party \nprogram. The notice of April 3rd, 1996, has almost a full page of \nFederal Register type laying out the standards, including restrictions \nif ``the third party, or any of its personnel, involved in 510(k) \nreviews has any ownership, or other financial interest, in medical \ndevice, device manufacturer, or distributor.''\n  That is a quote from the wording.\n  The agency has not identified any difficulties in the implementation \nof the conflict of interest guidelines, and it has expressed no concern \nabout the conflict of interest provisions, as drafted. We have reviewed \nthe FDA standards that appeared in the Federal \nRegister on Wednesday, April 3, 1996, at page 14794, and believe that \nthey adequately and appropriately address the problems which we are \nreviewing here. The agency's strict guidelines resulted in the \nelimination of 30 of the 37 applicants that originally sought \naccreditation. That means, obviously, that the FDA policy is effective, \nand it has outlined and again recognized--as the Senator from Illinois \nis aware--that there are problems that must be protected against. And \nwe agree with him on that.\n  The Durbin amendment attempts to set standards but in fact may \nconstrain the agency. In fact, the standards cited are reportedly \noutdated and do not reflect recent revision. This may explain why in \nthe second part of the amendment Senator Durbin effectively gives the \nagency discretion to craft appropriate guidelines. Section 204 provides \na full statutory directive to the agency to prevent conflicts of \ninterest that may be involved with both an individual reviewer and the \nreviewing organization. Therefore, it appears to us that the amendment, \nalthough well-intended, may even make it more complicated than \nnecessary, and that we will end up perhaps with a less effective system \nthan is already contained in the bill.\n  Madam President, I ask, if we yield back time, what happens to that \ntime? May we be advised on that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time would just lapse. I believe the \nSenator from Illinois has yielded his time on this amendment. If the \nSenator from Vermont yields the remainder of his time, then the Senator \nfrom Illinois could call up his second amendment.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If at the end of the time we, for instance, end up \ninstead of using an hour on the Durbin amendment using half an hour, \ndoes that time fall into the same category as the last half-hour of \nthis unanimous consent? So we have an hour in that last part of the \nunanimous-consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is not clear about the Senator's \nquestion. We would proceed to the next amendment, and there would be 30 \nminutes equally divided on that amendment. Then we would stay on the \nbill, if that is the wish of the managers.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Madam President, I believe I understand the ruling of \nthe Chair. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regardless of the amount of time we use today, \non Tuesday we will have 5 hours on the bill itself equally divided.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate that clarification because this does get a \nlittle bit complicated as we move forward. This is an important issue.\n  I think at this time I will just again restate that we believe that \nthe bill as written adequately covers the problems of the conflict of \ninterest situation.\n  We commend the Senator from Illinois for really focusing attention on \nthis and bringing it to our attention again so that all of my \ncolleagues hopefully will understand that the bill--this is agreed to I \nbelieve also by Senator Kennedy--is effective in accomplishing the \ngoals of the Senator from Illinois.\n  So, again I commend him for what he has done.\n  Madam President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment has been yielded.\n\n\n Amendment No. 1139 to Modified Committee Substitute Amendment No. 1130\n\n  (Purpose: To eliminate provisions relating to the discretion of the \n Secretary of Health and Human Services to track devices or to conduct \n                  post-market surveillance of devices)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, under the unanimous-consent request, I \nwould like to call up my amendment 1139.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, and Mr. Johnson, proposes an amendment numbered 1139 \n     to the modified committee substitute amendment numbered 1130.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9708]]\n\n\n       On page 46, beginning on part 5, strike sections 605 and \n     606.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nHarkin be added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 1139.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the conflict of interest provision which \nwe have just discussed is a very important one, but the one which I am \naddressing with this amendment may be even more important.\n  Consider this possibility. On Monday of next week you go out to buy a \nPontiac. On Tuesday when you go to the doctor, he says, ``You are going \nto have to go to the hospital, and you are going to need a pacemaker.'' \nIn 1 week you have a Pontiac and a pacemaker. What is the difference? \nWhen you bought the Pontiac, General Motors took note of your name and \naddress. If anything went wrong with the Pontiac, they would contact \nyou in 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or even later, and say, ``Bring it \nin. It needs to be fixed.'' It might not be safe, if you didn't. \nHowever, under this bill the pacemaker that you are going to have \nimplanted by the surgeon perhaps a few days later doesn't have the same \nkind of following. Why? Because we let that exist.\n  Why would we let people have lifesaving devices implanted in their \nbodies and not keep track of that fact? That is what this amendment is \nall about, because this bill, as good as it is, takes away the \nmandatory requirement that we have surveillance and tracking of these \nhigh-risk devices that can be implanted in people.\n  I am glad to be joined by Senators Harkin and Senator Johnson in \noffering this amendment which strikes the sections of the bill that \nundermine many of the patient protections for medical devices put in \nplace by the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990.\n  This act of 1990 instituted a mandatory surveillance program to \nidentify quickly any potential problems with approved high-risk \ndevices. A mandatory tracking system to locate patients in the event a \nsafety recall was also added.\n  Sections 605 and 606 in this act are nothing more than a backdoor \nattempt to eliminate these programs that industry considers burdensome. \nYes, they are burdensome. To keep track of the name and address of each \nperson who is given a pacemaker is a big burden on industry. But what \nkind of burden is it on the patient when the pacemaker fails and the \npatient can't be found? I would suggest that it is a much greater \nburden. That is what this amendment addresses.\n  Proponents of sections 605 and 606 say that the FDA has not been \nvigilant with respect to overseeing these vital programs. Does anyone \nimagine they are going to be more vigilant in enforcing these safety \nprotections when they are relegated to an optional or discretionary \nstatus? Especially given CBO's high estimate of this bill's additional \ncosts to the FDA without any corresponding increase in funding. \nPressure can only increase on the agency to curtail its efforts in \ndiscretionary programs.\n  Opponents of this amendment will point to the fact that the \nadministration went along with this change. This point is in fact even \nmore worrisome when you look at what types of devices we are talking \nabout, and the tragedies that may occur.\n  Many of us remember the tragedies that resulted from the Bjork-Shiley \nheart valve failures. Extensive congressional hearings were held in the \nlate 1980's examining what had gone wrong and how we might prevent \nfuture repeats of these terrible tragedies.\n  Over 300 people died in the United States from these heart valve \nfailures, and over 1,000 worldwide.\n  After it was concluded that these heart valves were defective--after \nthey realized the product had failed--over 50 percent of the patients \nwith these heart valves couldn't be located.\n  One widow testified--and this is a tragic story--about how her \nhusband, who had a Bjork-Shiley heart valve implant, suffered chest \npains but had no idea that the heart valve was the cause of the \nproblem. She was in a position to choose from two hospitals. She \nquickly raced to one hospital, and made the wrong choice. She went to \nthe hospital that didn't specialize in heart surgery when her husband \nneeded to live. She didn't know. Why didn't she know? She wasn't on the \nlist. Her husband's name and address were not on the list to be \nnotified that the heart valve he carried in his body was failing him.\n\n  What does tracking actually involve? It involves a patient--this is I \ndon't think a burden from that perspective--filling out a registration \nform with their address so they can be located if there is a recall of \na pacemaker, or high-risk device. Most companies make this request \nalready.\n  What kind of devices are we talking about? Just about anything? No. \nThere are 17 specific types of devices that require mandatory tracking. \nWe are talking about heart valves; pacemakers and pacemaker leads; \nvascular stents; jaw, shoulder, and hip joint replacements; windpipe \nprosthesis; breathing monitors and ventilators.\n  It is hard to imagine the tracking of these high-risk devices could \never been made optional, and yet that is exactly what this bill does.\n  FDA has already complained that they find it extremely difficult to \nenforce this provision, and yet, instead of making it stronger and \nhelping them with enforcement, this bill weakens it. It weakens the \nFDA's ability to make this kind of adequate tracking and surveillance \navailable.\n  Automobile manufacturers are required to have a tracking system to \nnotify those who buy cars. It even happens with motorcycles. Look at \nthis. What a coincidence. In the Phoenix Gazette of Friday, January 11, \n1991, there are two articles next to one another. Harley-Davison \nrecalls its motorcycles. We have a problem here. It turns out that \ntheir brake calipers are defective and could cause their front wheels \nto lock while driving.\n  Right next to it, on Consumer Watch, jaw implants. It is found that \nthe implants of Vitek of Houston caused bone degeneration. If we cannot \ntrack the people who bought the jaw implants through their surgeon, we \ncan certainly find the owners of the Harley-Davidsons. Does that make \nsense?\n  I would like to submit for the Record a letter that I received from \nVictims Against Lethal Valves, a support group out of Pittsburgh for \nthose who have suffered from defective heart valves. They urge the \nSenate to adopt my amendment. If you read this letter from the families \nof those who were caught unaware that they had a defective heart valve, \nyou might think twice. I hope my colleagues will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                Victims Against Lethal Valves,\n\n                               Pittsburgh, PA, September 16, 1997.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As a Bjork-Shiley heart valve survivor and \n     founder of VALV, a support group for people with the Bjork-\n     Shiley heart valve, I strongly urge you to support Senator \n     Durbin's amendment to S. 830 to maintain mandatory tracking \n     and postmarket surveillance of high risk medical devices like \n     heart valves.\n       The Bjork-Shiley heart valve experience was a major impetus \n     to enacting these two provisions in 1990. Almost 1,000 people \n     (world-wide, the device was marketed longer in Europe than in \n     the U.S.) have died as a result of the fracture of the Bjork-\n     Shiley valve. S. 830 makes tracking and postmarket \n     surveillance of these very high risk devices discretionary \n     rather than mandatory.\n       The Bjork-Shiley disaster highlighted the need to implement \n     a systematic method for tracking the device recipients. When \n     the FDA finally ``caught up'' with the significant numbers of \n     Bjork-Shiley heart valve fractures and ordered the company to \n     notify recipients of the valve's potential failure, what \n     symptoms to look for, and what to do if these symptoms \n     appeared, the manufacturer claimed that they had no record of \n     how to find as many as half of the recipients. Should a \n     defect in a device be identified, it is critical that device \n     recipients be notified so they can seek medical attention.\n       The manufacturer knew that the Bjork-Shiley heart valve had \n     a tendency to fracture very soon after it went on the market. \n     But the firm conducted no systematic surveillance, and did \n     not accurately report the information about problems it \n     received to the FDA. Section 522 was designed to remedy this \n     gap in reliable, verifiable information--so that the \n     manufacturer would know, and the FDA could check--on problems \n     with new post-1991 devices.\n       Most Market surveillance and tracking are consumer \n     safeguards that were won with the lives of people like me and \n     the members of\n\n[[Page S9709]]\n\n     VALV. We urge you to adopt Senator Durbin's amendment and \n     keep these consumer protections in place.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Elaine Levenson,\n                                                          Founder.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, another key aspect of the Safe Medical \nDevice Act, which this bill undermines, is the mandatory surveillance \nprogram for high-risk medical devices.\n  These surveillance programs are extremely important for early \ndetection.\n  In some cases, the initial breakage of a device may not cause \ninstantaneous harm. For example, in the case of the Telectronics Heart \nPacemaker ``J'' Leads which are found to be defective in 12 percent of \nthe patients with them, breakage didn't result in any harm until the \nnext bout of heart arythmia. Surveillance of these leads identified \nproblems in some patients. And this led to the notification of patients \nwith these leads of the need to have them checked.\n  Likewise, in the case of the Bjork-Shiley heart valves, 300 Americans \ndied when this tiny heart valve no bigger than a pen turned out to have \na structural defect.\n  This is a blowup of a photograph of a heart valve. And it shows a \ncrack in one of these struts on this heart valve. This crack alone \nwouldn't be lethal. But when the strut next to it cracks, it is too \nlate. You are going to die unless you have immediate surgical relief.\n  We believe that once you know that the heart valve is in danger, you \nshould know the people who have received it so that you can notify them \nso that they can go to a doctor and have the necessary test to see if \nthey are in danger.\n  Early detection and correction could have prevented many of the 300 \ndeaths that occurred when this Bjork-Shiley valve failed.\n  Let me tell you about another case, teflon jaw implants. People with \nthe temporal mandibular problems--TMJ--have turned to these implants as \na way of dealing with a maddening situation, and a very painful one.\n  In the case of the implants made by Vitek in the 1980's, early \ndetection unfortunately wouldn't help. These implants splintered and \ncaused massive corrosion of jaws and skull due to the triggering of \ninflammation and other immune responses. By the time the patients \nsuffered pain, for many of them it was too late. Many of the patients \nrequired the removal of much of their jawbone structure because this \nimplant had failed. Even some of their skulls were exposing their brain \nbecause of this subsequent surgery.\n  If a surveillance program had been in place prior to the Vitek jaw \nimplant defect, many of the patients would have been able to have their \nimplants removed prior to the full deterioration of their jaws. In \nfact, many individuals would have been saved altogether from ever \nhaving the implants inserted in the first place.\n  Vitek jaw implants were first marketed in 1983, but it wasn't until \n1990 that FDA sent out a safety alert, and in 1991 issued a recall.\n  Think about that, 7 or 8 years later we finally realized that there \nwas a problem with this implant.\n  At that stage, between 25,000 and 26,000 patients had received these \nimplants. The rate of failure was nearly 100 percent.\n  Here on these charts you see some of the sad stories of the victims. \nThese are troublesome to see, but think about these poor people and \nwhat they went through. Asking these companies to keep track of the \npeople who received these implants is not unreasonable when you take \nthis lovely young lady in this picture and look how she deteriorated \nafter these implants started to fail. And the same thing, this lovely \nlady in this picture and what happened to her face as a result of the \nimplant failure. On this one, look at this. After the implant failed, \nlook what happened. It actually emerged from the skin.\n  Is this something that we want to think twice about? I would think \nthat as a matter of just decency we should include in this bill \ntracking and surveillance to try to avoid this from happening to \nanybody in the future.\n  Some may try to argue we still have the medical device reporting \nsystem. That is no substitute for company surveillance. The medical \ndevice reporting system is basically a body count program. We hope that \nwe could have a strong program to detect problems before death and \ninjury. That is exactly what a surveillance program does. Many medical \ndevices on the market are approved on the basis of data from trials of \nshorter than the lifespan of the device. Vascular stint, approved by \nthe FDA this year, was approved on data after 6 months of use. FDA \nrequires surveillance to check if the device will be safe for a longer \nperiod similar to the life expectancy of the device.\n  I would like to also bring to the attention of my colleagues a recent \nGAO report on the inadequacies of the medical device reporting system \nbefore anyone starts arguing that it is a substitute for surveillance \nprograms. This report from the GAO states that between March 1994 and \nApril 1995, a backlog of about 48,000 malfunction reports from \nmanufacturers accumulated at the FDA. Many of the malfunction reports, \naccording to GAO, were not entered into the adverse event reporting \nsystem until 1996--almost 2 years in some instances. In fact, the House \ndevice bill suggests eliminating even this report because of its \ninefficiencies.\n  In contrast to that system, the tracking and surveillance programs \nwhich I am pushing for are much more effective. This January a good \nexample of this was seen in the case of a runaway pacing implantable \ncardioverter defibrillator manufactured by Ventritex. Due to their \nsurveillance programs, Ventritex realized the clock in the \ndefibrillator was running radically.\n  For those who are not familiar, it is a situation where a person has \na heart problem where the heart beats irregularly. The defibrillator \nfeeds a shock to the heart to stop the defibrillation and save the \nperson's life. The company realized it was not working right. That kind \nof problem could be fatal for individuals with these defective devices \nimplanted. On January 15, the company met with FDA and proposed a \ntemporary fix that could set these devices straight. Within less than a \nmonth, over 97 percent of the 5,600 patients were found and their \ndevices were reprogrammed. Thousands of lives may have been saved by \nthis effective tracking and surveillance.\n  Shouldn't this be the case for every lifesaving device? Why does this \nbill water it down? Why does this bill take away the tracking and \nsurveillance that would give us the necessary information to track this \nvery sort of thing to save people's lives.\n  In the pretracking days, before we started doing this, I have a \nletter from a lady named Charlotte Evans. She only discovered this year \nthat her teflon jaw implant might be defective even though the product \nhas been off the market for over 7 years, but no tracking program had \nbeen in effect when she bought it. For 11 years since she had this \ndevice implanted, her jaw had been undergoing deterioration due to this \ndefect, but she had no notice of any problems with the device.\n  I think the final chart says it all. Mandatory surveillance leads to \nearly detection of problems, which results in fewer deaths and less \nserious injuries. Mandatory tracking gives us effective recall and \nsaves lives. To rely only on the medical device reporting system is to \ntreat American people as though they were lab rats while we wait for \nthe body and injury count to mount.\n  Let me tell you who supports my amendment: Victims Against Lethal \nValves, the TMJ Association, the National Breast Implant Task Force, \nNORD, AARP, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, Bazelon \nCenter for Mental Health Law, the American College of Nurse-Midwives, \nAMFAR, the AIDS Action Council, DES Action, Center for Medical \nConsumers, Committee for Children, Human Rights Campaign, National \nWomen's Health Network, Public Citizen, and the Treatment Action Group.\n  I hope that it will also be supported by a majority of my colleagues. \nIf any of us believed for a moment that someone we love, a member of \nour family, was about to undergo a surgery and have a device implanted \nin their body and then be lost so that if something is found wrong with \nthat device later on and their lives are in danger, we would think \ntwice about this provision in the bill.\n  Let us keep tracking and surveillance in the bill. The medical device \nmanufacturers must accept the burden\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\nof keeping track of the people who receive these devices. If something \ngoes wrong, it is literally our only way to avoid injury and save \nlives.\n  Mr. President, at this point I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The time of the Senator from \nIllinois has expired. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I again commend the Senator from \nIllinois for focusing on some of the most critical problems that we \nhave with respect to devices. However, I would only point out that the \nbill as is at this time is subject to a bipartisan agreement with full \nconcurrence of FDA.\n  At this time I ask unanimous consent that Senator Collins be \nrecognized for up to 10 minutes as if in morning business and that upon \ncompletion of her remarks the Senate return to the consideration of S. \n830 and the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Maine is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished manager of the \nbill for yielding to me.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 1199 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I now return to the Durbin amendment.\n  Section 605, is also the subject of bipartisan agreement, with FDA's \nconcurrence. By way of brief explanation, device tracking is intended \nto facilitate a product recall.\n  Current law requires tracking for certain product types and also \ngives FDA discretion to require tracking for other products. It simply \nis not necessary for every device in the mandatory category to be \nsubject to the tracking requirement. This provision allows FDA to \naffirmatively indicate which products in the mandatory category should \nbe subject to tracking.\n  FDA may use its discretion to add new products to the list of \nproducts which must be tracked or put a product back on the list for \ntracking if evidence indicates the need.\n  This provision is needed because today, FDA will often indicate to a \nmanufacturer that a product need not be tracked, even if it is in the \nmandatory category. While this many be good policy in the specific \ncase, it puts both the FDA and the manufacturer in an undesirable legal \nsituation. This provision allows FDA to exercise proper discretion and \nremoves any potential cloud of legal liability which exists today.\n  It is inconceivable that FDA would not require tracking in the tragic \ncases identified by the Senator. The provision in the bill is logical, \nsafe, and necessary. Further, the GAO report cited by the Senator \nrefers to areas of FDA control totally unrelated to device tracking and \nsurveillance.\n\n\n                  Section 606: Postmarket Surveillance\n\n  Some have asked why we have made the FDA's postmarket surveillance \nauthority discretionary. I am pleased to address that question and I \nthink my colleagues will understand the good reasons for doing so. \nFirst, let me clearly state the FDA is in full concurrence with the \nappropriateness of this policy. I should add that FDA has actually \nrequired relatively few products to conduct postmarket surveillance. It \nis important to differentiate between this authority and the medical \ndevice reporting [MDR] and user reporting programs which are unaffected \nby this provision. The Medical Device Reporter Program is the keystone \nto the postapproval system for identifying hazardous or defective \nmedical devices on the market place. The MDR Program, coupled with \nFDA's authority to force product recalls and the device tracking \nprovisions are a strong web of protection for the consumer. User \nreports, submitted to FDA and manufacturers by hospitals and \nphysicians, are an additional layer of information on the status of \nmedical devices in the healthcare system.\n  Postmarket surveillance has a different purpose--to gather additional \ndata to provide the extra assurance in the relatively rare situation \nwhere FDA has approved a product, yet still believes that the product \nshould be subject to a limited period of postmarket evaluation. This is \nbecause for certain types of devices, problems may arise years after \napproval--problems which may not be detected in even the most elaborate \nclinical trial but could be dangerous to the individual, or even life \nthreatening.\n  It is instructive to consider the history of this authority. The Safe \nMedical Devices Act of 1990 included a provision requiring a \nmanufacturer to conduct postmarket surveillance for any device first \nmarketed after January 1, 1991, that is a permanent implant the failure \nof which may cause serious adverse health consequences or death, is \nintended for use in supporting or sustaining human life, or potentially \npresents a serious risk to human health.\n  In other words, if you have something which can prevent death or \nserious injury, you certainly want to try it and use it, but you want \nto keep track of it to make sure if it proves to be the reverse in \ncertain situations, that you at least know that and then can take \nappropriate action.\n  In addition to this mandatory surveillance, FDA was authorized to \nrequire postmarket surveillance for any device when the agency \ndetermined that surveillance is necessary to protect the public health \nor to provide safety or effectiveness data. All manufacturers subject \nto mandatory postmarket surveillance were required to submit protocols \nfor FDA approval within 30 days of first marketing the device. The FDA \nwas required to determine the adequacy of the principal investigator \nand the protocol and to approve the protocol after review by an \nappropriately qualified advisory committee.\n  In practice, the provision for mandatory surveillance, like the one \nfor mandatory tracking, is so broadly worded that it is causing a good \ndeal of uncertainty about those devices which are subject to this \nrequirement. In some cases, companies and the FDA are technically \nexposed to unfair liability when the FDA does not require surveillance \nfor products where it is, in fact, not necessary. We simply give FDA \nthe discretion to require postmarket surveillance on any product it \ndeems appropriate. This provision in no way suggests that FDA should \ncease to require surveillance for the types of devices it is currently \ncovering under the existing authority. Indeed, we expect that FDA will \nby and large continue to require surveillance for most if not all of \nthe products currently covered in the mandatory category. The committee \nand FDA believe this will be an appropriate way to bring clarity and \nefficiency to this important agency function. Indeed, FDA Director of \nSurveillance, Larry Kessler, recently said that he hoped Congress would \njoin FDA in moving toward doing more discretionary and less required \npostmarket surveillance. They want to ensure that they can use their \ntime as is most appropriate and most effective and efficient for their \nwork, and not be required to do things which their judgment has found \nnot necessary to take their time.\n\n  So, for that reason I must oppose this, and as I pointed out, Senator \nKennedy, as well as the FDA, would concur in opposition to this \namendment.\n  I think now I will take some of the time to go back and discuss the \n404 situation here, why we are here. Senator Kennedy has taken \nextensive time last night and today. Certainly this is an important \nissue. It is an extremely important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes.\n\n\n            Section 404: Labeling claims for medical devices\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, with the medical device amendments of \n1976, Congress intended that device classification and approval \ndecisions be made based on the intended use of devices as described in \nlabeling. In the 20th century, major strides in medical technology have \nrevolutionized the practice of medicine. Thanks to achievements in such \nfields as fiber optics, imaging, biomaterials, electronics, and \nbiotechnology, today's medical technology is faster, more efficient and \nmore productive than ever. These achievements have provided benefits to \nindividual patients and to society at large--benefits such as better \nhealth, more cost-effective medical treatments and the return of \npatients\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\nto productive lives more quickly. Today more than ever, medical \ntechnology is advancing at an astounding rate. Around the world, \nmedical providers and device innovators are working together to bring \nbetter, more cost effective therapies to patients.\n  That is what we are involved with here. So we want to keep in mind, \nand this is why we sometimes have an interesting dilemma, where you \nhave something which the patients' groups are plotting and which the \nconsumer groups sometimes take an opposite position on, based upon \ntheir fears that this process may lead to something getting on the \nmarket which might cause a problem and they do not have the confidence \nthat is built into the oversight part. I urge people to understand, the \ndevices we are talking about are important to health. If we delay, as \nhas been the case here, delay after delay after delay, unnecessarily \nso, then those who need it, those who are trying to improve their \nhealth, are denied it because some are so concerned that the delays \nwhich are deemed, really, unnecessary, lead to people having devices \ndenied them.\n  Over the years, FDA has made premarket regulatory decisions based on \nuses for devices that are unrelated to the intended uses set forth in \nlabeling. S. 830 includes two provisions that express the committee's \nspecific intention to limit FDA's review of premarket submissions to \nthe proposed labeling before the agency. Considerations like cost-\neffectiveness, relative effectiveness, or whether the product effects \nsome improvement in a patient's quality of life, are irrelevant to a \npremarket review unless such claims are included in proposed labeling. \nSimply put, the FDA should not exceed its jurisdictional \nresponsibilities by incorporating into the review process claims not \nbefore the agency for review consideration.\n  For premarket notification submissions, the labeling proposed in the \nsubmission will be controlling of a device's intended use. If the \nintended use is the same or sufficiently similar to the intended use of \na predicate device, then the device may be found to be substantially \nequivalent to the predicate. No considerations outside of the proposed \nlabeling for the 510(k) device should bear on the question of whether \nor not the proposed labeling of the newer device is compatible with the \nlabeling of the predicate device.\n  For premarket approval applications, the determination of whether or \nnot there is a reasonable assurance of device safety and effectiveness \nmust be based on claims in proposed labeling if such labeling is \nneither false nor misleading. The FDA may fairly consider all facts \nwhich are pertinent to proposed labeling in PMA's in determining \nwhether or not the labeling is false or misleading. Facts which are \npertinent to proposed labeling are those which directly relate to \nclaims in such labeling. For example, proposed labeling which states \nthat a device is for use in treating atherosclerosis cannot be false or \nmisleading because another device is more effective for that purpose. \nNor can the proposed labeling be false or misleading because another \ndevice provides the same treatment benefits but is less expensive to \npurchase and operate. However, the failure to state a material fact \nabout the device itself will make labeling in a pending PMA false or \nmisleading.\n  This provision, which has strong bipartisan support, provides a much \nneeded element of due process to product reviews. We preserve all of \nFDA's enforcement authority and leave the agency wide discretion in \nmaking judgments about new products.\n  What is at stake here? The ability of FDA to hold up a manufacturer's \nproduct on the basis of how a product might be used in the future--even \nif the company does not seek authority to market a product for those \nfuture uses.\n  I think it will be helpful to delve a little deeper into the \ntechnical issues related to this amendment dealing with one part of \nsection 404--it is worth a brief explanation of how FDA clears for \nmarketing new products which are similar to older, legally marketed \nproducts, this is the 510(k) process. The agency considers whether the \nnew product is substantially equivalent to the older one. In this \nprocess, FDA asks two questions. First, does the new product have the \nsame intended use as the older product? Second, are there issues raised \nby technological differences in the new product compared to the older \none?\n  On the first question, FDA must not be allowed to second guess or \nimpute new intended uses that the manufacturer does not claim--\nessentially acting as judge and jury on that question. That is what our \nbill does. This is simply too subjective a question to allow FDA broad \nlatitude. This bill would not allow that. If the product before FDA \nclaims a legitimate intended use and the product can perform that \nintended use, this part of the test is met.\n  But what if the new product has technological features not present in \nthe older product which give rise to different safety and efficacy \nconcerns? Under the bill, and it would certainly be my intent, FDA \nshould and can demand data on those concerns or else not clear the \nproduct for marketing. That is what they do today, and that is what \nthey would do under the bill. Further, if FDA determines that a \nmanufacturer is promoting a product for a use that is not approved, all \nof its enforcement authority is available to correct that situation.\n  Section 404 simply establishes a proper balance in the product review \nprocess and focuses FDA's authority on the more objective ground of \ntechnological considerations.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to add my strong support for S. 830, \nwhich will reauthorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act as well as \nprovide much-needed reforms to the FDA, and the approval process for \nprescription drugs and medical devices.\n  I want to specifically address one area of FDA reform which has \nbecome one of the most controversial, and most often misunderstood, \nprovision of this legislation. I'm referring to the issue of off-label \ninformation dissemination.\n  This is an issue I've worked on for more than 2 years. Joining me in \nthis effort have been Senators Frist, Dodd, Wyden, and Boxer. We come \nfrom different political parties. We have different political \nphilosophies. But, there is one principle upon which we strongly agree.\n  Physicians, and other health care professionals, should have the \nability to receive credible scientific information from reputable \nmedical journals and medical textbooks in order to make informed \ntreatment decisions with their patients.\n  However, because of an FDA policy--not a law, not a regulation, but a \npolicy--that is not happening today.\n  Let me explain.\n  When the FDA approves a prescription drug or medical device, it does \nso for specific uses. Frequently, scientists find the FDA-approved \nprescription drug or medical device is also effective for other uses. \nDoctors are legally able to prescribe drugs or use devices for these \nnew uses, which are called off-label uses.\n  According to the American Medical Association, between 40 and 60 \npercent of all prescriptions written are for off-label uses. For cancer \npatients, up to 80 percent of prescriptions are for off-label uses. For \nexample, the prescription drug Intron A has been approved by the FDA \nfor the treatment of melanoma, hepatitis B, and other diseases. \nAdditional studies, which were published in such prestigious \npublications as the New England Journal of Medicine and the Journal of \nClinical Oncology, have shown the drug is also effective for such \ndiseases as kidney cancer, myeloma--cancer of bone marrow--and bladder \ncancer.\n  However, since 1991, the FDA has maintained a policy which prohibits \nmanufacturers from giving doctors and other health care professionals \nscientific data about new uses of FDA-approved drugs and medical \ndevices.\n  That's simply bad public health policy--and the bipartisan agreement \nwe have reached will correct this intolerable situation.\n  The agreement will permit the dissemination to health care \nprofessionals of balanced, peer-reviewed articles from reputable \nmedical journals and medical textbooks about new uses of FDA-approved \nprescription drugs and medical devices.\n  It will also ensure that the important research on these important \nnew uses of prescription drugs and medical devices moves forward.\n  We ensure that only the highest quality of information can be \ndisseminated\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\nby defining the specific criteria for medical journals and medical \ntextbooks. It is important to note this legislation does not permit the \ndissemination of marketing materials, brochures, promotional materials, \nnewspaper or magazine articles, or other industry-generated materials.\n  Our legislation ensures that a balance of material about the use must \nbe disseminated. Sixty days prior to dissemination, manufacturers must \nsubmit the article it desires to disseminate to FDA along with a \nbibliography of other medical journal articles about that off-label \nuse. The Secretary has the option of adding an objective statement \nwhich describes additional scientific findings about that off-label use \nof the prescription drug or medical device.\n  The intent is that the statement be limited to objective and \nscientific information, and not present an opportunity to editorialize \nabout independently derived scientific information. That statement, \nalong with the required bibliography, must accompany the article or \ntextbook. In addition, companies must also submit and disseminate a \ndetailed statement which discloses that the article being disseminated \ndescribes a scientific study about an off-label use; any potential \nconflict of interest of the authors of the article; the source of \nfunding for both the study and the dissemination of the article; and a \nstatement which discloses if other products or treatments have been \napproved by the FDA for the use described in the article.\n  In other words, in addition to the article the company wants to \nshare, the doctor will also receive: the disclosure statement; a \nstatement of additional scientific findings from the Secretary of HHS; \nany previous FDA notices about that off-label use; a bibliography of \nother articles about that off-label use; and a copy of the FDA-approved \nlabeling for the drug or device described in the article.\n  In order to disseminate the medical journal articles and textbooks, \nmanufacturers must agree to conduct the required clinical trials in \norder to apply for a supplemental new drug application.\n  Companies must either certify they will file an SNDA within 6 months, \nor they must submit a clinical trial protocol and time schedule for \nconducting the needed studies to apply for an SNDA within 3 years. The \nSecretary of HHS may grant a 2-year extension to comply with this \nrequirement if the company is acting in due diligence to conduct the \nstudies in a timely manner. Periodic progress reports are required to \nbe filed with the Secretary. Companies may apply for an exemption under \nvery limited circumstances.\n  The manufacturer is also required to share with the Secretary new \ninformation about that same off-label use of the drug or device. If the \nSecretary determines the new information demonstrates that the drug or \ndevice may not be effective or may pose a significant risk to public \nhealth, then the Secretary shall, in consultation with the \nmanufacturer, take corrective action to ensure public health and \nsafety.\n  The provision provides the Secretary of HHS with strong oversight \nauthority, including the ability to stop dissemination of articles and \nthe ability to require manufacturers who violate the provisions of this \nlegislation to either take corrective action or return to compliance. \nThe Secretary can order a manufacturer to cease dissemination if the \nSNDA application is denied.\n  We also require that two future studies be performed. One study will \nexamine the impact this legislation has had on FDA resources. The other \nstudy will assess the quality of the information disseminated and it \nwill examine how useful the information has been to doctors and other \nhealth care providers.\n  It is important to note that this legislation will expire in 2006, \nunless Congress acts to continue it.\n  This legislation has earned the enthusiastic support of the American \nMedical Association. Let me quote from the AMA's Council on Scientific \nAffairs report:\n\n       It is imperative that physicians have access to accurate \n     and unbiased information about unlabeled uses of prescription \n     drugs. Dissemination of independently derived scientific \n     information about unlabeled uses by manufacturers to \n     physicians can help physicians have access to the latest, \n     scientifically credible information.\n\n  A Roper poll of oncologists released in July 1997 found that 70 \npercent of doctors believe FDA rules about off-label information stand \nin the way of doctors' efforts to get the most credible information \nabout cancer treatments. The poll also found that 99 percent found \npeer-reviewed medical journal articles is a source they use when making \nprescription decisions.\n  In addition, numerous patient organizations also support the \ndissemination of scientific information regarding off-label uses of \nprescription drugs and medical devices. These organizations include the \nAmerican Cancer Society, the Leukemia Society of America, the American \nOsteoporosis Foundation, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation, the A-T Children's Project, the American \nLiver Foundation, and the National Alzheimer's Association.\n  Mr. President, for the past 2 years, this bipartisan group of \nSenators--myself and Senators Frist, Dodd, Wyden, and Boxer--have \nworked together to craft legislation which will permit health care \nprofessionals to receive important scientific information while \nensuring consumer safeguards.\n  This bipartisan effort is based upon the belief that health care \nprofessionals should be able to receive scientific data while ensuring \npatient protections.\n  Most importantly--and this is key--from a patient's point of view, \nthis legislation will greatly increase one's odds of getting state-of-\nthe-art treatment which could cure a disease, slow the progression of a \ndisease, or, at minimum, improve one's quality of life.\n  It is simply wrong to continue this policy which denies the ability \nof a health care professional to receive an article from a medical \njournal or medical textbook.\n  Doctors, nurses, and other caregivers help patients make life or \ndeath decisions every day. They need access to credible scientific \ninformation to discuss with patients. We must take this commonsense \nstep to make sure they are able to receive accurate, unbiased \ninformation, including information about off-label uses, which will \nhelp them make informed treatment decisions with their patients.\n  I am very pleased to report this agreement has received the support \nof our colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, the ranking member of the Senate \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources. It also has the support of the \nSecretary of Health ad Human Services, Donna Shalala.\n  I would like to thank them, along with Richard Tarplin, Assistant \nSecretary of HHS, and Bill Schultz and Dianne Thompson of the FDA, for \ntheir cooperation in reaching this historic agreement on what has been \na very contentious issue.\n  Finally, I want to thank my colleagues who worked with me on this \nagreement, Senators Frist, Dodd, Wyden, and Boxer. It's been a pleasure \nto work with each of you, and I look forward to working with you on \nother public health issues in the future.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I understand the Senator from Georgia has time, and I \nask if he would yield me 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am sorry to have to report, we have been trying in \nthis last 45 minutes to see if we could move some amendments that \neverybody has agreed to and to show that we are really trying to bring \nthis bill before this body and to make progress so we can decrease the \namount of time that will be needed at the end as we move through the \ncloture process.\n  Unfortunately, we have not been able to get that agreement. So such \namendments as those of Senator Murray, Senator DeWine, and others, that \nwould have been approved by unanimous consent by will have to wait for\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\nsome future time in hopes that we can get agreement.\n  I want to point out there are a large number of amendments pending on \nthis bill, many of which are agreed to, others that probably will fall \nby the wayside, it should not be that difficult to finish work on this \nbill. However, if we continue to have this delay, without any \ncooperation to move the process forward, then it is going to foul up \nour very crowded calendar. That is unfortunate, as we all want to get \nthe legislation done, get the conference reports on appropriations \nbills passed, and other pending legislation which is essential, so that \nwe do not have to shut the Government down. If we fail to get the \ncooperation of the minority in even agreeing to things that everybody \nagrees to, it is unfortunate.\n  Let me point out some of the Senators we would have helped today: \nSenator DeWine, for instance, and Senator Dodd; their amendments should \nhave been agreed to. They have shown great leadership in advocating \ngreater research into pediatric uses of new and existing drugs. Their \namendment reflects Senator DeWine's successful effort to marry the \nmandated approach in the administration's regulations with the \nincentive-based approach underlying Senator DeWine and Senator Dodd's \nprovision. Senator Murray has worked diligently to protect the health \nand safety of children. Her amendment, which everybody agrees should be \napproved, modifies the national uniformity provision clarifying that \nthe exemption requirement is applicable to the health and safety of \nchildren.\n  Other amendments by other Members that we could have adopted today \nwill have to be done at some later time as long as the minority \ncontinues to block progress on the 152-page bill, of which 150 pages \nare agreed to. That does not make much sense. Why do we have this delay \nover a provision on which there is a disagreement, and general \nknowledge that the disagreement will have to be taken care of in the \nconference committee. The White House will insist that we come up with \nsomething different than is in the bill and the House has already taken \na different position. Why should we delay the meeting of that \nconference committee?\n  I urge the minority to let us vote--they are holding up an extremely \nimportant piece of legislation. The only advantage in doing this is to \nraise more public attention to one issue--that the minority is willing \nto tie up the Senate over one sentence in this bill in full knowledge \nthat further work will be done on the issue in conference.\n  So let's move this bill along, get it to conference. The House is \nmoving expeditiously, so we can go to conference probably at the end of \nnext week if we can get this bill done. I urge the minority to change \nthe tactics of delaying any progress on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9701-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9713-S9717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            EDUCATION REFORM\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, this Congress began its deliberations \nin a very interesting way. Our conference, our side of the aisle, met \nbefore the convening of the 105th Congress and concluded or defined 10 \nmajor issues they thought should be brought before the Nation.\n  The first issue, which resulted in the first piece of legislation for \nthis Senate, for this Congress, was education. It was unanimous \nagreement in the conference that our first expression in this Congress \non our side of the aisle would be about education and its importance. \nNot long after that the President of the United States announced that \neducation would become a centerpiece of his activities during this \nCongress, and he actually visited Georgia, he visited various locales \nacross the country, and he talked about, by and large, the requirement \nor need that people have some relief from the costs of higher \neducation.\n  It is interesting, and in a sense in a bipartisan way, we had key \nleaders in both parties focusing on this issue. It is certainly exactly \nwhat ought to have happened. I believe the genesis of American glory is \nthat we have been a free people. I have said more than once that an \nuneducated people cannot be free. An uneducated people cannot be free.\n  So as we, the custodians of this great democracy, prepare for a new \ncentury, we have to be asking ourselves the question over and over: Are \nwe preparing the generation that will lead that century with the tools \nthat they will need and require to be ready to do that job? \nUnfortunately, the news is not altogether comforting when you review \nthe data.\n  Despite the intense interest in the last tax relief proposal on costs \nof higher education, that higher education is not where America is in \ntrouble in its education. America is in trouble in its elementary and \nhigh school level.\n  I was reading just the other day a prominent survey of the condition \nin elementary schools. It is fairly alarming. It suggested that 4 out \nof 10 students in elementary school today are frightened by some aspect \nor fearful of violence in the school. Mr. President, the survey \nconcluded that 3 out of 10 students in elementary school will have \nproperty stolen from them in the schools. It suggested that 1 out of 10 \nwill be confronted with a deadly weapon while they are in school.\n  When you look at the condition of our reading proficiency, our basic \nskills--reading, writing, adding and subtracting--we are not comforted \nby the data which, of course, has led to this massive debate about \nskills that students have to achieve by the time they are in the fourth \ngrade, have to achieve by the time they are in the eighth grade, and \nhow are we going to certify that it has happened.\n  I have spent the better part of the last 2 years talking about the \nfact that we have a drug epidemic in the United States, particularly \namong our younger teenagers. We have seen statistics that show that \ndrug use has doubled in the last 36 to 40 months. These are \nschoolchildren, Mr. President. If you go to these schools--and I invite \nanybody to do it--the students are very savvy, they know exactly what \nis happening, and they know that there are drugs and violence \nsurrounding their environment in school.\n  So, 4 in 10 are fearful; 3 in 10 are going to be robbed; 1 in 10 is \ngoing to face a weapon; and all of them will tell you the nature of \ndrugs and the availability of drugs.\n  Three out of ten who come to college this September will have to take \nremedial training in reading. In other words, 30 percent-plus of the \nstudents that have gone through our elementary school system and our \nhigh school system are not ready for college and can't read well. So I \nguess the story is beginning to frame itself: We have a problem in K \nthrough high school. An American family ought to at least expect that \nwhen their child graduates from an American high school, they can do \nthe ABC's, they can read, they can write, and they can do their \narithmetic, and they are not behind. Society spends millions upon \nmillions of dollars retraining these students by the time they get to \ncollege.\n  Well, I think this data and these statistics, Mr. President, are the \nreason that when you poll Americans, the vast majority of them now put \neducation as the No. 1 issue. It is because they are reading the same \ndata that we are reading. And, of course, it is the reason that \nleadership in both parties have come forward of late and have suggested \nthat we need to make the Federal Government be the appropriate \npartner--the appropriate partner; not the governor, not the manager, \nbut a good partner--in helping our States and our local communities get \na handle on what is going wrong in public education at the elementary \nand high school level.\n  So, as a result, the first bill was introduced, S. 1, which contained \nthree major initiatives. First, there was tax relief making employer-\nprovided educational assistance tax free to help make up this \nshortfall, help these employers bring new educational opportunity to \ntheir employees. That is now law.\n  S. 1 allows State prepaid tuition plans to pay for both college \ntuition and room and board. That is now law.\n  S. 1, our first piece of legislation, made interest on student loans \ntax deductible. That is now law.\n  S. 1 provided education savings accounts for college. That is now \nlaw. That was a compromise and a coming together of the President's \nproposals and of our conference proposals.\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\n  S. 1 dealt with the Individuals With Disabilities Education Act and \nmade a commitment to full funding for the Individuals With Disabilities \nEducation Act because, while passed originally in the 1970's with a \npromise that about half of the cost would be borne by the Federal \nGovernment, it was never done. Congress had reauthorized the act \nearlier this year. It attempted to modify it, to make it more flexible, \nmore suitable for local school boards. And that is now law. Everything \nthat we wanted to achieve in S. 1 was not, but much was.\n  There were key provisions in S. 1 for school safety. I alluded to \nthis data just a moment ago--that you have 4 out of 10 that are \nfearful, 3 out of 10 that will be robbed, 1 out of 10 that confront a \ndeadly weapon, and all of the students will tell you of the problems \nwith drugs in and around their schools. This is not yet accomplished, \nthis key provision of S. 1, and we plan to come back and address these \nissues as we move through this 105th Congress. As an example, we \ncurrently offered an amendment to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill \nthat provides funding, Mr. President, for student hot lines to report \nacts of violence in school or for witness protection programs that \nwould allow students additional protections if they would ever become a \nvictim of a serious crime.\n  Now, Mr. President, in the course of the debate on tax relief, I \nintroduced an amendment, cosponsored by many, that tried to make the \ntax relief proposal reflect more concern about the problems that we are \nhaving in elementary school and high school. As I said, if there is a \ncriticism about the education components of the tax relief proposal, a \nconstructive criticism, it is that it all focuses on higher education. \nBut as I have just alluded to, Mr. President, the problem is not there. \nYes, the problem of costs are associated with it, but it is an \neffective system, the envy of the world. Our elementary schools are not \nthe envy of the world, and they are a source of great worry for us in \nthe United States.\n\n  So we introduced in the Senate, in the debate on tax relief, a \nproposal that would empower parents to deal with education \ndeficiencies, whatever they happen to be, for their children. We \ncreated and passed in the Senate, by a very powerful vote, 60 to 40, an \neducation savings account for students, grades kindergarten through \nhigh school. It allowed parents to save up to $2,000 per year per child \nin after-tax dollars, but the interest buildup would not be taxed if, \nat the time the account was used, it was used for an educational \npurpose for that child.\n  Mr. President, the savings account has a very unique feature to it. \nIt allows sponsors to contribute to the account. So the parents can \ncontribute to the account, obviously, but the grandparents could as \nwell, or an aunt, an uncle, a neighbor, a friend, an employer, an \norganization, an association--all of these could become partners to \nthat family to help produce an account that that family could use on \nbehalf of the child's education. Mr. President, this would result in \nbillions of dollars over the next decade coming to the assistance of \neducation where it really needs it--elementary and high school.\n  Mr. President, these new dollars, these billions of new dollars, I \ncall the smart dollars. They are the most intelligent dollar investment \nthat will occur in education. Why is that? Because they can be used for \nany education deficiency; whether the child needed a home computer or \nsome other new technology, or the child might need a tutor because of a \nmath deficiency, the child might need to be prepared for an SAT test, \nit might be necessary for an after-school program, or transportation, \nor uniforms, or whatever. But these dollars would be directed, like a \nbullet, right to whatever the problem was.\n  Now, vast public spending doesn't accomplish that. It sets up the \nbroad parameters, but it has a difficult time getting to that child's \nspecific deficiency. It may be medical, like dyslexia, or some other \nproblem. But who knows best about those deficiencies? The parents. This \narms those parents with an ability to go right to the problem, right on \ntarget.\n  So these billions of dollars would be the most intelligent invested \ndollars we could envision or imagine in education. Mr. President, these \neducation savings accounts have created an enormous outpouring of \nsupport. There is some opposition, and I am going to deal with that in \na minute. But the account could also be used for home schooling. The \naccount could also be used for tuition, if the parents had decided that \nthey needed to put that child in another learning environment, for \nwhatever reason.\n  Mr. President, last week, we held a press conference here in \nWashington on behalf of two proposals that are part of our side's \neducation initiatives. One was the proposal to provide funding for \nWashington, DC, public school scholarships, to allow students that are \ntrapped in the most difficult schools an opportunity to have the \nresources, up to $3,200 per student, to move to a school that was \neither safer or was producing a quality education.\n\n  The other proposal that the press conference gathered to support was \nthe education savings account that I have just described. It was one of \nthe most moving press conferences I have seen in Washington, Mr. \nPresident. The Presiding Officer and all of us have been to one press \nconference after another, and you can almost cite the routine. But this \none broke the routine. I knew the Speaker would be there, and the \nmajority leader from the House, and myself and Senator Coats from \nIndiana, a leading spokesman for education reform. We walked into the \nroom and were joined by Alveda Celeste King, a native of my home city; \nCongressman Flake of New York, an eloquent spokesperson who decided \nthat he will resign from Congress and return to his ministry; a young \nwoman named Starr Parker, who had written a book, ``From Welfare Mother \nto Work.'' It tells the story of her life, freeing herself from the \nentrapment of dependency, and the independence she has gained by moving \nto regular work; a great spokesperson and a single mother of four from \nCleveland, OH, giving an elongated story of her work to free her four \nchildren, who were in violent situations in public schools. They were \nin schools that were not teaching her children, and she told her story \nof freeing them from these schools and getting them to a new \nenvironment.\n  They were all there speaking on behalf of ideas like the education \nsavings account and how important it would have been to them to help \nthem deal with the particular problems that their children had faced \nand the entrapment that they were confronted with when no options were \nmade available to them. The education savings account would have been a \ntool that they could have used to free themselves of these environments \nand get their children into the proper school environment that they \nsought.\n  It reminded me, Mr. President.\n  I see that we have been joined by our good colleague from Alaska, and \nI am going to turn to him in just a moment.\n  But my sister was a single mother of four with two sets of twins. I \nremember my father and I meeting many, many years ago and deciding that \ntheir education was going to be a major issue. We didn't have a lot to \nspare in those days. We opened up a savings account, and he and I both \nstarted contributing every month a little bit, and then a little bit \nmore so there was a little nest egg available by the time these \nchildren were trying to deal with their college education.\n  If the education savings account had been in place, that nest egg \nwould have been twice the size it was when it was ready for use because \nthe interest would have built up, and it wouldn't have been taxed. We \ncould have used those assets to help further and even do more than was \ndone on behalf of their education. There is not a family in America--no \nmatter whether their child is in school--that this concept wouldn't be \napplicable to, and no one knows more what the peculiar or particular \ndeficiency is than the family.\n  So this is a powerful tool that will stand behind education wherever \nit is occurring--public schools or private schools or a home school or \nan employer environment.\n  Mr. President, I am going to turn to the Senator from Alaska, who has \njust joined us. He has been an eloquent spokesman in terms of our \neducational issues. I yield him up to 15 minutes, if that is \nappropriate.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S9715]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me first commend my good friend \nfrom Georgia for his efforts to bring attention to the significance of \nthe current education situation in the United States, and in \nparticular, for emphasizing some of the shortcomings in our educational \nsystem and what we can do to change them. I am very pleased to join him \nin this effort.\n  Mr. President, I would like to talk about issues concerning education \nand the attitude of constituents with regard to what they see as \ninsensitivity by the Federal Government. They look upon education as a \nresponsibility that should be shared, with the primary concern resting \nwith the parents, the educator, and then moving into the community as a \nwhole and the school boards, as opposed to a centralized dictate from \nfaceless and nameless bureaucrats in Washington, DC, dictating an \neducational system which suggests, ``one size fits all''.\n  When I go back to my State of Alaska, I consistently hear about the \nstate of education--not only in my State but as it applies in our \ncountry today. I think it is fair to say that the American people are \nextremely concerned that, despite annually spending hundreds of \nbillions of dollars at the Federal, State, and local level, our \neducation system to a large degree is failing. The simple fact is that \n78 percent--I am astounded at this--of all 2- and 4-year colleges offer \nremedial courses in math, reading, and writing; 78 percent. We would \nassume that our high school students have these skills when they get to \nthe university. But that is not the case. Seventy-eight percent of all \n2- and 4-year colleges now offer remedial courses in math, reading, and \nwriting.\n  What does that suggest? It is pretty obvious that many high school \nstudents are being shortchanged in their academic preparations for \nadulthood.\n  Is that a responsibility of the parents, the educators, the school \nboard, or the system? Well, I would have to say, it is pretty much the \nsystem.\n  As my friend from Georgia recently stated on this floor, the \neducational savings account offers relief. The recently enacted \nbalanced budget bill contained nearly $40 billion in tax incentives to \nhelp parents and students defray college education costs.\n  In addition, the new law provides individuals a $2,000-per-year \nlifetime learning tax credit that can be used by an individual \nthroughout his or her life, to enhance professional skills or complete \ngraduate or undergraduate degrees.\n  I strongly support these tax incentives because in the globally \ncompetitive 21st century our Nation's economic success--our very \nfuture--will depend on a highly educated and high-skilled labor force.\n  It is so disturbing today as we look at some of the areas, \nparticularly the inner-city areas of this country, where, \nunfortunately, many young people come from homes in which they spent \nlittle time with either parent, and oftentimes with a relative trying \nto do the best he or she could in raising those children as a single \nparent. Some of these children are involved at a very young age in \nsimply transporting narcotics, a trade made easier because law \nenforcement agencies might not initiate any significant sentencing on \nthese young people. Some of them become addicted as teenagers and young \nadults and thus depart on this trail which leads to dire consequences. \nOthers may be incarcerated from time to time as teenagers. The fact is \nwhen they are looking for a job, their skills are very limited. Many of \nthem can't read and can't write. They have a very bleak future. \nOftentimes that future leads to crime, drugs, and ultimately, a burden \non society.\n  It is just not the inner-city areas where we have this exposure. We \nhave it in other areas of the country also. Obvioulsy, we need to \nalleviate this situation. To do so, we should assist families instead \nof offering a Federal solution which more often than not will not work.\n  So I go into this area to elaborate a little bit on the dilemma \nfacing society today. Some of the solutions that have been proposed, \nand the tax incentive for higher education that was supported by the \nPresident along with the majority of Democrats and Republicans in \nCongress, do not contain restrictions that condition the incentives on \nstudents attending a public university. So families at the college \nlevel can take advantage of incentives whether the children attend \nState school or private universities.\n  But I think it is ironic that while the Congress and the President \nwork so well together on promoting higher education incentives, the \nPresident, as we know, had threatened to veto the entire tax bill \nbecause a bipartisan group of Senators, including myself and the \nSenator from Georgia, sought to give parents with children in grades \nkindergarten through 12 basically similar tax choices.\n  Why is it that it is all right to provide incentives for attending \nprivate universities but similar incentives are deemed inappropriate \nwhile students are attending kindergarten through 12? The White House \nhas not offered much of an explanation.\n  As important as a university education is this day and age, the best \nassurances that a child will do well in college, let alone be admitted \nto college, is the quality of education that student receives between \nthe ages of approximately 5 through 18. When are study habits \ndeveloped? When are reading, writing, and math skills developed? \nEveryone in this Chamber knows that children do not suddenly develop \nthese disciplines when they enter college. The foundations for \neducational development begin at the early stages of kindergarten, \npreschool, and evolve as the student moves up in grades through junior \nhigh and high school.\n  As we look at other societies, particularly Japan, I have often been \nstruck by the commitment of parents. Many times the mother will study \nwith the child. As a consequence, a family unit takes a significant \ninterest in the learning process. When those youngsters who are in the \nJapanese system want to go on to school, they must take an exam. There \nis a great deal of family excitement around the test as the student \nstudies for the exam and the family experiences a great deal of \nanticipation as to whether or not the child will pass the exam. But it \nis a system, if you will, that is supported by strong parental \nassociation.\n\n  Sixty Senators voted in June to allow parents to establish \neducational savings accounts, proceeds of which could be used to offset \nthe cost of private schools or home schools in the K through 12 grades. \nThis would have given parents of young children a very modest tax \nsubsidy if they choose to send their children to private school. \nContributions to such accounts would not have been tax deductible. The \nonly benefit of these accounts would have been that earnings could be \nwithdrawn tax free.\n  Although modest in scope, these accounts could have given real \nchoices to low- and middle-income families who believe their children's \nbest chance for the future lies in gaining an education in a private \nschool.\n  Income limits ensure that the benefits of these educational savings \nincentives would have been focused on middle-income families. Wealthy \nfamilies most often do not need to use these educational accounts \nbecause they can easily afford the cost of private K through 12 tuition \nand because the tax base in wealthy communities often provides the best \npossible public education in the Nation.\n  But middle- and low-income families don't have the same choices that \nthe wealthy have when it comes to education because they don't have the \nadequate resources to pay private tuition. Allowing these families the \nchoice of using funds from educational savings accounts for grades K \nthrough 12 would enable families with modest incomes to send their \nchildren to the schools where they believe that the child will get the \nbest preparation for college.\n  What is wrong with that?\n  Mr. President, if the education savings accounts can be justified for \ncollege tuition, shouldn't they also be allowed for the educational \nexpense that gives the child the opportunity to apply to college?\n  Mr. President, Congress and the President will again have the \nopportunity to debate this aspect of educational choice in front of the \nAmerican public.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor with my good friend, Senator \nCoverdell, who is with me on the floor today, of\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\nhis bill, PASS A+ Act--and I think that is an appropriate name, PASS A+ \nAct--which would allow parents to make contributions to education \nsavings accounts that can be used to finance K through 12 education.\n  I hope we can pass this legislation before the end of the year. I \nhope that President Clinton will reconsider his opposition to helping \nfamilies finance the cost of sending their children to the primary and \nsecondary schools of their choice.\n  Mr. President, while I am a strong supporter of giving families a \nchoice of where they send their children to school, I believe a vibrant \nand dynamic public school educational system is a strong bulwark of a \nfree society, and I totally support it in this Nation.\n  That is why I supported an amendment to the Labor-HHS bill offered by \nSenator Slade Gorton that will award all funds appropriated to the \nDepartment of Education for K through 12 programs directly to local \nschool districts.\n  Let the local school districts bear the responsibility associated \nwith the education process and let them be responsive to the parents of \nthose children entrusted to the local boards of education for \nperformance. That is the concept, the very basis of the accountability \nconcept. It is pretty hard to hold nameless bureaucrats in Washington, \nDC, under a dictate one-size-fits-all. I think Senator Gorton's \namendment puts the responsibility down at the local area, with the \nlocal school boards, by giving them, if you will, the necessary \nfunding. His amendment I think reflects my fundamental belief that \neducation policies and procedures are best determined by those who are \nthe closest to the student. That means shifting decisionmaking to \nparents, teachers, and local school boards and away from Washington \nbureaucrats.\n  By simply block granting education dollars to local school boards, \neach of the thousands of communities in this country will have the \nflexibility to improve their education system at the local level, \nputting the responsibility on the people.\n  And by consolidating Federal education funds into a block grant we \ncan assure that almost every school district will receive more funds \nfor actual education rather than having the funds lost in a \nbureaucratic administration mire that exists here in Washington.\n  Under the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, more than $11 billion would \nbe distributed under the block grant approach. Currently, the costs of \nadministering the programs that would be block granted represent nearly \n15 percent of the $11 billion. The block grant approach would free up \nthe administrative dollars, meaning nearly $1.5 billion more--$1.5 \nbillion more--could be used for students instead of filling out forms \nto be sent back to Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, there are 788 Federal education programs that spend \nnearly $100 billion a year. How many of these are necessary? These \nprograms are administered by 40 departments and agencies of the Federal \nGovernment. These agencies, I assure you, are not supportive of our \nproposal because they would not have anything to do.\n  Well, it is time to do a top-to-bottom review of how we could \nstreamline the delivery of education dollars to local communities, and \nI think Senator Gorton's amendment is the first step. It is my hope the \nPresident will support this approach through educational funding that \nputs children and teachers ahead of bureaucrats and program managers in \nWashington.\n  So I think it is time for Washington to catch up with the American \npeople on how to improve the educational opportunities of our children.\n  Mr. President, I wonder if I could defer and make a short \nintroduction of a resolution that would follow as opposed to \ninterrupting the presentation by my colleague.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I will be glad to yield whatever time to deal with the \nresolution, and it is perfectly appropriate. The Senator is asking \nunanimous consent it follow this.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, the resolution \nfollow the debate on education we are having here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Murkowski pertaining to the submission of Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 53 are located in today's Record under \n``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coverdell). The Chair recognizes the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I rise to support the \nCoverdell bill, of which I am a cosponsor.\n  Mr. President, we have been debating several pieces of legislation on \neducation here in this body over the last few weeks. It is important to \nclearly understand how all of this legislation fits together and why. \nThis is about restoring the fundamental belief that education policy \nand curriculum belong at the local level; they are best determined by \nthose closest to the students, who care most about the students, and \nwho have the most to win or lose--the parents, the teachers, the local \nschool boards, not Washington. As well-intentioned, as well-motivated, \nas the Department of Education is, as are the President and the \nCongress, who all care about education, it is those at the local level \nwho understand it best.\n\n  The Gorton amendment, which has been referred to by my friend and \ncolleague from Alaska, was passed last week during the debate on the \nLabor-HHS appropriations bill. This amendment block grants funds from \nseveral K-12 education programs in the Department of Education. It \nsends that money back to the States, back directly to school boards.\n  The Coverdell bill, another piece of the fundamental education \nphilosophy debate in this body, is the Parent and Student Savings \nAccount Plus Act. This legislation, as has been referred to many times \nthis morning, allows parents to make up to a $2,000 per year \ncontribution in after-tax dollars to an education IRA, or you could \nrefer to it as an expanded education savings account for primary and \nsecondary education. Parents would be free to choose how this money and \nwhere this money would be used on behalf of their own children's \neducation.\n  The Coverdell bill helps families, especially lower-income families, \nexercise the same rights as wealthy people when it comes to deciding \nwhere their children go to school.\n  Mr. President, I always start with this premise: Whose money is this? \nWhose money are we talking about? It is not my money. It is not the \nPresident's money. It is not the money of the Secretary of Education. \nIt is the parents' money, the taxpayers' money. My goodness, should \nthey not be empowered with some responsibility, since it is their \nmoney, as to how they use that, where they focus to help educate their \nchildren? I think so.\n  Our education problems begin not at the college or postsecondary \nlevel. Somehow we glide over that. Our problems in education begin at \nthe beginning, at the elementary and secondary levels. This is where we \nmust capture these young people. This is where they learn to read and \nwrite and discipline themselves and develop logic and work through \nproblems--at the beginning. Not in college; it is too late. This is \nwhere we should focus. This is where the choice should be. This is \nwhere students and parents desperately need a choice in education.\n  We will probably soon have the opportunity to vote on a third \neducation reform measure in this body, that being the District of \nColumbia Student Opportunity Scholarship Act, another fit, Mr. \nPresident, in the overall education debate, the overall education \nphilosophy.\n  It is no great secret that the District of Columbia school system is \ndeeply troubled. It is not the parents' fault. It is not the students' \nfault. But this bill that we will debate would create a tuition \nscholarship fund that would allow 2,000 low-income students in the \nDistrict to attend public schools, private schools, or parochial \nschools, but schools of their parents' choice. It would also provide \ndirect aid to an additional 2,000 public school students who want to \nimprove their academic skills through afterschool tutoring.\n  As Alveda King recently wrote, ``Is it moral to tax families, compel \ntheir children's attendance at schools and then give them no choice \nbetween teaching methods, religious or secular education, and other \nmatters?'' I do not think it is. ``Is it consistent to proclaim, \nmeanwhile, that America is a\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\nNation that prides itself on competition, consumer choice, freedom of \nreligion, and parental responsibility,'' yet, in fact, we don't give \nour parents a choice where they send their children to school?\n  The Gorton amendment, the Coverdell bill and the DC Student \nOpportunity Scholarship Act are not an attempt to destroy \npublic schools. My goodness. And that is an important point, Mr. \nPresident. I hear my colleagues on the other side of this debate \nsaying, ``Oh, you will destroy public schools. You will take funds from \npublic schools.'' Nonsense. This Nation is a rich, great Nation because \nwe have always had diversity. From the first days of the people who \nsettled this Nation, it has been about diversity. People from all over \nthe globe have made America great and continue to make America great. \nIt is about diversity. It is about choice. It is about competition.\n\n  Americans should want their public schools to be the very best, to be \nthe absolute best school systems that they can make, they can provide, \nthey can develop. I have a daughter in a public school system in \nVirginia. It is a good school system. I am not standing in this Chamber \ntoday to do anything that would deteriorate, take away or harm the \npublic school systems. But we must enable all people to choose the best \neducation for their children, whatever their circumstances are in life. \nAnd we must restore the fundamental belief that education policy and \ncurriculum are best determined by those closest to the students--\nparents, teachers, school boards--not Washington.\n  Mr. President, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the \nCoverdell bill, and I yield my time. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWashington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on Monday, millions of American children \nwill board schoolbuses all across the country.\n\n  But when they get off those buses, will they be walking into schools \nthat challenge them to learn and grow, or into empty shells of missed \nopportunities and lost hopes? Are we doing the best possible job of \neducating our children, or can we do better?\n  For decades, the conventional wisdom in our Nation's Capital has been \nthat Washington, DC, knows what's best for our schools. I disagree. I \nthink teachers, parents, principals, and school boards know what's best \nfor our children.\n  Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed school reform to restore \nthe traditional role that parents and teachers play in education.\n  The reform adopted by the Senate sends Federal education funds for \nkindergarten through high school directly to school districts.\n  Bypassing Federal and State bureaucracies, which siphon millions of \ndollars and attach regulatory strings, means more authority and more \nmoney for local educators.\n  All of us want the best education possible for our kids. We all want \nthem to succeed.\n  A good education unlocks the future, provides a lifetime key to open \ndoors of opportunity and helps our children reach their dreams. We can \nprovide that opportunity to our children by restoring the role that \nparents, teachers, and principals need to play in education.\n  Unfortunately, Washington, DC, takes a different view--the President \nand Democrats in Congress have denounced this proposal.\n  Education should not be a partisan issue, but when this school reform \nmeasure was approved by the Senate, not a single Democrat voted for it. \nAnd the President has said he will veto this reform when it comes to \nhis desk.\n  Apparently, he prefers a system that has Washington, DC, deciding \nwhat's best for schoolchildren in Chehalis, WA; New York City, and \nevery place in between. By taking this position, I think the President \nis telling parents and teachers: ``I don't trust you.''\n  While I believe the President has taken the wrong position, I know \nthat he and I share the same goal--we both want what is best for our \nchildren. The debate is not over who cares more for our children's \nfuture--the debate is about how to achieve our shared goal of doing the \nbest we can for children.\n  There is nothing more important than our children's future. There are \nfew issues as troubling as the state of our educational system. The \nnext century will demand a lot--advanced technology, the global \nmarketplace, an ever-changing American society--and I am concerned that \nour children aren't going to be completely prepared for their upcoming \nchallenges.\n  There was a time in America when parents and teachers had more say in \ntheir children's education. Over time, Washington, DC, gradually took \nresponsibility for education from our home towns, and put it in the \nhands of Federal bureaucrats. What have we gotten for allowing \nWashington, DC, to run our local schools?\n  Since 1960, education spending has risen 200 percent, but SAT scores \nare down. Teachers used to make up two-thirds of the full-time school \nstaff--now it is barely half. And schools are more dangerous than ever.\n  The Washington, DC-knows best approach to education has also taken us \naway from the ``back to basics'' approach long-favored by parents. Skim \nthrough your daughter's American history book. Does it instill her with \nhope? Is it the story of how incredibly diverse people came from all \nover the globe to pursue boundless opportunities? Or is it a visionless \nnarrative of American failures and shortcomings?\n  Those who oppose this measure argue that it's somehow dangerous to \nentrust parents and teachers with more control over our children's \neducation. Those in Washington, DC guard their power jealously, and \nthey won't give it up easily.\n  The President says this proposal will reduce funding for schools, and \neliminates the Department of Education--it will not.\n  Under this proposal, local schools get more money, and the Department \nof Education plays a more modest role.\n  While fewer bureaucrats and a weakened Department of Education are \nvaluable byproducts of this effort, they are not my primary concern--\ngiving parents and teachers more control over their children's \neducation is my single most important goal.\n  One Senator who opposes school reform said he actually thought that \nparents would build more swimming pools, instead of buying more books, \nif Washington, DC stops telling our schools how to educate our \nchildren.\n  I disagree. It's offensive to suggest that parents and teachers don't \nhave the children's best interests in mind.\n  I believe that with the additional authority and funding schools \nwould receive from this reform, our teachers, parents, principals, and \nschool boards will be inspired to do even more--not to build swimming \npools--they will be inspired to make sure that every child receives the \nbest education possible.\n  It comes down to this--will local schools be improved through more \nrules from Washington, DC, or will they be improved if we restore the \nauthority for education decisions that parents, teachers, and \nprincipals once had?\n  On this issue, I believe the answers are best left to our parents, \nteachers, and communities, not Washington, DC.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I commend the Senator for what he has done \nwith the education issue. I am really excited about the prospect of \nhaving, in fact, more education funds available for my State but \ndecisions made about those funds going to the States and local \ngovernments. I commend him for doing that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9713-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9717-S9720]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader, after consultation with the Democratic leader, must turn to S. \n25, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance reform bill prior to the close \nof the 1st session of the 105th Congress, and Senator McCain be \nimmediately recognized to modify the bill, and it be in order for the \nmajority leader to immediately offer an amendment relative to campaign \nfinances. I further ask unanimous consent that it not be in order for \nany Senator to offer any legislation regarding campaign finances prior \nto the initiation of this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am very disappointed on what I thought \nwas an understanding the majority leader and I had about the way we \nwere going to do business around here. I worked very closely with him \nall day yesterday. We were able to get quite a bit done legislatively \non Interior appropriations, and work through an agreement on FDA that \nrequired my cooperation. Yet I am presented with this about 30 seconds \nago--no consultation, no discussion, no deliberation, no way with which \nto discuss whether this makes sense for either side; an ultimatum, take \nit or leave it.\n  That is not the way to do business around here. It is an affront to \nthe Democratic Caucus, to me personally, and it begs the question about \nhow sincere this offer really is. If it were sincere I would think the \nmajority leader and I would have a chance to sit down and talk about it \ntogether, work it through. No effort was made to do that.\n  So, it is enlightening, it is instructive, and it will be \nreciprocated.\n  I am delighted that the Republicans have finally seen fit to \nrecognize the importance of dealing with this issue this year. I am \npleased that at long last they have agreed at least to taking the bill \nup, the McCain-Feingold bill, that 45 Democrats have said they support. \nIt only takes 2 more Republicans and we will have the 50 votes \nnecessary to pass McCain-Feingold as it was introduced, as S. 25. So we \nare looking for two more Republicans. We are hoping that 5 Republicans \nand 45 Democrats will pass this legislation sometime this year.\n  What the majority leader is asking in this unanimous-consent request \nis that at some point between now and the time we adjourn--it could be \nthe last day of this session--that we give consent to go onto this \nlegislation.\n\n  Before the majority leader leaves the floor, I will have a question \nfor him, if I could pose it? At least I would appreciate that respect.\n  Is it the intention of the majority leader to bring this bill up at a \npoint that will allow a deliberation and consideration of the \nlegislation well before the adjournment of the session in order to \nafford us the opportunity to have a good debate about the bill? Mr. \nPresident, I would ask the majority leader that question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. In response to the question under the Senator's reservation \nto the unanimous consent, this agreement says that it would be done \nprior to the close of the 1st session of the 105th Congress. Certainly, \nthere would be notification of what date that might be. I think, you \nknow, we would have to talk to a lot of people on both sides of the \naisle, including Senator McCain, among others, who could not be here at \nthis hour because he has had a commitment and had to leave by airplane. \nIt depends on a lot of other circumstances that we would have to take \ninto consideration. We might want to do it early. We might want to do \nit later. But it would not be my intent to do it right at the end of \nthe session. But I don't have a date in mind. We will have to look at \nwhat is happening with other bills all the way from FDA to \nappropriations conference reports.\n  Next week, for instance, the focus has to be on getting the \nappropriations conference reports agreed to. It would depend on what is \nhappening with other major legislation like the transportation bill, \nthe administration's proposal with regard to fast track--all of these \nwill be taken into consideration. We want to do it in a time when it \ncan be fully debated. I think it is important that we have a chance to \nlook at different proposals and see if a consensus can be reached, see \nif there is some way that we can deal with the way the laws were broken \nin 1996 but see if it can be done without another big Government gag of \nfree speech.\n  So, we fully intend to have notification of the date and an adequate \ndiscussion on all sides of the issue.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Is it the majority leader's intention to adjourn on or \nabout the date of November 14?\n  Mr. LOTT. I beg your pardon, repeat the question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Is it the intention of the majority leader to adjourn on \nor about the date of November 14?\n  Mr. LOTT. As we have discussed in the past, at the beginning of the \nyear we sort of laid out a schedule for the whole year of the times \nthat we would be in and out in each month. At the beginning of the year \nwe had talked in terms of having a week in October off for the Jewish \nreligious holidays as well as the Columbus Day period, and that we \nwould--you know, our target day to adjourn was the 14th.\n  There has been some consideration of it being earlier than that. \nSenator Daschle and I, as you recall, we did discuss the possibility of \nNovember 7. So I don't think we can at this point fix a specific date. \nI think more important is to get the work done that we must get done \nbefore we leave. But I think we are sort of shooting now for the 7th of \nNovember. But at the beginning of the year we said we would be out no \nlater than the 14th.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, if it is the 7th, or the 14th, somewhere in there, \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the request made by the \nmajority leader be amended to say that ``at a date no later than the \n31st of October.'' That would leave, according to the Senator's answer, \nat least 1 week for us to debate this and not make a sham of this \nrequest.\n  Obviously, if he has no intention of bringing it up until the last \nday, this isn't a meaningful request. If we have at least a week to \ndebate it, it is a meaningful request. So I would propose that we take \nS. 25 up before the Senate at a date no later than the 31st of October.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not intend to have this issue come up \nthe last day or the last week of the session, because I think we will \nhave other issues that we would have to deal with or want to deal with \nand I assume the administration wants to deal with at that point. I \npresume that we would probably want to look for a date earlier in the \nmonth of October, maybe even the end of October.\n  But I think this consent request is an honest one and a fair one for \nnow. I would like to leave it the way it is so that we will have a full \npanoply of options to make sure we have it brought up at the right time \nand we can have a full debate and look at all the other things that we \nneed to consider.\n  So I object at this time to changing that date. Let's leave it for \nthe end of the session. I do not intend to bring it up the last day. I \ndon't want to do that. I don't want to go out and be cramped on this \nissue. I would like to have a free discussion much earlier, but I would \nlike to have a chance to talk to Members who have worked it on both \nsides--Senator McCain, Senator McConnell, Senator Feingold, the \nleadership on both sides, the committees that are involved--and come to \nan understanding and agreement that everybody is comfortable with.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, can I just request for the record why the \nmajority leader has seen fit not to share this unanimous-consent \nrequest with me until we came to the floor? This is a highly unusual \nmatter. I would be interested in the leader's response.\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could address that question, if the Senator is \nsurprised, he is the only person in the room, in the building, in the \nmedia that is surprised by this. This has been a running discussion for \nquite some time. In fact, yesterday----\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Has the majority leader shared the language----\n  Mr. LOTT. Let me respond to the question, if I can, and give a full \nresponse. We were working on the language of the UC. I believe a copy \nwas given to Senator McCain, perhaps a copy to Senator Feingold. I \nunderstand Senator Daschle saw it. It is not a complicated UC. \nBasically, all it says is we are going to bring this up and how it will \nbe brought up and it will be done before the end of the session.\n  As a matter of fact, Senator Daschle and I sat right there yesterday, \nand we talked about the parameters of this agreement, and I had the \nimpression he knew full well what was in it.\n  The only difference in it now to what happened yesterday was to \nclarify that we are not going to have this popping up all the time \nwhile we have an agreement to get it brought up at a specific time.\n  So that is why it was done the way it was. He was notified I was \ngoing to make a unanimous-consent request. We don't have, usually, \nnecessarily hours or days of running discussions. This was very simple \nand clear. I thought\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\neverybody would be delighted with this. Senator McCain is comfortable \nwith it. I had the impression Senator Feingold is comfortable with it. \nSenator McConnell is here ready to comment on it. He is comfortable \nwith it.\n  If this is a sneak attack, there hasn't been such a well-covered \nsneak attack since Pearl Harbor. So everybody knew what was going on. I \nthink it is a fair agreement. If we want to get this issue up in a way \neverybody understands and deal with some of the changes that we can \nmake legitimately in campaign finances, including allowing employees \nand union members to have some say in how their dues and their fees are \nspent in campaigns, then we can do that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, the Senator from Mississippi is a smooth sell. Let \nme just say this. Senator McConnell ought to be very happy with this, \nbecause this plays right into the hands of the opponents of campaign \nfinance reform. Senator Feingold didn't know about this. I didn't know \nabout this. There is no Democrat I am aware of who has seen any of this \nlanguage.\n\n  So, I am very disappointed. We are not going to relegate our right to \noffer campaign finance reform in some form to other bills prior to the \nlast day of this session, and that's really what the majority leader is \nasking here. He is asking us to forgo the opportunity to debate \ncampaign finance reform until what could be the very last day of the \nsession, and we will then be under the terms of this agreement, an \nagreement that I have not seen. And yet, yesterday we worked through \nseveral unanimous-consent requests, back and forth, in detail, in \ndirect consultation, he and I working together to get an agreement on \nInterior appropriations, to get a deal, as difficult as it was, on FDA \nreform. We worked through that because he knows it is one thing to say \nwe are going to schedule FDA next week, it is another thing to come up \nwith an arrangement that brings about the unanimity of all 100 Senators \nthat takes care of all the concerns raised by Senators who have issues \nand concerns that they want to raise.\n  That's how you work through unanimous consent requests. You don't \nbring it to the floor and say, ``Here it is, take it or leave it.'' You \nnegotiate it.\n  If there was a real intent, a sincere intent to negotiate a real \nunanimous-consent agreement, do you suppose I would have been presented \nwith it 2 minutes ago on the floor with no discussion, no negotiation?\n  We did have a discussion here on the floor a couple nights ago, or \nwhenever that was. But it was, ``You know what, we may actually bring \nup campaign finance reform and we may actually have an agreement I \nwould like you to look at.'' I am looking at it, but this is the very \nfirst time.\n  In all the time I have been leader, every single time when there has \nbeen a sincere effort to resolve a unanimous-consent request, guess \nwhat happened? Senator Dole and I worked on it together, Senator Lott \nand I worked on it together, and jointly we presented it to the body \nbecause we wanted to get it passed, we wanted everybody to agree.\n  This is designed for disagreement. This is designed to surprise. This \nis designed so all the people up there will write, ``Democrats objected \nto a unanimous-consent request.'' That's what this is about. He knows \nit; I know it. We are playing a game this afternoon. We object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we have made a very fair unanimous-\nconsent offer here that we would bring this issue up before the end of \nthis session of Congress, that we would bring up McCain-Feingold and \nthen the latest iteration of that, which I believe is the McCain bill, \nand that I would have the opportunity, as majority leader, which I have \nanyway, to offer an amendment or a substitute for that. A very clear, \nunderstandable, fair process.\n  Now, if the Senator is surprised, I thought he had been talking to \nhis own Senator Feingold. I have in my hand a press release from \nyesterday that went out from Senator Feingold's office announcing that \nSenators McCain, Feingold, and Lott, much to my surprise, ``will \ndiscuss the McCain-Feingold campaign finance proposal in coordinated \nstatements on the Senate floor this afternoon.'' That was yesterday. \n``Attached is an outline of the new proposal.''\n  I thought if it had gone that far--which I thought was certainly \njumping the gun because we were trying to make sure everybody had an \nopportunity to know how this unanimous-consent agreement was being \nconstructed and what was in it, and Senator Feingold, to his credit, \napologized that it was done in the way it was. I said, no problem. I \nunderstand how sometimes we get a little carried away, maybe staff got \na little exuberant and released it before it was completed.\n  For instance, I felt like I ought to at least talk to Senator \nMcConnell and make sure he was aware of what we were developing here. I \nthought this was a very good proposal. This is a fair way to get the \nissue up, have a full discussion, for us to offer proposals that would \ncorrect some of the problems and abuses of union members, abuse of \ntheir dues, to deal with the illegal foreign contributions that we have \nseen over the past year in 1996, to deal with the other abuses of the \nlaw, tighten up the law and make it clear, or clearer if we need to, \nabout the President and Vice President should not do certain things \nwhile on Federal property. Whatever.\n  It seemed like a fair proposal to me. And I was ready to go with \nthat. And my intent is to try to get an agreement where we could do \nthis some time early in October. But if the Senator feels constrained \nto object, that is certainly his right.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. We will do it in October. I guarantee the majority \nleader of that. But we will do it either the easy way or the hard way. \nWe will do it the easy way, by scheduling Democrats and Republicans in \na way that makes sense in getting a unanimous consent that works, or we \nwill do it the hard way, we will do it the way we had to do on Kennedy-\nKassebaum, we will do it the way we had to do it on minimum wage, we \nwill do it the way we did it on disaster. But we will do it and do it \nand do it until it is done. That is a promise.\n  So we can play games on schedule and we can position ourselves and \ntalk about how much we are in favor of campaign finance reform, but the \nbottom line is it is going to be more than rhetoric. We are going to \nget this job done the hard way or the easy way. It is going to get \ndone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nWisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the road to campaign finance reform is \nobviously a long, hard one. But we are going to keep on it. I just want \nto say, because I am involved in a bipartisan effort here, that I \nbelieve the majority leader was engaged in the last couple of days in a \ngood-faith effort, negotiating with Senator McCain, of course, with \nmembers of his own caucus, to try to resolve this issue.\n  I believe there has been a relatively small misunderstanding here \nwith regard to the specifics that sounds a lot worse than it actually \nis. What we are down to here is merely a difference, based on the \nconversation I just heard, as to whether the bill will come up in early \nNovember or whether it might come back some time in October.\n  Surely, we will not allow such a difference to make the difference \nbetween whether we debate campaign finance reform or not.\n  I just had the opportunity to speak with Senator McCain briefly. He \nand I share the view that I think most of the American people share, \nthat too much has happened with regard to this scandal in this area to \nnot address this matter.\n  I think we need to work a little more on the UC. I had not seen the \nUC. I want that noted in the Record. I had not seen the UC, but I am \nnot complaining. That is not my role in this institution to be the main \nperson reviewing an agreement of that kind.\n  But I am confident, once this small matter is resolved, that we will \nhave an agreement very much like the one that was just propounded. That \nagreement would be a historic agreement. I think it would be the first \ntime in memory that the leaders of both parties in this body had agreed \nto bring up bipartisan campaign finance reform.\n  The nature of the proposal was quite reasonable. The proposal \nsuggested\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\nthat there would be full and open debate on this issue without a time \nlimit, that there would be an opportunity to amend. We can fix the bill \nwith amendments. We can accommodate Members' concerns. We can improve \nthe bill or we can even defeat the bill, as my colleague from Kentucky \nmay choose to do. But that is different than last year when we were \ngiven only 2 days, no amendments, and a cloture vote.\n  The agreement that was just propounded was significantly better in \nthat regard. The agreement would give the American people the \nopportunity with some certainty to know about when this issue was going \nto come up so that the people across the country could write their \nRepresentatives, call their Representatives, e-mail their \nRepresentatives, and say, ``We'd really like this bill passed'' or \n``We'd like it killed'' or ``We'd like it changed.'' I think all of \nthis is embodied in the proposal.\n\n  So I say, on behalf of myself and Senator McCain, if I may do so, \nthat, apart from this small issue of the exact timing, that this \nagreement, once agreed to, will do what we want it to. It is what we \nwant. It is what we worked for for a long time, while all the pundits, \nespecially in this town, have said that the issue will never come up. \nMost importantly, when we have this debate--and it will be in the near \nfuture--I am confident it will be done in an orderly manner. And it \nwill give the American people what they deserve, an opportunity to have \na real debate on this issue instead of just an endless stream of \nreports of abuses with regard to campaign financing throughout their \nGovernment.\n  So, Mr. President, I am very optimistic that this brief conversation \nhere was merely a blip and that we will not be forced to use the tactic \nof having to try to attach this legislation to other bills and in fact \nS. 25, which of course is still the McCain-Feingold bill, will in fact \ncome before this body in the relatively near future.\n  I want to thank the majority leader for his cooperation on this. I \nwant to thank my leader for his efforts to try to resolve these \ndifferences at this point. I want to thank all 45 members of my caucus, \nall the Democrats for having signed on to the McCain-Feingold bill. Of \ncourse I want to thank the other cosponsors of the bill, Senator \nThompson and Senator Collins on the other side of the aisle.\n  I want to thank the President. The President has been very steadfast \nin trying to move this legislation forward. His staff has worked \nclosely with us on a day-to-day basis to try to see if we could resolve \nthe very difficult differences between the parties so we could have \nthis matter debated.\n  Mr. President, we will get there. We are getting there. I hope we can \ntoday begin to tell the American people they are finally going to be \nable to participate in, hear and understand the debate about whether \nbig money is going to continue to control the Government of the people \nof the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I listened with interest to the \ncomments of the Democratic leader and Senator Feingold. I would just \nlike to say briefly in response, there is no reluctance to debate this \nissue. Those of us who oppose McCain-Feingold look forward to the \ndebate. We relish the debate.\n  My colleague in the chair remembers when we stayed up all night to \ndebate this about 5 weeks before the 1994 election, which was the \ngreatest victory for my party in congressional races in this century.\n  So let me just disabuse all of my colleagues of the notion that there \nis any reluctance on the part of those who oppose putting the \nGovernment in charge of political speech of individual groups, \ncandidates, and parties in this country, any reluctance to debate the \nmerits of that proposal. There is no reluctance whatsoever.\n  What the majority leader was trying to do here today was to structure \nthat debate in such a way as to provide minimal inconvenience to \nMembers of the Senate. The Democratic leader said we can get there the \nhard way or the easy way. We have no reluctance to get there the hard \nway, Mr. President, no reluctance whatsoever.\n  The majority leader was simply trying to accommodate all of the \nSenate by providing an orderly, structured way to have a debate that we \nrelish, look forward to making. My experience with this issue over the \nyears is the more colleagues and the American people and, yes, the \npress learns about the issue the better, the greater likelihood the \nfirst amendment will be protected.\n  So bring on the debate. We are ready for it. But, obviously, it will \nbe a lot easier on everyone if we did it an orderly, structured way. \nThat is what the majority leader was seeking to do. I commend him for \nthat, and look forward to the debate that will be forthcoming. We will \nbe happy to do it either the hard way or the easy way, whichever seems \nto suit the Senate the best.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton).

Mr. President, we have spent the better part of the \nmorning talking about our initiatives to begin to get at the core \nproblems in elementary education in America. We have talked about \ncreating an education savings account that allows every family the \nopportunity to save and build resources to deal with whatever \ndeficiencies are troubling their children.\n  We talked about the Presiding Officer's amendment which would move \n$11 billion or $12 billion to local school districts without the \nstrings and encumbrances that Washington cannot ever seem to free \nitself of. Just put the resource at the local level.\n  We have talked about a proposal to create scholarships in the \nDistrict of Columbia to try to allow these families in certifiably \ntroubled schools a way out.\n  Three things, all of which are addressed where the real problem in \nAmerican education is occurring: Elementary and high school.\n  Now, what has been the opposition? What is the opposition? It began \nwhen the savings account was put in the tax relief proposal. The \nPresident told the Speaker that if it was left in the proposal, the \nsavings account for families to help kids in elementary school, he \nwould veto all of it, all the tax relief would be vetoed.\n  So obviously it was removed. But we have not retreated. We have \nbrought the proposals back. The Speaker introduced the education \nsavings account on the House side, and myself and the majority leader \non this side.\n  Now, what is the reason? Why would the President go to such lengths \nto clamp down on an education savings account? Well, he and the \nSecretary of Education say it would undermine public education--remove \nresources from public education.\n  Mr. President, I have to assume they are just misinformed by their \nown staffs. I can come to no other conclusion--that they just have \nbecome so accustomed to the status quo and to beating down any new idea \nthat there is a knee-jerk reaction. They always try to infer that these \nideas will somehow impair or undermine public education. Wrong, wrong, \nand wrong.\n  In fact, it is the reverse, the exact reverse. The savings account \nwill infuse public education with new money. The vast majority of \nstudents are in public schools and the vast majority of students will \nstay in public schools. The savings accounts that the parents of those \nchildren create will come to the aid of--there is not a single dime, \nMr. President, not 10 cents, that will be removed from public schools.\n  Conversely, billions--billions--of new dollars will come to the \nsupport of public schools. The child in a public school who needs a \ntutor, the child in public school--which, incidentally, will be a \npublic schoolteacher. If I was a public schoolteacher I would be \nrushing in support of the education savings account because it will \ngive them a vast, vast new opportunity to teach, which they love to do, \nand earn compensation, which will help them. Not one dime is removed.\n  Every family that opens this savings account will continue to pay \ntheir property tax for the public school--every one. They will set up \nthe savings account. They will hire tutors from the public school \nsystem. They will be tutoring children in the public school\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\nsystem. They will be buying home computers for children in the public \nschool. And if the President's proposal is adopted sometime for \nuniforms, they will be buying uniforms in the public school system. \nThey will be transporting students to afterschool programs or whatever \nin the public school system.\n  Now, Mr. President, it will also help private schools because those \nparents that have made that decision can also open up savings accounts, \nand all the things I have just said that would augment public education \nwill augment private education.\n  Now, I guess this is the rub for the President. There will be some \nfamilies who will use the savings account to change schools. They might \nleave a troubled school and go to another one, and he doesn't think \nthey should have that right. He can say that. He can say it is good \nsound public policy for us to order families where they must go to \nschool, but he may not assert that it undermines public schools, \nbecause it just isn't true. It is the reverse. It augments and brings \nvast new resources to all elementary education, public and private.\n  As I said when these remarks began, they are going to be the most \nintelligently spent dollars in all education because they are dollars \nbeing directed like a rifle shot to the exact problem the child has.\n  Vast public moneys, which do great good, cannot do that; parents do \nit. And we are giving them the tools to do it. That is a fact, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand the situation we are now \nunder a time control of the minority leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, the underlying piece of legislation that \nwe have before the Senate is S. 830, which is the drug reform \nlegislation. Earlier in the course of the debate and discussion, I \npointed out one of the most serious proposals in that particular piece \nof legislation that puts the future health care of all at serious. I \nalso pointed out the bewilderment the President of the United States \nand I share, which every consumer group shares: Why in the world are we \nproviding the kind of change in protections for the American consumer \nthat are included in this legislation?\n  I am reminded, Mr. President, that 30 years ago this Nation was faced \nwith a thalidomide tragedy, and all the implications that that terrible \nsituation had for hundreds of mothers and children. Twenty years ago, \nwe had the Dalkon Shield tragedy, where 18 women died from perforated \nuteruses, 2,700 women had miscarrages, and millions of women were \nadversely affected with great illness and sickness and, in many \ninstances, were unable to have children in the future. Why? Because we \nhad a medical device that wasn't safe for American women.\n  Ten years ago, we had the Shiley heart valve. A certain part of that \nheart valve that was found to be unsafe here in the United States, but \nit was advertised and used overseas and resulted in hundreds of deaths.\n  We know that some medical devices can be dangerous. We have to ask \nourselves, as we are coming into the final consideration of this \nlegislation, why in the world we are retreating from protecting the \nAmerican public in this area? That is what we are doing. We are putting \nthe interests of the medical device industry ahead of the public health \nof the American people. For what reason? For the profits of those \nmedical device industries.\n  The provisions of the legislation are clear and simple. S. 830 says:\n\n       . . . prohibits FDA from reviewing the safety of a device \n     for uses not listed by the manufacturer.\n\n  If the manufacturer labels a device as substantially the same as \nanother device that has already been approved, the Food and Drug \nAdministration cannot look at that medical device, beyond the use \nlisted on the lablel, in terms of its safety and effectiveness in \nprotecting the American consumer.\n  We are effectively handcuffing the Food and Drug Administration with \nthis language. The amendment, which will be offered by Senator Reed--on \nwhich I will join him, says:\n\n       . . . prohibits FDA from reviewing the safety of a device \n     for uses not listed by the manufacturer unless the label is \n     false and misleading.\n\n  Who could defend a medical device manufacturer that knowingly submits \nfalse and misleading information? Anybody who is listening to this \nwould say, we can't believe that, Senator. We can't believe that is \nreally happening. Well they should believe it because that is what is \nhappening.\n  The clearest illustration of this development is the use of a certain \nbiopsy needle that has been manufacture by U.S. Surgical Co. A biopsy \nneedle used to excise tumor tissue to see whether it is cancerous or \nnot. The biopsy needle is maybe the size of the lead in a pencil. It is \nused to remove sufficient amount of material to be analyzed. Now, along \ncomes U.S. Surgical Corp., which develops medical devices, with a new \nmedical device that can take 50 times more material than the earlier \nbiopsy needle. U.S. Surgical says: Look, this new device is the same \npurpose as the other medical device. It is substantially the same. It \nis for taking material that can be a biopsied. We have been approved \npreviously in terms of safety and effectiveness. According to our \nlabel, this new device is a biopsy needle and, according to the law, \nunder S. 830, FDA cannot look beyond that use and into the real purpose \nof this new device to determine whether or not the device is safe and \neffective for that new use.\n\n  Well, Mr. President, unfortunately for U.S. Surgical Corp., a number \nof us have seen their ads and promotions for this particular medical \ndevice. What is U.S. Surgical Corp. promoting? It is promoting this new \ndevice as a device that is going to remove the tumor, not just take the \nbiopsy, but remove the tumor from a woman's breast. Now, it may be very \ngood in removing that tumor. It may be able to get all the cancerous \nmaterial. It may do the job better than any other medical device we \nhave had before. But we don't know that. The patient won't know it. The \ndoctor won't know it. The family of the patient won't know it. Why? \nBecause U.S. Surgical Corp. would not have to provide one paragraph of \ninformation demonstrating that this medical device is safe and \neffective for removing tumors. The doctors will see it and say, well, \nthis has been approved by the FDA, it must be safe. I think I will use \nit, especially after reading about, hearing, or watching the promotion \nfilm used in Canada to promote this device.\n  The FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the labeling of the \ndevice to determine whether it is safe and effective. The FDA can say, \nlook, we know the manufacturer is out there day in and day out \npromoting this device for tumor removal. They can hardly wait to get \napproval to go out and sell that medical device for the purposes of \nremoving the tumor. According to the proposal under S. 830, if the \nlabel says that it is substantially equivalent to the biopsy needle, \nthe Food and Drug Administration cannot require U.S. Surgical Corp. to \nprovide information demonstrating that the device is safe and effective \nfor its marketed purpose. That is wrong.\n  We are taking an important step backward in protecting the American \npeople. And it is not just this particular medical device. The real \nconcern is all the other medical devices that are out there now being \nconsidered. It is the mammography screening machines that are being \nused for breast cancer screening. The mammography screening machines \nmay be very good in terms of the diagnostic evaluation of tumors, once \nthe tumor is detected. They may be even better as screening tools to \nlook for such a tumor. But we don't know because the FDA wouldn't be \nable to ask for safety and effectiveness data for its use in breast \ncancer screening. So we have examples of mammography machines coming \ninto the FDA that will be approved because they are effective in terms \nof evaluating and diagnosing tumors, but have not been studied in terms \nof their effectiveness in screening. Yet we find the machine is being \nused for screening purposes. American women will say that they have \nbeen screened with\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\nmammography machines, and they have been found to be free of any kind \nof cancer. They will be very happy about that. Since we have no data on \nhow effective this device is for screening, they may find later, maybe \ntoo late, that they have some kind of a tumor. They may find out that \nthis machine didn't do what it was represented to do because it had not \nbeen tested in terms of effectiveness. That should not be the case.\n\n  That is true with regard to the surgical lasers that haven't been \ntested for safety and effectiveness in cutting cancerous prostate \ntissue. It has been demonstrated that the lasers are safe and effective \nin cutting general tissue. But, the manufacturer changes the design and \nputs another laser in that also cuts tissue. But the purpose of that \nnew laser is to cut through tissue in the prostate area, whether it is \na cancerous tissue or noncancerous tissue. The laser has not been \napproved for that purpose. We do not have safety information to know \nthat it is effective in dealing with this particular kind of operation. \nThe manufacturer doesn't have to provide it. All they have to do is say \nit is a laser that cuts tissue and they get approved. The FDA can be \nfully aware that they are going to promote it for prostate cutting, but \nthey will not be able to ask the manufacturer to provide safety \ninformation for that use.\n  The same is true with contact lenses that get approved though this \nloophole channel--saying that the lenses are substantially equivalent \nto equipment that has already been approved. But those lens \nmanufacturers are intend to promote these new lenses for long-term use \nrather than short-term use like the ones that have been approved. The \nFDA can know about the advertising--and can even tell from the change \nin materials used to make the new lenses that they are designed for \nlong-term use. But they cannot evaluate the new lenses for safety and \nlong-term use. We can see the dangers that could result--maybe even \nblindness.\n  Mr. President, we shouldn't be taking a risk with the health of the \nAmerican people in this way. It is fundamentally wrong. The only reason \nto do so is to give a competitive advantage to unethical medical \nmanufacturing companies. Those are the ones that will use this \nloophole. And when they do, they will gain a competitive advantage over \nthe ethical manufacturers that take the time and spend the money to \nconduct the safety and effectiveness studies to show that thier devices \nare safe. They will be at a financial and competitive disadvantage \nbecause less ethical companies will use this loophole for approval.\n  That is why each and every one of these consumer groups are opposed \nto this provision--why we have recommended five different alternatives \nto address this issue over the past weeks. The medical device industry \nhas turned those down because they say they have the votes. They can \nroll over the public health concerns of the American people. That has \nhappened in the past. But I hope it will not happen next Tuesday. This \nissue is too important. It is important for our wives, our daughters, \nour sons, our fathers, our grandparents--to be sure that when they have \nto use medical devices, those devices are going to be safe and \neffective. We have the ability to ensure safety in so many new ways--\nways that were unimaginable years ago.\n  But with this provision, we are effectively tying the hands of the \nFDA. If there is an appropriate title for the provision, it is the \nfalse-claims provision of the medical device and pharmacy legislation, \nS. 830. And it is the wrong way to go.\n  We look forward to debating this issue next week. I am hopeful that \nwe can address it in a way that will provide the real protection the \nAmerican people deserve.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9721-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9722-S9723]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BANNING ANTIPERSONNEL LANDMINES\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, the President of the \nUnited States announced that the United States would not sign the \nlandmine treaty that was just negotiated in Oslo. This treaty is the \nculmination of a process begun a year ago in Ottawa, Canada, by the \nForeign Minister of Canada, Lloyd Axworthy, who invited nations around \nthe world to sign a treaty that would be a comprehensive ban on the use \nand the export and the manufacture and stockpiling of antipersonnel \nlandmines.\n  Antipersonnel landmines are these weapons that destroy the lives--\neither by maiming or killing--of 26,000 people a year. There are \napproximately 100 million landmines in the ground of the 65 nations--or \nmore--around the world. And more are being put down every day. As one \nperson from one of the nations most severely impacted by landmines told \nme once, they clear the landmines in their country ``an arm and a leg \nat a time.''\n  Thanks to the leadership of Canada, and Minister Axworthy, this \neffort gained support around the world. Close to 100 nations joined \ntogether in Oslo to put the final pieces together on a comprehensive \nlandmine treaty that would be signed in Ottawa in December.\n  The United States had basically boycotted this process, preferring a \nmuch slower and less effective one in Geneva following a very \ntraditional route, the one that showed absolutely no movement. To the \nadministration's credit, they finally did join the process, although at \nthe 11th hour. Unfortunately, when they went to Oslo, they went to Oslo \nsaying that the United States would need some major changes in the \ntreaty to accept it, that they would have to have the treaty rewritten \nto accommodate the United States, and that these positions were not \nnegotiable.\n  I applauded the United States for going to Oslo, but I was \ndisappointed in the steps they took once they were there. I went to \nOslo for a few days and met with many of the delegates, including the \nchairman of the conference. Then it became clear to me--I also spoke to \nthe American delegation--that the United States had come with basically \na take-it-or-leave-it attitude and that other countries were not going \nto agree.\n  The President said that we had obligations in Korea that were unique \nto the United States. We do have special obligations in Korea. But that \nwas not an insurmountable issue. In fact, those who went there had said \nalmost a year before, if the United States made an effort, they would \nhelp accommodate our security interests in Korea, but the United States \nignored the entire process.\n  Finally, hours, literally hours before the conference was to end, the \nUnited States became engaged and said, well, we need some changes. If \nyou will give them to us, we can sign. The first change is to have a \ntreaty that would not take effect for 9 years, plus the 10 years as \nprovided for in the treaty to remove existing minefields. That is 19 \nyears from this December. We would actually be in the year 2017 before \nthe mines would be removed. The United States asked for a 19-year \nperiod even though countries far less powerful than us were willing to \nact much quicker. The United States was saying that even though we are \nthe most powerful nation on Earth, we want the ability to be able to \nuse our antipersonnel landmines all over the world for another 9 years, \nand the antipersonnel mines we use near antitank mines, forever. And, \nlastly, of course, accommodate us on Korea. It became a bridge too far \nfor the other nations. They said we were asking too much. They were, \nafter all, the nations being hurt by landmines and they would go \nforward with the treaty with or without the United States, and that is \nwhere we now stand.\n  After that, the President of the United States announced a number of \nsteps that he is willing to take unilaterally, and I commend him for \nthese steps because he has said that he also wants to see, as we all \ndo, this scourge of landmines to end.\n  Interestingly enough, many of the steps that he talks about are in \nlegislation pending before the Senate--legislation sponsored by both \nthe distinguished occupant of the chair right\n\n[[Page S9723]]\n\nnow and myself. So I ask this: If, indeed, the main problem the \nadministration has is our obligations, treaty obligations, defense and \nnational security obligations in the Korean Peninsula, especially the \ndefense of South Korea from a country that has proven its belligerence \nbefore, North Korea, a country that has an unstable political system \ntoday, faces drought, famine, and flooding--it is amazing it could have \nall those going on at once. It faces the consequences of its own \nsecrecy and belligerence. If that is our main concern, they should look \nat the legislation we have before the Senate, similar legislation \nbefore the House of Representatives, the Leahy-Hagel bill in the \nSenate, the Evans-Quinn bill in the House.\n  I urge the administration, disappointing as it is that it has not \njoined the Ottawa process, disappointing as it is it has lost this \ngolden opportunity, to work with the Congress, the Congress which has \ndriven the debate in this country on banning landmines--not the \nexecutive branch--the administration should now come and work with the \nCongress and continue forward, because, after all, the ultimate goal is \nto end the scourge of landmines. There is only one way to do that, and \nthat is for the United States to join in the Ottawa Treaty. If not in \nDecember, then in the future. We need to get there, one way or another. \nThere is no other treaty, and without the United States, we will never \nsee the worldwide ban we all seek.\n  We are coming to the close of the bloodiest century in history. It is \na century where we have seen the world torn by wars, great and small, \nbut wars that more and more saw their greatest toll in innocent \ncivilian populations. Whether in Rwanda, in Angola, in Bosnia, in \nMozambique, in Central America, or anywhere else, it is usually the \nnoncombatants who suffer the most. And more and more those \nnoncombatants suffer from the scourge of landmines.\n  Peace agreements are signed at some time, and someday armies march \naway and someday the guns grow silent, but in more and more of these \ncountries, after that happens, landmines stay in the ground and \ncontinue killing and continue maiming long after all hostilities have \notherwise ceased. Sometimes long after people can remember what they \nwere fighting about, a child walking to school is blown apart, a farmer \ngoing with his or her animals into a field is blown apart, a mother, \nfollowing a child down a road, is blown apart; and nobody knows who put \nthe landmine there. They may not even remember what the war was about. \nBut they know--that person knows--that their life is changed forever.\n\n  We have used, now, for several years, the Leahy war victims fund. We \nspend $5 million of our taxpayers' money each year for artificial \nlimbs, for men, women, and children who have been injured by landmines.\n  My wife, who is a registered nurse, has gone with me to some of the \nclinics where we use the fund. We have seen people our age get their \nfirst wheelchairs, even though they lost their legs in wars long gone \nby. We have seen children who have lost half their body from a \nlandmine. We have seen a child who went to pick up what she thought was \na shiny metal toy on the side of the road and lost her face and her \narm.\n  Mr. President, people talk about one type of landmine versus another \ntype of landmine. They talk about the technical capabilities of one \narmy or another. But what is often forgotten is the face of the \nvictims. Some of those victims may no longer even have a face. When she \nwas alive, I told the Princess of Wales that the greatest difference \nshe made in the battle against landmines was to focus the world's \nattention on the faces of the victims. Because when she visited a \nhospital for landmine victims, the whole world visited that hospital \nwith her. Those victims are still there. Just because the TV camera \nturns off, the victims don't disappear. They are still there. Their \nlives are still ruined. And in the time that I have been speaking, \nthere have been two more victims of landmines. By the time we go home \ntonight, there will be a dozen more victims of landmines--26,000 this \nyear alone.\n  I commend the effort begun by Canada, and Foreign Minister Axworthy. \nI commend those nations that came together in Oslo to sign the treaty. \nNot in my lifetime has there been an arms control issue that so many \nnations have moved so quickly on, to sign a treaty so comprehensive. \nNever before have so many nations responded so urgently, and so \neffectively, to a humanitarian problem such as this.\n  I regret very much that the United States was not among those who \nagreed to sign the treaty. Not because we are causing the problem. \nOther nations never even went to Oslo. Russia, China, Pakistan, India, \nothers, who are part of the problem, they weren't even there. And that \nshould be noted. But the United States is the most powerful nation \nhistory has ever known. The United States could be a moral beacon. \nInstead, the United States said: Notwithstanding our power, we want to \nkeep our landmines, but you less powerful nations, you should give up \nyours.\n  We should join them. We should be willing to set an example. Not to \npretend that we are giving up our landmines when in fact what we are \ndoing is calling them by another name. Let us use the steps that we \ncan, through congressional action, which will be taken, I am sure, \nbecause there is an ever-increasing number of Members in both parties \nwho want to see stronger U.S. leadership.\n  Let us take that step here as a nation. But then let's give guidance \nto the rest of the world. Let's not have Russia, China, and others stay \nout of the process because the United States is staying out. Let us be \nwholeheartedly a part of this process and put pressure on other nations \nto join us, until the day arrives when we do with landmines what we \nhave done with chemical weapons, and make their use a war crime.\n  Throughout this process, the U.S. position has been driven primarily \nby the Pentagon; not by the State Department, not by the White House. I \nthink back to the 1920's, to the First Geneva Convention, when Gen. \nBlackjack Pershing, no theoretical dilettante he, said we should give \nup poison gas. But the Pentagon said no, not so fast, because there are \nsome instances when it could be very helpful in protecting our troops. \nFortunately, our civilian leaders understood that the humanitarian \ndisaster that could result from using poison gas outweighed whatever \nmilitary utility could be got from using it. And so over time, poison \ngas was stigmatized so that anyone who used it risked being branded a \npariah. And it was virtually never used, even though in the Korean war, \nor in Vietnam, there were any number of instances when it might have \nbeen militarily advantageous.\n  Today we have a similar situation, where many of our best known, most \ndecorated generals say let's give up landmines. Again, we hear the \nPentagon saying, as General Pershing heard, ``No, there are instances \nwhen landmines can help us.'' Of course there are. There are instances \nwhen any nation would want to use landmines. But earlier this week, 89 \nnations made the moral decision to put the lives of innocent people \nfirst.\n  The balance of power throughout the world would still be the same as \nit is today. The only thing that would change is there would not be the \nthousands of innocent civilian casualties every single year.\n  Again, my prayer for the next century is that armies of humanity \nremove and disarm landmines, and no armies, no armies, put any new \nlandmines down. What greater gift could we give to those in the next \ncentury, than a world without landmines?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9722-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9723-S9725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  PARTISAN ATTACKS ON THE INDEPENDENCE AND INTEGRITY OF THE JUDICIAL \n                                 BRANCH\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

One of the \ngreatest hallmarks of the United States of\n\n[[Page S9724]]\n\nAmerica is that we have an independent Federal judiciary of the highest \nintegrity. We are the envy of the world in that respect. To hear \nRepublican leaders in the House and the Senate talk about intimidating \nthat Federal judiciary was disheartening.

We \nhave heard Republicans clamor for impeachment when a judge renders a \ndecision with which a Republican Member of the House of Representatives \ndisagrees.

More and more \ncourts around the country are being forced to rely on senior judges, \nretired judges, and visiting judges to hear cases. The Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals expects to include an outside visiting temporary judge \non 80 percent--80 percent--of its panels over this year.\n  Other appellate courts have had to forego oral arguments in more and \nmore cases, and litigants, the people who are paying the bills, the \ntaxpayers of the United States, are denied any opportunity to see the \njudges who are deciding their causes and to have any reassurance that \njudges are personally considering their arguments and concerns. Court \nclerks and attorney staff are being used more and more extensively in \nthe determination of cases as judges become overburdened and backlogs \ngrow.\n  These are not the way to engender confidence in our system of justice \nor acceptance of the process and decisions being rendered or respect \nfor courts and the Government.\n  The chief judge of the eleventh circuit has testified about \n``crushing workloads.'' He has noted that Federal courts are ``no \nlonger able to provide the public with the same standard of excellent \nservice that [they] did in the past.'' The Chief Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court, William Rehnquist, has called the rising number of \nFederal judicial vacancies ``the most immediate problem we face in the \nFederal judiciary.''

For the Republican leader in the Senate to join \nRepublican leaders in the House in an acknowledged effort to undercut \nthe independence and integrity of the Federal judiciary would be a sign \nof grave danger for the American people and would be a sign of danger \nfor the system of government that has protected this democracy for over \n200 years.\n  Wednesday marked the 210th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. \nConstitution.

Mr. President, I rise today to note a recent injustice \ndone to one of America's most valuable associations, the Boy Scouts, by \none of our most valued institutions, the Smithsonian. I also rise to \nexpress my appreciation to Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman for \nhis assurance that such an injustice will not occur again in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, in January of this year the Smithsonian Institution \ndenied an application from the Boy Scouts of America to use the \nNational Zoo's auditorium for a Court of Honor ceremony for District of \nColumbia area Scouts.\n  Why would the Smithsonian deny such an application from a group known \nfor its commitment to environmental conservation? According to Robert \nJ. Hoage, Chief of the Smithsonian's Office of Public Affairs, the \nSmithsonian's policy prohibits co-sponsoring events with any \norganization that exercises bias on the basis of religious beliefs.\n  Asked about this decision, the Smithsonian's communications director, \nDavid Umansky, explained: ``Our lawyers have documented cases of the \nBoy Scouts denying membership to atheists, and that violates our non-\ndiscrimination code.'' The Smithsonian also claimed that the honor \ncourt event was not sufficiently relevant to the National Zoo's \nmission. But that claim stretches credulity because of the Boy Scouts' \nmyriad programs devoted to environmental education and conservation. \nIndeed, the Scouts' highest honor, awarded to only about 1,000 Scouts \nsince 1914, recognizes exceptional work for environmental conservation.\n  In a letter to my colleagues dated September 12, I expressed my \ndismay that the Boy Scouts, an organization that has helped literally \nmillions of American boys reach responsible manhood, should be denied \naccess to a federally supported institution because it exercises its \nconstitutional right to free exercise of religion. I also expressed \nconcern that the Smithsonian Institution should enforce a policy \ndiametrically opposed to the principles on which our nation was \nfounded. The Smithsonian, our premier teaching museum, is entrusted \nwith, among other treasures, the Star Spangled Banner, the flag that \nFrancis Scott Key saw flying when he penned our national anthem. I \nrecently sponsored legislation appropriating $8 million to the \nSmithsonian for restoration of that flag. I was frankly disturbed to \nsee that the institution to which it has been entrusted was acting in \nthis manner.\n  However, Mr. President, I am now relieved to report that Secretary \nHeyman, in a September 15 letter to my distinguished colleague, Senator \nFrist, who serves as a regent to that Institution, has apologized for \nthis action. Further, Secretary Heyman's letter expressed his \nconviction that ``our special events policy clearly allows the \nsponsorship of events by all groups, including religious groups, that \nare consistent with the mission and tradition of the Smithsonian.''\n  Recent events at the Smithsonian, including the proposed Enola Gay \nexhibit, with its misleading and inaccurate treatment of the Second \nWorld War, and a number of new exhibits distorting history to cast \nAmerica and American values in a bad light, have caused me to worry \nabout the future of this distinguished and crucially important \ninstitution. I thank Secretary Heyman for his courageous statement of \nfundamental policy and hope that it heralds a new, more positive era at \nthe Smithsonian.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of my \nSeptember 12 letter to my colleagues and the September 15 letter from \nSecretary Heyman to Senator Frist be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 12, 1997.\n     Smithsonian Snubs Boy Scouts\n       Dear Colleague: I want to bring to your attention the \n     latest in an unfortunate series of decisions made at the \n     Smithsonian Institution, America's premier teaching museum. \n     It has come to my attention that in January of this year the \n     Smithsonian denied an application from the Boy Scouts of \n     America to use the National Zoo's auditorium for a Court of \n     Honor ceremony for District of Columbia area Scouts. The \n     application was denied on the grounds that the scouts require \n     members to believe in God and that the event supposedly did \n     not meet the ``relevance requirement'' needed for Smithsonian \n     cosponsorship.\n       In a letter to T. Anthony Quinn, president for District \n     Operations for the National Capital Area of the Boy Scouts of \n     America, Robert J. Hoage, Chief of the Smithsonian's Office \n     of Public Affairs stated that ``the Smithsonian's policy \n     prohibits co-sponsoring events with any organization that \n     exercises bias on the basis of religious beliefs.'' Asked by \n     a reporter from the newsweekly Human Events to explain this \n     decision, David Umansky, communications director for the \n     Smithsonian responded: ``Our lawyers have documented cases of \n     the Boy Scouts denying membership to atheists, and that \n     violates our non-discrimination code.''\n       I find it deeply disturbing that the Boy Scouts, one of \n     America's most important private organizations, which has \n     helped literally millions of American boys reach responsible \n     manhood, should be denied access to a federally supported \n     institution because it exercises its Constitutional right to \n     free exercise of religion. I also am disturbed that the \n     Smithsonian Institution, the repository of so many objects \n     central to our heritage as a people, should enforce a policy \n     diametrically opposed to the principles on which our nation \n     was founded.\n       In an August 14 follow-up letter to Mr. Quinn, Smithsonian \n     Under Secretary Constance Berry Newman failed to so much as \n     mention the ``anti-discrimination'' motivation behind this \n     rejection. Instead the Under Secretary detailed two \n     Smithsonian events involving Boy Scouts, both of which took \n     place several years ago. Her argument was that Smithsonian \n     ``policy emphasizes that the activity or event proposed by \n     the outside organization should have some Smithsonian \n     involvement and participation in the proposed activity or \n     event.'' That an event put on by the Boy Scouts, an \n     organization devoted to outdoor activities and knowledge of \n     the natural world, should be found ``irrelevant'' to the \n     National Zoo stretches credulity to the limit. Further, \n     recent events at the National Zoo clearly have had little to \n     do with that institution's mission. Events have included a \n     naturalization ceremony by the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service and a Washington Singers musical concert.\n       I urge you to contact Smithsonian Secretary Michael Heyman \n     and/or members of his staff to express your deep concern that \n     the Boy Scouts, an institution of longstanding importance to \n     our culture, traditions and public life, is receiving such \n     inappropriate treatment. Further questions on this matter can \n     be directed to Bruce Frohnen of my office at extension 4-\n     8841.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Smithsonian Institution,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 15, 1997.\n     Hon. William H. Frist,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Frist: As was discussed in this morning's \n     meeting of the Board of Regents, and knowing of your concern \n     on this issue, I am writing to apologize for an unfortunate \n     decision that denied the use of facilities of the National \n     Zoo to District of Columbia Boy Scouts last February. In a \n     letter\n\n[[Page S9726]]\n\n     denying the request, a determination was made that the event \n     did not comply with a requirement that all events be relevant \n     to the mission of the Smithsonian and further that the Boy \n     Scouts violated standards of non-discrimination with regards \n     to religion. I have reviewed this determination and reversed \n     it. Scouting is an important American institution that helps \n     in educating young men and women about the outdoors with \n     special emphasis on protection of the environment, a mission \n     relevant to and shared by the National Zoo.\n       Further, as I mentioned in our meeting, I believe that our \n     Special Events Policy clearly allows the sponsorship of \n     events by all groups, including religious groups, that are \n     consistent with the mission and tradition of the Smithsonian. \n     This event certainly complied with that standard and its \n     denial on that ground was in error.\n       The Smithsonian and the Scouts have over the years jointly \n     sponsored many events too numerous to mention here. I \n     apologize for this unfortunate mistake and look forward to \n     continuing our long standing and mutually productive \n     relationship with the Boy and Girl Scouts of America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                I. Michael Heyman,\n     Secretary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9725-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. McCathran, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9726-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9726]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ENROLLED BILL PRESENTED\n\n  The Secretary of the Senate reported that on September 19, 1997 he \nhad presented to the President of the United States, the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 910.

A bill to amend the Higher Education Act of 1965 regarding \nincome protection allowances for certain students; to the Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources.\n\n\n              the working students' income protection act\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Working \nStudents' Income Protection Act, a bill to increase the number of \nworking students who are eligible for Federal Pell grants. I am pleased \nto have Senator Snowe, Senator Hollings, and Senator Robb as \ncosponsors.\n  This bill will correct a problem created by the 1992 amendments to \nthe Higher Education Act that unfairly denies aid to hundreds of \nthousands of deserving students. Let me explain the problem.\n  The formula used to determine the eligibility for Federal financial \naid includes an income protection allowance, known as an IPA, which \nenables working students to retain a portion of their earnings to pay \ntheir basic living expenses. This allowance is not counted in \ndetermining eligibility for student aid. A portion of earnings above \nthe IPA is used to calculate the contributions students can make to \ntheir education expenses. As students' incomes rise above the IPA, \ntheir eligibility for Federal student aid, especially for Pell grants, \ndeclines.\n  The 1992 amendments to the Higher Education Act dramatically and \ndrastically lowered the income protection allowances. For single \nstudents, financially independent of their families, the IPA was \nreduced from $6,400 to $3,000. The IPA for working dependent students \nwas lowered from $4,250 to $1,750. As a result, the amount a typical \nindependent student can receive under the Pell Grant Program begins to \ndecline when his or her income exceeds $3,000, and the student becomes \ncompletely ineligible at an income level of $10,000.\n  Because of this decrease in IPA's, the number of independent students \nreceiving Pell grants declined from over a million in 1992 to about \n750,000 in 1993--a loss of over a quarter of a million grants to \nindependent working students.\n  This change has three unfortunate consequences:\n  First, many nontraditional students are not able to pursue post-\nsecondary education. Typically these are older individuals with jobs \nwho are attempting to improve their skills. Because the IPA is not \nenough to meet living expenses, independent students find themselves \nunable to pay tuition and meet their basic living expenses. They are \nforced to defer or even forgo higher education.\n  Second, the current law creates a disincentive to work. If a student \nknows that earning more than $3,000 will reduce the size of his or her \nPell grant award, the student can easily conclude that there is no \nreason to try to earn more than $3,000 a year.\n  Third, it penalizes students who are trying to pay for their \neducation through work rather than by borrowing. This is particularly \nunfair to the almost 75 percent of dependent undergraduates who are \nworking while studying to pay college expenses. When earnings result in \nlower grants, these students must turn to larger loans to finance their \neducation.\n  The Working Students' Income Protection Act will make great strides \ntoward correcting these problems. It will allow single independent \nstudents to retain $6,000 of their earnings for basic living expenses, \nmarried working independent students to retain $9,000, and working \ndependent students to retain $4,200 before they begin to loose their \nPell grants. This will not only make higher education more affordable \nfor these students, it will also encourage and reward work, a \nworthwhile objective.\n  Moreover, these changes will correct an injustice by providing \nbenefits to a segment of the student population that has been largely \noverlooked by the changes in student aid recently passed or currently \nunder consideration. Increasing Pell grants by $300, for example, a \nmove that I strongly support, which was included in the budget \nagreement, will not help the working students who are ineligible for \nthese grants because of the inadequate level of the current IPA. \nSimilarly, the tuition tax credit will not help them because they are \nnot earning enough to pay taxes. By increasing the IPA, these students \nwill be able to share in the government assistance available to those \nseeking to pursue a higher education.\n  I would like to give you some examples from the University of \nSouthern Maine, a State-supported institution serving 10,000 students. \nThese students have an average age of just under 30 years. They are \nlargely independent students and they are balancing jobs, school, and \noften family responsibilities. When these students have incomes above \nthe IPA, which they must have to survive, they are not eligible for \nPell grants under the current law. Let me describe two of these \nstudents to you.\n  Both are single students. The first is a 25-year-old junior \nrecreation therapy\n\n[[Page S9727]]\n\nmajor. She has worked as a nurses aide since graduating from high \nschool, and she continues to work full time during the summers and part \ntime during the school year. The second is a 31-year-old social work \nmajor. He works year round in a variety of part-time restaurant and \nclerical jobs. Both have total gross earnings of about $15,000 per \nyear.\n  The current income protection allowance permits each of these \nstudents to retain only $3,000 for basic living expenses. It assumes \nthat the remainder is available for calculating the family contribution \ntoward educational expenses. The Working Students' Income Protection \nAct will allow each of these students to retain $6,000 for basic living \nexpenses and will restore their eligibility for Pell grants. It will \nallow them to complete their education without incurring significant \namounts of debt.\n  The president of the University of Southern Maine, Richard \nPattenaude, has often noted that the mission of a public university is \nto help people of diverse backgrounds achieve their goals. These \ncitizens, including recent high school graduates, adult learners with \njobs and families, and single parents, all come to us, he says,\n\n       With dreams of becoming more than they are. I am always \n     moved and inspired by how hard our students work to realize \n     those dreams and how deeply they care about their educations. \n     These students underscore the significance of maintaining \n     support for higher education if we are to enter the 21st \n     century with an educational system ready to meet the needs \n     and challenges of the people we serve.\n\n  By increasing the income protection allowance, the Working Students' \nIncome Protection Act will take a major step toward meeting this \nchallenge by helping working students afford college and encouraging \nthem to pursue higher education.\n  Later in this Congress, the Senate Labor and Human Resources \nCommittee, whose chairman is here today, will mark up the Higher \nEducation Act reauthorization legislation. It is my hope that this \nlegislation will be incorporated into the committee's bill.\n  Enacting this modest change will make a significant and positive \nchange in the lives of thousands and thousands of students in the \nUnited States I urge my colleagues to show their support by \ncosponsoring this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nAmerican Council of Education on behalf of seven higher education \nassociations which support this bill be included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                American Council on Education,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The higher education associations \n     listed below, representing the nation's 3,700 colleges and \n     universities, strongly support the legislation you are \n     sponsoring to correct current inequities in the need analysis \n     formula for the Pell Grant program. Your legislation \n     parallels the reauthorization proposal we have advanced to \n     reinstate or expand eligibility for single independent \n     students and for dependent students who work.\n       A broad-based consensus exists among students, campus \n     officials, and higher education policy analysts, as well as \n     the Clinton administration and many members of Congress, that \n     the 1992 Higher Education Act (HEA) amendments made it overly \n     difficult for single, independent students and dependent \n     students with earnings to receive Pell Grants. These changes \n     were felt immediately and had a substantial, negative impact \n     on access to higher education. For example, at least 200,000 \n     single independent students lost their Pell Grants as a \n     result of these changes in the first year they were \n     implemented.\n       For a number of years, the cost of providing greater grant \n     access for these extremely needy students has been cited as a \n     reason against acting to assist them. However, the President \n     has requested funds for this purpose this year, and the House \n     Appropriations committee has included funds that will make a \n     substantial contribution toward addressing this problem in \n     its version of the FY 1998 Labor, Health and Human Services \n     and Education appropriations bill. Securing these funds, \n     along with passage of authorizing legislation such as yours \n     to permit the funds to be spent, will provide tremendous \n     relief and benefit to students on campuses across the \n     country.\n       Again, we are grateful for your leadership on this \n     important issue. Prompt consideration and passage of your \n     bill immediately following the August recess will pave the \n     way for appropriations to follow, enabling students and their \n     families to make financial plans for the next academic year. \n     We are eager to assist you in any way to secure passage of \n     your legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Stanley O. Ikenberry,\n                                                        President.\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1200. A bill to provide that countries receiving foreign \nassistance be conducive to U.S. business; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n\n             the international anti-corruption act of 1997\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, many of my colleagues and I have \nreceived complaints from constituent companies, or from constituents \nwho are affiliated with companies, which are encountering unfair and \nillegal business practices in other countries. What is especially \ndisturbing is that many of these countries are receiving significant \namounts of U.S. foreign assistance.\n  Ukraine, for example, is the fourth largest recipient of United \nStates foreign aid, receiving approximately $228 million in 1997. Yet, \ndespite this generous U.S. assistance, corrupt government officials \ncheat and threaten U.S. businesses and investors.\n  In March of this year, the Motorola Corp. pulled out of a $500 \nmillion investment because of arbitrary decisions made by powerful \nbureaucrats. News reports indicated that Motorola's decision came less \nthan 2 weeks after the consortium it was leading was selected as one of \nthree winners in a tight competition to install cellular phone networks \nin that country. As reported, the government kept changing the rules up \nto the last minute which drove Motorola to its startling decision to \npull out. The Wall Street Journal called Motorola's experience ``a case \nstudy of the pitfalls faced by investors in Ukraine.\n  The Foreign Operations Subcommittee of which I am a member held a \nhearing on May 6 regarding the Ukraine, Russia, and the New Independent \nStates. The hearing considered the administration's request for \nmillions of dollars in new funding for these countries. A number of \nsubcommittee members and I raised with the witnesses specific examples \nof United States companies and American investors who are victims of \ncorruption and dishonesty by the Ukrainian Government.\n  I would like to take a minute and highlight some statements made by \nAID Assistant Administrator Thomas Dine at that hearing which \nunderscore how serious the situation is in the Ukraine. Mr. Dine \ntestified that ``there are real problems in the Ukraine. The perceived \nlevel of official and unofficial corruption is pervasive and deep.'' He \nalso testified that ``the Deputy Prime Minister, the country's leading \nreformer, recently resigned.'' And, ``major and small U.S. companies, \nfaced with harassment, intimidation, and bribery are leaving the \ncountry.'' Mr. Dine further testified that ``we cannot expect American \ninvestors to do business in Ukraine or any of the NIS countries if they \nare not going to be treated fairly.'' I fully agree with this last \nstatement, and believe we in Congress should act to ensure American \ninvestors are treated fairly, especially in those countries which are \nreceiving millions in American tax dollars.\n  Corruption is a major problem for companies around the world. The \nWorld Bank recently surveyed international executives who identified \ncorruption as the biggest problem they face in doing business in Latin \nAmerica, the Caribbean, and sub-Saharan Africa.\n  And, we have seen disturbing news reports of the extent of corruption \nand illegal practices which are adversely affecting U.S. businesses \nabroad. A New York Times article of May 24, 1997, cited a Commerce \nDepartment finding that U.S. companies lost approximately $11 billion \nin contracts since mid-1994 because of bribery by their foreign \ncompetitors of foreign officials. And, this staggering loss is \nattributed only to those high-profile cases which were identified. \nAnother report cited in the June 2, 1997, Economist Intelligence Unit, \ncited a loss of $45 billion to American companies because of \ncorruption.\n\n  How many more millions of dollars have U.S. companies lost because of \ncorrupt practices by foreign officials?\n\n[[Page S9728]]\n\n  Mr. President, corruption in foreign countries hurts the U.S. \neconomy. Trade with foreign countries creates and supports American \njobs. Trade helps keep prices low, provides a greater selection of \ngoods, and creates a larger market in which American companies can sell \ntheir products. Corruption limits the possibilities for U.S. investment \nand exports. It increases the risk and costs of doing business to the \ndetriment of U.S. businesses and consumers.\n  Some important steps are being taken on the international scene. In \nMay 1997, the 29 member nations in the Organization for Economic \nCooperation and Development [OECD], which is composed of the world's \nlargest industrialized nations, reached an agreement to fight \ncorruption. This agreement is the first international accord which \nmakes it a crime to bribe foreign officials.\n  And, on July 31, the International Monetary Fund decided to end its \n$216 million loan agreement with Kenya because of corruption and \ngovernmental mismanagement in that country.\n  But, more needs to be done.\n  The United States, in effect, is subsidizing other countries which \nare harassing U.S. companies and American investors abroad. This is \nunfair to U.S. businesses and unfair to U.S. taxpayers. And, this \npractice should stop.\n  That is why I am introducing today the International Anti-Corruption \nAct of 1997. This legislation requires the State Department to submit a \nreport and the President to certify by March 1 of each year that \ncountries which are receiving U.S. foreign aid are, in fact, conducive \nto American businesses and investors. If a country is found to be \nhostile to American businesses, its aid from the United States would be \ncut off.\n  The certification would be based on whether a country is making \nsignificant progress in, and is committed to, economic reform aimed at \nstemming corruption. The specific factors of economic reform which the \nState Department would consider include: market principles, private \nownership, equitable treatment of foreign private investment, adoption \nof a legal and policy framework necessary for such reform, protection \nof intellectual property rights, and respect for contracts. The \ncertification also would determine whether that country is making \nsignificant progress to eliminate corrupt trade practices and become \nintegrated into the world economy.\n  Based on the State Department's findings, the countries would be \nassigned to one of three categories regarding their business climate: \nConducive for U.S. business; not conducive to U.S. business; or hostile \nto U.S. business.\n  If the President certifies that a country is hostile to U.S. \nbusinesses and investors, the U.S. Government would immediately cut off \nforeign aid to that country. The United States also would vote against \nany loans to this country in the multilateral development banks. The \naid would remain suspended until the President certifies the country is \nmaking significant progress in implementing the specified economic \nindicators and is no longer hostile to U.S. business.\n  If the President certifies that a country's business climate is not \nconducive for U.S. businesses, that country will, in effect, be put on \nprobation. The country would continue to receive U.S. foreign aid \nthrough the end of the fiscal year, but aid would be cut off on the \nfirst day of the next fiscal year unless the President certifies the \ncountry is making significant progress in implementing the specified \neconomic indicators and is committed to being conducive to U.S. \nbusiness.\n\n  This probationary period is similar to the one in S. 457, which I \nintroduced on March 19, 1997, regarding the drug certification process. \nThis new approach would provide a specific time period during which the \ncountry on probationary certification would be expected to comply with \ncertain conditions stipulated by the administration. If these \nconditions were not met at the end of this period, the United States \nwould act firmly and cut off aid.\n  I initially designed this alternative to put countries on notice that \nthe United States had serious concerns about their lack of cooperation. \nBut, I also wanted to provide a fair period of time during which those \ncountries could address U.S. concerns.\n  I included the probationary period in the bill I am introducing today \nfor those countries which fall in the ``not conducive for U.S. \nbusinesses'' category, because I believe it is important to provide \nadequate notice to these countries which may have important ties to the \nUnited States. And, access to more timely and specific information \nduring this probationary period would assist Congress in exercising its \nlegislative and oversight responsibilities.\n  The third category applies when the President certifies a country is \nconducive to U.S. businesses. Foreign aid continues without \ninterruption.\n  My bill includes the customary waiver authority where the national \ninterests of the United States are at stake. For countries certified as \nhostile to or not conducive for U.S. business, aid can continue if the \nPresident determines it is in the national security interest of the \nUnited States. However, the determination expires after 6 months unless \nthe President determines its continuation is important to our national \nsecurity interest.\n  The bill also contains a provision which would allow aid to continue \nto meet urgent humanitarian needs, including food, medicine, disaster \nand refugee relief; to support democratic political reform and rule of \nlaw activities; to create private sector and nongovernmental \norganizations that are independent of government control; or to develop \na free market economic system.\n  Finally, the bill directs the Commerce Department to establish a \ncorruption hotline. Through this toll-free number, U.S. businesses and \ninvestors will be able to report unfair and illegal practices they are \nencountering in foreign countries. The Commerce Department would use \nthat information in its investigations and would pass the information \nalong to the State Department to be included in its annual report.\n  At a time when we are working to balance the Federal budget and make \ntough spending choices here at home, we can no longer tolerate or \nafford to have our Government misdirect U.S. foreign assistance to \ncorrupt countries, especially countries harassing American investors.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill I am introducing today to \nfight corruption, protect American investors and businesses abroad, and \nimprove the allocation of U.S. foreign aid.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a Senate \nresolution to commemorate Representative Hu of the Republic of China \nfor his outstanding service as the head of the Taipei Economic and \nCultural Representative Office [TECRO] here in Washington, DC. \nPresident Lee Teng-hui has called Dr. Hu back to Taiwan to serve as the \nMinister of Foreign Affairs. This new appointment is a tremendous \nhonor, and I am sure that he will serve his government as ably as \nForeign Minister as he has done in Washington, and in his other \nprevious posts.\n  Serving Taiwan so well here in Washington, DC, has been no easy task. \nDr. Hu must balance the needs of Taiwan with the difficult dynamics \nassociated with the issues surrounding the Republic of China. \nMaintaining stability and peace in Southeast Asia while promoting \ndemocracy and strengthening our ties with our allies should be a top \npriority for both our governments.\n  I have spoken often on the floor of the United States Senate \nregarding numerous issues including our commitments under the Taiwan \nRelations Act, Taiwan's bid to enter the World Trade Organization, \nPresident Lee's visit to\n\n[[Page S9730]]\n\nCornell in 1996, and military exercises by the People's Republic of \nChina in the waters around the island of Taiwan on the eve of their \nhistoric Presidential elections. In all cases, Dr. Hu has provided \nvaluable insights regarding these matters to me.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Hu has distinguished himself among his \ncountrymen. From his days as the ROC delegation leader at the U.N. \nWorld Youth Assembly in 1970 to his current post as the representative \nof the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office here in \nWashington, DC, Dr. Hu has made a name for himself as an expert on \nforeign affairs. Obviously, President Lee recognizes Dr. Hu's abilities \nand has asked him to take the lead in foreign affairs. I hope Dr. Hu's \nreplacement will be as helpful and knowledgeable about Taiwan issues.\n  Finally, I would like to wish both Dr. Hu, his wife Shirley, and \ntheir two children good luck and express to him my heartfelt thanks for \na job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9729-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                   committee on governmental affairs\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL.

Mr. President, yesterday I attended a ceremony to \nmark the 50th anniversary of the Department of Defense. It was a most \nimpressive event to honor the men and women who serve in the defense of \nour Nation.\n  Our former colleague, Secretary of Defense Bill Cohen, highlighted \nthe achievements of the Department over these past 50 years. He \nreminded us of the Department's great legacy and challenges that lie \nahead in the future.\n  The Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and my good friend, \nGen. Joe Ralston, also spoke at this event. His remarks illustrated the \nsignificant changes that have occurred since the Department's inception \nand saluted our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who so honorably \nserve our country.\n  Mr. President, I request that the text of the remarks of both \nSecretary Cohen and General Ralston be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n    Remarks by William S. Cohen, Secretary of Defense, on the 50th \n      Anniversary of the Department of Defense, September 17, 1997\n\n       The poet Shelly called history ``a cyclic poem written by \n     time upon our memories.''\n       Let me describe a certain pivot point in history: It is a \n     time of daunting security challenges both at home and abroad. \n     In Europe, the United States is proposing a bold plan to \n     advance democracy, free markets and shared security. In the \n     Pacific, America is the dominant power, but Korea remains \n     dangerously divided and China is in a period of profound \n     transition, its future uncertain, its intentions unclear. \n     Meanwhile, breathtaking advances in technology are fueling a \n     revolution in military affairs. And America's defense \n     establishment is reorienting itself to confront the enormous \n     security challenges of the new era.\n       I could be talking about September, 1997, for this picture \n     captures our world today. But as history is ``a cyclic \n     poem,'' this picture also describes September, 1947, when the \n     Department of Defense came into being.\n       We have been marking many golden anniversaries of late. \n     These are the days of remembrance, a time to recall the \n     historic trials and triumphs of half a century. The hallowed \n     days--D-Day, VE-Day, VJ-Day. The historic deeds--the Marshall \n     Plan, the National Security Act. And the enduring \n     establishments--the United Nations, the US Air Force, the \n     Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense.\n       Why do we recall these trials and triumphs? Because they \n     can help us face the portents and possibilities of the \n     century ahead. As we talk of tomorrow, we must be mindful to \n     hold up the lamplight of history, so that we may walk with \n     confidence on the footpath to the future.\n       We are here today to celebrate not the golden anniversary \n     of a bureaucracy, or that of a building--but rather of a bold \n     idea. That idea was for a National Military Establishment \n     that unified all of our military services, land, sea and air, \n     under a single Department with a civilian chief, the whole \n     greater than the sum of its remarkable parts.\n       By 1947, it was an idea whose time had come. The generation \n     that won the Second World War set out to win the peace. They \n     understood that to win the peace, America had to be engaged \n     in global affairs as a global leader. They had learned from \n     personal experience--from their ``blood, toil, tears and \n     sweat''--the central lesson of this century: That when \n     America neglects the problems of the world, the world often \n     brings its problems to America's doorstep. And so they \n     created a Department of Defense that would engage the \n     world with gathered strength and purpose.\n       To witness the wisdom of this bold idea and its historic \n     achievements, you only have to walk the corridors of the \n     Pentagon.\n       You will walk past George Marshall's desk. He was soldier \n     who led our forces to victory against fascism; a diplomat who \n     set forth a bold vision for a new Europe, healed, whole, free \n     and linked to America in the spirit of help and hope; and a \n     Secretary of Defense who helped to halt the columns of \n     communism on the Korean peninsula.\n       You will walk past a section of the Berlin Wall, once a \n     symbol of tyranny and peril, now a symbol of the triumph of \n     freedom, and a triumph of the Department of Defense that \n     trained, equipped and maintained the US Armed Forces--forces \n     that gave America and our allies the power and the will to \n     stand fast and stand firm through 40 winters of the Cold War, \n     and gave us the opportunity to secure a lasting peace in \n     Europe and Asia.\n       As you walk through the corridors of the Pentagon, you will \n     see not only the artifacts of our trials and triumphs, but \n     the individuals who endured the trials and ensured the \n     triumphs.\n       You will see the portraits of the military leadership, and \n     also those who led this Department--the Secretaries of \n     Defense--some of whom have graced this ceremony with their \n     presence today. Secretary Cap Weinberger, Secretary Frank \n     Carlucci, Secretary Bill Perry: Each one of you has protected \n     and defended those who protect and defend our nation. Each \n     one of you has left the Department in better stead than when \n     you arrived, and with a challenge to your successor to \n     continue the legacy. I am honored and humbled to accept--and \n     extend--this challenge.\n       But the legacy of leadership extends to those who were \n     ready and willing to be led. And as you walk these corridors, \n     you see the legacy of soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines \n     enshrined on our walls--from the Hall of Heroes that recall \n     exceptional valor, to the exhibits that remember forgotten \n     service--the Women's Military Corridor, the exhibits for \n     Hispanic veterans and the Tuskegee Airmen.\n       To walk these corridors is to learn of courage and \n     commitment; of service and sacrifice; of grit and greatness: \n     From the frozen hills of Korea, to the twisted jungles of \n     Vietnam; from Beirut to Grenada; Panama to Somalia; to the \n     searing sands of Saudi Arabia and the mud and ice of Bosnia.\n       I dedicate our golden anniversary to their golden \n     achievements.\n       In so doing, let me make a point which often becomes \n     obscured in the reports which focus on our flaws: We have the \n     best-trained, best-equipped and best-educated military in the \n     history of the world, and we need to remember that despite \n     our shortcomings, which we are eager to examine and confront \n     openly, our forces are the envy of every other nation on this \n     planet.\n       Finally, if you walk the corridors of the Pentagon, you \n     will meet the backbone of this institution: The civilian \n     employees who serve this Department and support the troops. \n     The success of this Department is their success too.\n       But as we recall our trials and triumphs of the past, we \n     face a new challenge: In 1997--as in 1947--we must build a \n     Department of Defense that can face the dangers and the \n     daring possibilities of the future. For a brave new world \n     stretches beyond these lawns, past those shining monuments \n     across the river. It is a world of momentous opportunity--of \n     flourishing markets, stunning technologies, and new \n     democracies. But it is also a world of startling new \n     dangers--ethnic conflict, regional aggressors, and terrorism.\n       Fifty years hence, let those who look back on 1997 say \n     that, we too, were not just a building or a bureaucracy, but \n     that we too were bold. That we too were unafraid to think \n     anew, to organize anew, to act anew. Let them say that by \n     embracing the spirit of our era, we too were able to seize \n     the challenges of our time: The challenge to shape the world; \n     to respond to its threats; and to prepare for the future; to \n     harness a Revolution in Military Affairs to give our forces \n     the technology to dominate the battlefield; and to foment a \n     Revolution in Business Affairs, to create a 21st Century \n     Pentagon--a model of action, efficiency, economy and \n     versatility.\n       Fifty years from now, let them say that our leadership, \n     vision and courage helped catapult America into a new \n     century. And 50 years from now, let them say that we \n     bequeathed to them, what our predecessors bequeathed to us: \n     The best trained, best equipped, best prepared military in \n     history, the pride of our nation and the envy of the world.\n       I will close with the words from Daniel Webster, speaking \n     at the dedication of the Bunker Hill Monument: ``And now let \n     us indulge an honest exultation in the conviction of the \n     benefit which the example of our country has produced and is \n     likely to produce on\n\n[[Page S9731]]\n\n     human freedom and happiness. And let us endeavor to \n     comprehend in all its magnitude and to feel in all its \n     importance the part assigned to us in the great drama of \n     human affairs.''\n\n Remarks by Gen. Joseph Ralston, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n Staff on the 50th Anniversary of the Department of Defense, September \n                                17, 1997\n\n       Secretary Cohen, Former Secretaries Weinberger, Carlucci, \n     and Perry, Members of Congress, Gen. Jones, distinguished \n     guests, ladies and gentlemen:\n       I am very proud to be here as the representative of the \n     more than 3 million people currently serving in the defense \n     of our nation as soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, coast \n     guardsmen--active duty, National Guard, Reserve, and \n     civilians. It is an honor to be a part of this splendid \n     anniversary; a celebration to commemorate fifty years of \n     unwavering leadership to our armed forces.\n       Take a moment and put yourself back in time. Fifty years \n     ago we had just won a world war and the country was still \n     celebrating its victory. The might of the military machine \n     was not broken, at least the American public didn't think so.\n       But we learned many lessons the hard way during that war \n     and the leaders who fought that war knew we could and should \n     do better.\n       These visionaries understood that to stand still would put \n     the United States back where we were before the war . . . as \n     isolationists.\n       Imagine if you can, the resistance these men faced as they \n     attempted to reorganize our armed forces . . . a force that \n     only a year prior had defeated a deranged dictator and an \n     imperial army and navy.\n       These leaders, both civilian and military, realized the \n     daunting task before them, but charged forward, amid intense \n     debate, and agreed upon a ``unification'' course.\n       Although the reforms in 1947 were immense, ten years later \n     the leaders of our country recognized the requirement for a \n     course correction.\n       The Act of 1958, spearheaded by President Eisenhower, \n     provided that course correction and called for the \n     organization of all combat forces into unified commands and \n     as he stated, ``singly led and prepared to fight as one, \n     regardless of Service.''\n       With this new guidance our armed forces marched on for over \n     25 years. However, in 1986 a significant change occurred with \n     the enactment of the Goldwater-Nichols Act. It not only \n     reinforced our joint warfighting doctrine, but it also \n     strengthened the civilian authority in the Department and \n     increased the responsibility and authority of the Chairman. \n     Today we have an armed force that is the envy of every nation \n     on this Earth--and the pride of Americans.\n       Make no mistake . . . it is the magnificent men and women \n     in uniform who make the sacrifices, who walk the jungles, fly \n     over the deserts, sail on and under the seas, that provide \n     the peace, freedom, and stability we enjoy as a Nation today.\n       But we must resist the temptation to relax and believe we \n     have it just right. We must fight the complacency. We have \n     much left to do as we revolutionize the way we do business, \n     as we make the hard choices that will always put the needs of \n     America's sons and daughters first.\n       Today I proudly salute the men and women of the Department \n     of Defense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9730-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN RECOGNITION OF HARRY BELL\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of \nHarry Bell, a man well known to the people of South Carolina. We salute \nhim as he retires in December as president of the South Carolina Farm \nBureau Federation.\n  Harry Bell is known throughout the State as a successful farmer. With \nhis son, William, he operates a productive, 1,450 acre farm in Saluda \nCounty, on which he raises cattle and plants soybeans, cotton, small \ngrains, and strawberries. But Harry Bell's activities extend far beyond \nfarming. He also is a savvy and successful businessman, with a long \ncareer in banking and insurance.\n  In fact, he began his business career as a bank clerk, currently \nserves on the local board of First Citizens' Bank, and has been \npresident of the Palmetto Casualty Insurance Co. and director of the \nRidge Banking Co.\n  But it is for his work with South Carolina farmers that Harry Bell is \nbest known. He has served as president of the South Carolina Farm \nBureau since 1971; in that time, he helped South Carolina farmers \nweather droughts, high interest rates, and the increasingly \noverwhelming competition of large-scale commercial farms. During his \ntenure as president, Harry helped preserve the State's heritage of \nfamily-owned farms, while at the same time assisting farmers to \nmechanize and modernize their operations. It is partly as a result of \nhis efforts that agriculture remains a key component of South \nCarolina's economy.\n  Harry Bell's involvement with agriculture has not been confined to \nthe South Carolina Farm Bureau Federation. He also was president of the \nSaluda County Farm Bureau Federation for 4 years, and was vice \npresident of the American Farm Bureau Federation from 1986-94. From \n1967-85, he was the farm representative on the South Carolina Water \nResources Commission.\n  Fortunately for us, Harry Bell has employed his prodigious talents \nand energies not just in the service of the farming community, but of \nthe whole community. He must have filled his every waking moment with \npublic service of one kind or another.\n  He is active in his church, Johnston Presbyterian, having served as \nan elder and former deacon. He responded to another kind of call when \nhis country summoned him to fight, serving on active duty in the U.S. \nAir Force from 1945-47 and from 1951-53. Additionally, he served in the \nAir Force Reserves until 1974, when he retired with the rank of \nlieutenant colonel.\n  Harry Bell exemplifies the ideal of public service. His career has \ncombined devotion to God, country, and community. Thanks to his \nstewardship, South Carolina farmers can look forward to many future \nharvests. It has been my good fortune to work with Harry Bell for over \n20 years on important issues affecting the farmers and economy of our \nState. We in South Carolina are proud to call him our own, and I am \nhonored to salute him today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9731-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9731-S9732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  1998\n\n\n                Outer Continental Shelf Leasing Program\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to rise today, \nwith my colleague, Senator John Breaux, to engage in a colloquy about a \nserious matter that has only recently come to our attention.\n  Mr. GORTON. I yield the floor for your colloquy.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if these concerns are not addressed, \none of our country's most successful programs, the Outer Continental \nShelf Leasing Program, may be jeopardized. Under that program, the \nFederal Government has raised hundreds of millions of dollars in rents \nand royalties over the last 25 years, while at the same time developing \nsafe and secure sources of energy for our country. Crucial to the \nsuccess of that program is the ability of the private sector to conduct \nexploration of the Gulf of Mexico before submitting bids on the tracts \noffered for oil and gas leases.\n  I recently learned that the Minerals Management Service [MMS] has \nproposed changes to the rules under which that exploration is \nconducted. These changes would potentially jeopardize the continuity \nand success of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act [OCSLA] program.\n  Currently, geological and geophysical companies [G companies] \nconduct seismic surveys under MMS permits which require the permittees \nto provide the data they collect to the MMS under strict guarantees of \nconfidentiality.\n  The G companies then provide the oil companies access to the data \nthrough nonexclusive licenses. The licenses allow the oil companies to \nuse the data for any purpose including re-processing the data using \ntheir own technology and data. These licenses are given on the \ncondition that the licensee will not show or share the data with anyone \nelse. In this way, the G companies are able to offer data to the \nlargest number of possible users at the lowest cost.\n  Under the proposed regulations, MMS intends to extend its ability to \nobtain data from just the G companies to all of the companies who \nhave licensed and reprocessed that data using their own technology. By \nrequiring all industry to share reprocessed data with the MMS, the \nthreat of disclosure of extremely sensitive business data exists. Under \nany number of situations, including appeal of fair market values, it is \nunclear if the proposed changes would protect the confidentiality of \nthat data. This threat to sensitive business data could ultimately \nthreaten the success of the OCS leasing program.\n  I understand and appreciate the need for MMS to have accurate data. \nHowever, I question the need of the Government to obtain reprocessed \ndata that\n\n[[Page S9732]]\n\nbelongs to the business community especially if it could potentially be \nreleased to competitor companies.\n  It is my understanding that my colleague, Senator Breaux was an \nauthor of the original OCSLA. Do you believe the MMS' proposed \nregulations accurately reflect the purpose of that legislation?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, as one of the original authors of the \nOuter Continental Shelf Lands Act, I can advise the Senate that we \nspent a great deal of time and effort in developing a law that would \nresult in the information, data, and interpretation remaining \nconfidential. Any steps that would put that confidentiality at risk are \ncontrary to the spirit and intent of what we were trying to accomplish \nin 1972.\n  At that time, geophysical contractors were particularly concerned \nabout the data sharing and confidentiality provisions of the OCSLA \nbecause they felt any breach of that confidentiality would destroy the \nmarket for the data, which is the geophysical contractors' sole asset. \nTo protect that confidentiality, provisions were adopted requiring MMS \nto make sure the agency obtained permission from the permittee and \nanyone to whom the permittee sold the data under promise of \nconfidentiality before sharing any data obtained from the permittee \nwith a State government.\n  Shortly after the amendment of the OCSLA, MMS promulgated regulations \nspelling out the mechanics of how data was to be made available to it \nand how it was to be protected once it had been turned over. Among \nthose rules is one that mandates that the permittee, who had agreed to \nmake its geophysical data available to MMS as a condition of the \npermit, require any party to whom the data is transferred to agree to \nthe terms of the permit regarding data sharing as a condition of the \ntransfer. Industry contends that when that regulation was proposed, MMS \nproposed to define the term ``transfer'' in a way that included \nnonexclusive licensees, but dropped that requirement from the final \nrule. Industry believes that MMS has now proposed to extend its data \nsharing requirements to nonexclusive licensees and to amend its \nregulations in several other significant ways.\n  MMS contends that, in the 25-year span of its statutory \nresponsibility to hold geophysical data confidential, this \nconfidentiality has never been breached. And, MMS believes its current \nrulemaking is fully consistent with its authority under the OCSLA. In \nother words, MMS is going forward with its rulemaking without further \npublic input.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I share your concerns regarding the intent of the \noriginal OCSLA and the effect of the MMS' actions.\n  MMS is threatening to implement regulations without adequate \ndiscussions between the agency, industry, and the original authors of \nthe OCSLA. By utilizing a negotiated rulemaking, we have a unique \nopportunity to avoid the problems that MMS' current course of action \nwill create. There are many stakeholders in this debate that have valid \nconcerns which deserve to be addressed. The exploration contractors, \nthe oil and gas companies and the MMS all have a lot to lose by pushing \nthrough regulations that will cause more problems than they will fix.\n  Each of the stakeholders can make significant contributions to a set \nof regulations that will accomplish the goals of the OCSLA, the MMS and \nthe industry. I am frankly at a loss to understand why MMS has refused \nto engage in substantive negotiations on these issues when it is clear \nthat substantive concerns remain unaddressed.\n  The notice and comment rulemaking that surrounded this proposed rule \nwas insufficient. Significant disagreements continue to exist where \nsolutions seem eminently reachable. It makes sense to get the \ninterested parties together to see if they can find a mutually \nagreeable solution. I strongly urge MMS to abandon the current \nrulemaking proceeding and to negotiate immediately with the affected \nparties to avoid placing the OCS lease program in jeopardy.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am very concerned about the tenor of \nthese proceedings. MMS is the Federal agency charged with the \nresponsibility to manage the mineral resources of the Outer Continental \nShelf in an environmentally sound and safe manner and to timely \ncollect, verify, and distribute mineral revenues from Federal and \nIndian lands. So, I want to know that this proposal is the best way to \nget at the objective that underlies it--a fair and reliable royalty \nsystem. But, I also want to ensure that the individuals and businesses \naffected by the MMS proposal are accorded every opportunity to have \ntheir concerns heard.\n  I agree that MMS needs access to G information to discharge its \nimportant duties. But, it ought to accomplish that duty in a way that \ndoes not risk disrupting one of the Federal Government's most \nsuccessful revenue programs. The G industry estimates that the \nproposed regulations will, if adopted, require the renegotiation of \nthousands of existing license agreements and, until that renegotiation \nis complete, no data can be licensed. This renegotiation process may \ntake several months, if not years. During that time, there will be no \nexploration. Thus, the process that recently led to another record oil \nand gas lease sale on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf, \nproviding needed revenue to the Federal Treasury, will come to a \ngrinding halt. This is an interruption we cannot afford.\n  For 50 years, oil and natural gas have been produced from the Outer \nContinental Shelf [OCS] underlying the Gulf of Mexico. This production \nrepresents more than 83 percent of total OCS oil production and more \nthan 99 percent of all OCS natural gas production. In 1995, production \nfrom this area accounted for 15 percent of all oil produced in the \nUnited States and about a quarter of the natural gas.\n  Maintaining public trust in our royalty system is critical to the \nfuture of oil and gas leasing, both onshore and offshore. Federal \nroyalty policy must balance the need to encourage public resource \ndevelopment with the need to ensure that the public gets its fair \nroyalty share. That balancing act requires government and industry to \nwork together. The OCS leasing program is one example of government and \nthe private sector working together--reflected by the recent record \nleases, records bonus payments and increased exploration in the Gulf of \nMexico.\n  I hope we can advance that partnership here. Let's take another \nopportunity to learn from each other what is working, what is not \nworking under the current system--and how the MMS proposal addresses \nthose problems. Then, we can move forward with a balanced policy that \nassures timely and accurate royalty payments for the people of the \nUnited States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9731-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9732-S9733]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRADE NEGOTIATING AUTHORITY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the \nadministration's request for new trade negotiating authority.\n  Now, any discussion of trade policy should begin not with talk about \nnew agreements. It should begin with a review of the basic facts, and \nof what we need to change in the international trade system to create \njobs, raise wages, guarantee fairness, and create opportunities for \nAmericans.\n\n\n                            THE BASIC FACTS\n\n  So let's first look at the facts. We are enjoying what will soon be \nthe longest period of economic growth in our history. Since 1992, our \neconomy has grown from $6.5 to $8 trillion dollars. Inflation has \nfallen to 2 percent. We have added a net gain of more than 12 million \njobs. And while from 1986 to 1993 real wages fell every year, since \n1994 real wages have risen every year.\n  A lot of things go into that record. Research and development by \ncompanies and the Government. Deficit reduction from $290 billion in \n1992 to $36 billion before the recent budget agreement. Improved \ncompetitiveness. Most of all, hard work and sacrifice by ordinary \npeople.\n  But our trade policy in the past 4 years deserves some credit as \nwell. Since 1993, Ambassador Mickey Kantor and now Ambassador \nBarshefsky, along with their staffs, have worked very hard, stood up \nfor our workers and farmers, and achieved a great deal. And the result \nhas been a nearly 50 percent jump in exports, from just over $600 \nbillion in 1992 to nearly $900 billion this year.\n\n\n                           FAR FROM FINISHED\n\n  That is a good record. But the work is far from finished.\n\n[[Page S9733]]\n\n  Foreign countries routinely discriminate against our farm products. \nWe can do more in high technology, where our telecommunications, \ncomputer hardware, and software firms are tremendously competitive. \nSubsidies and state trading companies in foreign countries distort \ntrade tremendously. And our trade deficit remains unacceptably high. So \nwe need to keep working to fix these things.\n\n\n                     NEED FOR NEGOTIATING AUTHORITY\n\n  And the administration needs trade negotiating authority to do it. \nGranting negotiating authority--I do not call it ``fast track,'' \nbecause there is nothing fast about it--is a big step for Congress, but \nit is the right step. The fact is, big trade agreements are like base \nclosing agreements. The best possible trade agreement will ask many \ndifferent interests to give up a tariff, subsidy or other form of \nprotection in exchange for an agreement that will help the entire \ncountry.\n  So I believe the Senate should approve a trade negotiating authority \nbill. And the one proposed yesterday by the administration is, I \nbelieve, a good start. It sets five general trade policy objectives: \nincreasing market access; reducing barriers to trade; strengthening \ninternational trade rules; fostering economic growth and full \nemployment; and addressing labor, environmental and other areas \ndirectly related to trade.\n  More specifically, the draft sets the following priorities: reducing \ntariff and non-tariff barriers; opening markets to services; protecting \nintellectual property; ensuring more transparency in international \ndispute settlement, which is extremely important to me; winning fairer \ninvestment rules, so countries no longer can force technology transfer \nor impose export requirements; and opening markets in agriculture. I am \nespecially pleased by the inclusion of a specific negotiating objective \nof opening foreign markets to American farm products. The bill devotes \nappropriate attention to the problems we have with state trading \nenterprises like the boards which control grain trade in many of our \ntrade competitors.\n  Finally, promoting internationally recognized labor standards and \nenvironmentally sustainable development.\n\n\n                       LABOR AND THE ENVIRONMENT\n\n  Let me talk briefly about this last issue. This has become a source \nof controversy for reasons that I don't quite understand.\n  Since 1947 we have concluded five rounds of GATT. More recently, we \nhave passed three so-called free trade agreements, the Information \nTechnology Agreement, the Agreement on Basic Telecommunications and \nhundreds of other sectoral and bilateral agreements on trade issues. As \na result, tariffs are lower, quotas have shrunk in number and scope, \nand other formal trade barriers have diminished.\n  As these agreements go into effect, we quite logically find that \nother policies--intellectual property enforcement, antitrust policy, \nsubsidies, rule of law, transparency, technical standards, Government \nprocurement, labor regulations, and environmental law enforcement all \nhave some impact on trade.\n  Our trade policy should deal with these issues, and it does. \nIntellectual property is a top priority, as well it should be. \nGovernment procurement and subsidies are as well. To rule out labor and \nenvironmental standards is simply to make an arbitrary, ideological \njudgment that these are almost the only forms of policy whose trade \neffects we will refuse to recognize.\n  That does not mean treating them the same in all trade agreements. \nThe trade agreement with Mexico, for example, was a unique case. There \nwe negotiated an agreement with a developing country, with which we \nshared a long border and in which we had existing experience with a \nfree trade arrangement--the maquiladora program--which had created very \nobvious and serious labor and environmental problems. So in my opinion, \nthat agreement required pretty strict labor and environmental side \nagreements.\n  That is not necessarily true in all other agreements. We should look \nthem over case by case. Some very important agreements authorized by \nthis negotiating authority bill--for example, agreements on services, \nintellectual property and state trading companies in agriculture--\nprobably don't require labor and environmental provisions at all. But \nit is simply wrong and unfair to American workers and companies to say \nthat we should never consider these issues. And I believe that on the \nwhole, the administration proposal strikes a reasonable balance by \ncalling for negotiations on labor and environmental issues directly \nrelated to trade.\n\n\n                     IMPROVING EXISTING AGREEMENTS\n\n  In one area, however, I think the proposal needs some additions.\n  That is, I consider it at least as important to enforce and improve \nexisting trade agreements as to negotiate new ones. We now have a wide \nand complex web of agreements. Some work well. Others do not. Still \nothers are bad agreements that ought to be improved or redone.\n  Let me offer an example. Ambassador Barshefsky recently scored a \nmajor success by opening Canada's market to our barley. That is a very \ngood thing; but it also shows that NAFTA and the United States-Canada \nFree Trade Agreement are not perfect. They can be improved, and they \nshould be. Likewise, the Uruguay round should have eliminated Japan's \ntariffs on wood products, but did not.\n  Thus I think we should also include language that reflects the \nimportance of enforcing existing agreements and improving the ones we \nalready have. And I hope to work with the administration to include \nsuch language.\n\n\n                NEGOTIATING AUTHORITY VERSUS AGREEMENTS\n\n  Finally, we should not confuse negotiating authority with actual \nagreements. By passing trade negotiating authority, we do not sign \nblank checks. I expect that the Congress and the public will be fully \nconsulted as we decide which agreements to pursue,; and then as we \nnegotiate those agreements. And we have the right to disapprove trade \nagreements that do not meet the standards they should. So by endorsing \nnew negotiating authority, I do not promise support for any particular \nagreement.\n  To sum up, the country needs a tough and aggressive trade policy in \nthe years to come. And the President needs negotiating authority for \nthat policy. I support the effort and I hope the Senate will do so as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9732-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9733-S9734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1221\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I join with Senator Inouye in \nexpressing strong opposition to the amendment. Just a few months ago, \nSenator Inouye and I introduced a bill to amend the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act of 1987. The Indian Affairs Committee, which has \njurisdiction over matters involving native Americans, has scheduled the \nfirst hearing on this bill on October 8, 1997. This hearing has been on \nthe schedule for over a month. This is the normal and proper procedure \nfor making policy with respect to native American issues.\n  If I had been able to be on the floor, I would have fought against \nand voted against this amendment. In its modified form, as it was \nfinally adopted by voice vote, the amendment does not affect any \nprocess or procedure that currently exists into law or in regulation. \nHowever, it does represent an unwarranted interference into the \ndevelopment of reasonable and appropriate approaches to the \nauthorization and regulation of Indian gaming that have not been \nconsidered or approved by the Indian Affairs Committee, the \nadministration, or, more importantly, the tribes.\n  The amendment, even as modified, represents an ill-advised action of \nthe Congress to influence the future of Indian gaming. The mere fact of \noffering this type of amendment, which seeks to micromanage the \nregulation of Indian gaming, will have the effect of prejudicing the \noutcome of the Indian Affairs' Committee hearings on IGRA amendment.\n  The proponents of this amendment are seeking to override a carefully \nbalanced procedure in the Congress. They are seeking to throw up new \nobstacles to prevent tribes from engaging in gaming and to disrupt \nongoing negotiations between States and tribes who are cooperating in \ndeveloping Indian gaming compacts.\n  The IGRA was carefully crafted to take into account the differences \namong the several States. IGRA is not perfect, and that is why Senator \nInouye and I introduced amendments to the bill. The Enzi amendment is \npremature. The Senate Committee on Indian Affairs hearing is the proper\n\n[[Page S9734]]\n\nforum to discuss these issues and for opponents of Indian gaming to \nexpress their concerns.\n  Mr. President, I join with my colleagues on the Indian Affairs \nCommittee in urging the conferees on the Interior appropriations bill \nto eliminate this provision from the final conference agreement. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9733-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IN HONOR OF JUDGE LAWRENCE H.

During his 8 years \non the committee he provided wise counsel in helping me select \ncandidates for Federal judgeships to be nominated by the President. \nWhile not necessarily the most glamorous part of being a Senator, \nselecting individuals for nomination to a Federal judgeship is one of \nour most important responsibilities. Long after a Senator has left the \nbody, the judges whom he/she helped select may remain on the bench for \nmany more years to come with life tenure. Judge Cooke provided \ninvaluable assistance to me in this endeavor and I am pleased to say \nthat he is now lending his talents to New York Governor George Pataki \nby serving on the Governor's judicial screening committee for State \njudgeships.\n  When I travel around New York State, one of the things I like to do \nif I have a couple of free minutes is to visit the local county \ncourthouse. In most places, the courthouse is a grand and beautiful old \nbuilding, and the courthouse in Sullivan County is no exception. \nSullivan County was founded in 1809 and the current courthouse is \nactually the third it has had. The original burned down in 1844 and the \nsecond was replaced by the current structure in 1909. The newly named \nCooke Courthouse is an Ohio sandstone building which was designed by \nWilliam Beardsley of Poughkeepsie and built by the Kingston firm of \nCampbell and Dempsey for $143,000. In 1979 the building underwent a \nmajor renovation. It is a beautiful and historic building well \nbefitting of Judge Cooke's name.\n  Mr. President, 1997 marks the sesquicentennial of the New York State \nCourt of Appeals. With the exception of the U.S. Supreme Court, this \ncourt is perhaps the most important court in our Nation's legal \nhistory. One of the greatest jurists of the 20th century, Benjamin \nCardozo, was a chief judge of this court before being nominated by \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt to the Supreme Court. Even today, every \nlaw student must read several of Judge Cardozo's opinions as part of a \nlegal education and his opinion in Palsgraff versus Long Island \nRailroad is still the seminal case on proximate cause in torts. The \ncurrent chief judge, Judith Kaye, is nationally recognized as a leader \nin judicial reform, especially in the area of jury selection. It is a \nproud and important tradition with which Judge Cooke is associated, and \nhe certainly is an important part of that tradition.\n  On this special day on which we honor Judge Cooke, I want to wish the \nJudge and his wife Alice the best and thank him for his many years of \nservice to me, to Sullivan County, to New York State, and to our \njustice system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9734-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9734]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NORTH ATLANTIC FISHERIES RESOURCE CONSERVATION ACT\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

Mr. President, Friday, September \n19, 1997, has been designated this year by President Clinton and \nnumerous State Governors as National POW/MIA Recognition Day. This is a \nspecial day for paying tribute to our missing service members and \ncivilians involved with our Nation's past military conflicts. It is a \nday for reaffirming throughout the United States our national \ncommitment to obtaining the fullest possible accounting for America's \nPOW's and MIA's.\n  It has been an honor and privilege for me, since my election to the \nCongress in 1984, to assist the POW/MIA families, our veterans, and \ntheir friends and supporters, with the many efforts that have been \nundertaken to try to achieve a proper accounting for so many of our \nNation's bravest heroes still listed as missing. It has been a \ndifficult and emotional task, complicated by on and off-again \ncooperation by foreign governments.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I served as vice-chairman of the \nSenate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs in 1992, and I currently \nserve as the U.S. chairman of the Vietnam War Working Group of the \nJoint United States-Russian Commission on POW's and MIA's. This past \nsummer, I, along with Congressman Sam Johnson of Texas, himself a \nreturned POW from North Vietnam, traveled to Russia, Poland, and the \nCzech Republic in our continuing efforts to open archives and interview \npeople knowledgeable about the fate of American POW's. We both feel, as \na result of our trip, that we have enhanced our Government's ability to \nfurther investigate POW/MIA leads. I have also continued my own efforts \nhere in the Senate to ensure that U.S. Government records on this issue \nare declassified and made available to the public. I am pleased to \nreport that I am making additional progress in that regard, \nspecifically with respect to information from the Nixon administration \nthat I hope will shed more\n\n[[Page S9735]]\n\nlight on our own Government's knowledge about POW's and MIA's when the \nVietnam war ended in 1973.\n  As a result of my direct involvement with this issue, I can report \nthat, even though we have made some progress over the years, there is \nstill much work to do. It is, therefore, my hope that this \nadministration will take the opportunity National POW/MIA Recognition \nDay provides to rededicate itself to using all appropriate resources \navailable to the U.S. Government to resolve the POW/MIA issue.\n  I personally believe that public awareness is critical to ensuring \nthat the United States vigorously presses Communist governments abroad, \nespecially North Korea, China, Vietnam, and Laos, to give us the \ncomplete answers that we deserve on this humanitarian issue. Indeed, \nthe support of the public has enabled us to continue to push forward \nwith legislative initiatives in Congress that can help to ensure the \nPOW/MIA issue is pursued as a top priority with the governments I just \nreferenced.\n  I want to assure my own constituents and the many concerned Americans \nwho have contacted me through the years that I remain absolutely \ncommitted to doing everything I think is appropriate to resolve the \nfate of our missing soldiers.\n  Mr. President, I thank the American people for remembering our \nunaccounted for POW's and MIA's on this special day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/19/senate-section/article/S9734-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "19", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
