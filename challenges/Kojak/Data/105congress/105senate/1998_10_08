Mr. President, the Senate will be in a period of morning \nbusiness until 10 a.m. Following morning business, under a previous \norder, the Senate will begin 1 hour of final debate on the conference \nreport to accompany the VA-HUD appropriations bill. At the expiration \nof debate time, at approximately 11 a.m., the Senate will vote on \nadoption of that conference report. Following that vote, the Senate may \nresume consideration of the Internet tax bill. I believe we are about \nready to complete action on that. We have been saying that for a week, \nbut I think that the opposition really is minimal. When we finally get \nto a vote, it is going to be overwhelming. I hope those obstructing and \ndelaying the bill will give it up and let us get to the final passage \nof this important legislation before we leave. I understand there is \none outstanding issue remaining on that legislation. Hopefully, it can \nbe resolved by the managers early this afternoon.\n  In addition to the Internet bill, the Senate may consider the \nintelligence reauthorization bill, the human services reauthorization \nbill, under a 30-minute time agreement, and, possibly, the Treasury-\nPostal Service appropriations bill. The Senate may also begin\n\n[[Page S11832]]\n\nconsideration of the William Fletcher nomination under the previously \nagreed to 90-minute time agreement.\n  At 5 p.m., under a previous order, the Senate is scheduled to resume \nconsideration of H.R. 10, the financial services reform bill, unless \nanother agreement is reached. I hope we can also come to some \ncompromise agreement on that legislation so we can get it completed. It \nis very important domestically and, as a matter of fact, for our \nability to compete in international markets. Members should expect \nrollcall votes throughout the day and into the evening.\n  There are a number of meetings going on to resolve issues between the \nHouse and the Senate and the administration. I think a lot of good \nprogress has been made in the last 24 hours. I felt like the dam sort \nof broke yesterday. We have the bankruptcy reform legislation \nconference report being finished now. The vocational education \nconference report was completed last night. That was the first time we \nhad a vocational reauthorization in years, and certainly we need to \nfocus on vocational education. That, coupled with the higher education \nbill that was signed into law 2 days ago, will begin to show that we \nare committed to working continuously to improve education for our \nchildren and for the families of this country in the future.\n\n  We are in a position where we are about in final agreement on the \nWIPO bill, the intellectual property issue, and music licensing.\n  A number of bills are coming to a conclusion. As soon as conference \nreports are available, particularly appropriations bills, they will be \nstuck right into the schedule, and hopefully a quick vote. We will then \nmove with other conference reports. We hope to be able to move some \nExecutive Calendar nominations. But that also will take a lot of \ncooperation.\n  I thank the Senators for their assistance at this critical hour.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11831-6", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last evening, President Clinton did the \nright thing, did the right thing for this country and did the right \nthing for our farmers and for people who live all across rural America. \nHe did the right thing for farmers who are suffering because of a \ndrastic drop in prices. He did the right thing for farmers who are \nsuffering because of a loss of crop in disaster areas in the South and \nUpper Midwest. The President did the right thing by vetoing the \nwoefully inadequate farm disaster bill that this Congress passed and \nsent to him for his signature. Now it is up to us to see what we can do \nto make that bill better and get it back to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Rural America needs help. Farmers need assistance. Disaster-hit areas \nneed help. And yet they do not need the woefully inadequate bill that \nwas passed here. I likened the bill that was passed by the Congress as \ngiving a thimbleful of water to a person dying of thirst. It may \nassuage their thirst momentarily, but it is not going to keep them \nalive. We need to give those farmers who are dying of thirst out there \nthe adequate water they need to get them through this year and the next \nto keep them alive.\n  Mr. President, I was encouraged by what I read in Congress Daily, \nthat the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Congressman \nLivingston, has said that they expected a veto and that after the veto \ncomes negotiations. I do not have the exact quote, but that is about \nwhat he said. I think that gives us some hope that we can work together \nhere, we can negotiate out some differences, and we can come up with a \nbill that the President will sign and that will, indeed, benefit our \nproducers.\n  There are some principles that we must maintain, however. First of \nall, there must be adequate disaster assistance. There needs to be \nequitable treatment regionally both within the distribution of the \ndisaster assistance and within the overall package of disaster-related, \ncommodity-based assistance. That means it has to be equitable, and it \nhas to be adequate. It does not necessarily mean the dollars have to be \nspread around evenly. Equitable treatment is the key for farmers who \nhave suffered from natural disasters.\n  A second principle is that assistance must go to producers who need \nit. Assistance based on low commodity prices should be delivered to \nproducers suffering from low commodity prices. That is the advantage of \nthe marketing loan proposal that those on our side have advocated. The \nproposal just to add on some money to this so-called AMTA payment has \nno relationship to the level of commodity prices. And not all commodity \nprices are depressed equally or substantially, particularly in cotton \nand rice. So assistance must have some relation to market conditions.\n  I always wonder what it is about some of my friends on the other \nside. They always talk about the market, the market, the market, yet \nthe direct payment that goes out to farmers has no relationship to the \nmarket.\n  Removing the loan rate caps, as we want to do, does have a \nrelationship to the market. If the market price goes up, the exposure \nto the Government is less and farmers will get their money from the \nmarket and not from the Government. Just giving out a direct payment \nhas no relationship to the market whatsoever.\n  I think a third principle that we must have in any negotiated \nsettlement is assistance to actual producers. Lump cash payments in a \nfixed amount are less likely to remain in the hands of the actual \nfarmer than is assistance provided in a way that is contingent on \nmarket conditions. The additional AMTA payment that is in the vetoed \nbill is readily identified by landlords who are in a strong position to \ncapture the payment in land rental rates. That is why raising the \nmarketing loans, raising those caps will get to the producers.\n  Another principle. We must restore the safety net. Farmers are in \ntheir current predicament in large measure because the safety net \nfeature of previous farm bills was abandoned in the 1996 farm bill. A \nset cash payment does nothing to restore the safety net because it is \nnot responsive to market conditions. By contrast, removing loan rate \ncaps would help restore a safety net responsive to market conditions.\n  Two last and final principles. Some linkage to actual production. The \nmarketing assistance loan is tied directly to actual production. The \nRepublican plan in the vetoed bill would have provided an additional \nmoney windfall even though no crop had been produced on the land. Why \nwould we want to do that? Let's have assistance out to farmers who \nactually produced a crop.\n  And last, let's have a major measure of fiscal responsibility. This \nidea of just throwing out another payment to farmers is not fiscally \nresponsible. If commodity prices should rise next year, which we all \nhope will happen, our plan would cost less than expected. But if the \ncommodity prices rise next year, after the Republican plan payment went \nout, we would not recapture any of that money. It would be gone. That \nis why raising the marketing loan caps is, indeed, more fiscally \nresponsible than just giving out a payment.\n  Mr. President, I believe within those principles there is room for \nnegotiation. I look forward to the negotiations. I hope we can very \nrapidly come up with a bill that will meet these principles and that \nthe President will sign into law, because our farmers need the \nassistance, and the disaster areas also need that assistance.\n  I will yield the floor.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11832-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11833]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S11833]]\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Chair lays before the Senate \nthe VA-HUD conference report. There are 60 minutes for debate to be \nequally divided.\n  The report will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     4194), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 5, 1998.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield to my distinguished colleague from Maryland for a \nrequest.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during \nconsideration of the report 105-769, that Ms. Bertha Lopez, a detailee \nfrom HUD serving with the VA-HUD committee, be afforded floor \nprivileges.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you. I yield the floor and look forward to \nproceeding on our conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The Senator from Missouri is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank our distinguished ranking member, Senator Mikulski. \nBefore I get into the bill, let me say Senator Mikulski and her staff \nhave given us tremendous cooperation, guidance and support. The process \nis always very difficult in this bill, but it runs much more smoothly \nbecause of her leadership, her guidance, and her deep concern for all \nof the programs covered.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to present to the Senate the conference \nreport on the fiscal year 1999 VA-HUD and independent agencies \nappropriations bill. The conference report provides $93.4 billion, \nincluding $23.3 billion in mandatory veterans' benefits. I believe this \nrepresents a fair and balanced approach to meeting the many compelling \nneeds that are afforded this subcommittee, particularly in the face of \na very tight budget allocation.\n  The conference report accords the highest priority to veterans' \nneeds, providing $439 million more than the President's request for \nveterans' programs. Other priorities include elderly housing, \nprotecting environmental spending, and ensuring sufficient funding for \nspace and science.\n  We did our best to satisfy priorities of Senators who made special \nrequests for such items as economic development grants, water \ninfrastructure improvements, and similar vitally important \ninfrastructure investments. Such requests numbered over 1,000 \nindividual items, illustrating the level of interest and the demand for \nassistance provided in this bill.\n  We also attempted to address the administration's top concerns \nwherever possible, including funding for 50,000 new incremental housing \nvouchers, funding for the National Service Program at the current year \nrate, additional funding for the cleanup of Boston Harbor, and $650 \nmillion in advance funding for Superfund, contingent upon authorization \nand reform of the Superfund Program by August 1, 1999.\n  For the Department of Veterans Affairs, the conference report \nprovides a total of $42.6 billion. This includes $17.306 billion for \nveterans medical care. That figure is $278 million more than the \nPresident's request, and $249 million more than the 1998 level. Thus, \nwe have increased by just about a quarter of a billion dollars the \namount of money going to veterans health care above what was available \nfor the past fiscal year. There was a strong consensus in this body, on \na bipartisan basis, that the President's request for veterans medical \ncare was inadequate, and that additional funds were needed to ensure \nthe highest quality care to all eligible veterans seeking care.\n  Funds above the President's request also provided for construction, \nresearch, State veterans nursing homes, and the processing of veterans \nclaims. I am confident these additional funds will be spent to honor \nand care for our Nation's veterans.\n  In HUD, the conference report provides for the Department of Housing \nand Urban Development a total of $26 billion. Again, this is $1 billion \nover the President's request. We were able to provide this significant \nincrease in funding because of additional savings from excess section 8 \nproject-based funds as well as savings from our reform of how HUD \nconducts its FHA property disposition program.\n  Because of these savings and reforms, we have been able to increase \nfunding for a number of important HUD programs, including increasing \ncritically needed funding for public housing modernization from $2.55 \nbillion to $3 billion; increasing HOPE VI to eliminate distressed \npublic housing from $550 million to $625 million; increasing the very \nimportant local government top priority, Community Development Block \nGrants from $4.675 billion to $4.750 billion.\n  We increased HOME funds, providing the flexibility for local \ngovernments to make improvements in providing needed housing for low-\nincome and needy residents, from $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, and we \nincreased funding for homeless assistance from $823 million to over $1 \nbillion, including requirements for HUD, recapturing and reprogramming \nunused homeless funds.\n  We also included $854 million for section 202 elderly housing, and \nsection 811 disabled housing. This is an increase of some $550 million \nover the President's request for the section 202 program.\n  This reflects the sense of this body, expressed in a resolution \njointly sponsored by my ranking member and myself, saying that we could \nnot afford an 80-percent cut in assistance for elderly housing as \nproposed by the Office of Management and Budget.\n  I want to be clear that these funding decisions for HUD do not \nreflect a vote of confidence for HUD. HUD remains a troubled agency \nwith significant capacity problems and dysfunctional decisionmaking. \nLet me remind my colleagues that HUD remains designated as a high-risk \narea by the General Accounting Office, the only department-wide agency \never so designated. I am not confident that HUD is making appropriate \nprogress. I also want to warn my colleagues that, while we have \nprovided the additional 50,000 welfare-to-work incremental vouchers \nthat the administration requested, HUD and we are fast approaching a \ntrain wreck. And the debris will be on our hands.\n  Let me call our colleagues' attention to this chart. It shows an \nexplosion. To be specific, in fiscal year 1997 we had to appropriate \n$3.6 billion in budget authority for the renewal of existing section 8 \nvouchers. These are the renewals for people who are now receiving \nsection 8 assistance. Because in prior years we had multiyear \nauthorizations, those authorizations are expiring, and just to maintain \nthe section 8 assistance we are providing we had to go up to $8.2 \nbillion this year. We will go up next year to $11.1 billion, the year \nafter $12.8 billion, and by 2004 we will have to find budget authority \nof $18.2 billion, just to maintain the section 8 certificates, the \nvouchers for assisted housing for those in need that we already \nprovide.\n  So, this is a budgetary problem of huge magnitude and it is something \nthat is coming. Unless we are to stop providing assistance for those \nwho need section 8, we are going to have to find in the budget room for \nthat much budget authority. I have asked HUD repeatedly, in hearings \nbefore our committee, to address this fiscal crisis. Yet HUD has \nrepeatedly failed to fulfill these responsibilities. This is something \nthis body and the House are going to have to work on next year and the \nyear after and the year after. The problem grows significantly more \nsevere as we move into the outyears.\n  The conference report, at the request of the House and the leaders of \nthe Housing Authorization Committee in\n\n[[Page S11834]]\n\nthe Senate--the distinguished chairman of that subcommittee, Senator \nMack, will be addressing this later--includes a public housing reform \nbill entitled the ``Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of \n1998.'' I congratulate the members of the authorizing committee for \nmaking significant and positive reforms to public and assisted housing \nprograms. I believe that, given the legislative calendar and the \nsituation, it was appropriate, with the advice, counsel and direction \nof the leadership, that we included it.\n  There are some issues I want to flag now because I think we may want \nto come back and readdress them, as we do in so many things that we \npass in the housing area in this body.\n  I am concerned that the requirements on targeting might adversely \nimpact the elderly poor. I am concerned about a provision that could \nallow HUD to micromanage housing choices of public housing families on \na building-by-building basis, and I don't agree with the provision that \nwould provide the HUD Secretary with a slush fund of some $110 million.\n  Most of my concerns, however, relate to provisions that will become \neffective in fiscal year 2000. I expect that we will continue to review \nthese areas and we will work, as we have in the past, in full \ncooperation with our distinguished colleagues on the authorizing \ncommittees in both the House and the Senate and discuss these further \nin future bills.\n  Finally, this appropriations bill provides a significant increase for \nFHA mortgage insurance. We raised the floor from $86,000 to $109,000 \nand the ceiling for high-cost areas from $170,000 to $197,000. This is \na critical provision. It means that families will have new and \nimportant opportunities to become homeowners.\n  With respect to the Environmental Protection Agency, the conference \nreport provides $7.650 billion for EPA. That is about $200 million more \nthan current year funding. Included in this is the President's full \nrequest for the clean water action plan which totals $150 million in \nnew funding, principally for State grants aimed at controlling polluted \nrunoff or nonpoint source pollution. The conference report also \nprovides $2.125 billion for State clean water and safe drinking water \nrevolving funds, an increase of $275 million over the President's \nrequest and $50 million over the current year.\n  Mr. President, I am very proud that we were able to provide this, \nbecause I think in every State, if you talk with the people who are \nactually doing the hard work of making sure that wastewater is cleaned \nup and that we have safe drinking water, they will tell you that these \nState revolving funds, which provide low-cost loans and enable \ncommunities to take vitally important steps necessary to ensure that \nthey clean up their wastewater and they have safe drinking water, they \nwill tell you that these State revolving funds are absolutely critical \nfor meeting the long-term needs of our communities.\n  Back to the rest of the bill, for Superfund, the conference report \nprovides $1.5 billion, the same as the current year funding. In \naddition, there is an advance appropriation of $650 million, contingent \nupon authorization by August 1, 1999.\n  Other high priorities in EPA, which we have funded, include \nparticulate matter research, funding for the brownfields at the full \nrequest level, providing to the States the tools they need to prevent \npollution, cleanup of waste sites and enforcing environmental laws. \nAlmost half of the funds provided in this bill will go directly to the \nStates for these purposes.\n  For FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, there is a total \nof $827 million, approximately the same amount as current year funding, \nwith emphasis on preparing for both natural and man-made disasters.\n  The conference report includes the President's request of $308 \nmillion for disaster relief spending. While there are not any \nadditional funds above the President's request for disaster relief, let \nme assure everyone that the current balances in the disaster relief \nfund are sufficient to meet all the needs at this time, including those \nstemming from Hurricane Georges, as well as the flooding that hit my \nState over the weekend and resulted in tragic deaths in the Kansas City \narea, as well as severe damage to homes and businesses.\n  We all appreciate the good work FEMA has done to help the victims \nstruggling to recover from recent devastation, whether it is \nhurricanes, floods or tornadoes. Our thoughts and prayers are with the \nmany people who suffered severe losses because of natural disasters.\n  In order to support efforts aimed at mitigating against future \ndisasters, the conference report provides $25 million for predisaster \nmitigation grants. These funds are intended to ensure communities will \nbe better prepared and that losses will be minimized when the next \ndisaster strikes. We hope these funds will be well spent to strengthen \nthe Nation's preparedness for natural disasters.\n  Finally, within FEMA, the conference agreement provides the full \nbudget amount requested by the administration in July for antiterrorism \nactivities. My ranking member and I believe this is vitally important \npreparation. It is something we need to be looking at in every area, \nand we are very proud to be able to provide this assistance for FEMA, \nbecause this is critical as part of an interagency effort aimed at \npreparing States and local governments for possible terrorists \nincidents.\n  For the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, the \nconference report provides a total of $13.665 billion. This is $200 \nmillion over the President's request, including $5.480 billion for the \ninternational space station and shuttle activities.\n  We remain very concerned over cost overruns, and the failure of the \nRussian Government to meet its obligations as a partner in the \ndevelopment and operation of the space station. As a result, this \nconference report includes requirements for NASA to address Russian \nnoncompliance and includes a provision addressing the need for NASA to \nexplore alternative ways of doing business with the Russians. Again, I \nthank my distinguished ranking member for her leadership on this issue.\n  For the National Science Foundation, the conference agreement \nprovides $3.6 billion for NSF. This is $242 million above the enacted \nlevel for the past year. Included in this is $50 million for the plant \ngenome program. Mapping the significant crop genomes is vitally \nimportant to the future of agriculture and to feeding our country and \nto feeding the hungry people of the world. This is an increase of $10 \nmillion over last year's level and the initial phases of what I believe \nwill be a significant scientific breakthrough.\n  Before I yield to my colleague from Maryland, I do want to take this \nopportunity to talk about a crisis that is wreaking havoc throughout \nour country. That crisis is in Medicare home health benefits. They are \nin severe jeopardy.\n  The Health Care Financing Administration implemented a home health \ninterim payment system, the IPS, which hits hundreds of home health \nagencies, many of which are small, freestanding providers, and has been \nforcing them out of business.\n  In Missouri alone where we had last year 230 home health care \nagencies, 50 agencies have already shut their doors entirely or have \nstopped accepting Medicare patients. One of them is the largest program \nin the State, the St. Louis Visiting Nurses Association, but many of \nthem are small businesses that provide vitally needed health care \nservices. It may be in rural areas or it may be in the inner cities, \nbut they are serving some of the most deserving, poor elderly and \ndisabled in our country.\n  The agencies that are being hit are those that serve the most complex \ncases, the ones with the most difficult challenges. Some parts of \nMissouri are losing their only source of home health care.\n  My hometown of Mexico, MO, has a small rural hospital. It is the \nAudrain Medical Center. We are very proud of it. But recently I \nreceived a letter from David Neuendorf, the medical center's chief \nfinancial officer, describing the difficulties they are facing. He \nstated the following:\n\n       In Mexico the HealthCor, Beacon of Hope, and Homecare \n     Connections agencies have closed. Other firms headquartered \n     elsewhere have closed their Mexico offices. People who need \n     home care in this area are simply not going to be able to get \n     it in the future. When\n\n[[Page S11835]]\n\n     they become sick enough they will end up in the hospital \n     where they will receive more expensive treatment.\n\n  Mr. President, in Missouri we have a well known phrase: ``Show me.'' \nMr. President, people in Missouri have shown me that the interim \npayment system is denying access to critical home health services. The \nIPS is the worst case of false economy I have ever seen. If the elderly \nand disabled cannot get care in the home, what is going to happen? They \neither will wind up in the emergency room very sick or they will go \ninto institutionalized care, going into expensive nursing homes or even \nhospitals, or the patients simply will not get care at all.\n  One agency chief officer who testified before the Small Business \nCommittee exemplifies the problem. She tells me she provides care to \nthe most complex cases, the most difficult ones to serve in a central \ncity area. And if this system and the proposed cuts go through, she \ncould go out of business, and of the 350 patients she has, almost half \nof them would have to go immediately into nursing homes.\n  This means that not only will Medicare costs rise, but there will be \nan explosion in State and Federal Medicaid budgets. We are going to \nhave to pay for these poor, elderly, and disabled who are very sick. If \nwe do not take care of them in the home health setting, we are going to \ntake care of them in less convenient, less comfortable ways for them \nbut far more expensive ways for us.\n  We must demand this insane, inequitable, and punitive system be \ncorrected before we adjourn. And there are many proposals floating \naround. I believe Members on both sides of the aisle of this body know \nstories about how serious this crisis is. Some of them provide needed \nrelief to home health agencies, those whom they serve. Some of them \nmerely add a few lifeboats to a sinking ship. But it is clear one \nimportant consideration is missing. It is imperative we restore access \nto home health care for medically complex patients, especially those in \ncenter cities and rural areas. We cannot just reshuffle the deck and \ncause losses to vulnerable patients.\n  Mr. President, I would have addressed this under the VA-HUD bill, \nunder the FEMA's emergency budget. Unfortunately, home health care does \nnot qualify for disaster relief. But let me assure my colleagues, that \nthe human disaster of failing to address this home health care problem \nis going to be as severe, if not more severe, than many of the tragic \nnatural disasters we address in FEMA.\n  Mr. President, to sum up, I am very proud of the work that we have \nbeen able to accomplish. I appreciate once again the work of my \ndistinguished colleague. I will recognize others who have worked on \nthis later, but now it is my pleasure to defer to the distinguished \nSenator from Maryland.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Mr. President.\n  I am really proud once again to come to the floor with my colleague, \nSenator Bond, to bring to the Senate's attention the 1999 VA-HUD \nconference report and urge that we move quickly to vote on and pass \nwhat I believe is a very solid report. This is a strong conference \nreport, and I believe it is one which will be signed by the President \nof the United States. And why? Because it meets the day-to-day needs of \nthe American people as well as the long-range needs of the United \nStates of America.\n  It provides a safety net for our seniors. It gets behind our kids. It \ninvests in science and technology and makes our world safer. It meets \ncompelling human needs and at the same time makes public investments in \nFederal Laboratories that will come up with the new ideas for the new \nproducts, for the new jobs, for the 21st century.\n  Let's talk about a safety net for seniors. We have often said to our \nveterans that we are a grateful nation for the sacrifice that they have \nmade in the wars, and many of them bear the permanent wounds of war. \nBut I believe the way a grateful nation expresses its gratitude is not \nwith words but with deeds. That is why I am so pleased that we are \nproviding in the VA medical care account $17.3 billion to meet that \nneed. This will ensure that our veterans will receive quality medical \ncare and that whenever they enter a VA hospital or an outpatient \nclinic, promises made will be promises kept.\n  At the same time, we provided $316 million for VA medical research. \nVA medical research is different from NIH research. Building on basic \nscience, it actually does research in hands-on ways to improve clinical \npractice--both in acute care as well as in prevention and home health \ncare. This means that this will focus on those diseases that ravage our \nveterans--like diabetes and like prostate cancer as well as the Gulf \nWar Syndrome.\n  In addition to what we have done for senior citizens in the veterans \nhealth care program, we also worked to make sure that there is a safety \nnet for seniors in our housing for the elderly. Misguided budget \ncutters sent a budget to us cutting housing for the elderly by a half a \nbillion dollars, and at the same time they wanted to convert those \nfunds to vouchers. On a bipartisan basis, Senator Bond and I said that \nwas absolutely unacceptable.\n  First of all, the Housing for Elderly Program is one of the most \npopular programs within HUD. And it is often run by nonprofit \norganizations, many of whom are faith-based, like Catholic Charities \nand Associated Jewish Charities in my own State, not only taking \ntaxpayers' dollars and adding housing for the elderly but value adding \nto that. That is why we restored that cut of a half-billion dollars, to \nmake sure that the funds are there.\n  We also rejected their approach to providing vouchers. Senator Bond \nand I really did not believe that an 80-year-old frail, elderly woman \nwith her walker should be walking up and down the streets of St. Louis, \nMO, or Baltimore, MD, or any of our communities, trying to get into an \napartment that might not meet the needs of the elderly, and certainly \nthe frail elderly.\n  So we got rid of the misguided budget cutting and also the poor \npolicy thinking that went into it. We are challenging HUD, however, to \ncome up with new thinking in their housing for the elderly to develop \nnew approaches for our seniors, and particularly those that are aging \nin place. There will be a demonstration project run by Catholic \nCharities just to do that.\n  At the same time, in this subcommittee, we showed our commitment to \nthe next generation in terms of our children. Within the National \nScience Foundation account, we have increased the funding for the \ntraining of science teachers as well as expanding the informal science \neducation programs to reach beyond the classroom to our children to \nencourage them to study math, science, and engineering.\n  Also, we have added assistance for the historically black colleges, \nas well as ones serving Hispanic institutions, to develop important \nlaboratory infrastructure so that they can modernize their facilities, \nso they can provide the best quality education available.\n  In addition to our educational efforts in terms of our children, we \nalso wanted to look out for their health. That is often in the Labor-\nHHS appropriation, but there is a secret here often in housing, in old \nhousing in slum neighborhoods, which is that they are loaded with lead. \nLead constitutes one of the biggest problems facing many of the \nchildren in my own hometown of Baltimore. And we have taken Federal \ndollars and increased the funding for our lead abatement \nprogram. Again, we have worked on a bipartisan basis.\n\n  Scientists and physicians at Johns Hopkins point out when a child \ncomes into Hopkins and his or her blood is loaded with lead, the very \nnature of detoxification is not only painful, but it often costs in the \nMedicaid budget thousands of dollars. The impact of lead not only can \nlead to death but severe impairment of intellectual ability. By getting \nthe lead out of our housing and getting the lead out of our \nbureaucracy, we will make sure we get the lead out of our children. We \nare very pleased to have been able to do that.\n  While we are looking now to the day-to-day needs of the American \npeople, we know we have to invest in science and technology. Again, \nSenator Bond and I believe that public investments in science and \ntechnology will lead to the new ideas, the new products and the new \njobs for the 21st century. That is why we have provided significant\n\n[[Page S11836]]\n\nfunding for critical science and research at the National Science \nFoundation and the National Space Agency. This legislation will provide \n$3.6 billion in the National Science Foundation account. This is an 8 \npercent overall increase in funding.\n  The NSF has peer review programs focusing on developing cutting-edge \nscience and technology. We want to, again, work to make sure that this \nmoney is used wisely. We believe that the National Science Foundation \nis on track.\n  In addition to that, this appropriation provides $13.6 billion for \nthe National Space Agency. It will spur technology development, as well \nas look for the origins of the universe.\n  To my colleagues in the Senate and to those also watching, while we \nwere working on the funding for NASA we recognized a great American \nhero, Senator John Glenn. At the request of his colleague from Ohio, \nSenator DeWine, we have renamed the NASA Lewis Research Center in \nCleveland the ``John Glenn Research Center,'' which we think is an \nappropriate recognition. We thank the junior Senator from Ohio for \nmaking that request.\n  While we are working on NASA, we have been troubled about the funding \nfor the space station and also the failure of the Russian Government to \ndeliver its promises. We have instructed NASA to take a look at how we \nare going to get value for taxpayers' dollars and how we are going to \nget technology for taxpayers' dollars. After rather firm conversations \nwith the National Security Advisor of the United States, as well as the \nAdministrator, we believe we have language in our appropriations that \nwill help us get both value and technology for our cooperation in this \neffort.\n  We are also working on a safe world. We have funded the Environmental \nProtection Agency to clean up our environment and also take those steps \nthat are necessary to prevent increased environmental degradation. One \nof the efforts, of course, is in brownfields, which we hope will be a \nnew tool to be able to clean up those contaminated areas and turn a \nbrownfield into a ``green field'' for economic development.\n  We continue to be troubled about the lack of an authorization for \nSuperfund. We will fund Superfund at last year's level but we encourage \nthe authorizers to be able to move ahead and pass an authorization. We \nhave an additional $650 million included, contingent on a \nreauthorization by August 1. Those are the things we believe will truly \nbe able to help clean up our environment and do preventive work.\n  Certain aspects in this legislation regarding EPA are important to my \nhome State of Maryland. In Maryland, we consider good environment is \nabsolutely good business. That is why we thank, once again, Senator \nBond for work in continuing the funding for the cleanup and \nrevitalization of the Chesapeake Bay. The bay is important because it \nprovides tremendous jobs in our State, from the watermen who harvest \nthe different species, including the crabs and oysters of the bay, to \nother small businesses that work on the bay.\n  All of my colleagues in the U.S. Senate know we were hit by the \nterrible situation of pfiesteria--this ``X-like'' organism that sits in \nthe mud, mutates 24 times, and then wreaks havoc with our fish. What \nour legislation provides is important research in pfiesteria. We hope \nto be able to come up with solutions that will be important not only \nfor Maryland and the causes of it, but also that will help other parts \nof the country, like North Carolina, and rivers that are affected by \nanimal wastes, with dire consequences.\n  We are also very pleased the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration has been funded. We will meet, of course, the 9-1-1 \nrequest of the United States of America, but I believe in FEMA we \nprovided the three ``R's.'' We have funded readiness; we have funded \nresponse; and we have also funded both rehabilitation, but more \nimportantly, prevention. This has been the hallmark, I think, of FEMA \nduring the last 5 years, to do training at the local community and \nthroughout this Nation, to be ready for those disasters that normally \nwould affect a particular region, but at the same time the readiness \nhelp to move to a quick response. Often after a disaster we can't \nrestore it to its old condition or even better, and, therefore, we need \nto look at ways to prevent disasters.\n  There is also another disaster that threatens the United States that \nis very deeply troubling to me. That is the whole issue of threats of \nterrorist attacks on our own United States of America. I know at the \nhighest level there are coordinated task forces, particularly from our \nmilitary, but within our legislation we made sure we fund FEMA's effort \nto do the training necessary to deal with attacks, particularly of \nbioterrorism and chemical weapons. We regard this as a very important \neffort.\n  I want to mention before I close the very close cooperation we have \nhad in this bill with the authorizers on Housing and Banking. I \nparticularly acknowledge the role of my senior Senator, Senator Paul \nSarbanes, and Senator Mack of Florida. They really worked hard this \nyear to come up with a new authorizing framework for public housing. I \nbelieve that they did it. They worked on economic integration of public \nhousing so it doesn't remain ZIP Codes of pathology. We have worked \ntogether in our legislation. We are taking their authorization and \nincorporating it here to make sure that there are new housing \nresources. In our bill there will be 50,000 new vouchers designed for \nwelfare-to-work, to make sure that welfare is not a way of life but a \ntool to a better life, and that public housing is not a way of life but \na tool to a better life. We have worked cooperatively with them, and we \nhave worked long and hard on our bill to eliminate outmoded public \nhousing rules that only hold people in place, and often have kept \npeople in poverty.\n  Also, this legislation will extend the life of HOPE VI. HOPE VI is a \nprogram that I helped develop that not only tried to eliminate the \nconcentrations of poverty and bring down the old walls of public \nhousing, but to create new hope and new opportunity. I am so pleased \nthe authorizers have spent over 2 years looking at this to come up with \na new framework.\n  I know my own colleague, Senator Sarbanes, is trying to get here to \nspeak on this bill. If he doesn't, I know he will speak later. We were \nboth due at a breakfast meeting in Baltimore and he covered that so I \ncould be here to move my bill. How I like working as a team. It is \nreally a great pleasure to me to have my senior colleague, Paul \nSarbanes, on the Budget Committee, as well as on the Housing and \nBanking where we have worked as a team to look at the day-to-day needs \nof people.\n  He took this concept of what was happening in public housing and \ndelved into it to come up with new ideas and a new framework. He had \nthe support of Senator Mack, who I know has gone into public housing, \ntalked with residents, listened to the best ideas of foundations and \nthink tanks and also the needs of residents, as did my own senior \ncolleague. I wish all of my colleagues could enjoy the relationship \nwith their colleague within my State as I do. Senator Sarbanes and \nSenator Mack have come up with a new framework. They pushed us to the \nwall to come up with new funding. We had to forage for the funds, but \nwe were able to do it. We truly hope this will create hope and \nopportunity.\n  In addition to that, we are particularly appreciative of the \nconference report to maintain the funding for national service, which \nothers had wanted to eliminate.\n  We want to thank them for that because that is also another tool for \ncreating hope and opportunity. So that is my perspective on the VA-HUD \nbill. Once again, working on a bipartisan basis, we show that we can \nmeet the day-to-day needs of our American people, as well as the long-\nrange needs of the United States of America. I thank Senator Bond and \nhis staff for, once again, the cooperative and bipartisan way that they \nhave worked with my staff and myself. Senator Bond, I thank you for all \nof the courtesies, the collegiality, and the consultation in which we \nengaged on this bill. I thank you for really the professionalism of \nyour staff, Jon Kamarck and Carrie Apostolou, who really helped me in \nmany ways to come up with good ideas and worked with you for good \nsolutions.\n  I also thank my own staff, Andy Givens and David Bowers, and Bertha \nLopez, a detailee from HUD who has been with us, who has worked hard to\n\n[[Page S11837]]\n\nmake sure I could fill my responsibilities. I thank them for their hard \nwork and effort.\n  In closing, I also want to say that over on the House side, another \nmember of VA-HUD is retiring. We pay our respects to Congressman Louis \nStokes, who has also really helped move this bill forward.\n  So, Mr. President, that is my perspective on the bill. In a few \nminutes, I know we will be moving toward a vote. I urge every single \nSenator on my side of the aisle to support this bipartisan effort to \nmove the appropriations and really encourage all others with \noutstanding appropriations to act in the same bipartisan fashion that \nwe have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I join with my colleague from Maryland in \nexpressing our appreciation to the House authorizing committee. She \nmentioned Senator Sarbanes. I want to express my sincere appreciation \nto Senator Mack. They spent 4 years in ``legislative purgatory'' \nattempting to come up with a resolution of these very difficult and \nimportant issues.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I wish to thank the conference committee \nmembers, and in particular the chairman of the VA/HUD Appropriations \nCommittee, Senator Bond, and the Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee, \nSenator Mack. I appreciate their working with me to include two \nprovisions in public housing reform language which I feel are \nimportant.\n  We have worked together to include a provision to allow vouchers for \ncrime victims. This would create an opportunity for individuals who are \nliving in public housing units the chance to leave a bad situation if \nthey are a victim of a crime.\n  Public housing residents could receive a housing voucher if they were \nthe victim of a crime of violence that has been reported to law \nenforcement.\n  These individuals would be empowered with the choice of where they \nwant to live and are given the freedom to determine what surroundings \nthey desire. I strongly believe that people should have the option of \nvouchers when their housing is unsafe.\n  We have also included what I hope will be a thorough study by the \nGeneral Accounting Office of the full costs of each federal housing \nprograms. I have been dismayed by the lack of data on the cost and \nbenefits of public housing, section 8, and voucher programs. We need \nbetter data.\n  Once we determine what these programs actually cost on a unit by unit \nbasis we can better determine the best approach. I personally prefer \nvouchers, but I want a complete review of all these programs to help us \ndetermine the most cost effective means of providing government \nassisted housing as we enter the 21st century.\n  Again, I would like to thank the chairmen and their staff for \ncompleting action on public housing reform legislation and look forward \nto working with them in the future.\n\n\n   clarifying the statement of the managers accompanying the va-hud \n                           conference report\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to clarify a section in the \nstatement of the managers accompanying the VA-HUD conference report. \nThe language urges EPA not to spend any funds or require any parties to \ndredge contaminated sediments until completion of a National Academy of \nSciences report on dredging technology. The report may take two years \nto complete. It is my understanding that the language is not intended \nto limit EPA's authority during the next two years with respect to \ndredging contaminated sediments that pose a substantial threat to \npublic health or the environment where EPA has found that dredging is \nan appropriate response action.\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator is correct. The statement of the managers is \nnot intended to limit the EPA's authority with respect to dredging \ncontaminated sediments that pose a substantial threat to public health \nor the environment where EPA has found, consistent with its \ncontaminated sediment management strategy, that dredging is an \nappropriate response action.\n\n\n                    economic development initiatives\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to thank \nChairman Bond for his inclusion of funding within the Economic \nDevelopment Initiatives account for three important projects in \nPittsburgh, Wilkes-Barre, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that I \nrequested.\n  The conference report also includes $2 million for the City of \nPittsburgh to redevelop the LTV site in Hazelwood, Pennsylvania. These \nfunds can be used by the city to clean up and prepare the site for \neventual reuse. One possibility being contemplated in the area is an \neffort to attract the Sun Oil Company to build a new coke facility \nwhich create hundreds of new jobs.\n  I am pleased that we have been able to increase the level of funding \nin the bill from $750,000 to $1 million for the downtown revitalization \nproject in Wilkes-Barre which is also a top priority for Mayor Tom \nMcGroarty and Congressman Paul Kanjorski.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report includes $50,000 for a \nproject in Central and South Philadelphia, which is plagued with an \naverage annual family income of $7,600, a 45 percent unemployment rate, \nand a 50 percent high school drop-out rate. These funds are intended to \nprovide initial resources for the development of a job training and \nbusiness center to generate employment in this section of Philadelphia. \nThe renewal project is spearheaded by Universal Community Homes, a not-\nfor-profit community development corporation which has a strong \npresence in the city, and which has received grants from the Department \nof Housing and Urban Development for housing and other initiatives \nwhich are geared toward improving the quality of life for low-income \nfamilies. In January of this year, I had the opportunity to visit \nUniversal Community Homes to tour their facilities. More importantly, I \nmet with individuals who directly benefit from the programs and \nservices delivered by Universal Community Homes. Members of the media \nand community leaders were also present to bring to my attention that \nthe South Central Philadelphia sections of the city are in critical \nneed of a job training and business center.\n  I take this opportunity to clarify with Chairman Bond that it is the \nconferees' intent that Universal Community Homes is the appropriate \napplicant for the EDI grant for Central and South Philadelphia.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleague for his comments and have appreciated \nhis input on worthwhile projects in Pennsylvania. I agree with his \nunderstanding that the conferees intend that Universal Community Homes \nis the appropriate applicant for the funds provided for a job training \nand business center Central and South Philadelphia.\n\n\n                       new england health system\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague from \nConnecticut for the purpose of a colloquy with the Chairman and the \nSenator from Vermont. Is the Chairman aware of the financial \nconstraints facing the veterans health system in New England's VISN 1?\n  Mr. BOND. Yes, the Chair is aware of the financial constraints in New \nEngland.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, news accounts have indicated that New \nEngland's veteran health care system will suffer additional cuts \ndespite recent efficiency and consolidation efforts. Veterans could \nfind themselves cut off from health services throughout the region. Is \nthe Chairman aware that without additional dollars administrators will \nhave to cut deeply into valuable health care programs and basic \nadministrative support services?\n  Mr. BOND. I am well aware that the New England region has had to make \nsignificant reductions in health care costs, in part because of the VA \nfunding formula.\n  Mr. DODD. I know the Chairman knows that the veterans in VISN 1 live \nin a region that stretches from Connecticut to Maine. The budget for \nour region's medical care has dropped from $854 million in fiscal year \n1996 to $809 million in fiscal year 1998. I have been informed by the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs that the New England region will endure \nyet another budget cut in fiscal year 1999. I hope that the \nAppropriations Committee will take note of the impact these reductions \nare having on facilities across New England.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as is the Chairman, I am a member of the \nVA/\n\n[[Page S11838]]\n\nHUD Subcommittee that funds the Department of Veterans Affairs. He \nknows my personal concern about the situation facing our veterans in \nNew England. The Appropriations Committee added $278 million in this \nconference report for veterans medical care, a significant increase \nover the President's budget request. It was my understanding that a \nportion of this increase will go to New England. Am I correct in that \nassumption?\n  Mr. BOND. The Senator from Vermont is correct. All networks will \nreceive some part of these additional funds, and these funds will help \nNew England and all regions address some critical funding issues.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I look forward to working with the Senator from Missouri \non this issue in the coming year, and I thank him for his leadership on \nall issues affecting our nation's veterans.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. As did my colleague from Vermont, I thank my friend \nfrom Missouri for his consideration on this issue of profound \nimportance to New England veterans.\n\n\n                          notice of prepayment\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on an important \nprovision of the FY1999 VA/HUD appropriations bill. Thanks to the hard \nwork and grassroots efforts of tenants and housing advocates across the \ncountry, this VA/HUD bill includes a 5 month minimum requirement to \nnotify tenants and communities of an owner's intent to repay his or her \nfederally assisted mortgage.\n  This provision helps tenants of Section 236 and Section 221(d)(3) \nhousing as created by the National Housing Act for federally assisted, \nprivately owned affordable housing. Under the Section 221 program, the \nfederal government insures the mortgages on certain rental housing; \nunder the Section 236 program, the federal government subsidizes the \ninterest payments that owners of rental housing made on the mortgages. \nBoth of these programs offer the security of a federal subsidy for \nbuilding owners in return for their maintaining these buildings as \naffordable housing. Regulatory agreements signed between HUD and the \nbuilding owners restrict the rents which could be charged on the units \nwithin the building so long as the mortgage is insured or subsidized by \nHUD. To be eligible, an owner signs a 40 year mortgage; however, the \nowner can prepay the mortgage or end the contract after 20 years and \nhas the ability to remove that building from the pool of affordable \nhousing.\n  Twenty years have now passed, and the legislative housing initiatives \nof the 1980s have failed to curb the collapse of this once sturdy \nguarantee of affordable housing for low-income families and \nindividuals. One major provision is that owners of a Section 236 \nproject simply need to give their tenants a 30-60 day notice that the \nproperty is under the prepayment process. All too often the prepayment \nof the mortgage by the owners results in a tremendous loss to the \ntenants of that project. Without the federally backed restriction on \nrents that can be charged, the prepayment of the mortgage opens the \ndoor to new owners who on average have increased the tenants monthly \nrent by 49%.\n  This increase in rent forces low-income tenants out of their homes. \nThis increase in rent forces these tenants to search for new housing, \noften in rental markets with exceptionally low vacancy rates. At the \nsame time the supply of low-income housing takes a big hit, fewer and \nfewer units are available with each prepayment of Section 236 housing \nfor the low-income families in desperate need of adequate housing.\n  Mr. President, the Senate version of the VA/HUD bill included a \nprovision to give tenants of Section 236 housing a fair notice--one \nfull year--of the owner's intent to prepay the mortgage on the \nbuilding. This critical one year notice was designed to accomplish two \ngoals. First, it would have given the tenants a notice of the owner's \nprepayment intentions. For some tenants, especially those living in the \nMinneapolis/St. Paul Metropolitan area, finding housing has been \nextremely difficult. The vacancy rate is at 1.9%. It was simply \nunreasonably to expect those tenants to find alternative housing within \nonly 30 days with such a low vacancy rate. In fact, it has been nearly \nimpossible for low-income tenants and families to find adequate housing \nin such a short time in such a tight housing market. Secondly, the one \nyear notice would have given a community the critical time necessary to \nbegin to formulate options to keep that building available for those in \nneed of affordable housing. I am pleased that the Senate is on record \nsupporting the need for a fair notice to tenants.\n  Unfortunately, the conference report does not include the full extent \nof my provision. The one-year notice period was reduced in the VA/HUD \nConference Committee. It was reduced to not shorter than five months, \nbut not longer than a nine months notice by owners. In addition, the \nprovision now includes an enactment date effective 150 days after \npassage of the bill. Clearly, I am not enthusiastic about this revision \nto the notice requirement, but it is certainly an improvement over the \ncurrent requirement of 30-60 days. As a result, the shorter time may \nonly buy additional time for the families facing the increase in rent \nand their eventual move to alternative housing. I fear that the 5-9 \nmonths will not accord non-profits and communities with the necessary \ntime to purchase the building and maintain those units as affordable \nhousing.\n  However, this revised provision does put the right foot forward. Not \nonly is it a public acknowledgment that Congress sees the prepayment of \nSection 236 and Section 231 housing as a potential crisis facing the \nmarket, it gives tenants and communities the framework to find \naffordable alternatives for low-income families. This is only the first \nstep. To truly restore fairness to the housing situation, tenants \nshould have a longer period of time--one year or longer advance notice. \nThe Senate is on record in support of a one-year notice and the next \nCongress should move to increase the notice period again. I am proud of \nthe work that has been done, but I believe we have to do more.\n  I thank my colleagues for supporting this important provision. While \nthe revisions in the conference report may be the best possible \nsolution to the crisis facing the tens of thousands of families dealing \nwith the prepayment of their building, it does provide a necessary \nimprovement to existing law.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations bill. I thank Chairman Bond and Senator Mikulski for \ntheir success in bringing this bill to the floor with such widespread \nsupport. Balancing the many competing needs in an appropriations bill \nis never an easy task, and Senators Bond and Mikulski and all of the \nother conferees should be proud of the work they have done.\n  As ranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and \nCommunity Development, I am particularly pleased with the \nappropriations for the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The \nFiscal Year 1999 appropriations for HUD is the agency's best in the \npast 10 years. Roughly $2 billion more has been appropriated for Fiscal \nYear 1999 than was made available in 1998. These gains would not have \nbeen possible without the tireless efforts of Secretary Cuomo, who \ndelivered a strong and thoughtful budget request to the appropriators \nlast January.\n  The Fiscal Year 1999 HUD appropriations bill symbolizes a renewed \ncommitment to meet our nation's severe housing shortages. Today, only \nabout one out of every 4 households in need of housing assistance \nreceives it. Of the roughly 12 million families that need housing \nassistance but do not receive it, almost half have worst case housing \nneeds. These families are paying more than half of their incomes every \nmonth in rent, or live in physically substandard Housing, or both.\n  The appropriations bill will help address this need by funding 50,000 \nnew section 8 vouchers, many of which will be targeted to people moving \nfrom welfare to work. These vouchers establish a crucial link between \nhousing and employment opportunities, while simultaneously helping \nthose who are making a concerted effort to get off of welfare \nassistance. They are important tools whose significance cannot be \noverstated given the uncertainty of welfare reform.\n  Furthermore, this bill changes current law so that housing \nauthorities no longer have to hold off on reissuing vouchers and \ncertificates for a period of three months upon turnover. Repealing this \ndelay will provide section 8\n\n[[Page S11839]]\n\nvouchers to as many as 40,000 more low-income families each year. I \ncommend the appropriators for recognizing the need for this resource, \nand implementing this important change.\n  The conference report also reaffirms our nation's commitment to \nhomeownership by expanding the FHA single family mortgage insurance \nprogram. We are currently seeing record levels of homeownership in this \ncountry, and HUD should take great pride in this accomplishment. But \nnot all of those who qualify for homeownership are afforded an \nopportunity to purchase a home in the neighborhood of their choice. The \nFiscal Year 1999 appropriations bill will help address this inequity by \nraising the FHA loan limits in both high cost urban areas and lower \ncost rural areas. These new loan limits will enable roughly 17,000 \nadditional families to become homeowners each year.\n  The conferees are also to be commended for increasing the levels of \nfunding for a number of important HUD programs. Funding for the CDBG \nprogram, the HOME program, the public Housing capital fund, the HOPE VI \nprogram, the homeless assistance fund, Fair Housing initiatives, HOPWA, \nHousing for Elderly and Disabled, and the Lead Hazard Abatement program \nhave been significantly increased for Fiscal Year 1999. These funding \nlevels, many of which are higher than the Administration's request, \ndemonstrate the appropriators' commitment to supporting housing and \neconomic development initiatives despite other competing needs \ncontained in this appropriations bill.\n  I am especially pleased that the appropriators have chosen to fund \nthe Youthbuild program at $42.5 million for Fiscal Year 1999--$7.5 \nmillion over what was enacted in 1998. Youthbuild, which I helped pass \ninto law, provides on-site training in construction skills, as well as \noff-site academic and job skill lessons, to at-risk youth between the \nages of 16 and 24. Approximately 7,300 young people have participated \nin Youthbuild programs to date, and many more-at-risk youth will be \nable to benefit in the future from the increased resources that have \nbeen devoted to this program.\n  Mr. President, I would also like to express my support for the public \nhousing reform act which was attached to the conference report. As \nranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing Opportunity and Community \nDevelopment, I have worked closely with Senator Mack, Senator Sarbanes, \nSecretary Cuomo, Representative Kennedy and Representative Lazio to \ndevelop this compromise measure. I am very proud of the final product.\n  The public housing reform act successfully achieves a delicate \nbalance: it deregulates public housing authorities while simultaneously \nrequiring them to better the lives of the residents they serve. For \ninstance, the reform measure permanently repeals Federal preferences, \nwhich had the unintended consequence of concentrating poverty in public \nhousing developments. The bill allows PHAs to develop their own \npreferences, including a preference for working families, but requires \nthat at least 40 percent of all public housing units and 75 percent of \nall section 8 units that become available each year be provided to \npeople making below 30 percent of area median income. These \nprotections, which I fought very hard for on the Senate floor and which \nare better than current law, will benefit residents at all income \nlevels by facilitating the creation of mixed income developments.\n\n  The value of mixed income developments cannot be overstated. Working \nfamilies stabilize communities by offering hope and opportunity in \nenvironments of despair. In recognition of this important principle, \nthe reform bill will require housing authorities to develop plans for \nthe economic desegregation of their distressed communities. Each PHA \nmust develop their plan in consultation with its residents, and all \nplans will be submitted to HUD for approval. The economic desegregation \nplan was incorporated into the bill at the strong urging of Secretary \nCuomo, and I am confident that HUD officials will be committed to \nmaking this provision work.\n  The Reform Act eliminates many burdensome requirements for housing \nauthorities. One-for-one replacement rules, which prevented PHAs from \ndemolishing vacant public housing projects and building lower density \ndevelopments, have been repealed. Total development costs have been \nrevised to allow housing authorities to construct more viable \ncommunities. And PHAs will be permitted to use their Federal funds in a \nmore flexible manner, including investment in mixed finance \ndevelopments that attract private capital.\n  But with this freedom comes a new responsibility: housing authorities \nmust involve residents in the decisions that will affect their lives. \nThe Reform Act will empower residents in important ways. They will sit \non PHA boards, they will participate in the PHA planning process, and \nthey will be offered greater opportunity to manage their own \ndevelopments or solicit alternative management entities.\n  Other provisions in the public housing reform act will benefit \nresidents more directly. For instance, the bill includes a mandatory \nearned income disregard so that public housing residents who are \nunemployed, or who have been on welfare assistance, will not be charged \nany additional rent for a one year period after finding a job. The bill \npermits and encourages PHAs to establish escrow accounts for \nresidents--accounts which residents can use to fund homeownership \nactivities, moving expenses, education expenses, or other self \nsufficiency initiatives. The bill also retains the Tenant Opportunity \nProgram as a separately funded grant program, and mandates that at \nleast 25 percent of available funds under this program be distributed \ndirectly to qualified resident organizations.\n  The public housing bill also makes a real commitment to expanding \nhomeownership opportunities for low income Americans. PHAs will now be \npermitted to use a portion of their capital funds in support of \nhomeownership activities for public housing residents, and families can \nnow use their Section 8 vouchers to help cover the cost of mortgage \npayments.\n  In short, the Public Housing Reform Act will go a long way towards \nimproving the lives of the millions of Americans who are receiving \nFederal housing assistance. It is a nice complement to the funding \nincreases contained in the rest of the VA-HUD bill--increases which \nwill help many more Americans who are in dire need of housing \nassistance. I urge all of my colleagues to show their support for both \nof these important initiatives by voting in favor of the VA-HUD \nconference report.\n  Mr. DOMENCI. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nconference agreement on H.R. 4194, the VA-HUD appropriations bill for \n1999.\n  This bill provides new budget authority of $93.3 billion and new \noutlays of $54.0 billion to finance operations of the Departments of \nVeterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, the Environmental \nProtection Agency, NASA, and other independent agencies.\n  I congratulate the distinguished subcommittee chairman and ranking \nmember for producing a bill that not only is within the subcommittee's \n302(b) allocation, but that also can be signed by the President. When \noutlays from prior-year BA and other adjustments are taken into \naccount, the bill totals $91.9 billion in BA and $102.1 billion in \noutlays. The total bill is exactly at the Senate subcommittee's 302(b) \nnondefense allocation for budget authority and is under the outlay \nallocation by $197 million. The bill is exactly at the defense \nallocation for both BA and outlays.\n  I note that this appropriations bill does include significant \nauthorizing legislation, including a major reauthorization of public \nhousing programs, and that some of the provisions have a revenue impact \nwhich will go on the paygo scorecard.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert into the Record a \ntable displaying the Budget Committee scoring of the conference \nagreement on H.R. 4194.\n  There being no objection, the data was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 H.R. 4194, VA-HUD APPROPRIATIONS, 1999--SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                   [Fiscal year 1999, in millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               Defense  Nondefense   Crime   Mandatory    Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n  Budget authority...........................................      131     69,914   .......    21,885     91,930\n\n[[Page S11840]]\n\n  Outlays....................................................      127     80,364   .......    21,570    102,061\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...........................................      131     69,914   .......    21,885     91,930\n  Outlays....................................................      127     80,561   .......    21,570    102,258\n1998 Enacted:\n  Budget authority...........................................      131     69,286   .......    21,332     90,749\n  Outlays....................................................      139     80,250   .......    20,061    100,450\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...........................................      131     69,957   .......    21,885     91,973\n  Outlays....................................................      127     81,000   .......    21,570    102,697\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...........................................      130     70,899   .......    21,885     92,914\n  Outlays....................................................      126     80,373   .......    21,570    102,069\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...........................................      131     69,855   .......    21,885     91,871\n  Outlays....................................................      127     80,653   .......    21,570    102,350\nCONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget authority...........................................  .......  ..........  .......  .........  ........\n  Outlays....................................................  .......       -197   .......  .........      -197\n1998 Enacted:\n  Budget authority...........................................  .......        628   .......       553      1,181\n  Outlays....................................................      -12        114   .......     1,509      1,611\nPresident's request:\n  Budget authority...........................................  .......        -43   .......  .........       -43\n  Outlays....................................................  .......       -636   .......  .........      -636\nHouse-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...........................................        1       -985   .......  .........      -984\n  Outlays....................................................        1         -9   .......  .........        -8\nSenate-passed bill:\n  Budget authority...........................................  .......         59   .......  .........        59\n  Outlays....................................................  .......       -289   .......  .........      -289\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for consistency with current scorekeeping\n  conventions. Prepared by SBC Majority Staff, 10/07/98.\n\n Provisions in the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy with \nthe distinguished ranking member of the Banking Committee, Senator \nSarbanes, to clarify various provisions in the Quality Housing and Work \nResponsibility Act of 1998 and discuss the understandings reached among \nconferees regarding these provisions.\n  Section 508 requires a disregard of earned income under some \ncircumstances, including persons who obtain employment after one year \nof unemployment. The rules defining ``unemployment'' for this purpose \nshould provide sufficient flexibility so that a family member who may \nhave a brief, temporary period of employment during the preceding year \nwould not be ineligible for the disregard. At the same time, the rules \nmust not encourage households to change their employment patterns to \ntake advantage of the disregard.\n  Section 519 provides guidance for a new Operating Fund formula, \nincluding that agencies will ``benefit'' from increases in rental \nincome due to increases in earned income by families in occupancy. The \nextent of this benefit will be determined in the negotiated rulemaking \non the Operating Fund formula. More generally, the Operating Fund \nformula should not be skewed against or discourage mixing of incomes in \npublic housing that is consistent with the bill's objectives. With \nrespect to the Capital Fund formula, the possibility of having an \nincentive to encourage agencies to leverage other resources, including \nthrough mixed-finance transactions, should be considered during the \nnegotiated rulemaking process.\n  Section 520 amends the current definition of total development costs, \nbut retains the current law directive in section 6(b)(2) of the United \nStates Housing Act that these guidelines are to allow publicly bid \nconstruction of good and sound quality. In the past, HUD has not \ninterpreted this reference in a way that allows for sufficiently \ndurable construction, of a nature that will reduce maintenance and \nrepair costs and will assure that public housing meets reasonable \ncommunity standards. The Department should interpret this section as \nrequiring the use of indices such as the R.S. Means cost index for \nconstruction of ``average'' quality and the Marshal & Swift cost index \nfor construction of ``good'' quality.\n  Where a family is relocated due to demolition or disposition, \nvoluntary conversion of a development to tenant-based assistance or \nhomeownership (sections 531, 533 and 536), the family must be offered \ncomparable housing that is located in an area that is generally not \nless desirable than the location of the displaced resident's housing. \nFor purposes of this provision, the phrase ``location of the displaced \nresident's housing'' may be construed to mean the public housing \ndevelopment from which the family was vacated, rather than a larger \ngeographic area.\n  Where a family is relocated due to demolition or disposition, \nvoluntary or required conversion of public housing to tenant-based \nassistance or a homeownership program (sections 531, 533, 536 and 537), \nrelocation may be to another public housing unit of the agency at a \nrental rate that is comparable to the rental rate applicable to the \nunit from which the family is vacated. However, this requirement does \nnot mean that the rental rate always must be exactly the same. \nSpecifically, if the agency has exercised its discretionary authority \nin the initial unit to charge less than thirty percent of adjusted \nincome and that authority would be inapplicable to or inappropriate for \nthe new unit, the comparable rent could be a rent that would apply if \nthis discretionary authority had not been exercised (i.e., up to thirty \npercent of adjusted income).\n\n  With respect to public housing demolition (section 531), the \nconference report does not include a provision from the Senate bill \nthat would deem applications approved if HUD did not respond within 60 \ndays. However, HUD is urged to continue processing applications \nresponsibly and expeditiously. In the same section, references to \ndemolition or disposition of a ``project'' may be applied to portions \nof projects where only portions are undergoing demolition or \ndisposition.\n  In the provisions for voluntary or required conversion of public \nhousing to vouchers (sections 533 and 537), residents of affected \ndevelopments are to be provided notification that they can remain in \ntheir dwelling unit and use tenant-based assistance if the affected \ndevelopment or portion is to be used as housing. In many such \ninstances, the development may be undergoing rehabilitation, \nreconfiguration or demolition and new construction. If so, the resident \nwould be entitled to stay in the same development and use tenant-based \nassistance, but not necessarily the same dwelling unit.\n  The bill provides for the possibility of transfer of housing from an \nagency to an eligible management entity due to the mismanagement of the \nagency (section 534). Such mismanagement may relate to a single housing \ndevelopment, rather than more widespread mismanagement.\n  With respect to the definition of ``mixed-finance projects'' in \nsection 539, the requirement that a project is financially assisted by \nprivate resources means that the private resources must be greater than \na de minimis amount. In addition, in the same section, new Section \n35(h) of the 1937 Act applies only to a mixed-finance project that has \na ``significant number'' of units other than public housing units. \nTherefore, this section would not apply to a mixed-finance project \nwhich had only a de minimis number of units other than public housing \nunits.\n  It is intended that wherever appropriate in programs authorized \nthroughout the bill, reasonable accommodation be made for persons with \ndisabilities. This would apply, for example, in homeownership programs \nauthorized by section 536. With respect to the setting of voucher \npayment standards authorized by section 545, agencies are urged to make \npayment standard adjustments to facilitate reasonable availability of \nsuitable and accessible units and assure full participation of persons \nwith disabilities. Subject to the availability of funds, HUD also \nshould allow administrative fee adjustments to cover any necessary \nadditional expenses for serving persons with disabilities fully, such \nas additional counseling expenses.\n  The provision allowing HUD to phase in the new Section 8 law, section \n559, provides HUD the flexibility to apply current law to assistance \nobligated before October 1, 1999. This language is intended to be \nconstrued so that HUD may continue for as long as necessary to apply \ncurrent law to families now assisted by Section 8, to the extent the \nSecretary deems appropriate.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Senator for the clarification and concur \nwith the Senator's understanding of the intent of these provisions.\n\n\n                              section 226\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith my good friend Senator Bond in order to fully clarify a provision \nof the VA-HUD Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999. I am pleased \nthat the conferees have included language in Section 226 of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Conference Report (H. Rpt. 105-769) which would clarify \nthat existing contractual arrangements between the New York City \nHousing Authority\n\n[[Page S11841]]\n\n(NYCHA) and HUD are maintained. Under current practice, NYCHA is \nexpressly allowed, under prior formula agreement with HUD, to utilize \nits existing allocations of operating and modernization subsidies for \nthe benefit of certain state and city developed public housing units. \nWhile the FY 1999 VA-HUD Appropriations Act will not allocate any \nadditional funds for these local units, the Act does include a specific \nstatutory protection for units which were assisted prior to October 1, \n1998. Thus, the current contractual relationship between NYCHA and HUD \nwould be fully protected and maintained. I would ask the distinguished \nChairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee if my explanation is consistent \nwith the intent of the conferees?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I concur with the statement by Senator \nD'Amato, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee. The conferees \nwere mindful of the existing situation in New York City and have fully \nprotected existing practice in the VA-HUD Appropriations Conference \nReport. No provision of the Act is intended in any way to interfere \nwith or abrogate existing contracts for the use of assistance in New \nYork City.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Chairman for his clarifying remarks and wish \nto express my thanks to the conferees for their consideration of the \nunique circumstances which exist in New York City.\n\n\n        the quality housing and work responsibility act of 1998\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise to support the Quality Housing and \nWork Responsibility Act of 1998. This public and assisted housing \nreform legislation is the result of four years of delicate crafting and \ncompromise and has bipartisan Congressional support and the endorsement \nof Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Cuomo. I \nsupport its final passage today as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 \nVeterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and Independent \nAgencies appropriations bill (H.R. 4194).\n  Mr. President, it is with great respect that I salute the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Banking Subcommittee on Housing \nOpportunity and Community Development, Senator Connie Mack. Senator \nMack is owed a debt of gratitude for his great determination and \ncommitment to an informed and reasoned approach to public housing \nreform. He consistently pursued a steadfast course toward a compromise \nwhich represents a positive change to the existing public housing \nsystem while protecting our residents whom the program serves. I \ncommend him for his strong leadership and effective stewardship of this \nlandmark legislation.\n  I also commend Banking Committee Ranking Minority Member Paul \nSarbanes, Housing Subcommittee Ranking Minority Member John Kerry, all \nMembers of the Banking Committee and many interested Members of the \nSenate for their essential guidance and leadership on this issue. \nChairman Kit Bond and Ranking Member Barbara Mikulski of the VA-HUD \nAppropriations Subcommittee deserve our appreciation for their \nwillingness to allow this bipartisan legislation to be included in the \nFiscal Year 1999 VA-HUD Appropriations Act. Our House colleagues, in \nparticular Banking Subcommittee on Housing Chairman Rick Lazio, Banking \nCommittee Chairman Jim Leach, Banking Committee Ranking Minority Member \nJohn LaFalce and Housing Subcommittee Ranking Minority Member Joe \nKennedy, all deserve thanks and appreciation. In addition, I commend \nand thank HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo and his Administration for his \nable assistance and support of this bill. All deserve credit for their \ndedication to this consensus-building effort.\n  Resident associations, public housing authorities, low-income housing \nadvocates, non-profit organizations, state and local officials and \nother affected parties have shared their views and participated in this \nimportant political and policy process. I express my thanks to all for \ntheir significant involvement which has successfully yielded a \nbalanced, fair, and comprehensive reform bill which will enhance and \nrevitalize affordable housing throughout our nation.\n  The Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act recognizes that the \nvast majority of public housing is well-managed and provides over 1 \nmillion American families, elderly and disabled with decent, safe and \naffordable housing. It also responds to the need for improvements to \nthe public and assisted housing system. It will protect our residents \nby maintaining the Brooke amendment, which caps rents at 30% of a \ntenant's income, and establishing a ceiling rent voluntary option as an \nincentive for working families. In addition, the bill will ensure that \nhousing assistance continues to be targeted to those most in need. \nForty percent of all public housing units which become vacant in any \nyear and seventy-five percent of re-issued Section 8 vouchers will be \ntargeted to families with incomes below thirty percent of the local \narea median income. It will expand homeownership opportunities for low \nand moderate income families. The bill also will speed the demolition \nof distressed housing projects through the repeal of the one-for-one \nreplacement requirement.\n  The reforms contained in this Act will reduce the costs of public and \nassisted housing to the Federal Government by streamlining regulations, \nfacilitating the formation of local partnerships, and leveraging \nadditional state, local and private resources to improve the quality of \nthe existing stock. These changes will help ensure that federal funds \ncan be used more efficiently in order to serve additional families \nthrough the creation of mixed income communities.\n  Mr. President, I would like to comment in more detail on a few of the \nmany significant provisions in the bill. The legislation recognizes \nthat every American deserves to live in a safe and secure community. To \nachieve that goal, a number of safety and security provisions have been \nincluded in the bill. Specifically, the Act will allow police officers \nto reside in public and assisted housing, regardless of their income. \nAlso, the Act improves tenant screening and eviction procedures against \npersons engaged in violent or drug-related crimes or behavior which \ndisrupts the health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the \npremises of other tenants or public housing employees. In addition, the \nAct will serve to improve coordination between housing authorities, \nlocal law enforcement agencies and resident councils, particularly in \ndeveloping and implementing anti-crime strategies.\n  Further, at my request, the Act includes provision to ban child \nmolesters and sexually violent predators from receiving federal housing \nassistance. To achieve this, local public housing agencies would be \ngranted access to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's national \ndatabase on sexually violent offenders, as well as State databases. \nThis improved records access provision is critical to ensuring that \nthese offenders are properly screened out and prevented from \nendangering our children.\n  Another critical safety and security measure will ensure that housing \nauthorities have the well-defined power to ban absentee and negligent \nlandlords from participation in the Section 8 voucher program. \nCurrently, HUD's regulations only allow housing authorities to refuse \nto do business with absentee landlords on very narrow grounds. The \nlegislation being passed today will clarify that housing authorities \nmay cease to do business with landlords who refuse to take action \nagainst tenants who are engaged in criminal activity or who threaten \nthe health, safety or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of \ntheir neighbors.\n  In addition, my proposals to protect the essential rights of current \nresidents have been adopted in the Act and I commend the residents of \nmy home State for bringing injustices to my attention so that I might \nact. First, the protection against eviction without good cause has been \nfully maintained in the Act. This is critical for the hundreds of \nthousands of senior, disabled and hardworking low-income New Yorkers \nwho depend on public and assisted housing for shelter. Second, the \nresidents' right to organize and assemble has been fully protected and \nextended to the project-based and Section 8 opt-out properties. It is \nimperative that residents have their First Amendment rights to free \nspeech and assembly protected. Finally, the Act makes absolutely clear \nthat no provision of the existing HUD regulation (24 CFR\n\n[[Page S11842]]\n\n964) governing resident councils is in any way abrogated by this Act. I \nam gratified that the Act protects the residents' right to organize and \nempower themselves to improve further their own communities.\n  Without the tireless and steadfast efforts of our staff, this bill \nwould not have become a reality. I would like to express my \nappreciation and thanks to the following Senate majority and minority \nBanking Committee and Housing Subcommittee staff: Chris Lord, Kari \nDavidson, Cheh Kim, Jonathan Miller, Matthew Josephs, and Army Randel. \nI would also like to commend the House Banking Committee and Housing \nSubcommittee staff for their fine work and spirit of cooperation.\n  Mr. President, this landmark legislation will greatly improve the \nquality of life for our nation's families residing in public and \nassisted housing and will help to ensure the long-term viability of our \nnation's existing stock of affordable housing. I respectfully urge its \nimmediate passage.\n\n\n                         rent choice provision\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would ask my friend Senator Mack for a \nclarification of the provision included in the Quality Housing and Work \nResponsibility Act of 1998 which will grant residents a voluntary \noption to choose a flat rent. Several clarifying provisions have been \nadded to the legislation to protect residents and reduce the \nadministrative burden of such a choice on housing authorities. First, \nresidents will be protected from being coerced into making a choice of \nrents which is adverse to their interest. Second, in the case of a \nfinancial hardship, residents are granted the right to an immediate \nchange to the Brooke Amendment rent, which caps rent at no greater than \nthirty percent of income.\n  Mr. President, the Act also specifically provides that no additional \nadministrative burden be placed on housing authorities that already \nadminister flat rent or ceiling rent systems. If an agency's present \nsystem allows the family the opportunity to annually request a change \nfrom an income-based system to a flat or ceiling rent system, or vice-\nversa, the fact that rent is initially determined by an existing \ncomputer system which automatically selects the lower rent should not \nbe considered contrary to the requirements of the Act. I would ask \nSenator Mack if these statements accurately describe the provisions of \nthe Act?\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I fully concur with the statements of my \nfriend, Senator D'Amato. His statements are fully consistent with my \nunderstanding of the legislation.\n\n\n                  section 8 tenant-based renewal terms\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to ask Senator Mack his view \nof the provisions of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of \n1998 that relate to the renewal of expiring tenant-based Section 8 \ncontracts. I am greatly heartened by the inclusion of specific terms \nfor the renewal of expiring Section 8 tenant-based contracts. The \nrenewal terms included in the Act will ensure that housing authorities \ncontinue to receive full funding to maintain effective Section 8 \nassisted housing programs. The Act's renewal provision will address a \nnumber of problems which have arisen--including a very serious \npotential threat to affordable housing in my home State of New York--as \na result of HUD's attempt to revise its method of funding renewals.\n  Under the renewal terms of Section 556 of the Act, housing \nauthorities will be ensured that they receive full funding to maintain \ntheir current obligations and continue to re-issue turnover vouchers, \nwithout any attrition or loss of assistance. Housing authorities in New \nYork will be able to continue to assist thousands of new families each \nyear--particularly the homeless and victims of domestic violence. \nWithout the changes included in this legislation, the New York City \nHousing Authority alone could have suffered a loss of over 7,000 \nvouchers over the next few years. This potential catastrophe has been \naverted.\n  To be more specific, Section 556 establishes a baseline for \nmaintaining current Section 8 obligations. This baseline is to be \ncalculated by taking into account the number of families which were \nactually under lease as of October 1, 1997 plus any incremental units \nor additional units authorized by HUD after that date. It is the \nexplicit intent of the authors of this legislation that the units \napproved by HUD pursuant to its April 1, 1998 Notice shall be included \nin the definition of ``additional families authorized.'' Finally, HUD \nshall apply an inflation factor to the baseline which takes into \naccount local factors such as actual increases in local market rents.\n  I would ask Senator Mack, if these statements are consistent with his \nviews of the legislation?\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, Senator D'Amato's comments are absolutely \naccurate. Section 556 of the Act was added in response to a vociferous \noutcry among housing authorities and low-income advocates who feared \nthat HUD's administrative actions during Fiscal Year 1998 could have \ninadvertently led to a decline in housing assistance under the Section \n8 program. The renewal terms included in the Act are intended to avoid \nsuch a result and will ensure that full funding for the program is \nmaintained. I appreciate the Chairman's work to ensure that this \nprovision will not have adverse budgetary implications.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the Senator for his clarifying remarks and \ncommend him for the excellent work that went into the legislation.\n\n\n                  drug elimination program amendments\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to enter into a colloquy \nwith the respected Chairman of the Banking Committee's Subcommittee on \nHousing Opportunity and Community Development, Senator Connie Mack and \nthe full Committee Ranking Member, Senator Paul Sarbanes. One of the \nmost significant provisions addressed by the Quality Housing and Work \nResponsibility Act of 1998 is the amendment of the Public and Assisted \nHousing Drug Elimination Act of 1990.\n  Mr. President, the Drug Elimination Program is critical to the fight \nagainst drugs and serious, violent crime in our Federal housing \ndevelopments. The residents of this housing have a right to a safe and \npeaceful environment. The Federal Government bears a unique and \noverriding responsibility to ensure that residents feel secure in their \nhomes, can walk to the store or send their children to school without \nfear for their physical well-being. I am especially appreciative of the \ninclusion of a funding mechanism which will ensure the continued \ndirection of assistance to housing authorities with significant needs. \nIn my home State, the Drug Elimination Program plays a critical role in \ncommunities from Buffalo, Syracuse, Rochester and Albany to Brooklyn, \nthe Bronx and Long Island. The provisions of the Act will ensure that \nexisting programs are placed on a solid financial foundation--without \nprecluding assistance to new programs which meet urgent or serious \ncrime problems.\n  I would ask the distinguished Chairman of the Housing Subcommittee \nfor his views on the legislation?\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I welcome the comments of my friend, Senator \nD'Amato. Indeed, the amendments to the Public and Assisted Housing Drug \nElimination Act of 1990 which we have included in the Act represent a \nsignificant improvement in the program. The amendments will provide \nrenewable grants for agencies that meet performance standards \nestablished by HUD. In addition, housing authorities with urgent or \nserious crime needs are protected and will be assured an equitable \namount of funding.\n  Mr. President, the intent of these provisions is to provide more \ncertain funding for agencies with clear needs for funds and to assure \nthat both current funding recipients and other agencies with urgent or \nserious crime problems are appropriately assisted by the program. The \nprovisions will also reduce the administrative costs of the current \napplication process which entails a substantial paperwork burden for \nagencies and HUD. Under the terms of the amendments, HUD can establish \na fixed funding mechanism in which the relative needs of housing \nauthorities are addressed with a greater amount of certainty.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I concur with my colleagues. Drug \nElimination Grant funds have proven to be an extremely effective tool \nin fighting drugs and crime in public housing. This provision will \nenable housing authorities with significant needs to implement long-\nterm strategies to continue this important fight. I\n\n[[Page S11843]]\n\nappreciate the work of the Chairman on this important issue.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank both of my colleagues for their \nclarifying remarks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, once again, I find myself in the \nunpleasant position of speaking before my colleagues about unacceptable \nlevels of parochial projects in the VA/HUD appropriations bill. \nAlthough the level of add-ons in some portions of this conference are \ndown, this bill still contains approximately $865 million in wasteful \npork barrel spending. This is an unacceptable amount of low priority, \nunrequested, wasteful spending.\n  The level of add-ons in the Veterans Affairs section of this \nconference report is down. The total value of specific earmarks in the \nVeterans Affairs section of this conference report is about $116 \nmillion.\n  Let me just review some examples of items included in the bill. The \nbill directs $1 million for the VA's first-year costs to the Alaska \nFederal Health Care Partnership's proposal to develop an Alaska-wide \ntelemedicine network to provide access to health services and health \neducation information at VA, IHS, DOD and Coast Guard clinic facilities \nand linking remote installations and villages with tertiary health \nfacilities in Anchorage and Fairbanks.\n  An especially troublesome expense, neither budgeted for nor requested \nby the Administration for the past seven years, is a provision that \ndirects the Department of Veterans Affairs to continue the seven-year-\nold demonstration project involving the Clarksburg, West Virginia VAMC \nand the Ruby Memorial Hospital at West Virginia University. Last year, \nthe appropriations bill contained a plus-up of $2 million to the \nClarksburg VAMC that ended up on the Administration's line-item veto \nlist and that the Administration had concluded was truly wasteful.\n  The VA provides first-rate research in many areas such as \nprosthetics. However, some of my colleagues still prefer to direct the \nVA to ignore their priority research programs and instead provide \ncritical veterans health care dollars for parochial or special interest \nprojects. For example, this bill earmarks $3 million for the Center of \nExcellence at the Truman Memorial VA Medical Center in Missouri for \nstudies on hypertension, surfactants, and lupus erythematosus, and \nprovides $6 million in the medical and prosthetic research \nappropriation for Musculoskeletal Disease research in Long Beach, \nCalifornia. It is difficult to argue against worthy research projects \nsuch as these, but they are not a priority for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs.\n  Like transportation and military construction bills, the VA \nappropriations funding bill is no exception for construction project \nadditions to the President's budget request. For example, the bill adds \n$7.5 million in funding for the Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in \nMissouri for gravesite development which will provide 13,200 grave \nsites for full casket interments. Although this is a worthy cause, I \nwonder how many other national cemetery projects in other States were \nleapfrogged to ensure that Missouri's cemetery received in the VA's \nhighest priority.\n  In the area of critical VA, medical facility funding, again, certain \nprojects in key members' states received priority billing, including \n$20.8 million add for the Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center \nambulatory care renovation project in Ohio, a $9.5 million add for the \nLebanon, Pennsylvania VAMC for nursing unit renovations, including \nproviding patients with increased privacy, a $25.2 million add for \nconstruction of an ambulatory care addition at the Tucson VA Medical \nCenter in Arizona, and provides $125,000 for renovation of the Pershing \nHall building in Paris, France for memorial and private purposes.\n  Mr. President, we are charged with the important responsibility of \ndedicating funding toward the highest priorities to safeguard our \nenvironment. Yet, I am troubled that this conference report is loaded \nwith directed earmarks toward specific projects without adequate \nexplanation of why these projects are higher in priority than national \nenvironmental problems and needs.\n  I continue to hear about the number of Superfund sites that are in \ncritical need of remediation actions or leaking background storage \ntanks that continue to endanger lives. Yet, the picture that I am \nputting together from this report is a prioritization of member \ninterest projects. EPA's overall budget contains approximately \n$484,325,000 in earmarks that are directed to specific states and to \nnational organizations.\n  Rather than dedicating funding toward our most pressing environmental \nconcerns, the priorities of the conferees are earmarking spending of \n$125,000 for the establishment of a regional environmental finance \ncenter in Kentucky and $225,000 for a demonstration project in Maryland \nto determine the feasibility of using poultry litter as a fuel to \ngeneral electric power.\n  I commend the efforts of my colleagues who worked tirelessly to \nrectify differences between the two chambers and present us with this \nconference report. Each of them have worked diligently to ensure that \nimportant housing programs and initiatives are adequately funded in a \nfair and objective manner.\n  Contained in this bill is funding for many programs vital in meeting \nthe housing needs of our nation and for the revitalization and \ndevelopment of our communities. Many of the programs administered by \nHUD help our nation's families purchase their homes, assists low-income \nfamilies obtain affordable housing, combats discrimination in the \nhousing market, assists in rehabilitating neighborhoods and helps our \nnation's most vulernable--the elderly, disabled and disadvantaged have \naccess to safe and affordable housing.\n  In July, I came to the Senate floor and highlighted the numerous \nearmarks and set asides contained in the Senate version of this bill. \nAt that time, the egregious violations of the appropriate budgetary \nprocess in the HUD section amounted to $270.25 million dollars.\n  Unfortunately, I find myself coming to the floor today to again \nhighlight the numerous earmarks and budgetary violations which remain \nin the conference report of this bill. In the HUD section alone there \nis $265.1 million in set asides or earmarks. While this amount is \nslightly lower than when the Senate first considered this bill it is \nstill too great a burden for the American taxpayers.\n  The list of projects which received priority billing is quite long \nbut I will highlight a few of the more egregious violations. There is \n$1.25 million set aside for the City of Charlotte, NC to conduct \neconomic development in the Wilkinson Boulevard corridor, $1 million \nfor the Audubon Institute Living Sciences Museum in New Orleans and $2 \nmillion for the Hawaii Housing Authority to construct a community \nresource center at Kuhio Homes/Kuhio Park Terrace in Honolulu, Hawaii.\n  It is difficult to believe many credible and viable community \ndevelopment proposals may be excluded from access to federal housing \nfunds because such a large amount of funds have been unfairly set aside \nfor specific projects fortunate enough to have advocates on the \nappropriating committee.\n  Finally, I would like to comment on the public housing reform bill \nwhich is now included in this funding bill. In the limited period of \ntime I was afforded to examine this provision, I have learned that it \nincludes several initiatives intended to enhance the quality of life \nfor many individuals while promoting self sufficiency and personal \nresponsibility in our communities.\n  While I applaud these goals and will not object to this bill based on \nthe inclusion of this section I am gravely concerned about the process \nused to pass this reform bill. It concerns me that this complex measure \nwas inserted at the last moment during conference which precluded the \nSenate from having sufficient time to thoroughly examine its contents \nand fully evaluate its objectives. This is a very serious matter which \ndirectly impacts the lives of thousands of American families and our \nlocal communities.\n  Certainly, this issue deserves thoughtful deliberation and careful \nreview through the established legislative process and should not be \nattached at the last moment to a funding conference report. This is not \nthe manner in which we should be implementing meaningful reform \nintended to benefit the citizens of our nation.\n  Mr. President, I have touched on only the tip if the iceberg. There \nis more I\n\n[[Page S11844]]\n\ncould point to, were time available. I continue to look forward to the \nday when my trips to the floor to highlight member interest spending \nare no longer necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri has 7 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. I yield 7 minutes 30 seconds to the Senator from Florida. I \nwill ask my colleague, if there is additional time remaining, if he \nmight have 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I would be happy to work with the Senator. I would like \nto bring to my colleague's attention that Senator Sarbanes might be \nparachuting in, as well, to comment on the public housing initiatives. \nIf he lands, I want to be able to accommodate him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized for the \nremaining time.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of this \nconference report. I want to commend the chairman of the subcommittee, \nSenator Bond, and the ranking member, Senator Mikulski for bringing to \nthe floor a well-balanced bill.\n  I am extremely pleased that this bill contains a comprehensive reform \nof the nation's system of public and assisted housing. We began this \nprocess of reforming public housing more than three years ago. \nNegotiating this legislation was a long, difficult and sometimes \npainful process. But the end result is a carefully crafted, bipartisan \ncompromise that reflects input from the Senate, the House, and the \nadministration. I believe it is a good bill. I appreciate the \nindulgence of Chairman Bond in permitting the authorizing committee to \nutilize the appropriations process as the vehicle to enact these \nimportant reforms, and I appreciate his long-standing support of public \nhousing reform. In the end, it was the willingness of the \nAppropriations Committee to increase the level of incremental section 8 \nassistance that removed the last hurdle to this agreement.\n  I want to express special thanks to Senator Paul Sarbanes for his \ncritical role in the development of this legislation and in the recent \nnegotiations. I am convinced that this agreement would not have been \npossible without the leadership and support of the Senator from \nMaryland, and I can't thank him enough. I also want to thank the \nchairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Alfonse D'Amato, for his \nsteady support and guidance over the past 3 years, and also the ranking \nmember of the Housing Subcommittee, Senator Kerry, who has made major \ncontributions to this legislation. This has truly been a bipartisan \neffort throughout.\n  There are so many people that have played a role in this. Obviously, \nthe Secretary of HUD, Secretary Cuomo, and I spent many hours and many, \nmany phone calls trying to work through this and working also with \nCongressman Lazio, who made a special effort to try to find a way to \nbring this to a conclusion, and also the work of Congressman Lewis, the \nchairman of the subcommittee on the House side. So, again, this has \ntruly been a bipartisan effort. I thank all of those who were involved.\n  Since my appointment to the Banking Committee almost 10 years ago, I \nhave visited public housing developments throughout Florida and in \ncities like Detroit, Chicago, and Jersey City. I have seen public \nhousing that is well run and I have seen public housing that \nconcentrates the very poorest of the poor in developments that are \nhavens for crime and drug abuse and islands of welfare dependency.\n  On a personal note, I want to say to my colleagues that while I have \nbeen working on this specific legislation now for 4 years, I have been \ninvolved in public housing issues now for 10 years, since I have been \non the Banking Committee. There are two particular thoughts that come \nto my mind, two visits that I made.\n  I spoke with individuals that lived in public housing, and that \nsignificantly affected me. I am pleased to say it has had a major role \nin this legislation that we developed. One person was an individual \nfrom Liberty City in Miami, who, frankly, grew up in public housing in \nLiberty City and saw how public housing has changed since the late \n1930s. She--and I have used this term --``screamed'' at me as she was \nexplaining to me the problems she was dealing with and how she used to \nhave a decent place to live and how it had been destroyed over the \nyears. Her message was heard.\n  I also think of a little 4, 5, or 6-year-old boy in Melbourne, FL. \nWhen we walked out of an apartment that was totally destroyed, as we \nwalked down between these three-story buildings and saw the boarding up \nof windows and doors hanging by their hinges, this little fellow was \nwalking down between the buildings. I thought to myself, what kind of \nfuture can this little fellow possibly dream of if the only environment \nin which he was going to live was the public housing like we saw. I \nwanted to share that with my colleagues.\n  The time is long overdue for us to eliminate the disincentives to \nwork and economic self-sufficiency that trap people in poverty, and to \nease the complex, top-down bureaucratic rules and regulations that \naggravate the problems and prevent housing authorities from operating \neffectively and efficiently. It is time to begin the process of \ndeconcentrating the poor, create mixed-income communities with role \nmodels and establish a foundation for building communities of hope \ninstead of despair.\n  Let me make clear that this is only the beginning. The effect of \nthese reforms won't be felt overnight. We are creating a framework for \nmeaningful and beneficial change in our public and assisted housing \nsystem. But our ultimate success will depend on the ongoing cooperation \nand commitment of Congress, HUD, housing authorities, residents, and \nlocal communities.\n  The reforms contained in this legislation will significantly improve \nthe nation's public housing and tenant-based rental assistance program \nand the lives of those who reside in federally assisted housing. The \nfunding flexibility, substantial deregulation of the day-to-day \noperations and policies of public housing authorities, encouragement of \nmixed-finance developments, policies to deal with distressed and \ntroubled public housing, and rent reforms will change the face of \npublic housing for PHAs, residents, and local communities.\n  This bill empowers residents and promotes self-sufficiency and \npersonal responsibility. It institutes permanent rent reforms to remove \ndisincentives for residents to work, seek higher paying jobs and \nmaintain family unity. Further, it expands homeownership opportunities \nfor residents of both public and assisted housing.\n  It improves the living environment for public housing residents by \nexpanding opportunities for working poor families and providing \nflexibility for housing authorities to leverage private resources and \ndevelop mixed-income, mixed finance communities.\n  It refocuses the responsibility for managing public housing back to \nthe public housing authorities, residents and communities, it \neliminates counterproductive rules and regulations, and frees public \nhousing communities to seek innovative ways to serve residents.\n  The bill requires tough, swift action against PHA with severe \nmanagement deficiencies and provides HUD or court-appointed receivers \nwith the necessary tools and powers to deal with troubled agencies and \nto protect public housing residents.\n  It enhances safety and security in public housing by enhancing the \nability of public housing authorities to screen out and evict criminals \nand drug abusers who pose a threat to their communities.\n  Finally, the bill enhances resident choice. It merges the section 8 \nvoucher and certificate programs into a single, choice-based program \ndesigned to operate more effectively in the private marketplace. It \nrepeals requirements that are administratively burdensome to landlords, \nsuch as ``take-one, take-all,'' endless lease and 90-day termination \nnotice requirements. These reforms will make participation in the \nsection 8 tenant-based program more attractive to private landlords and \nincrease housing choices for lower income families.\n  To get to this stage, we have had to work through some very difficult \nand contentious issues. All sides have been willing to make concessions \nin the interest of compromise. I will mention only one of those \nissues--income targeting.\n\n[[Page S11845]]\n\n  At a time when housing resources are scarce, a strong argument can be \nmade that the bulk of housing assistance should be made available for \nthe very poor. At the same time, there is a concern that excessive \nconcentrations of the very poor in public housing developments have \nnegatively affected the liveability of those developments.\n  The final income targeting numbers of public housing and project-\nbased and tenant-based section 8 represent a fair compromise that will \nencourage mixed income communities in public housing, and ensure that \ntenant-based assistance remains an important tool for housing choice \nfor very low-income families.\n  Mr. President, this public housing reform bill is the first \ncomprehensive housing reform measure to pass Congress in almost six \nyears. It is a good, bipartisan package that represents the most \nsignificant reform of public and assisted housing in decades. I urge my \ncolleagues to adopt this conference report and I urge the President to \nsign the bill.\n  Mr. President, Senator Sarbanes was not here when I mentioned earlier \nhow much I appreciate his working with us, working with me, in trying \nto find ways to keep the process moving as we would hit roadblock after \nroadblock after roadblock. I want to extend to him publicly my \nappreciation for his work; also, again, to Senator Mikulski, and to \nSenator Bond. We know that we added to their difficulties. We greatly \nappreciate what they were able to accomplish with us.\n  Lastly, I want to mention some members of the staff. Jonathan Miller, \nand Matt Josephs of the minority staff, again, just went out of their \nway to help us accomplish this. David Hardiman and Melody Fennel--I \nthank them as well.\n  Chris Lord, Kari Davidson, and Cheh Kim of my staff did an \noutstanding job and worked endless hours to accomplish this, at moments \nof maybe thinking that we weren't going to make it but held in there to \nget the job done. I thank them.\n  I thank the Chair for his indulgence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 7 minutes 43 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield such time as he may use to Senator Sarbanes, \nand I very much appreciate his excellent work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the Chair.\n  First, although I am going to speak a little more later about our \ninvolvement in this process, I thank Senator Mack for his very generous \nand gracious comments, and I want to say that this bill would never \nhave happened but for his very fine leadership. I am extremely indebted \nto him for the very positive and instructive and understanding way he \nmoved this process forward. It has been a long and difficult process, \nbut I am very pleased that we have arrived at this day.\n  First, let me express my very strong support for this bill. I want to \ncommend Senator Mikulski and the chairman, Senator Bond, for their very \nexcellent work with respect to the matters before the Appropriations \nSubcommittee. In particular, I want to applaud them for the excellent \nbill they have written with regard to the funding for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development.\n  The President submitted a strong budget. And I am happy to see that \nthe bill now before us responds to many of those requests.\n  The bill represents a well-rounded approach to housing and economic \ndevelopment. It provides for 50,000 new vouchers targeted to helping \npeople move from welfare to work by eliminating the current 90-day wait \non reissuing vouchers upon turnover. The bill effectively adds another \n40,000 vouchers.\n  It provides $500 million in additional capital funds for public \nhousing modernization to help maintain this important affordable \nhousing resource. And the bill includes a total of $625 million for \nHOPE VI, the very innovative program that was created by my very able \ncolleague, Senator Mikulski, which is focused on tearing down the \nworst, most isolated public housing projects and replacing them with \nmixed-income housing. Senator Mikulski has been an absolute champion of \ntrying to rescue this situation which plagues many of our very large \nhousing projects. I want to acknowledge the tremendous leadership that \nshe has provided in this area. Working together with Senator Bond, they \nhave fashioned I think a first-rate piece of legislation. I am very \npleased to support it.\n  Let me say, since she is my very able colleague, what a pleasure it \nhas been working with her. I sit on the authorizing committee. Of \ncourse, she is on the appropriating committee. Over the years we have \nbeen able to work together I think in a partnership not only for our \nState but for the country.\n  Mr. President, the primary reason I come to the floor today is to \ncall the Senate's attention to the fact that an important piece of \nlegislation reforming the Nation's Public Housing Program is attached \nto this appropriations conference report. This is a tremendous step \nforward. This public housing legislation I think represents a fine \npiece of legislative craftsmanship. It reflects a bipartisan approach \nto reform of our public and assisted housing.\n  We have been working at this problem, Senator Mack has been working \nat this problem for 4 years, at least. The success of this effort \nreflecting what is before us, is, to a very significant extent, the \nresult of the fine leadership provided by Senator Mack as Chairman of \nthe Housing Subcommittee of the authorizing committee; the work of \nSenator Kerry, the ranking member of that subcommittee, interacting \nwith our House colleagues, and with Secretary Cuomo, who has been a \ntireless advocate for housing and economic development programs.\n  Senator Mack has taken a keen interest in the area of public housing \nsince he took over the housing subcommittee in 1995. He has personally \nvisited public housing projects and has spoken to administrators and \nresidents. The commitment of his own time and concern I think is a \nmodel of how people responsible for certain programs need to understand \nthe program, oversee the program, and then formulate the changes which \nwill make the program work better.\n  Senator Mack has been a strongly positive and constructive force \nthroughout the long and often difficult process we have followed to get \nthis positive resolution. I am pleased to express publicly my very deep \nrespect and appreciation for his efforts.\n  Mr. President, this public housing bill embodies an important \nbargain. We provide public housing authorities with increased \nflexibility to develop local situations to address housing needs in \ntheir communities but, in turn, they are required to use that \nflexibility to better serve their residents by creating healthier, more \neconomically integrated communities.\n  The PHAs will get more flexibility in how to use operating and \ncapital funds. It encourages them to seek new sources of private \ncapital to both build new housing and to repair existing units. It \nprovides more flexibility in the calculation of public housing \ndevelopment costs and encourages the construction of higher quality \nhousing.\n  Finally, the law gives PHAs increased flexibility to admit higher \nincome families while guaranteeing that the poor, including the working \npoor, continue to have access to 40 percent of the public housing units \nmade available each year.\n  This new increased flexibility is not an end in itself. The purpose \nis to provide higher quality housing in an overall improved living \nenvironment to the families who live in public housing. We want the \nPublic Housing Program and the Rental Voucher Program, which the \nappropriators have generously supported in this legislation, to be \nstepping stones to better lives, to provide access to better schools \nand more economic opportunities.\n  There is now a growing consensus that we need to have a mix of \nfamilies with different levels of income in public housing. Such a \npolicy will strengthen public housing projects and make them more \nlivable communities. To ensure this outcome, the legislation requires \nthe public housing authorities to demonstrate how they will attempt to \ncreate these more economically integrated communities. The Secretary\n\n[[Page S11846]]\n\nis required to review these plans and to ensure that housing \nauthorities pursue them.\n  The bill also creates new rent rules that encourage existing tenants \nto go to work. There is a mandatory earned income disregard so that \ntenants who start working will reap the benefit of that effort at least \nfor a year before additional payments are phased in. As a result of the \nspecial efforts of Senator Kerry, the bill deepens the targeting above \nthe levels contained in both House and Senate bills for section 8 \nvouchers, requiring 75 percent of vouchers to go to lower-income \nfamilies.\n  The bill gives tenants an important role in working with housing \nauthorities to determine housing policies. Residents will sit on \nboards, and the resident advisory boards I think will be very helpful.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. May I have 30 seconds, if the chairman has any time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland have an additional minute. I ask \nfor an additional 3 minutes on this side to afford 2 minutes to my \ncolleague from Ohio and a minute for myself to close.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman.\n  Finally, the bill helps encourage home ownership in two ways. First, \nas a result of an amendment offered by Senator Dodd, our able colleague \nfrom Connecticut, public housing authorities will be able to devote \npart of their public housing capital funds to home ownership \nactivities. In addition, section 8 assistance will be able to be used \nto support home ownership.\n  Mr. President, I close again by thanking Senator Bond and Senator \nMikulski for their very effective efforts. We are deeply appreciative \nof their cooperation. I again voice my respect for the tremendous \nleadership which Senator Mack provided in enabling us to achieve public \nhousing reform which we have been striving to achieve for a number of \nyears and to do it in a way that commands a consensus. The process we \nfollowed in working this out I really commend to all my colleagues. I \nthink it is an example of how really to craft legislation and in the \nend achieve a very positive and constructive result.\n  Finally, I want to recognize and thank the staff for their hard work \nand dedication. Jonathan Miller and Matt Josephs on the Democratic \nside, Chris Lord, Kari Davidson, Cheh Kim, David Hardiman, and Melody \nFennel from the Majority side, worked extremely well together to help \nus bring this finished product to the floor today.\n  In closing, Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss two important provisions in \nthis bill--provisions that honor two distinguished Ohioans who are \nretiring from public service this year--Lou Stokes and John Glenn.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us would name the Veterans \nAdministration Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, the Louis Stokes VA \nMedical Center. That is a fitting tribute for a number of reasons.\n  First, Lou Stokes is a veteran, serving our country in the U.S. Army \nduring the Second World War.\n  Second, as ranking member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on \nVeterans' Affairs, Lou Stokes has demonstrated that he is a true \nchampion on behalf of his fellow veterans.\n  Third, Lou Stokes in recent years has dedicated his attention to \nimproving the quality of care at the facility that will bear his name. \nHe has been working tirelessly with me to provide funds to improve this \nfacility for our veterans in northeast Ohio. This bill in fact contains \n$20.8 million to improve the ambulatory care unit at the Stokes Medical \nCenter. This is the latest of a lifetime of examples of how Lou Stokes \nhas made a difference--a difference for veterans and for all his \nconstituents.\n  I also am pleased and proud that the bill before us contains a \nprovision that, in my view, represents the deepest feelings of the \npeople of Ohio regarding our senior Senator John Glenn.\n  Mr. President, it would be fair to say that the imagination of Ohio, \nand indeed of all America, has been captured by Senator Glenn's \nimpending space voyage. It is an inspiring odyssey. It is exiciting--it \nreminds us of the spirit of American possibility we all thrilled to \nwhen John Glenn made his first orbit back in 1962.\n  Senator Glenn's return to space as a member of the crew of the space \nshuttle Discovery marks the culmination of an incredible public career.\n  This is man who flew 149 heroic combat missions as a Marine pilot in \nWorld War II and the Korean war--facing death from enemy fighters and \nantiaircraft fire.\n  And none of us who were alive back in 1962 can forget his historic \nspace flight. I was in Mr. Ed Wingard's science class, at Yellow \nSprings High School in Yellow Springs, Ohio--we were glued to the TV. \nOur hearts, and the hearts of all Americans, were with him that day.\n  John Glenn reassured us all that America didn't just have a place in \nspace. At the height of the cold war, he reassured us that we have a \nplace--in the future.\n  And that, Mr. President, brings me to the purpose of the legislation \nI am introducing. Even as we speak, in Cleveland, Ohio, there are some \nhardworking men and women of science who are keeping America strong, \nwho are keeping us on the frontier of the human adventure. They are the \nbrilliant, persevering, and dedicated workers of the NASA-Lewis Space \nResearch Center.\n\n  People who understand aviation know how crucially important the \ncutting-edge work of the NASA-Lewis scientists is, for America's \neconomic and technological future.\n  Mr. President, what more fitting tribute could there be to our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Glenn, than to rename this facility--\nin his honor?\n  That, Mr. President, is the purpose of this legislation. It \nrecognizes not just a man's physical accomplishments--but his spirit. \nIt inspired us in 1962. It inspires us this year. And it will remain \nstrong in the work of all those who expand America's frontiers.\n  The facility would be renamed the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration John H. Glenn Research Center at Lewis Field--to honor \nour distinguished colleague, and also the aviation pioneer for whom it \nis currently named. George Lewis became Director of Aeronautical \nResearch at the precursor to NASA in 1919. It was then called the \nNational Advisory Committee on Aeronautics, or NACA.\n  Lewis visited Germany prior to World War II. When he saw their \ncommitment to aeronautic research, he championed American investment in \naeronautic improvements--and created the center which eventually bore \nhis name.\n  He and John Glenn are pioneers on the same American odyssey. Ohio \nlooks to both of them with pride--and with immense gratitude for their \nleadership.\n  And I am proud, today, that we were able to include this in the bill. \nI thank my colleagues for that, and I also want to thank our good \nfriend, Louis Stokes, who has been instrumental in shepherding this \nmeasure honoring Senator Glenn in the other body.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Ohio.\n  I, too, join with him in expressing appreciation for the services of \nour colleague, Senator Glenn, and our colleague on the House side, \nCongressman Stokes. I believe it is very important that we recognize \nthem in this bill. I thank him for his comments.\n  Again, my sincerest thanks to Senator Mikulski, to Andy Givens, David \nBowers, and Bertha Lopez on their side. On my side, this is a very \ndifficult bill, and I could not have done it without the leadership of \nJon Kamarck and the dedicated efforts of Carrie Apostolou and Lashawnda \nLeftwich.\n  We have the statement by the chairman of the Budget Committee saying \nthis bill is within the budget guidelines.\n\n[[Page S11847]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure because I believe, while \nit has many compromises in it, they are reasonable compromises. I am \nmost hopeful that we can have a resounding vote and see this measure \nsigned into law.\n  I thank the Chair and staff for their courtesies, and I urge a yes \nvote on the conference report.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the VA-HUD \nconference report. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, yesterday evening the senior Senator from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, reached 100 presiding hours in the 105th \nCongress for his 100 hours of service presiding over the Senate. He \nwill be awarded the Golden Gavel. But there is an interesting point \nhere. This is the fifth Golden Gavel that Senator Gorton has obtained \nin his years in the Senate--representing 500 hours presiding in the \nSenate Chamber.\n  I think most Senators will acknowledge that he does an excellent job \nwhen he is the Presiding Officer. He is one we call on quite often on \nFriday afternoons or late at night. He is always willing to do it. And \nhe dedicates each one of these Golden Gavels to one of his \ngrandchildren. He has seven. This is the fifth one; so he has two more \nto go.\n  This is an assignment that takes time and patience. I publicly thank \nSenator Gorton for achieving this and for the way that he is doing it \nfor his grandchildren.\n  I ask my colleagues to join in expressing our appreciation.\n  (Applause.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do not know that anything else needs to be said, but I \ncertainly want to join with the majority leader in offering my \ncongratulations and my condolences for all of those hours. As one who \nhas only been presented one Golden Gavel in my time in the Senate, I \ncan appreciate the magnitude of the accomplishment just accomplished by \nthe senior Senator from Washington. On behalf of all of our colleagues, \nI join in congratulating the Senator.

I withdraw it and call up amendment No. 3711.\n  The amendment (No. 3711), as modified, was withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I object to that request to modify and I raise again the \npoint of order that the amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no request to modify the pending \namendment. There is a duly filed motion to suspend the rules with \nrespect to that amendment. The motion to suspend is debatable.\n  Is there further debate?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, point of parliamentary inquiry. Will there \nbe a ruling on the motion of the point of order as to germanity?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to suspend the rules needs to be \nresolved.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Further point of inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. What is the position relative to debate on the motion to \nsuspend the rules for the purpose of considering this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is operating under cloture, and the \nmotion will be debatable as under the limitation of the cloture rule.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, has the Chair ruled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                      Motion to Suspend the Rules\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. In full accordance with the rules and procedures of the \nSenate and pursuant to the notice filed yesterday, I move to suspend \nrule XXII as it applies to the consideration of amendment No. 3711.\n  And, Mr. President, for the information of my colleagues, I want to \nexplain what will occur here and the significance of this vote.\n  By the way, as far as the modification is concerned to amendment No. \n3711, since it is agreed on both sides, once we dispense with this \nparliamentary tactic, then obviously we will be able, by unanimous \nconsent, to modify to satisfy a concern that was not included in the \namendment.\n  At some point this morning we will vote to suspend the rules \nregarding germaneness with respect to the pending amendment. Senator \nWyden and I would have offered this amendment earlier, long before \ncloture was invoked, but we didn't because we were still negotiating \nlanguage with other Senators--specifically, the Senator from North \nDakota and other Senators--who were involved in this very important \npiece of legislation. We could have offered it and I am sure we could \nhave passed the amendment, but in the environment of trying to reach \noverall agreement on language of this legislation we did not do it at \nthat time. We did not propose this amendment in order to accommodate \nother Senators. As we all know, sometimes there are package agreements \ninvolving different parts of the legislation.\n  The Democratic manager of the bill, Senator Dorgan, Senator Wyden and \nmyself came to agreement on the language of the amendment. It was at \nthat time, and only at that time, we were notified that a point of \norder would be raised against the language, even though we have been \nnegotiating with the Senator from Florida and his staff since last \nAugust on this package. Doing so obviously is the Senator's right. I \ndon't begrudge any Senator their right to use the rules to his or her \nadvantage. But I do want to make it clear we tried to be fair and \naccommodate everyone who has left us in this position.\n  Simply, if we don't succeed in suspending the rules and adopting this \namendment, Senator Wyden and myself will no longer pursue this \nlegislation. It won't pass. Internet tax freedom, at least for this \nyear, will be dead. Because, Mr. President, failure to adopt this \namendment will render this bill impotent.\n  I suspect that may have been the desire of some Members all along, to \nkill this bill. Let there be no mistake, failure of this bill will hurt \nthe future of electronic commerce and will subject our constituents to \nnew taxes. Yes, a vote against suspending the rules is a vote to kill \nthe bill. Without the language of this amendment being added, the bill \nis meaningless; it will accomplish nothing. Therefore, we will not \npursue the legislation.\n  But this vote means more than killing the Internet Tax Freedom Act. \nAdopted to this bill was Senator Bryan's Children's Online Privacy Act. \nThat is a very important bill that will protect children who use the \nInternet. It is bipartisan legislation that was passed out of the \nCommerce Committee by a unanimous vote. If this bill dies today, \nSenator Bryan's Children Online Privacy Bill dies today.\n  Adopted to this bill was Senator Coats' Decency Act. That measure was \nadopted by a vote of 98-1 yesterday. The Coats amendment is exceedingly \nimportant to protect our children from pornography that is \nproliferating on the world wide web. If this bill dies today, Senator \nCoats' Decency Act dies today.\n  Adopted to this bill was Senator Dodd's amendment regarding \nfiltering. The Dodd amendment would require Internet service providers \nmaking filtering software available to families so that they can screen \nunwanted and harmful material from appearing on their computer. The \nDodd amendment has twice been adopted by the Senate. It is important.\n  Adopted to this bill was Senator Abraham's Digital Signature bill. \nThis bill was reported by the Commerce Committee with no opposition.\n  Mr. President, if we cannot suspend the rules and adopt this \namendment that is supported by both managers, the Internet tax bill is \ndead and so is the vital legislation sponsored by our colleagues.\n\n[[Page S11849]]\n\n  Let me briefly explain why this amendment is needed. The amendment \ndoes two things. First, it clarifies what is a discriminatory tax. This \nis necessary because without this definition the moratorium is rendered \nmeaningless. States and localities do not pass new laws every time a \nnew product appears. They simply interpret existing laws to apply to \nthe products. What we are seeking to do here is clarify that the \nInternet cannot be singled out for the application of a tax in a \ndiscriminatory manner. For example, if an entity has a wicket tax, or a \ncellular phone tax, or a microwave oven tax, it would not be able to \napply such tax in a discriminatory manner solely to the Internet and \nthereby claim the moratorium does not apply.\n  Mr. President, if this definition is not included in the bill, then \nthe moratorium is gutted.\n  The second part of the amendment clarifies that the location of a \nserver or of web pages does not constitute nexus. This is exceedingly \nimportant. If an individual in Iowa, sitting at his or her desk is \nsurfing the web and buys a product for his mother in Tennessee from a \ncompany in Maine, using a server located in Florida, the fact that the \nserver is located in Florida should not constitute nexus for the \npurposes of taxation. Neither the purchaser nor the company from which \nmerchandise was purchased, nor the recipient, under this example, lived \nin Florida.\n  So, again, this language simply clarifies this matter. We do not \nstate that the appearance of a catalog in someone's mailbox constitutes \nnexus. This provision simply updates that fact in the age of the \nInternet.\n  As technology bypasses us all and the use of the web becomes more and \nmore ubiquitous and seamless, we will need to protect the technology \nthat is fueling our economy. The issues of Quill and of who should and \nshould not have to pay taxes will and should be settled by the Congress \nand the States. But regardless of that outcome, this technology should \nnot be harmed by onerous, discriminatory, unfair--and in many cases--\noutdated laws.\n  To close, adoption of this amendment is vital to the passage of this \nlegislation. This vote is key to its passage. If we fail to muster the \n66 votes necessary, this bill will be dead. And as I have noted, some \nhave wanted to kill it all along. We were forced to file cloture on the \nmotion to proceed. We were forced to file cloture on the bill. We did \nall we could to accommodate all Senators with interests in this bill. \nWe protected the rights of Senators to offer and debate amendments.\n  We did not have to allow the senior Senator from Arkansas an \nopportunity to offer non-germane amendments prior to cloture we did. We \ncould have filled the tree or sat in quorum calls awaiting the cloture \nvote or final vote. But the Senate functions in a spirit of comity. So \nthe Senator from Arkansas had his opportunity and his votes.\n  The bill has been changed and amended. We have accepted language \noffered by Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas. We accepted language \noffered by my good friend Senator Enzi. I did not care for those \namendments, but I accepted the will of this body and I recognized that \nwe must move forward on this important legislation. Especially on \nlegislation like this, accommodations and concessions have to be made.\n\n  This bill does contain amendments which I wish were not in there, but \nthere are 100 Members here. I also agreed to go along with the will of \nthe majority, as did the Senator from North Dakota, as did the Senator \nfrom Oregon, and many other Senators who had deep and abiding interests \nin this legislation.\n  Again, this vote is exceedingly important if we are going to pass \nthis bill. If we waive the rules for the purpose of this amendment, we \ncan pass the bill and send it to the House. If we waive the rules, we \ncan protect the Internet from unfair and discriminatory taxation, and \nmore importantly, pass legislation that is vitally important to the \ncountry.\n  It is my understanding, and I ask parliamentary clarification, this \nmotion is debatable; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. But there is still a time limit that each individual \nSenator is allowed under the postcloture proceedings?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Parliamentary inquiry; how much time is remaining to the \nSenator from Florida?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida has 14 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Oregon yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. WYDEN. If that is all I am yielding for.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. How much time do I have remaining on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has 36 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I urge the Senate suspend the rules and \npass this important amendment.\n  First, let's be clear what happens if this amendment is passed. The \nmost important thing is that the grandfather on Internet tax provision \nthat was so central to the States is preserved and preserved \ncompletely.\n  Second, there is a separate section to ensure that all other existing \ntaxes are preserved, and that there is another provision that would \nensure that all ongoing liabilities--the matter the Senator from \nFlorida says is important to the State of Connecticut--is also \npreserved.\n  After we filed this amendment last night, we again reached out to all \nsides to try to address concerns. I have done this now for a year and a \nhalf. The original bill that came out of the Commerce Committee, by the \ntime it came to the floor, had more than 30 major changes. In our \nefforts here now to be reasonable, we have made at least another 20 \nchanges to try to accommodate the Senator from Florida and others. In \nfact, the definition of a discriminatory tax--which is what this is all \nabout--is essentially that which was used in the House, and it was \nagreeable to the Governors and the States when it was debated there in \nthe House. The reason that the Senator from Arizona and I have focused \non this issue is that this definition of discrimination is essential to \nensure technological neutrality.\n  What this definition does is straightforward. It ensures that the new \ntechnology and the Internet is not discriminated against. It makes sure \nthat a web site is treated like a catalog; catalogs aren't taxed. We \ndon't want web sites to be singled out for selective and discriminatory \ntreatment. The provision also makes sure that Internet service \nproviders are, in effect, treated like the mail. The mail isn't taxed \nwhen a product is shipped to your home from a catalog merchant. \nSimilarly, the Internet service provider should not be taxed merely for \nbeing the carriers or transmitters of information. In effect, Senator \nCoats recognized this in his amendment that was adopted yesterday.\n  So what we have done is, yesterday, we have worked with the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Senator Enzi, and others, to address this \ndiscriminatory tax question in a way that we thought would be agreeable \nto the States. Overnight, we tightened up the language to deal with the \ngrandfathering question. The minority leader, Senator Daschle, made \nsome important and, I thought, useful suggestions. We incorporated \nthose this morning to make sure that when we talk about the \ngrandfathering provision, as it relates to South Dakota and North \nDakota, the grandfather provision would tightly protect those two \nStates. We have done that.\n  This Senator finds now that if we do not prevail on this point and \nthe bill goes down, all of these efforts now for a year and a half are \ngoing to leave us in a situation where I think we will see, with \nrespect to the Internet and the digital economy, the same problems \ndevelop that cropped up with respect to mail order and catalogs. We \nhave had a number of people at the State and local level saying, you \nknow, with respect to the mail-order and catalog issue, we wish we had \ndone what you are bringing about with respect to the Internet.\n  We know that we have to have sensible policies so we can protect some \nof\n\n[[Page S11850]]\n\nthe existing sources of revenue for the States. Some call it the ``old \neconomy''; I don't. I think they are extremely important to the States. \nWe have to respect those, while at the same time writing the ground \nrules for the digital economy--the economy where the Internet is going \nto be the infrastructure and when every few months takes us to exciting \nnew fields and increases dramatically in revenue.\n  So I hope our colleagues will not cause all of the other important \nwork that has been done here to go down. That is Senator Dodd's \nlegislation and the important work done by Senator Bryan. There is a \nhost of good measures that we agreed to accept as part of this \nlegislation in an effort to be bipartisan and to accommodate our \ncolleagues.\n  But, once again, the goalposts are moving. The definition of \ndiscriminatory tax that came up in the House is essentially what we are \nusing. The Governors and the States found that acceptable. And then, \nafter taking that kind of approach, even last night, we moved again, at \nthe request of colleagues--and we thought they were reasonable \nrequests--to tighten up the grandfathering provision. Now is the time \nto make sure that we do not gut this bill, the definition of a \nmoratorium, and particularly don't gut a concept that we think is \nacceptable to our colleagues, and that is the concept of technological \nneutrality.\n  When you vote for the McCain-Wyden amendment to suspend the rules and \npass this, you will be voting for a solid grandfather provision that \nensures that all existing taxes are preserved. You will be voting to \nprotect ongoing liabilities, which is what the Senator from Florida \nsaid he is concerned about, along with the Senator from Connecticut, \nand others. You will be voting to make sure, in a separate section, \nthat all other existing taxes other than Internet taxes are preserved, \nand you will be voting for the principle of technological neutrality.\n  I think it would be a great mistake to gut this legislation now after \nall this progress has been made. I represent a State with 100,000 small \nbusinesses. These businesses are a big part of the economic future that \nwe all want for our constituents. They cannot afford a crazy quilt of \ntaxes that would be applied by a good chunk of the Nation's 30,000 \ntaxing jurisdictions, based on what we have seen during this debate.\n  Let's do this job right. Let's do it in a thoughtful and uniform way. \nI urge our colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment Senator \nMcCain and I have offered. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, for those here on the floor and those who \nmay be watching this on C-SPAN, I apologize, because we are about to \nenter some very arcane and not particularly exciting discussion. But it \nis necessary in order to understand what this amendment does and what \nit doesn't do. First, what it doesn't do.\n  Mr. President, this amendment starts by saying on page 26 of the bill \nthat is before us that we will strike lines 3 through line 5 on page \n27. So for those of you who have access to the legislation, I ask if \nyou will turn to those pages. If you don't have access to the \namendment, I am going to make a statement.\n  Unfortunately, both of those who have spoken--well, Senator Wyden is \non the floor. I would like him to listen to this statement. If he feels \nI am misstating--since it is not my intention to have to read all of \nthis language--would he please indicate where I am misstating. But as I \nread the amendment, with the exception of changing the numeration--that \nis, what was listed as an (a) in the Senate Finance committee language \nis listed as a small paragraph letter (i) in the McCain amendment \nnumber 3711. With the changes of those numerations, the words in the \namendment are almost verbatim to the words that are being stricken from \nline 3 on page 26 through line 5 on page 27. Is that an accurate \nstatement?\n  Mr. WYDEN. We are anxious to be responsive to the Senator from \nFlorida, but we are having trouble locating this. Why don't we do this: \nContinue, if you will, with your address and we will try to get the \npage numbers right.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. If there is a difference, I will yield to indicate that. \nIn my reading of the amendment, I cannot find any substantial \ndifference between the language that was in the Finance Committee's \ndraft and the language that is in this amendment. We are striking out \non the one hand and reinserting on the other. The difference begins \nwith a new subparagraph added by the amendment, which is subparagraph \nRoman numeral (iv), beginning on line 16 of page 2 of the amendment \nthrough line 22. It is my understanding that paragraph will be deleted.\n  Mr. WYDEN. We agreed to take that paragraph out yesterday.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. So that is not an issue of controversy.\n  And Roman numeral (v), which is the new language under discriminatory \ntax, is acceptable.\n  Two-thirds of the amendment that is offered is not in contest, either \nbecause it is in existing law--so whether we adopt the amendment or \nnot, it is still going to be in the legislation--or it is acceptable.\n  All the controversy, therefore, focuses on page 3, lines 5 through \n23, which is the language that has been referred to as the ``nexus'' \nlanguage. This language essentially as presented in this amendment was \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee. It was reviewed by the Senate \nFinance Committee and, on the recommendation of both the majority and \nminority legal counsel, was stricken from the bill.\n  What was the basis, Mr. President, that the Finance Committee made \nsuch a recommendation to strike what is now the essence of lines 5 \nthrough 23 from this bill? These are the arguments that the Finance \nCommittee was persuaded by. It determined that the areas of nexus, \nwhich relate to the subject of how much of a presence does an entity \nsuch as a business have to have in a State to make it subject to that \nState's tax authority. It determined that the areas of nexus were \nsufficiently clear under today's law that it was inappropriate to \ninclude such standards in Federal legislation.\n  The basis of nexus: As the Presiding Officer, who was a distinguished \nmember of the State Senate of the State of Wyoming, knows and from his \nprofessional career as a CPA, nexus has traditionally been determined \nby State law, not by Federal law. Each State determines what is the \nnecessary presence for taxation. There are, of course, limits as to \nState law under constitutional provision for interstate commerce. But \nwithin that standard, the States have been the determinative bodies.\n  According to the Finance Committee staff, there has only been one \nother Federal law, and that was passed 40 years ago, in 1959, which \nrelates to the issue of federalization of what those standards of nexus \nwould be.\n  So the essential position of the Finance Committee was, first, that \nthis is a matter that was being properly dealt with at the State level, \nand that was not a compelling reason why we should federalize the issue \nof nexus.\n  Second, they found that no State is currently attempting to enforce a \ntax collection obligation on the basis of the circumstances outlined in \namendment; therefore, there was no necessity for this federalization, \nand that it would lead to potentially increased litigation over the \nnuances of this language. I am going to talk about that in a moment.\n  Finally, that the enactment of this amendment would create special \nfederalized rules for a very small subset of the retail community. And \nit is inappropriate--for a bill that is intended to cause a timeout, a \npause, a moratorium, on State action to allow a commission to develop \nrecommendations on appropriate rules for taxation--for us now to \nessentially preempt that whole process by federalizing a significant, \nalbeit very niche, area of commerce.\n  So those are the reasons that the Senate Finance Committee voted to \neliminate this language in the bill. Certainly the Finance Committee \nwas not adverse to the thrust of the bill, because it passed the bill \non a 19-to-1 vote. The idea that by failing to include this language we \nwould be ``gutting'' the bill is, in my opinion, an extreme \noverstatement.\n  Mr. President, beyond those reasons that were given by the Finance \nCommittee, there is also another set of concerns which have come to \nlight as this\n\n[[Page S11851]]\n\namendment has been increasingly in the public attention. That is the \nfact that there are States which either are or are potentially in \nlitigation with various providers within the Internet industry over the \nquestion of their tax liability to a State. We have been sensitive to \nthat in this legislation by providing a grandfather clause, which \nessentially protects the right of those States. As presented, this \nnexus amendment clause is retroactive, as the discriminatory tax \ndefinition in this bill is not covered by the general grandfather \nclause, and would apply to past events.\n  There is concern that the effect of this legislation would be to tilt \nthe playing field in the courtroom of that litigation by making it more \ndifficult on a retroactive basis for the States to make their arguments \nabout an adequate nexus to the State as the basis of taxation of these \nInternet providers.\n  I don't think that this Congress wants to get into the business of \nintruding itself into ongoing litigation which might involve the State \nof Mississippi, or the State of North Dakota, or the State of Arizona, \nor the State of Florida, or any other State. That is not our business--\nto retroactively insert ourselves into that thicket of litigation.\n  Mr. President, it is for those reasons that I believe this amendment \nis defective. This Senate has adopted rules that provide that, after \ncloture has been invoked, the only amendments that can be considered \nare those that are germane to the bill.\n  The very fact that the sponsors of this amendment have filed what is \na very unusual motion to suspend the Senate's rules as it relates to \ngermanity is an indication that, first, they don't think it is germane; \nand, second, that under the rules of the Senate it should not be \ndebatable in this postcloture environment.\n  As the managers and sponsors of this bill, they have had ample \nopportunity to get this language included throughout this long and \ntedious process. They have not done so. Now, in the postcloture \nenvironment, they are asking us to waive a fundamental rule of the \nSenate, which is, after cloture has been invoked, the cloture which was \nfiled by the primary sponsor of the bill, now they want to be able to \ntake up what is tacitly admitted to be a nongermane amendment, an \namendment which was rejected after thorough analysis by the Senate \nFinance Committee, a measure which I think would have the effect of \ninjecting us into litigation and affecting potential litigation between \nthe States and various Internet providers.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues that we not adopt this \nmotion, that we not change our rules, that we play by the rules that we \nhave all agreed to, and that we play by the rules that have been in \neffect between States and the Internet industry in the past, and not \nretroactively reach back and adopt a provision which could interfere \nwith the normal resolution of pending litigation.\n  Having said all of that, Mr. President, it is my hope that while this \ndiscussion has been going on, there have been good-faith efforts made \nto arrive at a resolution of this issue, and it would be my suggestion \nto have possibly a brief period by suggesting the absence of a quorum \nso that we might see if in fact we have arrived at a resolution that \nwould obviate the necessity of the several steps that would be required \nin order to further pursue this matter. I think that would be in \neverybody's interest.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). The clerk will call the role.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n3711 be withdrawn, and I send to the desk amendment No. 3711, with a \nmodification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3711) was withdrawn.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3711, As Modified\n\n(Purpose: To define what is meant by the term ``discriminatory tax'' as \n                           used in the bill.)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the new amendment as so \nmodified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 3711, as modified.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 26, beginning with line 3, strike through line 5 on \n     page 27 and insert the following:\n       (2) Discriminatory tax.--The term ``discriminatory tax'' \n     means--\n       (A) any tax imposed by a State or political subdivision \n     thereof on electronic commerce that--\n       (i) is not generally imposed and legally collectible by \n     such State or such political subdivision on transactions \n     involving similar property, goods, services, or information \n     accomplished through other means;\n       (ii) is not generally imposed and legally collectible at \n     the same rate by such State or such political subdivision on \n     transactions involving similar property, goods, services, or \n     information accomplished through other means, unless the rate \n     is lower as part of a phase-out of the tax over not more than \n     a 5-year period;\n       (iii) imposes an obligation to collect or pay the tax on a \n     different person or entity than in the case of transactions \n     involving similar property, goods, services, or information \n     accomplished through other means;\n       (iv) establishes a classification of Internet access \n     service providers or online service providers for purposes of \n     establishing a higher tax rate to be imposed on such \n     providers than the tax rate generally applied to providers of \n     similar information services delivered through other means; \n     or\n       (B) any tax imposed by a State or political subdivision \n     thereof, if--\n       (i) except with respect to a tax (on Internet access) that \n     was generally imposed and actually enforced prior to Oct. 1, \n     1998, the sole ability to access a site on a remote seller's \n     out-of-State computer server is considered a factor in \n     determining a remote seller's tax collection obligation; or\n       (ii) a provider of Internet access service or online \n     service is deemed to be the agent of a remote seller for \n     determining tax collection obligations solely as a result \n     of--\n       (I) the display of a remote seller's information or content \n     on the out-of-State computer server of a provider of Internet \n     access service or online services; or\n       (II) the processing of orders through the out-of-State \n     computer server of a provider of Internet access service or \n     online services.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, let me say that I intend, after the \nSenator from Florida and the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and I speak on this, there is no controversy associated \nwith it, that we would ask the amendment be agreed to. I would, at that \ntime, request unanimous consent to withdraw my motion to suspend the \nrules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making that request at this \ntime?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I make that request at this time. I ask unanimous consent \nto withdraw my motion to suspend the rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The motion was withdrawn.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida. This has \nbeen a tough battle. It has been a very difficult set of negotiations. \nWe have disagreed on several issues, but we have reached a compromise. \nI thank him for his willingness to do that.\n  I also thank the good offices of the Senator from North Dakota whose \ncalm demeanor has prevailed throughout this entire process we have been \nthrough. This amendment represents a compromise--another compromise--\nthat has been made in the process of this legislation among ourselves \nand the Senator from Florida, and I thank him for it.\n  After the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Oregon speak, I \nhope we can adopt the amendment at that time. Then I hope we can go to \nfinal passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the areas that have been most recently \ndiscussed with respect to this legislation are arcane, complicated \nareas dealing with nexus, jurisdiction of tax and so on. There are not \na lot of people who understand the nuances of all of those\n\n[[Page S11852]]\n\nwords and all of the provisions. That is why it was hard to sift \nthrough all of this and reach an agreement. But an agreement has been \nreached that I think is a good agreement, one that accomplishes the \npurpose of this legislation in a manner that is not injurious to any \nother interests.\n  I thank the Senator from Arizona--I would say for his patience, but \nhe is a Senator who is impatient to get things done on the Senate \nfloor. I understand that and accept that, as do others. That is the \nreason he brings a lot of legislation to the floor and is successful \nwith it.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon who has been at this task for a long, \nlong time and has been very determined to help get this legislation \nthrough the Senate.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Florida, one of the admirable \nqualities of that Senator, among many, is his stubborn determination to \nmake certain that when things are done here, they are done the right \nway and that he understands it and that the interests affected are \nprotected in a manner that is consistent with what he views as a matter \nof principle. I know that is frustrating for some, but the Senator from \nFlorida certainly has that right. He contributes to this process by \nbeing determined to make certain we understand the consequences of all \nof this.\n  I thank him for working with us now in these final moments to reach \nan agreement that I think is the right agreement. We will pass this \nlegislation, and I think we have accomplished something significant.\n  Mr. President, let me also indicate that my staff member, Greg Rohde, \nwho has been working on these issues for many, many years with me, has \ndone an outstanding job, as well as have other staff who have helped \nwork through this process. I thank him for his work. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I understand I only have 22 seconds. I \nwant to say some positive things. I ask that I may be yielded----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the Senator from Florida as much time as he may \nuse from my time.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate that generosity, and I will \nnot overly indulge. Let me say, we have reached an honorable resolution \nto this issue which, for those who have been listening to this arcane \ndebate, I will summarize by saying a significant issue will be made \nprospective in its application and not have retroactive application. \nReading the language we have agreed to add to the McCain amendment \n3711, which makes a portion of the nexus language prospective, in \ncombination with the definition of ``tax on internet access,'' which \nwas agreed to earlier, this amendment should not interfere with \nlitigation between States and internet service providers. With that \nagreement, that has brought the various parties of interest into \nconcurrence.\n  What I want to say, Mr. President, is the three people who have been \nparticularly active on this issue, who are on the floor now--Senator \nMcCain of Arizona, Senator Dorgan of North Dakota, Senator Wyden of \nOregon--are three of the finest people with whom I have had the \nprivilege to serve in public office. If America was going to judge the \nquality of its public officials, I would be happy to be judged by these \nthree men.\n  As the Senator from Arizona said, we have had some degree of \ncontroversy, but that is the nature of the democratic process. If this \nwere a passive and tranquil process where everybody voted 400 to 0, \nthat would be reminiscent of the way in which the Soviet Union used to \noperate its parliament, not the U.S. Senate.\n  I think we have come to not only an appropriate resolution of this \nspecific amendment, but I am proud where we are overall. We have \nachieved the purpose of having a reasonable period of timeout, with a \nthoughtful commission to be appointed to study some extremely \ncomplicated areas, the intersection of a legal system that is complex \nin areas of State-Federal relations, telecommunications and a highly \ncomplex new set of technologies.\n  This is an appropriate area for us to stand back and ask for the \nassistance of some thoughtful citizens who can bring their wisdom and \nexperience to bear and give us the framework of some policy that then \nwill be returned to the Senate and to the House of Representatives for \nenactment, as well as to the various State legislatures for their \nconsideration.\n  I think we have, at the end of this process, arrived at exactly what \nour framers of this Constitution intended the legislative branch to do. \nI am proud to vote not only for this amendment but for the bill on \nfinal passage, and I look forward to the commission's work over the \nnext several months and a return to these subjects in the year 2000 or \n2002.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their very significant leadership in \nbringing us to this position.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from North \nDakota.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Tyler Candee \nbe accorded the privilege of the floor for the rest of the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I also would like to take this opportunity \nto thank Mr. Russ Sullivan, who is legislative director in my office, \nand Kate Mahar, who has worked with him. They have been on a fast \nlearning curve on these issues, fortunately, about 12 hours ahead of \nmyself. I publicly thank them for their contribution to this final \nconclusion.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I think this may well \nbe a historic day. What the U.S. Senate is doing is beginning to write \nthe ground rules for the digital economy. As we have seen just in the \nlast hour again, it is going to be a tough job.\n  We have had just in the last hour another set of questions that have \ncome up with respect just to the terminology that is used in this new \nfield. For example, some States call an Internet access tax a tax on \non-line services.\n  What we have done now as a result of the agreement among the Senator \nfrom Arizona, the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from Florida \nand myself, is we have said that we are going to treat those terms the \nsame way when, in fact, they have the same effect. I think that this \nexercise, while certainly laborious and difficult, is just an \nindication of the kind of challenges we have to overcome.\n  I thank particularly the Senator from Florida. He feels very strongly \nabout this issue and has made the case again and again to me that it is \nimportant to do this job right, and I share his view. I thank him for \nhis courtesies.\n  The Senator from North Dakota and I have been debating this \nlegislation now for a year and a half, probably at a much higher \ndecibel level than either of us would have liked.\n  The chairman of the committee, Chairman McCain, and I have been \nfriends for almost 20 years now. For this freshman Senator--not even a \nfull freshman, an arrival in a special election--to have a chance to \nteam up on this important piece of legislation is a great thrill. I \nthank him and his staff for all of their courtesies.\n\n  Before I make any final comments, I want to thank Ms. Carole Grunberg \nof our office who again and again, when this legislation simply did not \nlook like it could go forward, persisted. And she, along with Senator \nDorgan's staff and Senator McCain's staff, has helped to get us to this \nexciting day.\n  I am particularly pleased, Mr. President--I will wrap up with this--\nfor the benefits that this legislation is going to have for people \nwithout a lot of political power in America. I think about the 100,000 \nhome-based businesses I have in my State. I think about the disabled \nfolks who are starting little businesses in their homes. For them, the \nInternet is the great equalizer. It allows people who think of \nthemselves as the little guy to basically be able to compete in the \nglobal economy with the big guys.\n\n[[Page S11853]]\n\n  Unless we come up with some ways to make uniform some of these \ndefinitions and terms, which is what we have been trying to do in the \nlast hour--and we have made some real headway and reached a success--\nthose little guys are going to find it hard to compete.\n  So I look forward to continuing the discussions with our colleagues \nas we look to other questions with respect to the Internet. This, it \nseems to me, is just the beginning of the discussion rather than the \nend.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues now to support this modified \namendment, to support the bill, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I again thank Senator Wyden, Senator \nDorgan, the Senator from Florida, Senator Graham, and all who were \ninvolved in this very difficult and very complex issue. I also thank my \nstaff--all of them, including Mark Buse.\n  I also would like to add to the comments of the Senator from Florida, \nSenator Graham, who said this is how the process should work. It has \nbeen very tough, very difficult, very time-consuming, but I think the \nmagnitude of the legislation we are considering probably warranted all \nof that--and perhaps more. So I thank him very much. And as far as the \nfreshman from Oregon is concerned, he has certainly earned his spurs as \na member of the Commerce Committee.\n  By the way, I also thank the Chair for his involvement in this issue. \nHe is probably the most computer literate Member of the U.S. Senate. We \nobviously value his talent and expertise and look forward to the day \nwhen he has his laptop on the floor for its use that so far we have \nfailed to achieve but someday I hope we do.\n  I also mention one other person, Congressman Cox over in the other \nbody, who has also played a key role in the development of their \nlegislation on the other side. He has done a tremendous job, \nCongressman Cox of California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3711, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3711), as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3718, As Further Modified\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I send to the desk a modification to amendment No. 3718 \nand ask unanimous consent that it to be adopted. Mr. President, the \nsituation is that some written language that had been included in that \namendment was not legible in the printer, so we had to remodify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3718), previously agreed to, as further modified, \nfollows:\n       On page 29, beginning with line 20, strike through line 19 \n     on page 30 and insert the following:\n       (8) Tax.--\n       (A) In general.--The term ``tax'' means--\n       (i) any charge imposed by any governmental entity for the \n     purpose of generating revenues for governmental purposes, and \n     is not a fee imposed for a specific privilege, service, or \n     benefit conferred; or\n       (ii) the imposition on a seller of an obligation to collect \n     and to remit to a governmental entity any sales or use tax \n     imposed on a buyer by a governmental entity.\n       (B) Exception.--Such term does not include any franchise \n     fee or similar fee imposed by a State or local franchising \n     authority, pursuant to section 622 or 653 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 542, 573), or any other \n     fee related to obligations or telecommunications carriers \n     under the Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\n       (9) Telecommunications service.--The term \n     ``telecommunications service'' has the meaning given such \n     term in section 3(46) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 153(46)) and includes communications services (as \n     defined in section 4251 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986).\n       (10) Tax on Internet Access.--The term ``tax on Internet \n     access'' means a tax on Internet access, including the \n     enforcement or application of any new or preexisting tax on \n     the sale or use of Internet services; unless such tax was \n     generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, \n     1998.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. I'd like to take a moment to express my strong support for \nS. 442, the Internet Tax Freedom Act. In my view, S. 442 is a necessary \nfirst step to ensure that the Internet remains user-friendly to persons \nand businesses who seek to use it as a primary forum in which to \nconduct commerce. Before I begin, I'd like to credit my colleague from \nOregon, Senator Wyden, for his hard work on this legislation and for \nhis longtime and pioneering leadership on Internet issues, both when he \nwas in the House and now as a member of the Commerce Committee in the \nSenate. I'd also like to thank Senator McCain for his steadfastness and \ndetermination in ensuring that this important legislation is considered \nby the full Senate.\n  The Internet holds great promise to expand prosperity and bring ever \nmore Americans into the national economy. In the past, to open a store \nand sell goods to the public, a merchant needed to find a good location \nfor a storefront, build-out the store front, maintain its interior, pay \nrent and deal with myriad other business and legal concerns. All of \nthese actions consume time and often scarce resources. To many \nAmericans, they present an unreachably high bar to starting or \nmaintaining a business. The Internet will allow millions of Americans \nto sell goods and services online, and will dispense with many of the \nburdensome costs involved with starting and maintaining a business. One \ngreat impediment, however, to the evolution of commerce over the \nInternet is the immediate threat of both disparate taxing jurisdictions \nand inequitable taxation.\n  A product offered over the Internet can be purchased by anyone with a \ncomputer and a modem, regardless of the town or state in which the \nperson lives. Imagine needing to know the tax consequences of selling \nto each of the thousands of taxing jurisdictions in the country as a \nprerequisite to starting a business. This problem becomes even more \ncomplex if states and localities begin to impose taxes on electronic \ntransactions or transmissions as such, in addition to sales, use and \nother taxes.\n  This legislation attempts to reasonably address this concern by \nimposing a brief moratorium specifically on the inequitable taxation of \nelectronic commerce. It will allow the federal government, the states, \nthe Internet industry and Main Street businesses a brief time-out to \nrationally discuss the several issues involved in Internet taxation and \nto develop a reasonable approach to taxation which permits electronic \ncommerce to thrive in America. In my view, the legislation does not \nseek to deprive states of needed tax revenue. Senators Wyden and McCain \nhave gone to great lengths to minimize those existing taxes that would \nbe affected. In addition, the bill expressly grandfathers existing \nstate taxes on Internet access. What the bill does, however, is attempt \nto ensure that the development of the Internet is not hampered by a \nhodge-podge of confusing state and local taxes.\n  This bill was carefully negotiated to address competing equities. \nStates and localities certainly have very real and legitimate needs to \nraise revenue to support vital state and community functions. By the \nsame token, the Internet and the promise it holds for our economy, for \nschools, for children and families, and for our democracy is also very \ncompelling. It is a wholly new medium whose mechanics, subtleties and \nnuances few of us really understand. I do not hear any Senator stating \nthat electronic commerce should never be the basis of tax revenue, and \nI do not believe any Senator is trying to permanently deprive states of \ninherent privileges. Instead, the bill strives to create a brief period \nduring which we in government and those in business can attempt to \nbetter understand this new medium and create a sensible policy that \npermits the medium to flourish as we all want.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act. This legislation imposes a temporary \nmoratorium on taxes relating to the Internet and establishes a \nCommission to study and make recommendations for international, \nFederal, state, and local government taxes of the Internet and other \ncomparable sales.\n  This legislation reflects the exciting times in which we live--a time \nwhen commerce between two individuals located a thousand miles apart \ncan take place at the speed of light. Today, names like Netscape, \nAmazon.com, Yahoo, and America On-Line are household names--each a \nsuccessful company in a new and exciting global\n\n[[Page S11854]]\n\nbusiness community. And they are only a few of literally thousands who \nprovide their goods and services over the Internet.\n  They compete in a world where technological revolutions take place on \na daily basis, and they benefit the lives of families everywhere. Even \nin America's most remote communities, our children have access to the \nseven wonders of the world, to metropolitan art museums, electronic \nencyclopedias, and the world's great music and literature. These \ncompanies--and the countless companies like them--are pioneers. And the \nnew frontier is exciting, indeed.\n  In the new realm of cyberspace, government has three choices: lead, \nfollow, or get out of the way. The legislation we introduce today is a \nclear indication that government is prepared to lead. It demonstrates \nthat Congress is not going to allow haphazard tax policies, and a lack \nof foresight to get in the way of the growth and potential of this new \nand promising medium. It makes it clear that government's interaction \nwith Internet commerce will be well-considered and constructive--\nbeneficial to future prospects of Internet business and the individuals \nthey service.\n  From the introduction of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, in early 1997, \nmembers of the Finance Committee expressed keen interest in considering \nthis legislation. The Finance Committee has clear jurisdiction over \nstate and local taxes--it's also the place for trade issues. And this \nJuly, we received a referral of the bill. We conducted a hearing on the \nissues and listened to witnesses detail the growth and potential of the \nInternet. Witnesses also articulated the many sides and concerns \nassociated with the tax implications of Internet commerce.\n  Following our hearing, the Finance Committee held a markup, where we \napproved an amendment in the nature of a substitute to the original \nbill reported out of the Commerce Committee. The Finance Committee made \nsignificant improvements to the original legislation. We beefed up the \ntrade component of the bill. We directed the USTR to examine and \ndisclose the barriers to electronic commerce in its annual report. And \nwe declared that it is the sense of Congress that international \nagreements provide that the Internet remain free from tariffs and \ndiscriminatory taxation.\n  The Finance Committee's substitute also shortened the moratorium \nperiod on State and local taxes relating to the Internet. We did this \nwith an understanding that the advisory commission, set up in the \nlegislation, would not need the five year period that was set out in \nthe original Commerce bill. At the same time, we streamlined the \nAdvisory Committee and focused its study responsibilities.\n  We took out any grandfather provision, feeling that as a policy \nmatter, there should not be any taxes on the Internet during the \nmoratorium period--regardless of whether some States had jumped the gun \nand applied existing taxes to Internet access. The Finance Committee \nalso felt that this bill should be an example to our international \nnegotiating partners--that if we wanted to keep grandfather provisions \nout of the international agreements, that we should remove them from \nour domestic taxation.\n  I recognize that there have been various floor amendments that have \nchanged some of the things we did in the Finance Committee. Despite \nthose amendments, the central thrust of the legislation, which is to \ncall a time-out while a commission assesses the Internet and makes some \nrecommendations about how we should tax electronic commerce, remains. \nImportant international provisions--relating to trade and tariff \nissues--also remain unchanged.\n  Mr. President, I support the Internet Tax Freedom Act. It is a \ndemonstration of Congress' understanding of the exciting potential and \nthe opportunities that will be realized in cyberspace. It is a \nthoughtful approach to a very important issue. It meets current needs, \nand allows continued growth in this new frontier. I hope my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I first want to thank the Chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for his insistence that the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act be considered by the Finance Committee before \nany action on this floor. I recognize and applaud all of the effort \nthat has gone into the other proposals dealing with this subject, and \nin particular we should acknowledge the work of Senators Wyden, McCain, \nDorgan, Graham, Lieberman, and Gregg.\n  Since June of 1997, the chairman and I sought referral of this \nlegislation to give the Finance Committee the opportunity to consider \nthe important tax and trade issues related to the Internet, which by \nsome estimates will grow to $300 billion of commercial transactions \nannually by the year 2000. The bill was finally referred to the Finance \nCommittee on July 21st of this year.\n  That referral to the Finance Committee was consistent with Senate \nprecedents. In recent years, the Finance Committee has had jurisdiction \nover at least two other pieces of legislation with direct impact on \nstate and local taxes. Both the ``source tax'' bill that was of great \ninterest to Senators Bryan, Reid, and Baucus, prohibiting states from \ntaxing the pensions of former residents, and Senator bumpers' mail \norder sales tax proposal, requiring mail order companies to collect and \nremit sales taxes due on goods shipped across state lines, were \nreferred to the Finance Committee.\n  The legislation before us today also deals directly with \ninternational trade. It requests that the administration continue to \nseek trade agreements that keep the Internet free from foreign tariffs \nand other trade barriers. As reported by the Finance Committee, this \nbill would establish trade objectives designed to guide future \nnegotiations over the regulation of electronic commerce--issues clearly \nwithin the Finance Committee's jurisdiction.\n  A few comments on the substance of this legislation. I am not \nentirely persuaded that there is a pressing need for a federal \nmoratorium on the power of state and local governments to impose and \ncollect certain taxes, but it seems clear that such a moratorium does \nenjoy a great deal of support. The two-year moratorium period in the \nFinance Committee bill and the three-year period agreed to as a floor \namendment during this debate is surely preferable to the six-year \nprovision in the Commerce Committee bill.\n  There is some question whether such a moratorium is actually \nnecessary. New York is proof that States do not need a directive from \nCongress to act on this matter: Governor Pataki and the New York State \nlegislature have agreed on a bill exempting Internet access services \nfrom State or local sales, use, and telecommunications taxes. The \nGovernor's legislation also makes it clear that out-of-state businesses \nwill not be subject to State or local taxes in New York solely because \nthey advertise on the Internet.\n  I am pleased that the Finance Committee's bill preserves the right of \nStates or local governments to collect tax with respect to transactions \noccurring before July 29, 1998 (the date of Finance Committee action). \nFurther, I am pleased that language has been added on the floor that \ngoes beyond the Finance Committee bill and ``grandfathers'' any \nexisting State and local taxes on Internet activity occurring during \nthe period of the moratorium.\n  With respect to the Advisory Commission on Electronic Commerce \nestablished, a membership of 16, almost half of that in the House bill, \nis manageable and is more likely to lead to meaningful recommendations. \nAn item of particular interest to me is the requirement in that the \nCommission examine the application of the existing Federal \n``communications services'' excise tax to the Internet and Internet \naccess. We need to know more about how and whether that tax should \napply to new technology.\n  This bill is not perfect, but on balance I believe it deserves our \nsupport. I urge its adoption and hope it can be enacted this year.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nSenate's overwhelming passage today of the Internet Tax Freedom Act. \nThis bill represents several months of thoughtful consideration and \ndiscussion among Members on both sides of the aisle to address the tax \ntreatment of this emerging medium of commerce.\n  Throughout history, innovations in technology have dramatically \nchanged lifestyles. Today, it is the Internet changing lives, and \nunlike any other\n\n[[Page S11855]]\n\ntechnology to date. It is connecting people all around the world in \nways that no one at the Department of Defense ever conceived of when \nthe network was created. It is a true testament to the fact that \nleadership and entrepreneurial drive is alive and well in America.\n  This new tool of communication and information is also fast becoming \none of the most important and vibrant marketplaces in decades. It holds \ngreat promise for businesses, both large and small, to offer their \nproducts and services for sale to a worldwide market. This is good news \nfor everyone. It means new jobs, new opportunities and choices for \nconsumers and retailers, and ultimately more revenue for state and \nlocal governments.\n  Mr. President, by its very nature, the Internet does not respect the \ntraditional boundaries of state borders or county lines used to define \nour tax policies today. With about 30,000 taxing jurisdictions all \nacross America, a myriad of overlapping and burdensome taxes is a \nlegitimate concern for consumers and businesses online. This issue \nneeds to be explored and resolved.\n  The Internet Tax Freedom Act is about the potential of technology.\n  It is about taking a necessary and temporary time-out so that a \nCommission of government and industry representatives can thoroughly \nstudy electronic commerce and make sensible recommendations to Congress \nabout a fair, uniform and consistent Internet tax structure. The \nmoratorium will apply to discriminatory and multiple taxes as well as \nto taxes paid just to access the Internet.\n  This legislation will treat Internet sales the same as any other type \nof remote sale. It will not favor the Internet or disadvantage others.\n  Businesses and consumers using electronic commerce need and deserve \nsome level of assurance and sense of uniformity about how they will be \ntaxed.\n  Mr. President, over the past several months, I personally heard from \ngovernors and groups across the nation who expressed serious concerns \nabout the hindering effect on electronic commerce due to ambiguous and \nconflicting tax treatment. I also heard from others expressing concerns \nabout raising revenue and providing services to their citizens. Both \nvoiced support for passage of a balanced bill that would represent \ntheir views. Adequate time was allowed for the Senate to hear what they \nhad to say, and their concerns are reflected in the amendments and in \nthe final bill.\n  Internet taxes, like many other issues faced in Congress, is not \nwithout controversy. The spirited exchange on the Senate floor during \nthe past several days is evidence of that. I respect the differences \nthat have been debated. I recognize the delicate balance in many of the \nviews expressed, and appreciate the good faith efforts of my colleagues \nin working together to reach consensus. I know it was not easy.\n  Passage of this legislation was made possible by the hard work of \nmany people.\n  First, I commend Senator John McCain, Chairman of the Senate's \nCommerce Committee, for his diligent leadership and commitment to \ntackle this complex and contentious issue. He has been steadfast \nthroughout this process, and to him I say thank you.\n  I also owe a debt of gratitude for the work and contributions of the \nChairman of the Senate's Finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth. He \nprovided a fresh perspective on the issue of electronic commerce.\n  Clearly, the participation of several Members with diverse interests \nwas integral in moving this bill forward. I am proud to see Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle--Senator Byron Dorgan, Senator Judd Gregg, \nSenator Tim Hutchinson, Senator Joe Lieberman, and Senator Ron Wyden--\nall work together in a respectful manner to get the job done.\n  Nothing is ever accomplished in the Senate without the dedicated \nefforts of staff. I want to take a moment to identify those who worked \nhard to prepare this legislation for consideration. From the Senate \nCommerce Committee: Mark Buse, Jim Drewry, Carol Grunberg, Paula Ford, \nKevin Joseph, John Raidt, Mike Rawson, and Jessica Yoo. From the \nFinance Committee: Stan Fendley, Keith Hennessey, Jeffrey Kupfer, \nBrigitta Pari, Frank Polk, and Mark Prater. Other individuals \nparticipated on behalf of their Senators: Renee Bennett, Laureen Daly, \nRichard Glick, Hazen Marshall, Greg Rhode, Mitch Rose, Stan Sokul and \nRussell Sullivan. I thank them all for their efforts.\n  Mr. President, the current power of the Internet and its future \npotential will advance America into the next millennium. Passage of the \nInternet Tax Freedom Act is a crucial step in recognizing the \nsignificance of the Internet in electronic commerce and what it will \nmean in the lives of every American consumer, to American businesses, \nand to America's economy.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to add my own support to promoting \nelectronic commerce and keeping it free from new Federal, State or \nlocal taxes. I am a cosponsor of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, S. 442.\n  In ways that are becoming increasingly apparent, the Internet is \nchanging the way we do business. More than 50 million people around the \nworld surf the net--50 million. And more and more of these users turn \nto the World Wide Web and the Internet to place orders with suppliers \nor to sell products or services to customers or to communicate with \nclients.\n  The Internet market is growing at a tremendous pace. Over the past 2 \nyears, sales generated through the web grew more than 5,000 percent. In \nfact, in a recent Business Week article, electronic commerce sales are \nestimated to reach $379 billion by the year 2002, pumping up the \nNation's gross domestic sales by $10 to $20 billion every year by 2002.\n  And I see it in my own State of Vermont. On my home page on the web, \nI have put together a section called ``Cyber Selling In Vermont.'' It \nis a step-by-step resource guide for exploring how you can have on-line \ncommerce and other business uses of the Internet. It has links to \nbusinesses in Vermont that are already cyberselling.\n  As of today, this site includes links to web sites of more than 100 \nVermont businesses doing business on the Internet. They range from the \nQuill Bookstore in Manchester Center to Al's Snowmobile Parts Warehouse \nin Newport.\n  For the past 3 years, I have held annual workshops on doing business \non the Internet in my home State. I have received a tremendous response \nto these workshops from Vermont businesses of all sizes and customer \nbases, from Main Street merchants to boutique entrepreneurs.\n  At my last Doing Business on the Internet Workshop in Vermont, we had \nthese small business owners from all over our State. They told how \nsuccessful they have been selling on the web. They had such Main Street \nbusinesses as a bed and breakfast, or in one case a wool boutique, and \na real estate company. One example is Megan Smith of the Vermont Inn in \nKillington. She attended one of my workshops. Now she is taking \nreservations over the net, reservations not just from Vermont, but from \nthroughout the country. So cyberselling pays off for Vermonters.\n  Now Vermont businesses have an opportunity to take advantage of this \ntremendous growth by selling their goods on line. I have tried to be a \nmissionary for this around our State, because I believe the Internet \ncommerce can help Vermonters ease some of the geographic barriers that \nhistorically have limited our access to markets where our products can \nthrive.\n  The World Wide Web and Internet businesses can sell their goods all \nover the world in the blink of an eye, and they can do it any time of \nthe day or night.\n  As this electronic commerce continues to grow--for even a small State \nlike mine; we can see it all over the country--I hope we in Congress \ncan be leaders in developing tax policy that will nurture this new \nmarket. I followed closely the Internet Tax Freedom Act since Senator \nWyden introduced it last summer. I want to commend the senior Senator \nfrom Oregon for his leadership on cyber tax policy.\n  More than 30,000 cities and towns in the United States are able to \nlevy discriminatory sales on electronic commerce. Because of that, we \nneed this national bill to provide the stability necessary if this \nelectronic commerce is going to flourish.\n  We are not asking for a tax-free zone on the Internet. If sales taxes \nand\n\n[[Page S11856]]\n\nother taxes would apply to traditional sales and services under State \nor local law, then those taxes would also apply to Internet sales under \nour bill. But the bill would outlaw taxes that are applied only to \nInternet sales in a discriminatory manner.\n  We do not want somebody to kill these businesses before they even \nbegin because they think it is some way they can pluck the money out of \nthe pockets of those who are using the Internet. We should not allow \nthe future of electronic commerce--electronic commerce that can greatly \nexpand the markets of even our Main Street businesses--we should not \nallow it to be crushed by the weight of multiple taxation. Without this \nlegislation, they would have faced multiple taxation, and a lot of \nthese Internet businesses now creating jobs, now flourishing, now \nadding to the commerce of our States would have been wiped out of \nbusiness.\n  This legislation creates a temporary national commission to study and \nrecommend appropriate rules for international, Federal, State, and \nlocal government taxation of transactions over the Internet. This also \nwill help us very, very much.\n  The commission would submit its findings and recommendations to \nCongress within the next 18 months. With the help of this commission, \nCongress should be able to put a tax framework in place to foster \nelectronic commerce and protect the rights of state and local \ngovernments when the three-year moratorium ends.\n  During my time in the Senate, I always tried to protect the rights of \nVermont state and local legislators to craft their laws free from \ninterference from Washington. Thus, the imposition of a broad, open-\nended moratorium on state and local taxes relating to the Internet in \nthe original bill gave me pause. I certainly agreed with the goal of no \nnew state and local taxation of online commerce, but the means were \nquestionable.\n  I believe those questions have been fully answered by the changes \nmade to this legislation during its consideration in the Commerce and \nFinance Committees.\n  I want to commend Senators Burns, Kerry, McCain, Moynihan and Roth \nfor working with Senator Wyden, the sponsor of the original bill, to \ncraft a substitute bill that protects the free flow of online commerce \nwhile accommodating the rights of state and local governments.\n  Today there are more than 400,000 businesses selling their sales and \nservices on the World Wide Web around the world. This explosion in web \ngrowth has led to thousands of new and exciting opportunities for \nbusinesses, from Main Street to Wall Street. The Internet Tax Freedom \nAct will ensure that these businesses, and many others, continue to \nreap the rewards of electronic commerce.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nto foster the growth of online commerce and urge my colleagues to \nsupport its swift passage into law.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to say how pleased I am that \nthis chamber has finally come to agreement on S. 442, the Internet Tax \nFreedom Act. First, I would like to thank Senator Wyden for introducing \nthis bill and his perseverance to see this legislation through. I would \nlike to thank Chairman McCain for his management of this bill, and \nSenator Dorgan for working so closely with Senator Wyden to arrive at a \ncompromise. I would like to thank Senator Gregg for his unwavering \ninsistence on what he believes is right. I would like to acknowledge \nthe efforts of Senator Bumpers and Senator Graham who come to this \nissue from a different viewpoint but have tried to seek a common ground \nin what has been a polarizing and difficult negotiation.\n  I truly believe the most important things accomplished by this bill \nwill be, first, to raise the visibility of the issue of taxation of the \nInternet. Just having this debate in Congress has stimulated discussion \nand thought about the future of electronic commerce and the Internet \nthroughout the country. Three states--Texas, South Carolina, and my \nhome State of Connecticut--came forward and said that they did not want \ntheir States' taxes to be grandfathered into the tax moratorium, but \ninstead preferred to stop taxing the Internet. This debate has raised \nthe consciousness of public leaders as to the great benefits electronic \ncommerce holds for U.S. business to improve its productivity and reach \nnew customers, and even more importantly, the level playing field the \nInternet provides for small businesses. At the same time, we have \nbecome aware of the enormous problems faced by small businesses which \nare suddenly, over the net, selling beyond their physical reach and the \nuncertainties they face in the legal and tax environment in 30,000 \ntaxing jurisdictions.\n  The second major benefit of this bill will be to slow down the \ntaxation of the Internet. The moratorium in S. 442, while \ngrandfathering in existing State taxes on Internet access, will prevent \nnew taxes from being added.\n  The third, and I consider the most important, major benefit of this \nlegislation will be the creation of a commission to draft model State \nlegislation creating uniform categories for these new Internet \ncompanies and transactions that gives these firms some certainty as to \nhow they will be treated tax-wise in the different States. This is the \nessence of the bill that Senator Gregg and myself introduced in March, \ncalled NETFAIR, S. 1888--to remove the uncertainty under which \nelectronic commerce companies have had to operate in the United States \nand bring some order into the present business climate. It is our \nintent that this model State legislation would not preempt the States, \nbut would be adopted by the States, at their choice.\n  The Senate agreed to expand the duties of the commission beyond that \nof drafting model State legislation to looking at the States' \ncollection of use taxes on all remote sales. This is a legitimate area \nof study and of concern to the States and to their revenue base. In \nopposing this amendment, I was merely voicing my concern that the \ncommission may become bogged down in a debate over the taxation of \ncatalog sales that I fear it will not be able to stay focused on the \nInternet and accomplish the very useful purpose of helping create a \npredictable legal environment for electronic commerce. It is my hope \nthat the commission will try to complete the draft State legislation \noutlined in S. 442 first before turning to this larger debate.\n  At this point, I want to thank Senators Roth and Moynihan and the \nrest of the Finance Committee members for adding the international \nelement to this bill. The Finance Committee reminded us to consider our \ndomestic policies toward the Internet in the context of the \ninternational environment. Just as the Internet puts small companies on \nan equal footing with large companies, it also is creating a new level \nplaying field internationally. Developing countries that have not yet \nfully industrialized, and countries whose telephone penetration is only \na fraction of that in the United States, can leap frog entire stages of \ntechnology and move straight into fiber optic and wireless technologies \nthat will carry video, sound, data, and voice.\n  A number of my colleagues and I have had an opportunity to speak with \nJohn Chambers, the President and CEO of Cisco Systems, one of the major \nsuppliers of networking equipment at a breakfast last week. He knows \nsomething about electronic commerce since his company accounted for \none-third of all electronic commerce last year. I was very impressed \nwhen he said that, on his trip through Asia, the political leaders of \nSingapore, Malaysia, Hong Kong and China wanted to hold substantive \none- to two-hour conversations with him because they understand the \npower on the Internet and understand that information technology will \nchange, not just their country's economy, but the economy of the world. \nThey understand that those countries that embrace the information age \nwill prosper and those who don't will fall behind.\n  Once again, Mr. President, I want to thank my colleagues and their \nstaffs for the extraordinary effort they made to reach this point where \nwe can finally vote on this bill. Finally, I would like to thank \nLaureen Daly of my staff who put in an enormous amount of work to \nassure that Connecticut's constituents, businesses and government will \nbenefit from this legislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise to restate my strong support for \nthe Internet Tax Freedom Act. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S11857]]\n\nand pleased that with end the 105th Congress legislation that brings \nfairness and equitable tax treatment to hundreds of Virginia Internet \nand online companies.\n  It has been a difficult week, but we have succeeded reaching a \nresolution on this most important issue. This moratorium is critical to \nthe development of an industry that has become a pillar of Virginia's, \nand our Nation's, economy.\n  I will ask a resolution passed earlier this year expressing the sense \nof the General Assembly of Virginia that the Internet should remain \nfree from State and local taxes.\n  Mr. President, I also wish to commend Governor Jim Gilmore. He has \nbeen a tireless advocate and a true leader on this issue. He was one of \na handful of governors to recognize the potential of this industry and \nthe irreparable harm that could come to it at the hands of tens of \nthousands of tax collectors across the Nation. He shares my view that \nwe will remain the leader in the information technology industry only \nas long as we pursue policies of lower taxes and less regulation--\npolicies that have made Virginia such an attractive home to thousands \nof high tech companies and their employees.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 36\n\n       Expressing the sense of the General Assembly of Virginia \n     that services which provide access to the international \n     network of computer systems (commonly known as the Internet) \n     and other related electronic communication services, as well \n     as data and software transmitted via such services, should \n     remain free from fees, assessments, or taxes imposed by the \n     Commonwealth or its political subdivisions.\n       Agreed to by the House of Delegates, February 17, 1998; \n     agreed to by the Senate, March 10, 1998.\n       Whereas, services which provide access to the international \n     network of computer systems (commonly known as the Internet) \n     and other related electronic communication services, as well \n     as data and software transmitted via such services, have \n     provided immeasurable social, educational, and economic \n     benefits to the citizens of Virginia, the United States, and \n     the world; and\n       Whereas, technological advancements made by and to the \n     Internet and other related electronic communication services, \n     as well as data and software transmitted via such services, \n     develop at an ever-increasing rate, both qualitatively and \n     quantitatively; and\n       Whereas, these advancements have been encouraged, in part, \n     by public policies which facilitate technological innovation, \n     research, and development; and\n       Whereas, companies which provide Internet access services \n     and other related electronic communication services are \n     making substantial capital investments in new plants and \n     equipment; and\n       Whereas, it has been estimated that consumers, businesses, \n     and others engaging in interstate and foreign commerce \n     through the Internet or other related electronic \n     communication services could be subject to more than 30,000 \n     separate taxing jurisdictions in the United States alone; and\n       Whereas, multiple and excessive taxation places such \n     investment at risk and discourages increased investment to \n     provide such services, which, in turn, could put such \n     jurisdictions at a long-term social, educational, and \n     economic disadvantage; and\n       Whereas, the growth and development of electronic \n     communication services should be nurtured and encouraged by \n     appropriate state and federal policies; and\n       Whereas, the Commonwealth's exercise of its taxation and \n     regulatory powers in relation to electronic communication \n     services would likely impede the future viability and \n     enhancement of Internet access services and other electronic \n     communication services in the Commonwealth, which, in turn, \n     could restrict access to such services, as well as data and \n     software transmitted via such services, for all Virginians; \n     and\n       Whereas, previous rulings of departments of taxation or \n     revenue in several states have resulted in state taxes being \n     levied on Internet service providers or Internet-related \n     services, and have, in some cases, prompted action by those \n     states' legislatures to overturn such rulings; and\n       Whereas, a majority of the states that have addressed the \n     issue of taxing Internet-related services have chosen to \n     exercise restraint in taxing Internet service providers and \n     Internet-related services; and\n       Whereas, Virginia's existing tax code (Sec. 58.1-609.5) \n     exempts from retail sales and use tax purchases of services \n     where no tangible personal property is exchanged; and\n       Whereas, pursuant to Sec. 58.1-609.5, the Commissioner of \n     the Department of Taxation has promulgated regulations (Title \n     23 Virginia Administrative Code 10-210-4040) which provide \n     that charges for services generally are exempt from retail \n     sales and use tax, but that services provided in connection \n     with sales of tangible personal property are taxable; and\n       Whereas, in interpreting and applying Virginia's tax code \n     and regulations, the Commissioner has ruled that sales of \n     software via the Internet are not subject to Virginia's \n     retail sales and use tax (P.D. 97-405, October 2, 1997); and\n       Whereas, in further interpreting and applying Virginia's \n     tax code and regulations, the Commissioner has ruled that \n     providers of Internet access services and other electronic \n     communication services are not subject to Virginia's retail \n     sales and use tax (P.D. 97-425, October 21, 1997); and\n       Whereas, services which provide access to the Internet and \n     other related electronic communication services, as well as \n     data and software transmitted via such services, are not \n     tangible personal property and, therefore, should not be \n     subject to Virginia's retail sales and use tax: now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Delegates, the Senate concurring, \n     That Internet access services and other related electronic \n     communication services, as well as data and software \n     transmitted via such services, should remain free from fees, \n     assessments, or taxes imposed by the Commonwealth and its \n     political subdivisions; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That P.D. 97-405 (October 2, 1997), by \n     which the Commissioner ruled that sales of software via the \n     Internet are not subject to Virginia's retail sales and use \n     tax, correctly reflects the sense of the General Assembly and \n     the law of the Commonwealth regarding this issue; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That P.D. 97-425 (October 21, 1997), by \n     which the Commissioner ruled that providers of Internet \n     access services and other related electronic communication \n     services are not subject to Virginia's retail sales and use \n     tax, correctly reflects the sense of the General Assembly and \n     the law of the Commonwealth regarding this issue; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That, to the greatest extent possible, \n     future rulings of the Commissioner reflect the sense of the \n     General Assembly that Internet access services and other \n     related electronic communication services, as well as data \n     and software transmitted via such services, should remain \n     free from fees, assessments, or taxes imposed by the \n     Commonwealth and its political subdivisions; and, be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the House of Delegates \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Commissioner of the \n     Department of Taxation that he may be apprised of the sense \n     of the General Assembly in this matter.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order to S. 442, the Senate proceed immediately to \nthird reading, and final passage then occur, without debate, and I \nfurther ask that the final passage vote occur now, and that paragraph 4 \nof rule XII be waived.\n  And, Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Internet Tax Freedom Act''.\n\n                  TITLE I--MORATORIUM ON CERTAIN TAXES\n\n     SEC. 101. MORATORIUM.\n\n       (a) Moratorium.--No State or political subdivision thereof \n     shall impose any of the following taxes during the period \n     beginning on October 1, 1998, and ending 3 years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act--\n       (1) taxes on Internet access, unless such tax was generally \n     imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, 1998; and\n       (2) multiple or discriminatory taxes on electronic \n     commerce.\n       (b) Preservation of State and Local Taxing Authority.--\n     Except as provided in this section, nothing in this Act shall \n     be construed to modify, impair, or supersede, or authorize \n     the modification, impairment, or superseding of, any State or \n     local law pertaining to taxation that is otherwise \n     permissible by or under the Constitution of the United States \n     or other Federal law and in effect on the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n       (c) Liabilities and Pending Cases.--Nothing in this Act \n     affects liability for taxes accrued and enforced before the \n     date of enactment of this Act, nor does this Act affect \n     ongoing litigation relating to such taxes.\n       (d) Definition of Generally Imposed and Actually \n     Enforced.--For purposes of this section, a tax has been \n     generally imposed and actually enforced prior to October 1, \n     1998, if, before that date, the tax was authorized by statute \n     and either--\n       (1) a provider of Internet access services had a reasonable \n     opportunity to know by virtue of a rule or other public \n     proclamation made by the appropriate administrative agency of \n     the State or political subdivision thereof, that such agency \n     has interpreted and applied such tax to Internet access \n     services;

Then we will go to the Fletcher \nnomination.\n  Therefore, the next recorded vote would be at approximately 2:30.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11865-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11865-S11872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COATS HUMAN SERVICES REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1998--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany S. \n2206, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     2206), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 6, 1998.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, the conference report on the Coats Human \nServices Reauthorization Act of 1998 includes the Head Start program, \nthe\n\n[[Page S11866]]\n\nCommunity Services Block Grant, and the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program. Through this reauthorization, these programs can \ncontinue to provide vital assistance to the neediest of Americans. The \nAssets for Independence Act, also included in this bill, is a new way \nof helping low-income individuals and families to achieve economic \nself-sufficiency.\n  For three decades, Head Start, CSBG, and LIHEAP have effectively \nhelped many low-income families and individuals throughout America. In \nthis legislation, we have used the lessons learned over the past thirty \nyears to reaffirm what is working well, make improvements where \nnecessary to better meet today's challenges, and eliminate what no \nlonger achieves our goals.\n  This bill leaves present law largely intact, but it does make some \nimportant changes to improve program accountability, expand services to \nmeet the changing needs of today's families, and to increase the \ncapacity of these programs to reach each of the program's purposes.\n  The reauthorization of Head Start expands the Early Head Start \nprogram for our youngest children, in a manner which balances the \ndesire to make this program available to more children and families and \nthe need to ensure that every Head Start program meets the high \nstandards of quality that we have demanded.\n  The new evaluation and research provisions will provide much-needed \ninformation about how the program operates, help identify the ``best \npractices,'' and will guide the grantees, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, and Congress to continue the improvements in Head Start \nwhich began four years ago.\n  This legislation expands the Head Start competitive grant process to \ninclude for-profit service providers. All Head Start grantees must meet \nthe same high level of performance standards and outcome measures. Tax \nstatus does not guarantee the quality of a program---good or bad,. The \nmost important issue is selecting the best possible provider, non-\nprofit or for-profit, public or private, to deliver Head Start \nservices. That is what this legislation does.\n  The second major program authorized under this legislation is the \nCommunity Services Block Grant, or CSBG. This program provides funding \nto States for work in local communities to alleviate the causes of \npoverty. That's an easily defined goal, but getting there takes lots of \nwork, and diverse communities across the nation are taking equally as \ndiverse approaches to meeting it.\n  Local Community Action Agencies, working with other groups and \nindividuals in their communities, are helping people find and keep a \njob. They are helping them go back to school or get their GED. \nProvisions in this legislation will help States and local communities \nto continue this important work.\n  For almost two decades, the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program \n(LIHEAP) has provided a lifeline to countless Americans who cannot pay \ntheir fuel bills. The program works very well. It is widely regarded as \na model block grant program that gives states the flexibility to meet \nthe needs of their low-income residents while ensuring an appropriate \nlevel of accountability for federal dollars.\n  The reauthorization of LIHEAP will help about four million low-\nincome, disabled, and elderly households pay their fuel bills so they \nwon't have to struggle to keep warm in the winter or to avoid \nheatstroke in the summer. They won't be forced to choose between \nheating and eating. Although some four million households received \nLIHEAP benefits this year, if we had the resources, some 30 million \nhouseholds would be eligible for LIHEAP assistance. This legislation \nestablishes an authorization level that will permit Congress to \nincrease funding for LIHEAP, a goal towards which I will continue to \nwork.\n  I know some of our colleagues in Congress wonder whether we still \nneed a LIHEAP program. Today I think we send a strong message that the \nprogram is more important than ever, especially in light of welfare \nreform efforts. Low- and fixed-income households still spend at least \n18 percent of their income on energy bills, a proportion virtually \nunchanged since LIHEAP was created.\n  The Assets for Independence Act represents an important new approach \nto helping low-income families and individuals. Through Individual \nDevelopment Accounts, the saving, investment, and accumulation of \nassets is encouraged as a way to increase economic self-sufficiency and \nbuild a future. Senator Coats crafted this portion of the legislation. \nHis work in the development of asset-based policies to help low-income \nindividuals and families has helped us approach an old problem from a \nnew angle.\n  Senator Coats took the lead in shepherding this bill through the \nlegislative process, from the first draft to the conference report. \nWhen the Committee on Labor and Human Resources marked-up the bill, \nthey unanimously voted to change the name of the legislation to the \nCoats Act as a tribute to Senator Coats' dedication to issues affecting \nchildren and their families.\n  In both his personal and professional life, Senator Coats has been a \nlongstanding activist on behalf of American families. He was a Big \nBrother in Indiana long before his political career began, and was \nrecently elected President of the Board of Directors for Big Brothers/\nBig Sisters of America. Early in his congressional career, Senator \nCoats served as the Republican leader for the House Select Committee on \nChildren, Youth And Families.\n  Upon arriving in the Senate in 1989, he became the ranking member of \nthe Subcommittee on Children and Families of the Senate Committee on \nLabor and Human Resources. Serving as the subcommittee's Chairman since \n1995, Senator Coats has been a voice of reason and a tireless advocate \nfor children and families.\n  His compassion and caring is evident in every piece of legislation \nthat has come out of that subcommittee since Senator Coats became a \nmember. When he leaves the Senate, I will miss his leadership and most \nof all, his friendship.\n  The Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act will serve to remind us \nall of his contributions to the Labor Committee and the Senate.\n  This legislation is the result of months of hard work, negotiation, \nand compromise. It has been a truly bi-partisan, bicameral effort that \nhas resulted in good public policy.\n  The legislation reinforces what works in these programs, and discards \nwhat does not, which is the whole purpose of a reauthorization.\n  It continues the mission that we began many years ago of empowering \ncommunities to help their most vulnerable populations, and it does this \nin a responsible manner. This bi-partisan effort would not have been \npossible without the hard work of many outstanding staff members.\n  With this legislation, Stephanie Monroe, the Staff Director for the \nSubcommittee on Children and Families, has added one more piece of \neffective public policy to her already impressive portfolio. Her work \nin researching, drafting, and negotiating this bill has been \ninvaluable. Stephanie has been working in the Senate for fourteen years \nand I hope she will seriously consider continuing on here, after \nSenator Coats retires.\n  I want to thank Stephanie Robinson and Amy Lockhart, of Senator \nKennedy's staff and Suzanne Day and Jim Fenton of Senator Dodd's staff \nfor their contributions and their commitment to keeping this \nlegislation a bi-partisan effort.\n  Conferencing a bill always involves long hours, hard work, and much \npatience. I appreciate the efforts of Denzel McGuire, Mary Gardner \nClagett, and Sally Lovejoy on the staff of the House Committee on \nEducation and Workforce.\n  I also want to thank Jackie Cooney of Senator Gregg's staff, Alex \nNock and Marcy Phillips with Representative Martinez, Melanie Marola \nwith Representative Castle, Amy Adair and Randy Brant with \nRepresentative Souder for their work on this legislation.\n  Brian Jones recently left my staff on the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources, but before he left, he contributed enormously to the \ncrafting of this legislation. I wish him well in his new venture, and \nappreciate his contributions to this and other legislation while on my \nstaff. Geoff Brown, who is on my personal staff was instrumental in \ncrafting and negotiating the\n\n[[Page S11867]]\n\nLIHEAP portion of the bill. Working with Cameron Taylor, Legislative \nDirector of the Northeast-Midwest Senate Coaltion, Geoff made sure that \nthis critical program will continue to meet the needs of millions of \nlow-income families.\n  Kimberly Barnes-O'Connor provided valuable and tireless counsel \nthroughout this process, proving once again her capacity to put the \ninterests of children and families first. I commend her for her \nexemplary service to me, the committee, the Congress, and the \nconstituents we serve through these critical human services programs.\n  Mark Powden, the Staff Director for the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, as always, helped to clear the obstacles and push this \nlegislation forward. Thank you, Mark.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to Senator Coats, who is worthy of \nall the praise possible with respect to this legislation and his total \nservice to this Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Indiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, allow me to thank my colleagues for their \nkind words and also for their assistance.\n  At a time when our two parties are often divided over issues, major \nissues, this is truly a bipartisan effort. This is something that could \nnot have been achieved without the cooperation, support, help and \nassistance of people on both sides of the aisle. I thank the chairman \nand Senator Kennedy for their work with us on this. I thank my \ncounterpart on the Children and Families Subcommittee, Senator Dodd; \nSenator Gregg has been a supporter of this effort, and others on the \ncommittee who have worked hard and worked diligently with us to bring \nus to this particular point.\n  Each of the four programs that are encompassed in this bill represent \nan all too rare occurrence--a forging of public and private partnership \nto combat the effects of poverty and unleashing the vast resources of \none of our most important assets, the local community.\n  The first component of this bill is the reauthorization of Head \nStart, a program that has proven to be significant in providing an \nopportunity for children to realize their full potential. It was more \nthan a decade ago that Congressman George Miller and I, as chairman and \nranking member, respectively, of the Children, Youth and Family \nSubcommittee in the House of Representatives, asked the General \nAccounting Office to do an analysis of all of the programs that \naffected children, youth and families under the title and the theme of \nwhat works, what doesn't and why. It was a 2-year exhaustive study, and \nit came back listing eight Federal programs that provided real tangible \nbenefits and a real return on the investment of the taxpayer's dollar \nand encouraged support for those programs.\n  At the head of the list, No. 1 on the list was Head Start. It said \nthat for the taxpayer's investment in providing low-income, \ndisadvantaged children with opportunities to prepare to enter the \neducational system, he or she was saving an enormous amount of money \nthat would have had to be spent on remedial education and would have \nbeen potentially lost because those children were not prepared to enter \nthe educational system. Since that time, I have been an ardent \nsupporter of Head Start, in trying to provide funds for Head Start and \nalso to make sure the program is effective. It is a program that \nclearly has provided many millions of children opportunities that they \nwould not have otherwise had.\n  However, having said that, there have been questions about the \nquality of the program. We have experienced varying degrees of quality, \nfrom excellent in some cases to very poor in other cases. With the 1994 \nreauthorization, Congress and the administration made a commitment to \nenhance the focus on quality improvement. Since the last \nreauthorization, the Head Start bureau has offered technical \nassistance, resources and support to Head Start programs that are \ncommitted to pursuing excellence--again, something that is all too \nrare. We have also terminated, actually terminated grants to those \nprograms that were experiencing deficiencies to the extent that they \ncould not be remedied.\n  Close to 100 Head Start grantees have been terminated or have \nrelinquished their grants since 1994--the first time in history that \ndeficient programs were actually recompeted. These are essential. Too \noften here we authorize a new program with glowing words and the best \nof direction that we can provide, only to find later that those \nprograms did not match up to the promise, and yet they are continued, \nthey are perpetuated, they continue to receive funding, we continue to \nsupport mediocrity or even worse.\n  We have, through the actions in 1994 and subsequent, infused into the \nHead Start Program not only the technical assistance and resources and \nsupport necessary, but also the oversight and the investigation and the \ndetermination that we are either going to make some of these programs \nthat are deficient, better, or we are going to recompete them--and, as \nI said, more than 100 have been recompeted.\n  The reauthorization bill that we are dealing with today builds on \nthat commitment by requiring that 60 percent of the Head Start funds in \nthe first years go toward enhancing program quality. It is important \nthat we expand Head Start. We obviously want to get as many children in \nthe program as possible, but it does no good to expand the program, to \nenroll more children, if the existing programs are not providing the \nhealth and the benefit and the quality that the children need to give \nthem that edge that they need. So the emphasis on quality early and \nexpansion later, I think, is the proper emphasis.\n  We also take steps to make sure Head Start students obtain the goal \nof school readiness by requiring the establishment of educational \nperformance standards to ensure that the children develop a minimum \nlevel of literacy awareness and understanding coupled with very \nspecific measures to help us assess whether or not this program is \nactually working. Under this scenario, poor programs, poorly \nadministered programs, will be identified, they will be offered \ntechnical assistance, and if they fail to correct the deficiencies, \nthey will be terminated and the grant recompeted.\n  We have responded to the concerns of Head Start programs to be able \nto more fully address the emerging needs of working families for full-\nday, full-year services, by significantly enhancing the Collaboration \nGrant Program in current law by requiring active collaboration between \nHead Start and other early care in education programs within the State, \nand we have included the President's request for an expansion of early \nHead Start programs from the current 7.5 percent in fiscal year 1999 to \n10 percent in fiscal year 2003.\n  Finally, in response to concerns raised about the lack of reliable \nresearch on Head Start, which can be used as a basis for determining \nits effectiveness, we have authorized the National Impact Study of Head \nStart. These studies will yield very valuable information about how \nthis program is working and whether Head Start is, in fact, making a \ndifference.\n  Mr. President, the whole emphasis here, as you can tell, is on \nsufficient oversight, sufficient involvement in the program, to \ndetermine how it is working and to establish and identify where it is \nnot working, and to help make where it is not working better and, if \nnot, if necessary, recompeting the whole process and turning it over to \nsomeone else.\n  There are three other components of this particular bill before us. \nOne is the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. I will allow \nother Members, including the chairman, to address that. That is an \nissue they have been involved in more directly than I have.\n  Another is the Community Services Block Grant, an excellent example \nof what can happen when Washington allows local communities to design \ntheir own responses to local problems. The ``Washington knows best,'' \nthe ``Washington has one model formula that fits all sizes,'' is pretty \nmuch a discounted and discarded theory. We are working now, and need to \nwork, with local communities to identify local problems and allow them \nto help us and work with us in fashioning a local solution.\n  Mr. President, 90 percent of the funds provided under this act, the \nCommunity Services Block Grant, must be passed through by the State to \nlocal eligible entities, which include a variety of public and \nnonprofit organizations,\n\n[[Page S11868]]\n\ncommunity action agencies, and faith-based neighborhood organizations.\n  We made some important improvements in this act, requiring each State \nto participate in a performance measurement system, again to determine \neffectiveness of programs and make sure they are meeting their program \ngoals and priorities.\n  We have reauthorized a number of subcomponents of this--the Community \nEconomic Development Program, the Rural Economic Development Program, \nNational Youth Sports, the Community Food and Nutrition Program--and \ncreated a new program called the Neighborhood Innovation Projects, so \nthat grants to private, neighborhood-based nonprofits can test or \nassist in the development of new approaches and developments in dealing \nwith these community problems. These grants may be used for a variety \nof purposes, including gang interventions, addressing school violence, \nor any other purposes identified by the community as a problem \nresulting from poverty and consistent with the purposes of this CSBG.\n  Finally, let me address a program that has been near and dear to my \nheart, something that has been part of the Project for American Renewal \nthat I authored some time ago. This is a 5-year demonstration program \nentitled ``Assets for Independence.'' It is designed to encourage low-\nincome individuals to develop strong habits for saving money. It is an \nIRA for low-income people. The current IRA program really is only \navailable to those who have assets readily available or accessible to \nput into this saving program. The Assets for Independence Act allows \nsponsoring organizations to provide participating individuals and \nfamilies intensive financial counseling and assistance in developing \ninvestment plans for education, home ownership, and entrepreneurship.\n\n  I am excited about this new program. As I said, it is part of the \nProject for American Renewal legislation I first introduced in 1995. It \nis estimated that our 5-year investment of $100 million in asset \nbuilding through these individual accounts will generate 7,000-plus new \nbusinesses, 70,000 new jobs, $730 million in additional earnings, \n12,000 new or rehabilitated homes, 6,600 families removed from welfare \nrolls, and 20,000 adults obtaining high school, vocational, and college \ndegrees.\n  Each of the programs we are authorizing today represents an effort to \ngive people a hand up, not simply a handout. They are an acknowledgment \nthat when one family suffers, we all suffer as Americans; when \ncommunities break down, we all pay a price, and therefore we all have a \nstake in helping people achieve the American dream.\n  The legislation recognizes the limits of government and the fact that \nmany of our worst social problems will never be solved by government \nalone. We are beginning to recognize that there are people and \ninstitutions, families, churches, synagogues, parishes, community \nvolunteer organizations, faith-based charities, that are able to \ncommunicate societal ideals and restore individual hope, and we need to \nallow those organizations to compete to provide services, and we have \ndone so in each of the programs I have described.\n  Community activist Robert Woodson makes the point that every social \nproblem, no matter how severe, is currently being defeated somewhere by \nsome volunteer community group, faith-based organization, or others. \nThis is now one of America's great untold stories. No alternative \napproach to our cultural crisis holds such promise, because these \ninstitutions have resources denied to government at every level, \nresources of love, spiritual vitality, and true compassion.\n  Mr. President, I have been proud to be associated with one \norganization entitled Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America. I have been \nwith them now for 26 years as a Big Brother as a local board member, \nboard president, now as the president of the national board. This, \nalong with organizations like Boys Clubs, Girls Clubs, Boy Scouts, Girl \nScouts, and others, provides just one example of how local volunteer \norganizations can provide volunteers who can provide help to children \nto give them the kind of mentoring and support they need in difficult \nyears, growing up often in one-parent families or families with \npoverty.\n  There are examples of this all across the board. The Gospel Rescue \nMinistry's efforts across the country have reached out to drug-addicted \nhomeless individuals and provided astounding support. Whether the \nproblem is teen pregnancy, school dropouts, school violence, children \nwithout fathers--whatever--there are organizations that we need to tap \ninto, support, and enhance their involvement, providing support for \nyoung people and addressing social problems in this country.\n  Mr. President, I see my time is expiring. I did not mean to go on as \nlong as I have. I hope I have not used up all the time. I know Senator \nKennedy and others are on the floor to talk about this. These programs, \nI believe, the ones we are reauthorizing, represent the true measure of \nour compassion as a nation.\n  I want to end by giving credit to Stephanie Johnson, who has poured \nher heart and soul into this reauthorization. She has given more than \nany one person can ask, making this a reality. This would not have \nhappened without her involvement. Good staff makes good Senators, and \nshe is the epitome of good staff. I thank her personally and publicly \nfor her work in making this, and many of the things that have happened \nwithin our committee, a reality.\n  With that, I appreciate the extra time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Nation is focusing on a number of \nmatters today, I want to say what a really important achievement the \nSenate will accomplish in a few moments when we pass this very \nextensive authorization legislation, about $35 billion over the next 5 \nyears.\n  The legislation has been described by our colleagues and friends, but \nI join in echoing the sentiments that have been expressed this morning \nin paying tribute to our friend and colleague from Indiana, Senator \nCoats, the staff who have worked with him, others on the committee, and \nour chairman, Senator Jeffords, in moving this legislation forward.\n  I remember back to 1994--maybe the Senator from Indiana remembers--\nwhen we were working at that time on the reauthorization of the Head \nStart Program. Many of us had been long-time supporters of that \nprogram. It is fair to say, at that time, that legislation, or the \nlegislation that we are considering here, would not have been \nreauthorized unless it had the active involvement and leadership of the \nSenator from Indiana. That was a time of great crisis in the Head Start \nProgram. I think the accolades that have been given about the Senator \nare well-deserved.\n  I thank him, in particular, for saving the program back in 1994, but \nalso for the continued commitment that he has had, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, for these past years. As Senator Coats has \npointed out, he was working as a cochair of the children's caucus in \nthe House of Representatives. Our colleague and friend Senator Dodd is \ncochair of the children's caucus in the Senate. Both of these Senators \nhave probably spent more time focusing on the needs of children in our \ncountry than any others and have worked in a very important bipartisan \nway.\n  I join with those who pay tribute to the Senator from Indiana, and \nnaming this legislation after him is really well-deserved. I welcome \nthe opportunity to stand with those who say he has made an \nindispensable contribution to the needs of poor children in our \nsociety. I say that with great sincerity and appreciation, because he \nhas made a very, very important difference, not just in shaping these \nprograms, but basically in helping our country respond to these \nparticular needs.\n  There have been times when we have had differences on various policy \nissues. But we are friends, and the Senate is at its best when we have \ndifferences on some matters, but we are able to work them out and, most \nof all, to respect the individual integrity which Members bring to \nthese issues. The legislation before us today--and I urge our fellow \nMembers to support it--is really the product of our best efforts. I \nthink it will make an important difference in the lives of children.\n\n[[Page S11869]]\n\n I join with those in congratulating the Senator and in appreciating \nhis leadership.\n  Mr. President, at a time when we have extraordinary prosperity, it is \nimportant that we look primarily at the needs of children, particularly \nthe poor children. This bill invests in America's future by providing \nurgently needed assistance to low-income families and children.\n  This bill reauthorizes the Head Start program, the comprehensive \nearly childhood development program for low-income children.\n  For more than thirty years, Head Start has been providing \neducational, nutritional, medical, and social services to help young \nchildren and their families reach their full potential. The advances \nmade by this bill will ensure even greater success for the program in \nmeeting the needs of today's families.\n  In preparing this bill, we've made significant efforts to improve \nprogram quality. That was particularly a matter that the Senator from \nIndiana was strongly committed to. We've established new education \nperformance standards, to ensure that Head Start children enter school \nready to learn. We've strengthened teacher qualifications, so that \nchildren will receive the very best care.\n  We've also worked to encourage closer cooperation by Head Start with \nother agencies so that full-day, full-year services will be more \nreadily available to working families who need this kind of extended \ncare.\n  More than 830,000 children currently receive the benefits of Head \nStart and they will continue to do so. Just as important, this bill \nmakes it possible over the next five years to reach out more \neffectively to the 60% of eligible children who are not now receiving \nthese services.\n  Head Start has demonstrated its success in lifting families out of \npoverty. With the program's support, many families obtain the boost \nthey need to achieve economic self-sufficiency.\n  A letter I received from Monica Marafuga, a Head Start teacher in \nMassachusetts, makes this point well:\n\n       I believe that Head start is sometimes the only hope for \n     some families. As a teacher, I see the many families and \n     children who need someone to guide them and point them in the \n     right direction for a better life.\n\n  The Early Head Start program is also greatly enhanced by this bill. \nThis program was established four years ago to provide high quality \ncomprehensive services to very young children, from birth to age 3, and \ntheir families. There is nothing that can replace a parent and a home \nthat is supportive and loving. But as we have seen, many of the \nchildren in our society are missing the support which can help them \ndevelop at a very critical and important time of their development.\n  We know that the first three years of life are a critical period in \nevery child's development. We are mindful of the excellent studies that \nhave been done by the Carnegie Commission about the importance of the \ndevelopment of a child's brain in the first months and years of life. \nThe Early Head Start Program helps in developing those cognitive, \nemotional, and social skills that can help children seize future \nopportunities and fulfill their highest potential. This is something we \nwant to encourage.\n  I welcome the fact that we are able to see an important enhancement \nof the Early Start Program. I'm especially pleased that this bill \nincludes provisions to establish a new training and technical \nassistance fund, which will reinforce the program's commitment to \nprovide quality services through on-going professional support for \nprogram staff.\n  The Early Start Program is having an important impact, and in this \nbill we continue a gradual expansion of the program so that more young \nchildren can be served. Currently, less than 2% of those eligible are \nreceiving its benefit. This bill will expand the program over the next \nfive years to cover an additional 40,000 babies and toddlers. This is a \nmodest expansion, but one which I think, with its success, can be built \non over future years.\n  In addition, the bill also renews our commitment to reducing poverty \nby reauthorizing the Community Services Block Grant. This program helps \ncommunities by providing assistance to address the specific needs of \nlocalities, marshaling other existing resources in the community, and \nencouraging the involvement of those directly affected.\n  Funds may be used for a variety of services, including employment, \ntransportation, education, housing, nutrition, and child care.\n  I remember when Senator Robert Kennedy sponsored the initial \nCommunity Development Corporation more than 30 years ago, which was the \nprecursor to the Community Services Block Grant. This program has a \nproven record of fostering innovative methods for eliminating the \ncauses of poverty. The need today is as great as it has ever been. \nPoverty continues to be a significant problem across the nation.\n  We know that 37 million of our fellow citizens live in poverty. \nChildren are particularly vulnerable, representing 40% of those living \nin poverty despite the fact that they make up only 25% of the overall \npopulation. These figures are particularly disturbing because studies \nshow that children living in poverty tend to suffer disproportionately \nfrom stunted growth and lower test scores. The Community Services Block \nGrant can help alleviate these conditions and benefit these children.\n  The legislation also reauthorizes the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program for the next five years. The funding levels provided \nfor this important program will ensure that LIHEAP continues to help \nlow-income households with their home energy costs, particularly in \nextreme weather.\n  I am especially pleased that this legislation includes a provision to \nclarify the criteria for the President to release emergency LIHEAP \nfunds. This assistance will enable many families hurt by hot or cold \nweather, ice storms, floods, earthquakes, and other natural disasters \nto get through the season.\n  In addition, it will enable the release of emergency LIHEAP funds if \nthere is a significant increase in unemployment, home energy \ndisconnections, or participation in a public benefit program.\n  There is clearly a continuing need for a strong LIHEAP program. 95% \nof the five million households receiving LIHEAP assistance have annual \nincomes below $18,000. They spend an extremely burdensome 18% of their \nincome on energy, compared to the average middle-class family, which \nspends only 4%.\n  Without a strong LIHEAP program, families will be forced to spend \nless money on food and more money on their utility bills--the so-called \n``heat or eat effect.'' The result is increased malnutrition among \nchildren.\n  Without a strong LIHEAP program, children will fall behind in school \nbecause they will be unable to study in their frigid households.\n  Without a strong LIHEAP program, low income elderly will be at an \neven greater risk of hypothermia. In fact, older Americans accounted \nfor more than half of all hypothermia deaths in 1991.\n  LIHEAP is clearly a lifeline for the most vulnerable citizens in \nsociety, and I commend the House and Senate for strengthening this \nvital program.\n  This bill also establishes a new and innovative approach to helping \nlow-income individuals achieve financial independence, and again, I \ncommend Senator Coats for his leadership on this new program. \nIndividual Development Accounts are designed to promote economic self-\nsufficiency by providing matching funds for deposits made into \nqualifying savings accounts. Funds can be used to purchase a first \nhome, open a small business, or pay for college education.\n  This program shows great promise for improving the lives of many \nindividuals and families in communities across the country.\n  Mr. President, I want to just use the last minute in sharing my \ncommendation for the wonderful staff, Republican and Democrat, who \nworked very closely together. This bipartisan effort is really the most \neffective way to develop the best possible legislation.\n  I want to also recognize Stephanie Monroe, who will be leaving the \nSenate and has been really a stalwart. Everyone has enormous respect \nfor her. She has worked with Senator Coats, but I think all of us have \nhad enormous confidence in her leadership. She has done really an \noutstanding job. I also thank Suzanne Day and Kimberly Barnes O'Connor, \nand Amy Lockhart, a Congressional Fellow in my office, and\n\n[[Page S11870]]\n\nStephanie Robinson of my staff who is an enormously gifted, talented \nand committed individual.\n  The Clinton Administration worked effectively with us in the \ndevelopment of this legislation, and they also deserve great credit. I \nwant to particularly recognize Helen Taylor who is the Associate \nCommissioner of the Head Start Bureau at the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. Ms. Taylor has dedicated her professional career to \nimproving the lives of young children and has had over 30 years of \ndistinguished service in the field of early childhood development. Her \nknowledge and experience proved invaluable in this process, and I thank \nher for her true commitment to the children of Head Start.\n  This bill ensures the continuation of these important programs into \nthe 21st century. Again, I thank the chairman of our committee, Senator \nJeffords, and Senator Dodd, and Senator Coats who really have done an \nextraordinary job in bringing this legislation to where it is today.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I want to take just a couple seconds to join in the \naccolades which Senator Kennedy has made for the various staff members, \nand also to recognize all the tremendous work that Senator Kennedy \nhimself has done not only today but throughout the years on these very \nvaluable programs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am delighted to stand here and thank the \nchairman and the ranking member, the Senator from Massachusetts, as we \nare about to adopt the Coats Human Services Reauthorization Act, which \nincludes Head Start, LIHEAP and the community services block grants.\n  People are going to wonder. This is the second day in a row that I \nfind myself on the floor extolling the tremendous contribution of my \ncolleague from Indiana.\n  We were involved in a piece of legislation yesterday. But I think all \nof us, as I said yesterday, are going to miss our friend, who is going \nto be here only a few more days and will move on to another chapter in \nhis life.\n  But it is highly appropriate, given his tremendous work over his \ncareer in the Senate on behalf of children and families that this piece \nof legislation is going to be named in honor of his service to our \ncountry.\n  I am very pleased to join in that effort, and to commend him for his \nspectacular work over the years of service in the Senate.\n  Senator Coats and I have worked intensively with Senator Jeffords, \nSenator Kennedy, other members of our committee, and the House \ncommittee to complete this important reauthorization. The strong \nbipartisan support for this bill is a clear statement of how we all \nview the crucial programs included in this bill. And it is also a \ntestament to the leadership of Senator Coats on this legislation. While \nwe have not necessarily agreed on every issue, I have always admired \nSenator Coats dedication to working to help working families, and in \nparticular, to helping children. His presence on the Labor Committee \nwill surely be missed, and I am pleased that the full committee chose \nto name this important bill after Senator Coats, as a show of respect \nand admiration for his service in the Senate.\n  This bill is fundamentally about expanding opportunity in America for \nall of our citizens. Under the umbrella of the Human Services Act, low \nincome communities, their families and children receive more than $5 \nbillion of assistance each year. These dollars support the basic \nbuilding blocks of stronger communities--care and education for young \nchildren in Head Start, food, job and economic development through the \nCommunity Services Block grant, and home heating assistance through \nLIHEAP.\n  Head Start is the nation's leading child development program, because \nit focuses on the needs of the whole child. Inherently, we know that a \nchild cannot be successful if he or she has unidentified health needs, \nif his or her parents are not involved in their education, and if he or \nshe is not well-nourished or well-rested. Head Start is the embodiment \nof those concerns and works each day to meet children's critical needs. \nThis year, Head Start will serve over 830,000 children and their \nfamilies this year, and nearly 6,000 in my home state of Connecticut.\n  The bill before us today further strengthens the Head Start program: \nWe continue the expansion of the Early Head Start program, increasing \nthe set aside for this program to 10 percent in FY 2002. Anyone who has \npicked up a magazine or newspaper within the last year knows how vital \nthe first three years of child's life are to their development. This \nprogram, which we established in 1994, extends comprehensive, high-\nquality services to these young children and their parents, to make \nsure the most is made of this window of opportunity.\n  We have added new provisions to encourage collaboration within states \nand local communities as well as within individual Head Start programs \nto expand the services they offer to families to full-day and full-year \nservices, where appropriate, and to leverage other child care dollars \nto improve quality and better meet family needs.\n  We emphasize the importance of school readiness and literacy \npreparation in Head Start. While I think this has always been a \ncritical part of Head Start, this bill ensures that gains will continue \nto be made in this area.\n  Mr. President, this bill puts Head Start on strong footing as we \napproach the 21st Century. It is a framework within which Head Start \ncan continue to grow to meet the needs of more children and their \nfamilies. What is unfortunate is that we cannot guarantee more funding \nfor Head Start--I think it is shameful that there are waiting lists for \nHead Start and that only 40 percent of eligible children are served by \nthis program. And Early Head Start, which is admittedly a new program, \nserves just a tiny fraction of the infants and toddlers in need of \nthese services.\n  The President has set a laudable goal to reach 1 million children by \n2002. But I say we need to do more. We need a plan to serve 2 million \nchildren--all those eligible and in need of services--as soon as \npossible.\n  Some argue that meeting the goal of fully funding Head Start will be \ntoo costly. Yes, it will cost a great deal to get there. But my \nquestion is how much more will it cost not to get there?\n  Studies show us that children in quality early childhood development \nprograms, such as Head Start, start school more ready to learn than \ntheir non-Head Start counterparts. They are more likely to keep up with \ntheir classmates, avoid placement in special education, and graduate \nfrom high school. They are also less likely to become teenage mothers \nand fathers, go on welfare, or become involved in violence or the \ncriminal justice system.\n  How much does it cost when we don't see these benefits?\n  I know this is an issue for another place and another venue. But I am \nhopeful as we strengthen Head Start we can also strengthen our resolve \nto expand this successful program to reach more children and their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, the bill before us also makes important changes to the \nCommunity Services Block Grant program. CSBG makes funds available to \nstates and local communities to assist low-income individuals and help \nalleviate the causes of poverty. One thousand local service providers--\nmainly Community Action Agencies--use these federal funds to address \nthe root causes of poverty within their communities. CSBG dollars are \nparticularly powerful because local communities have substantial \nflexibility in determining where these dollars are best spent to meet \ntheir local circumstances.\n  I have had the pleasure of visiting Community Action Agencies in \nConnecticut many times. They are exciting, vibrant places at the very \ncenter of their communities--filled with adults taking literacy and job \ntraining courses, children at Head Start centers, seniors with housing \nor other concerns, and youths participating in programs or volunteering \ntheir time.\n  To see clearly how critical the CSBG program is to the nation's low \nincome families, one only needs to look at the statistics. The CSBG \nprogram in 1995 served more than 11.5 million people, or one in three \nAmericans living in poverty. Three-quarters of CSBG clients have \nincomes that fall below the federal poverty guideline.\n  This bill recognizes the fundamental strength of this program and \nmakes modest changes to encourage broader participation by neighborhood \ngroups. In addition, it improves the accountability of local programs.\n\n[[Page S11871]]\n\n  This bill also reauthorizes the vitally important Low Income Heating \nand Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP. Nearly 4.2 million low-income \nhouseholds received LIHEAP assistance during FY1996, more than 70,000 \nhouseholds in Connecticut. One quarter of those assisted by LIHEAP \nfunds are elderly. Another 25 percent are individuals with \ndisabilities. I cannot overvalue the importance of this assistance--it \nis nearly as necessary as food and water to a low-income senior citizen \nor family with children seeking help to stay warm in the winter--or as \nwe saw a few months ago in the Southwest--to stay cool during the \nsummer.\n  This bill makes no fundamental changes to the LIHEAP program. I am \nvery pleased we increase the authorization of the program to $2 \nbillion, which recognizes the great need for this help. We also put \ninto place a system to more accurately and quickly designate natural \ndisasters. Early disaster designation will allow for the more efficient \ndistribution of the critically important emergency LIHEAP funds, aiding \nStates devastated by a natural disaster.\n  This bill contains one new, important program--the Individual \nDevelopment Accounts, based on a bill offered by Senator Coats and \nSenator Harkin. Individual Development Accounts, or IDA's, are \ndedicated savings accounts for very low income families, similar in \nstructure to IRA's, that can be used to pay for post-secondary \neducation, buy a first home, or capitalize a business. This program is \na welcome addition to the Human Services Act family. The Assets for \nIndependence title will provide low-income individuals and families \nwith new opportunities to move their families out of poverty through \nsavings.\n  This is a strong bill and it is a good bill. I hope my colleagues \nwill support this conference report, and again I want to thank Senator \nCoats for his committed leadership on this effort.\n  For all of those reasons, Mr. President, I commend the chairman of \nthe committee and again the ranking member. Suzanne Day of my office \nand Jim Fenton did a tremendous job; Stephanie Monroe from Senator \nCoats' office, Stephanie Robinson from Senator Kennedy's office and \nKimberly Barnes O'Connor of Senator Jeffords' office did a tremendous \njob in pulling this together. We thank all of them for their efforts.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his graciousness.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \ncongratulate the members of the conference committee on S. 2206 for \ntheir hard work on this legislation which reauthorizes the Head Start \nprogram, the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance program, and the \nCommunity Services Block Grant (CSBG) program. I am particularly \ngrateful to the conferees for including in this legislation language \nthat will expand the opportunities for charitable and religious \norganizations to serve their communities with Community Services Block \nGrant funds. This language, which is based upon my Charitable Choice \nprovision in the 1996 welfare reform law, will encourage successful \ncharitable and faith-based organizations to expand their services to \nthe poor while assuring them that they will not have to extinguish \ntheir religious character as a result of receiving government funds.\n  This provision makes clear that states may use CSBG funds to contract \nwith charitable, religious and private organizations to run programs \nintended to fight poverty and alleviate its effects on people and their \ncommunities. When states do choose to partner with the private sector, \nthe charitable choice concept ensures that religious organizations are \nconsidered on an equal basis with all other private organizations.\n  For years, America's charities and churches have been transforming \nshattered lives by addressing the deeper needs of people--by instilling \nhope and values which help change behavior and attitudes. By contrast, \ngovernment social programs have often failed miserably in moving \nrecipients from dependency and despair to responsibility and \nindependence. We in Congress need to find ways to allow successful \nfaith-based organizations to succeed where government has failed, and \nto unleash the cultural remedy that our society so desperately needs.\n  Unfortunately, in the past, many faith-based organizations have been \nafraid--often rightfully so--of accepting governmental funds in order \nto help the poor and downtrodden. They fear that participation in \ngovernment programs would not only require them to alter their \nbuildings, internal governance, and employment practices, but also make \nthem compromise the very religious character which motivates them to \nreach out to people in the first place.\n  My charitable choice measure is intended to allay such fears and to \nprevent government officials from misconstruing constitutional law by \nbanning faith-based organizations from the mix of private providers for \nfear of violating the Establishment Clause. Even when religious \norganizations are permitted to participate, government officials have \noften gone overboard by requiring such organizations to sterilize \nbuildings or property of religious character and to remove any \nsectarian connections from their programs. This discrimination can \ndestroy the character of many faith-based programs and diminish their \neffectiveness in helping people climb from despair and dependence to \ndignity and independence.\n  Charitable choice embodies existing U.S. Supreme Court case \nprecedents in an effort to clarify to government officials and \ncharitable organizations alike what is constitutionally permissible \nwhen involving religiously-affiliated institutions. Based upon these \nprecedents, the legislation provides specific protections for religious \norganizations when they provide services with government funds. For \nexample, the government cannot discriminate against an organization on \nthe basis of its religious character. A participating faith-based \norganization also retains its religious character and its control over \nthe definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious \nbeliefs.\n  Additionally, the government cannot require a religious organization \nto alter its form of internal governance or remove religious art, \nicons, or symbols to be eligible to participate. Finally, religious \norganizations may consider religious beliefs and practices in their \nemployment decisions. I have been told by numerous faith-based entities \nand attorneys representing them that autonomy in employment decisions \nis crucial in maintaining an organization's mission and character.\n  Charitable choice also states that funds going directly to religious \norganizations cannot be used for sectarian worship, instruction, or \nproselytization.\n  In recent years, Congress has begun to recognize more and more that \ngovernment alone will never cure our societal ills. We must find ways \nto enlist America's faith-based charities and nongovernmental \norganizations to help fight poverty and lift the downtrodden. The \nlegislation before us today provides us with such an opportunity.\n  Again, I want to express my appreciation to the conferees and their \nstaff that worked on this legislation: Senators Jeffords, Coats, Gregg, \nKennedy and Dodd, and Congressmen Goodling, Castle, Souder, Clay, and \nMartinez. I especially want to commend Senator Dan Coats, the Chairman \nof the Labor Committee's Subcommittee on Children and Families, for his \ndesire to include my charitable choice language in the Community \nServices Block Grant Reauthorization. Senator Coats worked very hard in \nthe conference committee to garner bipartisan support for this \nprovision. Thanks to his efforts, and the efforts of this Congress, we \nwill soon expand the opportunities for charitable and faith-based \norganizations to make a positive impact in their neighborhoods and \ncommunities through the Community Services Block Grant program.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to express my sincere \nappreciation and admiration for the distinguished Senator from Indiana. \nThe Senator from Indiana has set a standard and an example in this body \nof what it means to be a Senator, what it means to be a decent \nChristian gentleman, the likes of which I do not think have been \nsurpassed in my experience here. I have had the honor of calling him \nfriend. I have had the opportunity to serve or participate with him in \na prayer breakfast that he leads. He sets the kind of example of good \npublic service that all of us ought to seek to emulate. And I\n\n[[Page S11872]]\n\nam delighted that he has played an important role in this piece of \nlegislation, as he has in so many others. And it will be, I am sure, \nsuccessfully pursued.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the conference \nreport is agreed to, and the motion to reconsider the vote is laid upon \nthe table.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11865-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FLETCHER, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n                  CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report Executive Calendar No. \n619, on which there will be 90 minutes of debate equally divided in the \nusual form.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of William A. \nFletcher, of California, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nNinth Circuit.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the role of the Senate is to advise and \nconsent in nominations by the President for judicial vacancies. That is \nunderstood in the Constitution. Every nominee of the President comes \nbefore the Judiciary Committee and then they come before this body for \na vote. We are at this point analyzing the nomination of William \nFletcher, Willie Fletcher from California, to the Ninth Circuit. I \nregretfully must say I have concluded that I have to oppose that \nnomination. And I would like to discuss the reasons why.\n  Most of the nominations that have come forward from the President \nhave received favorable review by the Judiciary Committee. In fact, we \ncleared nine today. A number of them are on the docket today and will \nprobably pass out today. So we are making some substantial progress.\n  Nearly half of the vacancies that exist now in Federal courts are \nbecause there are no nominees for those vacancies--almost half of them. \nBut on occasion we need to stand up as a Senate and affirm certain \nfacts about our courts and our Nation. One of the facts that we need to \naffirm is that courts must carry out the rule of law, that they are not \nthere to make law. The courts are there to enforce law as written by \nthe Congress and as written by the people through their Constitution \nthat we adopted over 200 years ago. Also, that is, I think, where we \nare basically today.\n  With regard to this nomination, it is to the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals in California. Without any doubt, the Ninth Circuit is \nconsidered the most liberal circuit in the United States. It is also \nthe largest circuit. There are 11 circuit courts of appeals. And in the \nUnited States we have the U.S. district judges. These are the trial \njudges. The next level--the only intermediate level--is the courts of \nappeals. And they are one step below the U.S. Supreme Court. It is the \ncourts of appeals that superintend, day after day, the activities of \nthe district judges who practice under them.\n  There are more district judges in the circuit than there are circuit \njudges. And every appeal from a district judge's ruling, almost \nvirtually every one, would go to the courts of appeals in California \nand Arizona and the States in the West that are part of the Ninth \nCircuit. Those appeals go to the Ninth Circuit, not directly to the \nU.S. Supreme Court. As they rule on those matters, they set certain \npolicy within the circuit.\n  We have--I think Senator Biden made a speech on it once--we have 1 \nConstitution in this country, not 11. The circuit courts of appeals are \nrequired to show fidelity to the Supreme Court and to the Constitution. \nThe Supreme Court is the ultimate definer of the Constitution. And the \ncourts of appeals must take the rulings of the Supreme Court and \ninterpret them and apply them directly to their judges who work under \nthem or in their circuit and in fact set the standards of the law.\n  We do not have 11 different circuits setting 11 different policies--\nat least we should not. But it is a known fact that the Ninth Circuit \nfor many years has been out of step. Last year, 28 cases from the Ninth \nCircuit made it to the U.S. Supreme Court. The Supreme Court does not \nhear every case. This is why the circuits are so important.\n  Probably 95 percent of the cases decided by the circuits never are \nappealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court will not hear them. \nBut they agreed to hear 28 cases from the Ninth Circuit. And of those \n28 cases, they reversed 27 of them. They reversed an unprecedented \nnumber. They reversed the Ninth Circuit 27 out of the 28 times they \nreviewed a case from that circuit. And this is not a matter of recent \nphenomena.\n  I was a Federal prosecutor for almost 15 years, and during that time \nI was involved in many criminal cases. And you study the law, and you \nseek out cases where you can find them. Well, it was quite obvious--and \nFederal prosecutors all over the country used to joke about the fact \nthat the criminal defense lawyers, whenever they could not find any law \nfrom anywhere else, they could always find a Ninth Circuit case that \nwas favorable to the defendant. And they were constantly, even in those \ndays, being reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court, because the U.S. \nSupreme Court's idea and demand is that we have one Constitution, that \nthe law be applied uniformly.\n  So I just say this. The New York Times, not too many months ago, \nwrote an article about the Ninth Circuit and said these words: ``A \nmajority of the U.S. Supreme Court considers the Ninth Circuit a rogue \ncircuit, out of control. It needs to be brought back into control. They \nhave been working on it for years but have not been able to do so.''\n  All of that is sort of the background that we are dealing with today.\n  When we get a nominee to this circuit, I believe this Senate ought to \nutilize its advise and consent authority, constitutional duty, to \nensure that the nominees to it bring that circuit from being a rogue \ncircuit back into the mainstream of American law, so we do not have \nlitigants time and again having adverse rulings, that they have to go \nto the Supreme Court--however many thousands and hundreds of thousands \nof dollars--to get reversed.\n  This is serious business. Some say, ``They just reversed them. Big \ndeal.'' It costs somebody a lot of money, and a lot of cases that were \nwrong in that circuit were never accepted by the Supreme Court and were \nnever reversed. The Supreme Court can't hear every case that comes out \nof every circuit. So we are dealing with a very serious matter.\n  The Senator from Ohio who I suspect will comment today on the \nnominee, Senator DeWine, articulated it well. When we evaluate \nnominees, we have to ask ourselves what will be the impact of that \nnomination on the court and the overall situation. We want to support \nthe President. We support the President time and again. I have seen \nsome Presidential nominees that are good nominees. I am proud to \nsupport them. There are two here today who I know personally that I \nthink would be good Federal judges. But I can't say that about this \none.\n  We need to send the President of the United States a message, that \nthose Members of this body who participate in helping select nominees \ncannot, in good conscience, continue to accept nominations to this \ncircuit who are not going to make it better and bring it back into the \nmainstream of American law.\n  With regard to Mr. Fletcher, he has never practiced law. The only \nreal experience he has had outside of being a professor, was as a law \nclerk. His clerkship was for Justice William Brennan of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. That is significant and it is an honor to be selected to \nbe a law clerk for the Supreme Court. But the truth is, Justice Brennan \nhas always been recognized as the point man, the leading spokesman in \nAmerican juris prudence for an activist judiciary. I am not saying he \nis a bad man, but that is his position.\n  Justice Brennan used to dissent on every death penalty case, saying \nhe adhered to the view that the death penalty was cruel and unusual \npunishment, and within that very Constitution he said he was \ninterpreting, there are at least four to six references to the death \npenalty and capital crimes.\n\n[[Page S11873]]\n\n The Founding Fathers who wrote that Constitution never dreamed that \nanyone would say that a prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment \nwould prohibit the death penalty, because the death penalty was in \nevery State and colony in the United States at the time the \nConstitution was adopted. It never crossed their minds.\n  This is an example of judicial activism when Justice Brennan would \nconclude that he could reinterpret the Constitution and what the people \ncontracted with their Government when they ratified it. It says, ``We, \nthe people, ordain and establish this Constitution. . ..'' So they \nadopt it; it is reinterpreted. That is a classic definition of judicial \nactivism.\n  We know Mr. Fletcher was his law clerk and has written a law review \narticle referring to Justice Brennan as a national treasure. It is \nobvious he considers him an outstanding judge and a man he would tend \nto emulate.\n  Of course, judicial activism is part of his family. One of the \nproblems, and the Presiding Officer has attempted to deal with it \nthrough legislation, and was successful. Just today, I believe, we have \npassed legislation dealing with nepotism, two family members serving on \nthe same court.\n  The truth is, Mr. Fletcher's mother is a judge on the Ninth Circuit \nalready. Of the judges in the United States, I am sure she would be \nviewed as one of the most activist--in the Ninth Circuit, it is common \nknowledge she is one of the most activist nominee members of that \ncourt. It doesn't mean he will be, but he is connected to Justice \nBrennan, and his mother is a very liberal, an activist, and will remain \non the court as a senior judge and will have the opportunity to \nparticipate in a substantial number of the opinions that are rendered \nby the Ninth Circuit, because they have three-judge panels who assign \nthese cases out of the judges there and they often put these judges on \na panel. If she takes senior status, which I understand she has agreed \nto do, she would not resign from the bench but take senior status and \nstill be able to handle a substantial caseload. That is a troubling \nfact to me.\n  To me, a judge is a very important position at any level of the \ncourts. This is not an absolute disqualifying factor to me, but it is a \nvery important factor to me, and that is that Mr. Fletcher lacks any \nprivate practice experience. Mr. Fletcher has never practiced law. Mr. \nFletcher has never tried a lawsuit. He has been a law clerk for William \nBrennan and a professor at the University of California Law School. He \nhas never been in the courtroom as a litigant. He has never had the \nopportunity to have that knot in your stomach when a judge is about to \nrule on a motion, to understand the difficulties in dealing with human \nnature. He has not had that experience.\n  Having had 15 years of full-time litigation experience in Federal \ncourt trying cases, you learn things intuitively. Supreme Court \njustices and appellate court justices will be better judges if they \nhave had that experience. It is an odd thing, and not a healthy thing, \nnormally; it takes extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, in my \nopinion, to conclude that someone who has been nothing but a law \nprofessor all their life is now qualified to take a lifetime \nappointment to review the decisions of perhaps 100 or more trial judges \nin their district who are working long and hard, for whom he has never \nhad the opportunity to practice before and see what it is like. That is \nnot a good thing in itself. That is another reason I have serious \nreservations about this nominee.\n  Certainly Mr. Fletcher has a right to speak out, but in 1994, not too \nmany years ago, he made a speech in which he criticized the ``three \nstrikes'' law legislation, the criminal law changes that have swept the \ncountry, calling it ``perfectly dreadful legislation.'' He has never \nbeen a prosecutor. He has never been a judge. He has never been a \nlawyer. Here he is saying this about this legislation, which I believe \nis widely supported throughout the country. In my opinion, it has \nhelped reduce the rise in crime, because ``three strikes and you are \nout'' focuses on repeat, habitual offenders.\n  Make no mistake, somebody will say, ``You will have everybody in \njail, Jeff.'' Not so; everybody is not a repeat, three-time felony \noffender. If you focus on the repeat offender, those are the ones \ncommitting a disproportionate percentage of crime. We have done a \nbetter job on that in the last 10 or 15 years. We have tough Federal \nlaws dealing with repeat offenders. States have implemented ``three \nstrike'' laws and it has helped draw down the rise in crime. As a \nmatter of fact, crime has been dropping after going up for many years \nbecause we got tough and identified the repeat offenders and prosecuted \nthem successfully and States have stepped up to the plate and done so.\n  He criticized that. That gives me a real insight into his view about \ncriminal law, and here he will be presiding over reviewing cases of \ntrials involving murderers and other criminals in the Ninth Circuit and \nhe has never had any experience.\n  The only thing we know about him is that he considers good, tough law \nlegislation dreadful.\n  (Mr. ASHCROFT assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts with you \nabout judicial activism. In 1982, Mr. Fletcher wrote an article \nentitled ``The Discretionary Constitution.'' He was a professor then. \nIt has been interpreted by many as a blatant approval of judicial \nactivism. He discusses institutional suits. I was attorney general of \nthe State of Alabama and I had to deal with Federal judges who have \nmajor court orders dominating the prison system. Most States have \nprison systems under court order, having Federal judges ruling those, \nand mental health systems and school funding issues are decided by \nFederal judges. So he wrote about that and other issues. In that \narticle, this is what he said, and it really troubles me:\n\n       The only legitimate basis for a Federal judge to take over \n     the political function in devising or choosing a remedy in an \n     institutional suit is a demonstrated unwillingness or \n     incapacity of the political body.\n\n  I want you to think about that. That is a revealing quote, that, \nwell, the only way you can do it is if the institution demonstrates an \nunwillingness or incapacity to act. That is the rationale of the \nliberal activist. What they say is, well, the State of Alabama didn't \nprovide enough gruel for the criminals, so we are going to issue an \norder and tell them what they have to feed them three times a day. Or \nwe are going to have a law library for every prison, and they have to \nhave so many square feet. Or you have to spend so much money on \neducation; you have to change your whole way of funding education in \nyour State. Why? Because the State would not act.\n  Now, we live in a democracy. In a democracy, the people rule; they \ndecide what they want to do. I know the distinguished Senator in the \nChair, Mr. Ashcroft, shares this view. I have heard him express it. I \nthink these are his exact words: ``When the legislature does not act, \nthat is a decision.'' When they go into session, they decide to act on \nmatters or not act on them, and not acting is an action, a decision not \nto act. The people have influence with that because they elect their \nrepresentatives and, if they are not happy, they can remove them from \noffice.\n  But you can't remove a Federal judge because he has a lifetime \nappointment. He cannot be removed, except for the most serious personal \nabuses of office. Normally, making bad decisions is not one of those. I \nwill just say this. We have a circuit that is in trouble. It is \nconsidered by a majority of the Supreme Court to be a rogue circuit. We \nneed to put nominees on this circuit and move it back into the \nmainstream and not continue it out on the left wing. We have a \nresponsibility to assure that the judges we confirm are going to \nimprove the courts, and I think we need to vote ``no'' on this \nnomination because I don't believe it will take us back in the \ndirection we need to go. I think it will take us in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I need.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Professor William \nFletcher, nominee to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. I am pleased \nthat the U.S. Senate is finally fully considering this nominee.\n  Mr. Fletcher was first nominated during the 104th Congress on \nDecember\n\n[[Page S11874]]\n\n21, 1995. I do regret the fact that his nomination has languished for \nas long as it has, but I would like to comment on some of the obstacles \nthat have hindered this nomination.\n  First, all nominees to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals got bound \nup within the difficulties we were having with deciding whether or not \nto divide the Ninth Circuit. Once we established a commission to look \ninto this matter, we have been able to process nominees to that court.\n  Second, some had concerns--legitimate concerns--that Professor \nFletcher's mother, Betty Fletcher, currently serves as a judge on the \nNinth Circuit. There is a statute that appears to prevent two people, \nclosely related by blood or marriage, from serving on the same court. \nNow, the Justice Department said that only applies to people less than \nthe judiciary, but that was pure bunk as far as I was concerned. The \nstatute is pretty clear. Yes, it is an old statute, but it is clear and \nit is a matter of great concern to me. To ensure compliance with that \nlaw--or to the best of my ability to make sure that this law is \ncomplied with, Judge Betty Fletcher has agreed to take senior status \nupon her son's confirmation, and Senator Kyl has introduced \nlegislation, which passed the Senate last night, which I support, that \nwill clarify the applicability of the so-called antinepotism statute.\n  Just to say a little bit on that statute, it seems to me that it is \nvery logical that we should not place persons of such close \nconsanguinity on the same court that overviews 50 million people. \nSurely we can find people other than sons of mothers on the court. So \nSenator Kyl has made a splendid effort to try to resolve this matter. \nHe indicated in our Judiciary Committee this morning that, as a matter \nof principle, he would have to vote against Professor Fletcher because \nhe feels that the statute does apply. I tried to resolve it by chatting \nwith Judge Betty Fletcher who has agreed to take senior status upon her \nson's confirmation.\n  Now that these obstacles have been removed, I am pleased that we are \nvoting on Mr. Fletcher and would like to express my considered view \nthat he should be confirmed.\n  I am the first to say that I may not agree with all of Professor \nFletcher's views on Federal courts and procedure, the separation of \npowers, or constitutional interpretation. But the question is not \nwhether I agree with all of his views, or whether a Republican \nPresident would or would not nominate such a candidate. The President \nis entitled to have his nominees confirmed, provided that the nominee \nis well qualified and will abide by the appropriate limitations on \nFederal judges.\n  I recognize that this is especially important for nominees to the \nNinth Circuit and concur wholeheartedly with those of my colleagues who \nbelieve that the Ninth Circuit has literally gone out of control. I \nagree with the distinguished Senator from Alabama that that circuit is \nout of line and out of control. It is often reversed. It has a 75 \npercent reversal rate over the last number of decades because of these \nactivist judges on that bench. But Professor Fletcher has personally \nassured me that he would follow precedent, that he would interpret and \nenforce the law, not make laws from the bench.\n  I believe Professor Fletcher is a man of honor and integrity and that \nhe will live up to his word and, in fact, I hope Professor Fletcher, \nwho is an expert on civil procedure, can actually help rein in some of \nthe more radical forces on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Professor Fletcher clearly is highly qualified. He is a graduate of \nthe Yale Law School, he clerked for a Supreme Court Justice, and is \nconsidered an eminent legal scholar. That consideration is justified. \nAlthough some of his writings may push the envelope of established \nlegal thinking, as often happens in the case of professors of law, we \nshould recognize that this is the role of academics. I made that point \nduring the Bork nomination when my colleagues on the other side were \nfinding fault with many of the positions that Judge Bork had taken in \nsome of his writings, many of which he repudiated later, but all of \nwhich were provocative and intended to create debate on the respective \nsubjects.\n  In short, I believe Professor Fletcher is within the mainstream of \nAmerican legal thought just as several Republican nominees such as \nAntonin Scalia, Frank Easterbrook, Richard Posner, and Ralph Winter \nwere when they were nominated, and this body should confirm him today.\n  I hope my colleagues will confirm Professor Fletcher.\n  Today the Judiciary Committee voted out 15 judicial nominees and 4 \nU.S. attorneys. This year we have held hearings for 111 out of 127 \nnominees.\n  If all of the judges who are now pending on the Senate floor are \nconfirmed, as I expect they will be, we will end this Congress having \nconfirmed 106 judges, resulting in a vacancy rate of 5.4 percent. This \nwill be the lowest vacancy rate since the judiciary was expanded in \n1990.\n  Also, over 50 percent of the judges confirmed this year, to date, by \nthis Republican Senate have been women and/or minorities.\n  Given the fact that over the last five Congresses the average number \nof article III judges confirmed is 96, I think this Republican majority \nhas done very well to this point, and will continue to do so. Can we do \nbetter? Always. I am sure we can. And we will certainly try to do \nbetter during this coming year, and I intend to do better during the \ncoming year.\n  At this particular point, we are concerned about Professor William \nFletcher, who I believe is highly qualified for this job. Even though I \ndon't agree with him on everything that he believes, or everything that \nhe has taught, the fact of the matter is he is qualified, he is a \ndecent man, and he should be confirmed here today.\n  Although Professor Fletcher's nomination has taken quite a while to \nbe brought up for a vote, I do not think anyone can fairly criticize \nthe work the Judiciary Committee has done this year, especially during \nthe last few weeks of this session. On Tuesday of this week, Senator \nSpecter chaired a hearing for 11 nominees. Nine of those 11 nominees \nwere received by the Committee only within the last month. I am told \nthat, according to the Department of Justice, the hearing Senator \nSpecter chaired broke a record for the most nominees on a single \nhearing.\n  To date, the Republican Senate has already confirmed 80 judges. And \ntoday, that number will rise to 84, if Professor Fletcher and the other \njudges that will be brought up for a vote are confirmed--as I wholly \nexpect they will. As I stated earlier, if all of the nominees now \npending on the Senate floor are confirmed, the Senate will adjourn \nhaving confirmed 106 Article III judges.\n  Again, this will leave a judicial vacancy rate of only 5.6 percent. \nKeep in mind that the Clinton administration is on record as having \nstated that a vacancy rate of just over 7 percent is considered virtual \nfull employment of the Federal judiciary.\n  I do not think anyone can legitimately argue that the Judiciary \nCommittee has not done its job well. Yes, there have been some \ncontroversial Clinton nominees that have moved slowly or not at all, \nbut sometimes nominees come to the Committee with problems that prevent \ntheir nominations from going forth. I am pleased to say that although \nsome thought the problems relating to Professor Fletcher's nomination \ncould not be worked out, they ultimately have been. I fully expect that \nProfessor Fletcher will be confirmed today and I will vote for him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. How much time does the distinguished Senator from \nWashington desire? I yield 5 minutes or such time as he needs to the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I share the background of the Senator from \nAlabama as attorney general of my State. I agree with much of the \nphilosophic underpinning of his remarks directed at the judicial \nphilosophy of Mr. Fletcher. I disagree, however, as to the conclusion, \nand intend to vote for his confirmation.\n  The Constitution of the United States says that the President shall \nnominate and by and with the advice of the Senate shall appoint judges \nto positions like the one we are debating here today.\n  In my view--I have some differences even with my good friend from \nUtah on\n\n[[Page S11875]]\n\nthis subject--I believe that does permit a Senator to vote against a \njudicial nominee on the grounds that the Senator disagrees with the \nfundamental legal philosophy of that nominee. I also believe, however, \nthat when the President has sought the advice as well as the consent of \nthe Senate, and when that advice has been heated, at least to the \nextent of being given significant weight, it is then appropriate to \nvote for the confirmation of a judicial nominee, even though one, as an \nindividual Senator, might well not have nominated that individual had \nhe, the Senator, been President of the United States.\n  That is the situation in which I find myself here. I have met with \nand talked about Mr. Fletcher's ambitions on two or three occasions at \nsome length. I have found him to be a thoughtful, intelligent, hard-\nworking individual dedicated to the law as he sees it, and, perhaps \neven more importantly than that, as the Constitution and the statutes \nof the United States lay it out.\n  He would certainly not have been my first choice had I been the \nnominating authority in this case. But, I am not. I am an individual \nSenator. At the same time, the President of the United States and his \nofficers have, in fact, sought my advice as well as my consent on \njudicial nominees, both to the district courts in the State of \nWashington, and to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals when those \nnominees come from the State of Washington.\n  While again I have not necessarily gotten my first choices for those \npositions, I believe that in a constitutional sense my advice has been \nsought and my advice has been given considerable weight by the \nPresident of the United States.\n  As a consequence, the combination of the punctual adherence to \nconstitutional requirements with my own belief that Mr. Fletcher will \nfill the position of a judge on the Ninth Circuit honorably, and in \naccordance with the Constitution and laws of the United States, causes \nme to feel that he is a qualified nominee and that he should be \nconfirmed by the Members of the Senate to the office to which the \nPresident has nominated him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia. She requires how much time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the distinguished manager. May I have 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for the nomination \nof Professor William Alan Fletcher to the Ninth Circuit Court. I very \nmuch appreciate the views of the chairman of the committee, the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, on this, and his considered judgment \nthat Mr. Fletcher deserves approval by this body. And I hope, indeed, \nthat will be the case.\n  Mr. Fletcher has been before this body for over 3 years now. He has \nhad two Judiciary Committee hearings. I had the pleasure of attending \nboth and listening to him. His responses at these hearings were crisp, \nto the point, direct, and showed a depth and breadth of knowledge of \nthe law that I think is among the top one percent of those nominees who \ncame before the committee.\n  His credentials are impeccable. As the chairman pointed out, they \ninclude: magna cum laude graduate of Harvard; Rhodes scholar; law \ndegree from Yale; service in the Navy; law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court \nJustice William Brennan; and a clerkship for District Court Judge \nStanley Weigel.\n  Since 1977, he has been a distinguished professor at the Boalt Hall \nSchool of Law at the University of California, where he won the 1993 \nDistinguished Teacher Award and has come to be regarded as one of the \nmost foremost experts on the Federal court and the Constitution.\n  Mr. President, since the distinguished Senator from Alabama raised \nsome concerns about this nominee, I would like to respond to some of \nthose concerns. We asked Mr. Fletcher to respond, and, in fact, he \nprovided us with a response on a number of items that have been raised \nby Mr. Thomas Jipping, of the Judicial Selection Monitoring Project, \nand subsequently repeated.\n  The first allegation is what was called the ``discretionary \nConstitution.'' Mr. Jipping attributes to Professor Fletcher the \nconclusion:\n\n       When judges think that the political branches are not doing \n     what they should, judges have the discretionary power to do \n     it for them.\n\n  And he states:\n\n       Mr. Fletcher writes that this virtually unlimited judicial \n     discretion is a ``legitimate substitute for political \n     discretion'' when the political branches are ``in default.''\n\n  I would like to give you directly the statement from Mr. Fletcher.\n  The article says quite the opposite of what Mr. Jipping wrote. I do \nnot believe in a ``discretionary Constitution.'' As the article makes \nplain, I view judicial discretion as a problem rather than a solution. \nFurther, I did not write that judicial discretion is legitimate when \npolitical branches are ``in default.'' Rather, I wrote that the \nexercise of judicial discretion in curing constitutional violations in \ninstitutional suits is ``presumptively illegitimate'' unless the \npolitical bodies that should cure those violations are in ``serious and \nchronic default.''\n  I would like to put all of this in the Record.\n  On the second point that has been raised critically, on standing, Mr. \nFletcher writes:\n\n       Contrary to what Mr. Jipping wrote, I do not believe \n     Congress can write statutes that allow anyone or anything to \n     sue. Indeed, in some cases I take a narrower view of standing \n     than the Supreme Court. For example, I argued that the Court \n     should not have granted standing in Buckley v. Valeo. My \n     position on standing would not drastically expand caseloads. \n     Further, rather than inviting judges to legislate from the \n     bench, I am particularly anxious that the Federal courts not \n     perform as a ``super-legislature.''\n\n  The third point that he has been criticized for is the \nunconstitutionality of statutes. The critic writes:\n\n       Mr. Fletcher believes that judges can declare \n     unconstitutional legislation they believe was inadequately \n     considered by Congress. He argues that a statute effectively \n     terminating lawsuits against defense contractors by \n     substituting the United States as the defendant was passed \n     without hearings and based on what he believes are \n     misrepresentations about its operation. That alone would be \n     sufficient to strike down the statute.\n\n  Now, this is Mr. Fletcher's response:\n\n       I believe no such thing. I argued that the presumption of \n     constitutionality normally accorded to a statute should not \n     be accorded to the Warner Amendment, based on the following \n     factors: (1) The only body in Congress that considered the \n     amendment was a subcommittee of the House Judiciary \n     Committee, which held hearings and concluded that it was \n     unconstitutional; (2) When the amendment was later attached \n     as a rider to an unrelated defense appropriations bill, it \n     was consistently described as doing the opposite of what it \n     actually did.\n\n  And so, if I might, to clear these things up, Mr. Fletcher has \nsubmitted to us a draft response, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record both the allegations and the responses.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to correct some \n     mischaracterizations of my writing that have been put forward \n     by Mr. Thomas Jipping.\n       The most extensive misrepresentations are contained in Mr. \n     Jipping's May 10, 1996, op-ed piece in The Washington Times. \n     I will take them in order.\n\n\n                        (1) judicial discretion\n\n       Mr. Jipping wrote: ``First, Mr. Fletcher believes in what \n     he has called a ``discretionary Constitution.'' In fact, that \n     was the title of his first law review article. When judges \n     think the political branches are not doing what they should, \n     judges have the discretionary power to do it for them. Mr. \n     Fletcher writes that this virtually unlimited judicial \n     discretion is a ``legitimate substitute for political \n     discretion'' when the political branches are ``in default.'' \n     Not surprisingly, judges get to determine when the political \n     process has defaulted. Today courts are running prison \n     systems, school districts and even mental institutions in the \n     name of such discretion.'' The article Mr. Jipping refers to \n     is ``The Discretionary Constitution: Institutional Remedies \n     and Judicial Legitimacy,'' 91 Yale L.J. 635 (1982).\n       Brief statement: The article says quite the opposite of \n     what Mr. Jipping wrote. I do not believe in a ``discretionary \n     Constitution.'' As the article makes plain, I view judicial \n     discretion as a problem rather than a solution. Further, I \n     did not write that judicial discretion is legitimate when \n     political branches are ``in default.'' Rather, I wrote that \n     the exercise of judicial discretion in curing constitutional\n\n[[Page S11876]]\n\n     violations in institutional suits is ``presumptively \n     illegitimate'' unless the political bodies that should cure \n     those violations are in ``serious and chronic default.'' at \n     pp. 637, 695 (emph. added).\n       Extended analysis: The article analyzed institutional \n     injunctions where there has already been a finding of \n     unconstitutionality in the operation of a prison or mental \n     hospital, in the apportionment of a legislature, or in the \n     racial segregation of public schools. After there has been a \n     finding of a constitutional violation, the question arises: \n     Who should decide how that violation should be cured? Even \n     where there has been a constitutional violation, I argue that \n     the role of the federal courts should be severely \n     circumscribed, and that judicially formulated injunctions \n     should be regarded as presumptively illegitimate.\n       Constitutional violations in institutional cases can be \n     cured in many ways. For example, in a prison case where \n     conditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment, a \n     prison administrator can do a number of different things to \n     bring the prison into compliance with the Constitution. Or \n     in a reapportionment case a state legislature can draw \n     district lines in a number of different ways to bring the \n     districts into compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment. \n     Choices among the possible remedies inescapably involved \n     the exercise of discretion, and should be regarded as \n     presumptively illegitimate if made by a judge rather than \n     a political entity. I wrote: ``Trial court remedial \n     discretion [in institutional suits] can to some degree be \n     controlled in the manner of its exercise; in some cases it \n     may even be eliminated without sacrificing unduly the \n     constitutional or other values at stake. But there comes a \n     point where certain governmental tasks, whether undertaken \n     by the political branches or the judiciary, simply cannot \n     be performed effectively without a substantial mount of \n     discretion. * * * The practical inevitability of remedial \n     discretion in performing those tasks defines the \n     legitimate role of the federal courts. * * * [S]ince trial \n     court remedial discretion in institutional suits is \n     inevitably political in nature, it must be regarded as \n     presumptively illegitimate.'' at pp. 636-37 (emph. added).\n       In Swann v.  Mecklenberg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16 \n     (1971), Chief Justice Burger wrote for the Court that the \n     district court has the power to fashion an institutional \n     injunction only ``[i]n default by the school authorities of \n     their obligation to proffer acceptable remedies'' (emph. \n     added). I argued that ``default'' by the political \n     authorities--which in the view of the Supreme Court justified \n     a judicially fashioned injunction--should be found only as a \n     last resort. I wrote. ``Political bodies and courts respond \n     to different institutional imperatives. * * * As a matter of \n     fundamental structure, even where a constitutional violation \n     has been found, a court cannot legitimately resolve such a \n     problem unless the political bodies that ordinarily should do \n     so are in such serious and chronic default that here is \n     realistically no other choice.'' at p. 695 (emph. added).\n       My argument is neither liberal not activist. Indeed, my \n     formulation is more conservative and restrained than Chief \n     Justice Burger's in Charlotte-Mecklenberg, where he required \n     that school authorities simply be ``in default.'' I \n     recommended increasing the threshold for judicial action by \n     requiring that the political body be in ``such serious and \n     chronic default that there is realistically no other \n     choice.''\n       Throughout the article, I emphasized the danger in judicial \n     overreaching: ``[A] federal court is not, and should not \n     permit itself the illusion that it can be, anything more than \n     a temporarily legitimate substitute for a political body that \n     has failed to serve its function. '' at 969.\n\n\n                              (2) Standing\n\n       Mr. Jipping wrote: ``Second, the Constitution limits court \n     jurisdiction to `cases' and `controversies.' One way to \n     assure this jurisdiction is to demand that plaintiffs \n     concretely trace their injury to the defendant's action, \n     preventing judges from reaching out to decide issues and make \n     law in the abstract. In a 1988 article, Mr. Fletcher argues \n     that standing is merely a way of looking at the merits of a \n     case rather than assuring a court's jurisdiction. As such, he \n     believes that Congress can write statues that allow anyone or \n     anything to sue, regardless of whether plaintiffs have \n     suffered any harm at all. This view would drastically expand \n     federal court caseloads and give judges innumerable \n     opportunities to legislate from the bench.'' The article Mr. \n     Jipping refers to is ``The Structure of Standing,'' 98 Yale \n     L.J. 221 (1988).\n       Brief statement: Contrary to what Mr. Jipping wrote, I do \n     not believe Congress can write statutes that allow anyone or \n     anything to sue. Indeed, in some cases I take a narrower view \n     of standing than the Supreme Court. For example, I argued \n     that the Court should not have granted standing in Buckley v. \n     Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976). My position on standing would not \n     drastically expand caseloads. Further, rather than inviting \n     judges to legislate from the bench, I am particularly anxious \n     that the federal courts not perform as a ``super-\n     legislature.''\n       Extended analysis: The article sought to bring some \n     intellectual order to an area of doctrine long criticized as \n     incoherent. I agreed with Justice Harlan that standing as \n     presently articulated is ``a word game played by secret \n     rules.'' Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 129 (1968) (Harlan, J., \n     dissenting) at 221. My concern was not to argue for different \n     results in standing cases, but rather to provide a coherent \n     intellectual structure that would support those results. As I \n     wrote, ``[W]e mistake the nature of the problem if we condemn \n     the results in standing cases.'' at 223 (emph added).\n       In my view, Justice Douglas' opinion in Association of Data \n     Processing Service Org. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970), is the \n     source of much of the analytical difficulty. I stated, ``More \n     damage to the intellectual structure of the law of standing \n     can be traced to Data Processing than to any other single \n     decision.'' at 229. In essence, I argued that standing \n     doctrine should return to what it had been at the beginning \n     of this century, when a plaintiff in federal court has to \n     state a cause of action, and the focus was on the particular \n     statutory or constitutional provision invoked by plaintiff. \n     Under this earlier approach, a plaintiff has to show that he \n     was entitled to relief ``on the merits,'' in the sense not \n     only that defendant violated a legal duty but also that \n     plaintiff had a legal right to judicial enforcement of that \n     duty.\n       In a few cases, I disagreed with results reached by the \n     Supreme Court. In those few cases, I generally viewed \n     standing more narrowly than the Court and would have denied \n     standing. The most important such case is Buckley v. Valeo, \n     424 U.S. 1 (1976). I did not criticize the substance of the \n     Court's decision, but I did criticize its grant of standing.\n       In Buckley, the Court sustained a statutory grant of \n     standing to any person eligible to vote for President to \n     challenge on any constitutional ground the Federal Election \n     Campaign Act of 1971. Plaintiffs included Senator Buckley who \n     had introduced the standing provision in the Senate. They \n     challenged the Act under the statutory grant of standing; the \n     District Court certified twenty-two constitutional questions \n     to the Supreme Court; and the Court answered all of them. I \n     wrote: ``[I]f the twenty-two certified questions answered in \n     Buckley had been sent to the Court in a letter from the \n     Senate floor, as the twenty-nine questions in Correspondence \n     of the Justices were sent to the Court in a letter from \n     Secretary of State Jefferson[, i]t is unthinkable that the \n     Court would have answered them. Yet when Congress cast the \n     questions in the form of a lawsuit granting standing to one \n     of its members, the Court in Buckley willingly provided the \n     answers, performing, in Judge Leventhal's words, in a ``role \n     resembling that of a super-legislature.'' The lessons of \n     Buckley are sobering. Not only will the Court answer \n     questions that have proven particularly difficult for \n     Congress. It will also answer them in the highly abstract \n     form traditionally thought particularly ill-suited for \n     judicial resolution.'' at 286 (emph. added). My approach to \n     standing could hardly be clearer: I argued that the Court \n     should not have granted standing and should not have acted as \n     a ``super-legislature.''\n\n\n                  (3) Unconstitutionality of statutes\n\n       Mr. Jipping wrote: ``Third, Mr. Fletcher believes that \n     judges can declare unconstitutional legislation they believe \n     was inadequately considered by Congress. He argues that a \n     statute effectively terminating lawsuits against defense \n     contractors by substituting the United States as the \n     defendant was passed without hearings and based on what he \n     believes are misrepresentations about its operation. That \n     alone would be sufficient to strike down the statute.'' The \n     article Mr. Jipping refers to is ``Atomic Bomb Testing and \n     the Warner Amendment: A Violation of the Separation of \n     Powers,'' 65 Wash. L. Rev. 285 (1990).\n       Brief statement: I believe no such thing. I argued that the \n     presumption of constitutionality normally accorded to a \n     statute should not be accorded to the Warner Amendment, based \n     on the following factors: (1) The only body in Congress that \n     considered the Amendment was a subcommittee of the House \n     Judiciary Committee, which held hearings and concluded that \n     it was unconstitutional; (2) when the Amendment was later \n     attached as a rider to an unrelated defense appropriations \n     bill, it was consistently described as doing the opposite of \n     what it actually did.\n       Elimination of the presumption does not mean that a statute \n     is unconstitutional. A statute is unconstitutional only if it \n     independently violates some provision of the Constitution. \n     I did not argue--and do not believe--that inadequate \n     consideration by Congress ``alone would be sufficient to \n     strike down a statute.''\n       Extended analysis: At the outset, I note that I wrote the \n     article as an advocate for the American military veterans and \n     civilian downwinders. My involvement as advocate is indicated \n     at the beginning of the article at 285, *fn.\n       Between 1946 and 1963, the United States conducted a little \n     over 300 atmospheric tests of atomic bomb, about 200 of them \n     in Nevada. Over 200,000 soldiers and an undetermined number \n     of civilians were exposed to significant amounts of radiation \n     during the tests. Atmospheric tests were discontinued in 1963 \n     after the United States signed a test ban treaty. In the \n     1980s, a number of suits were filed against the private \n     contractors who had assisted the government in the tests. \n     Seeking to short-circuit the suits, the contractors sought a \n     statute that would protect them. Joined by the executive \n     branch, they sought a statute that would substitute the \n     United States as a defendant in their place, and would then \n     permit the United States to obtain a dismissal on grounds of \n     sovereign immunity.\n\n[[Page S11877]]\n\n       In 1983, a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee \n     held hearings on the proposed statute and issued a written \n     report concluding that it would be unconstitutional. The \n     following year, Senator Warner attached the proposed statute \n     as a rider to a defense appropriation bill. The conference \n     committee report said that the amendment ``would provide \n     remedy against the United States,'' even though it was clear \n     that the intent, and ultimate effect, would be to deprive the \n     plaintiffs of any remedy at all. After the passage of the \n     Amendment, the District Court substituted the United States \n     as a defendant and dismissed the suits. In re Consolidated \n     United States Atmospheric Testing Litigation, 616 F.Supp. 759 \n     (N.D. Calif. 1985), aff'd sub nom. Konizeski v. Livermore \n     Labs, 820 F.2d 982 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. den., 485 U.S. 905 \n     (1988).\n       I argued that the Warner Amendment violated separation of \n     powers by interfering with the judicial function in violation \n     of United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128 (1872). I contended \n     the Warner Amendment should not enjoy the normal presumption \n     of constitutionality: ``[C]ourts ordinarily accord a strong \n     presumption of constitutionality to any legislation that is \n     enacted in accordance with the formally required process. We \n     should be very reluctant to abandon the presumption when a \n     statute has fulfilled the formal prerequisites, but in \n     certain circumstances such an abandonment may be justified. . \n     . . [In the case of the Warner Amendment] we have . . . \n     affirmative evidence that the one body in Congress that \n     seriously considered the amendment found it unconstitutional. \n     Moreover, we know that the bill was passed thereafter only by \n     avoiding hearings and misrepresenting the bill's character. \n     Under such circumstances, the Warner Amendment can hardly lay \n     claim to the traditional presumption in favor of a statute's \n     constitutionality.'' at 320 (emph. added).\n\n\n                        (4) separation of powers\n\n       Mr. Jipping wrote: ``Finally, Mr. Fletcher rejects perhaps \n     the most important limitation on government power established \n     by the Constitution's framers, the separation of powers. The \n     Supreme Court has said what the Framers said, namely, that \n     each branch has relatively defined and exclusive areas of \n     authority and power. In a 1987 article, Mr. Fletcher \n     condemned these decisions as `fundamentally misguided'. Why? \n     The Court `read the Constitution in a literalistic way to \n     upset what the other two branches had decided, under the \n     political circumstances, was the most workable arrangement.' \n     In other words, political circumstances can trump \n     constitutional principles.'' The article Mr. Jipping refers \n     to is a review of Chief Justice Rehnquists's book, The \n     Supreme Court: How It Was, How It Is, 75 Calif.L.Rev. 1891 \n     (1987).\n       Brief statement: I do not reject separation of powers. \n     Indeed, I relied on separation of powers to argue the \n     unconstitutionality of the Warner Amendment, calling it a \n     ``vital check against tyranny.'' 65 Wash.L.Rev. at 310. In \n     the review I criticized two separation of powers decisions by \n     the Supreme Court, Immigration and Naturalization Service v. \n     Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), and Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. \n     385 (1986), in which the Court found unconstitutional two \n     Acts of Congress. Believing in judicial restraint, Justice \n     White dissented because he found no clear constitutional text \n     invalidating what Congress had done. I agreed with Justice \n     White.\n       Extended analysis: In Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service v. Chadha, the Supreme Court struck down the use of \n     the one-house veto by Congress. In Bowsher v. Synar, the \n     Court struck down the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act providing for \n     federal deficit reduction. I wrote: ``I think both decisions \n     fundamentally misguided, for essentially the reasons given by \n     Justice White in his dissenting opinions. . . . Justice White \n     pointed out that [Chadha] invalidated, at one stroke, almost \n     200 statutes on the basis of a highly debatable reading of \n     the Constitution. Invoking Justice Jackson's emphasis on a \n     `workable government' in his concurrence in the Steel Seizure \n     Case, Justice White reminded the Court that the `wisdom of \n     the Framers was to anticipate that . . . new problems of \n     governance would require different solutions.' . . . Justice \n     White, [dissenting in Bowsher], again invoked Justice \n     Jackson's view of the Constitution as a charter for a \n     `workable government,' and objected to what he saw as the \n     Court's `distressingly formalistic view' in attaching \n     dispositive significance to what should be regarded as a \n     triviality.' '' at 1894.\n       Justices White and Jackson firmly believed in a non-\n     activist judiciary. As a matter of interpretive principle, \n     they deferred to the judgment of the political branches \n     unless the clear text of the Constitution commanded \n     otherwise. I agree with them.\n       I thank you for the opportunity to correct these \n     mischaracterizations.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              William A. Fletcher.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, University of California law professor \nCharles Alan Wright, one of the Nation's leading conservative \nconstitutional scholars, had this to say about Dr. Fletcher:\n\n       Too many scholars approach a new issue with preconceptions \n     of how it should come out and they force the data that their \n     research uncovers to support the conclusion that they had \n     formed before they did the research. I think that is \n     reprehensible for a scholar and it is dangerous for a judge.\n       I am completely confident that when Fletcher finishes his \n     service on the ninth circuit we will say not that he has been \n     a liberal judge or a conservative judge but that he has been \n     an excellent judge, one who has brought a brilliant mind, \n     greater powers of analysis, and total objectivity to the \n     cases that came before him.\n       I believe that the nomination of William Fletcher will add \n     strength to the ninth circuit and I hope very much that he is \n     confirmed.\n\n  I would like to also quote Stephen Burbank of the University of \nPennsylvania Law School:\n\n       His work is both analytically acute and painstaking in its \n     regard for history. Indeed, love of and respect for history \n     shine through all his work, as the history itself illuminates \n     the various corners of the law he enters.\n\n  Interestingly enough, the New Republic wrote in an editorial in 1995:\n\n       Fletcher is the most impressive scholar of Federal \n     jurisdiction in the country. His path-breaking articles on \n     sovereign immunity and Federal common law have transformed \n     the debates in these fields; and his work is marked by the \n     kind of careful historical and textual analysis that should \n     serve as a model for liberals and conservatives alike. If \n     confirmed, Fletcher will join his mother--\n\n  And as we know now his mother is going to take senior status --\n\n     but his judicial philosophy is more constrained than hers. We \n     hope he is confirmed as swiftly as possible.\n\n  That was back in 1995 when he was nominated. It is now almost the end \nof 1998, and as this man has gone through the scrutiny of 3 years of \ndelay, I must say I very much hope that this body will confirm him this \nafternoon. I believe, as another has said, that he will, in fact, be an \nexcellent, thoughtful and commonsense judge.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am very happy to finally have the \nopportunity to come to the floor today and vote on the nomination of \nProfessor William Fletcher to the U.S. Court of Appeals in the Ninth \nCircuit. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote for Professor \nFletcher, who is eminently qualified to serve on the federal appeals \ncourt. Professor Fletcher was first nominated on April 26, 1995. He had \na hearing and was reported out in May of 1996, and has been patiently \nwaiting for a debate and vote on his nomination ever since.\n  Some members of the Senate oppose this nomination because his mother \nsits on this court. However, his mother, the Honorable Betty Fletcher, \nhas already agreed to take senior status and not sit on panels with her \nson if he is confirmed. So, again, I am very happy to once again \nexercise my duties as a U.S. Senator and cast a vote on the nomination \nof a federal judge.\n  To give a little history, the 104th Congress never acted on Professor \nFletcher's nomination the first time, so he had to be renominated on \nJanuary 7, 1997. He waited more than a year for a second hearing, and \nhas continued to wait for a confirmation vote, until today. One look at \nhis record, and I am sure my colleagues will see that Professor \nFletcher is eminently qualified to sit on the federal bench, and \ndeserves swift Senate confirmation.\n  In 1968, Professor William Fletcher received his undergraduate \ndegree, magna cum laude, from Harvard College. He spent the next two \nyears at Oxford University on a Rhodes Scholarship, receiving another \nB.A. in 1970. After Oxford, he spent the following two years on active \nduty military service in the United States Navy. He was honorably \ndischarged as a Lieutenant in 1972. Professor Fletcher then attended \nYale Law School, graduating in 1975. While at Yale, he was a member of \nthe Yale Law Journal.\n  After graduating from law school, Professor Fletcher clerked for a \nyear for U.S. District Judge Stanely A. Weigel in the Northern District \nof California, and another year for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William \nJ. Brennan, Jr. He began teaching at the University of California, \nBerkeley, School of Law, also known as Boalt Hall, in the fall of 1977, \nimmediately after his second clerkship. While at Boalt Hall, Professor \nFletcher has been teaching a broad range of courses, including \nProperty, Administrative Law, Conflicts, Remedies, and Constitutional \nLaw.\n  Professor Fletcher is widely praised by his students and his fellow \nacademics for his fair-minded and balanced approach to legal problems. \nHe promises to bring the same careful fair-mindedness to the federal \nbench.\n\n[[Page S11878]]\n\n  I believe professor Fletcher will make an exceptional addition to the \nfederal bench. I believe his intelligence, broad experience, and \nprofessional service qualify him to sit on the federal bench with great \ndistinction. I am sure my Senate colleagues will be equally impressed, \nand I urge my colleagues to vote for his confirmation.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield up to 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to oppose the \nnomination of William Fletcher to be a U.S. Circuit Court judge for the \nNinth Circuit. On May 21, 1998, the Senate Judiciary Committee \nfavorably reported out this nominee by a vote of 12 to 6.\n  I voted against the nominee. I would like to take a moment this \nafternoon to explain to my colleagues in the Senate why I voted no on \nthat date and why I intend to vote no today. I intend to vote no today, \nMr. President, and I base my opposition on the fact that Mr. Fletcher's \nwritings and statements simply do not convince me that he will help to \nmove the Ninth Circuit closer to the mainstream of judicial thought. \nAnd that is the criteria that I applied and will continue to apply in \nregard to the Ninth Circuit.\n  Although some Senators oppose this nominee because of their reading \nof the antinepotism statute and their concerns in that area, the fact \nthat Mr. Fletcher's mother also serves on the Ninth Circuit, who, as my \ncolleague pointed out, will take senior status, does not trouble me. As \nI said in the Judiciary Committee, I am not in favor of legislation \nthat, based on family relationships, restricts the power of the \nPresident or the power of the Senate to either nominate or confirm \njudges.\n  Having said that, Mr. President, let me restate what does concern me \nabout this nomination. All of us--all of us--should be concerned about \nwhat has been going on in the Ninth Circuit over the last few years. \nBased on the alarming reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit, I have said \nbefore and I will say it again for the Record today, I feel compelled \nto apply a higher standard of scrutiny for Ninth Circuit nominees than \nI do for nominations to any other circuit.\n  Mr. President, I will only support nominees to the Ninth Circuit who \npossess the qualifications and whose background shows that they have \nthe ability and the inclination to move the circuit back towards the \nmainstream of judicial thought in this country. Before we consider \nfuture Ninth Circuit nominees, I urge my colleagues to take a close \nlook at the evidence, evidence that shows that we have a judicial \ncircuit today that each year continues to move away from the \nmainstream.\n  I believe the President of the United States has very broad \ndiscretion to nominate to the Federal bench whomever he chooses, and \nthe Senate should give him due deference when he nominates someone for \na Federal judgeship. However, having said that, the Senate does have a \nconstitutional duty to offer its advice and consent on judicial \nnominations. Each Senator, of course, has his or her own criteria for \noffering this advice and consent. However, given that these nominations \nare lifetime appointments, all of us take our advice and consent \nresponsibility very seriously.\n  We should keep in mind that the Supreme Court of our country has time \nto review only a small number of decisions from any circuit. That \ncertainly is true with the Ninth Circuit as well. This means that each \ncircuit, the Ninth Circuit in this case, in reality is the court of \nlast resort. In the case of the Ninth Circuit, they are the court of \nlast resort for the 45 million Americans who reside within that \ncircuit. To preserve the integrity of the judicial system for so many \npeople, I believe we need to take a more careful look at who we are \nsending to a circuit that increasingly--increasingly--chooses to \ndisregard precedent and ultimately just plain gets it wrong so much of \nthe time.\n  Consistent with our constitutional duties, the Senate has to take \nresponsibility for correcting this disturbing reversal rate of the \nNinth Circuit. I think we have an affirmative obligation to do that. \nAnd that is why I will only support those nominees to the Ninth Circuit \nwho possess the qualifications and who have clearly demonstrated the \ninclination to move the circuit back towards the mainstream.\n  Mr. President, I will want to apply a higher standard of scrutiny to \nfuture Ninth Circuit nominees to help ensure that the 45 million people \nin that circuit receive justice, and justice that is consistent with \nthe rest of the Nation, justice that is predictable and not arbitrary \nnor dependent on the few times the Supreme Court reviews and ultimately \nreverses an erroneous Ninth Circuit decision.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I reserve our time on this side. I know on \nthe other side the Senator from Missouri, I assume, will speak on their \ntime. I will withhold my statement. I am kind of stuck here anyway. I \nyield to the Senator from Missouri, on their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, with the permission of the Senator from \nAlabama, I yield myself as much time as I might consume in opposition \nto the nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is in \nserious need of improvement. The court is the epicenter of judicial \nactivism in this country. The Ninth Circuit's unique blend of \ndistortion of text, novel innovation, and disregard for precedent \ncaused it to be reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court 27 out of 28 cases \nin the term before last. That is something very, very serious. When \nthis court's cases were considered by the U.S. Supreme Court in the \nterm before last, 27 out of 28 decisions were considered to be wrong.\n  If the people of this country found out that 27 out of 28 decisions \nof the Senate were considered to be wrong, Senators would not last very \nlong. No tolerance would be provided for virtually any institution that \nwas wrong that much of the time. The Ninth Circuit Court's record \nimproved last year, but barely. According to the National Law Journal, \nthe court was reversed in whole or in part in 14 out of 17 cases last \nyear. Over the last 2 years, that amounts to a reversal rate of 90 \npercent. In the last 2 terms, 9 out of 10 times the Ninth Circuit has \nbeen wrong.\n  The Ninth Circuit's disastrous record before the Supreme Court has \nnot been lost on the Justices of the Supreme Court. In a letter sent \nlast month supporting a breakup of the Ninth Circuit, Justice Scalia \ncited the circuit's ``notoriously poor record on appeal.'' Justice \nScalia explained, ``A disproportionate number of cases from the Ninth \nCircuit are regularly taken by this court for review, and a \ndisproportionate number reversed.''\n  The Ninth Circuit's abysmal record cannot be dismissed or minimized \nbecause the Supreme Court is there to correct the Ninth Circuit's \nmistakes. In a typical year, the Ninth Circuit disposes of over 8,500 \ncases. In about 10 percent of those cases, over 850 cases, the losing \nparty seeks to have a review in the Supreme Court. Although appeals \nfrom the Ninth Circuit occupy a disproportionate share of the docket, \nthe Supreme Court grants only between 20 and 30 petitions from the \nNinth Circuit in a given year. If they are reversed 90 percent of the \ntime because they are wrong in those cases that have been accepted, I \ndo not know what the error rate would be in the other 8,500 cases that \nthey litigate or consider on appeal, or what would be the error rate in \nthe 850 cases that are sent, begging the Supreme Court to review the \ncases. But it is very likely, in my judgment, if their error rate is 90 \npercent in those cases that are accepted by the Supreme Court, that \nthere are a lot of other individuals simply denied justice because of \nthe extremely poor quality of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  This really places upon those of us in the U.S. Senate a very serious \nresponsibility, a responsibility of seeking to improve the quality of \njustice that people who live in the Ninth Circuit receive. Accordingly, \nof the 8,500 cases decided by the Ninth Circuit in a year, only 20 or \n30, or about three-tenths of 1 percent, are reviewed by the Supreme\n\n[[Page S11879]]\n\nCourt. So, if there are errors in the other cases, they are just going \nto remain there.\n  Only three-tenths of 1 percent of the cases decided by the court are \nreviewed by the Supreme Court. So if we say it is OK for that circuit \nto be full of error, it is OK for that circuit to be absent the quality \nand the kind of correctness that is appropriate in the law, if we \npredicate our approval on the basis that there can be an appeal, the \ntruth of the matter is, the Supreme Court takes only about three-tenths \nof 1 percent of the cases for appeal.\n  The Supreme Court, moreover, selects cases for review predominantly \nto resolve splits among the circuits, not to correct the most egregious \nerrors. So some of the cases the Supreme Court does not even take may \nbe more blatant injustices than the ones that the Supreme Court does \ntake, because the Supreme Court is trying to resolve differences \nbetween the Ninth Circuit and the Second Circuit, or the Eighth Circuit \nand the Ninth Circuit, or something like that. So we have a real \nshortfall of justice that exists as a potential whenever we have a \ncourt that is so error ridden, and its error-ridden nature is \ndemonstrated because of the correction responsibility that has to be \nexercised by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The truth of the matter is, for virtually all litigants within the \nNinth Circuit, the decisions of the Ninth Circuit are the final word. \nHow would you like knowing that you were going to court and that the \nappellate court which would oversee your day in court was reversed 90 \npercent of the time when it was considered by the Supreme Court, but \nyou only had a three-tenths of 1 percent chance of getting an injustice \nin your case reversed because the Supreme Court only takes three-tenths \nof 1 percent of the cases? I think America deserves to have more \nconfidence in its judicial system than that.\n  The Ninth Circuit is an activist court in desperate need of therapy \nand help. After a thorough review of its record, it is my judgment that \nProfessor Fletcher would do more harm than good in the Ninth Circuit, \nwould move that court further outside the judicial mainstream.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion about the applicability of \nFederal antinepotism statutes to this nominee. I commend individuals \nfor raising this issue. It is critical to the respect for law.\n  I have heard some people say they do not really care whether this is \nagainst the law or not. Frankly, I think we ought to care. I think a \ndisregard for the law, especially as it relates to the appointment of \njudges, is a very, very serious matter. It is critical to the respect \nfor law in a society as a whole that we in the Senate respect the laws \nthat apply to us.\n  However, one of the principles of judicial restraint identified by \nJustice Brandeis many years ago is that a court should not decide a \ndifficult constitutional or statutory question if there is another \nstraightforward basis for resolving the case. Applying that principle \nto this nomination, I have concluded that whether or not the statute \nprecludes confirmation of Professor Fletcher, there is ample basis in \nthe record to suggest that Professor Fletcher would exacerbate the \nNinth Circuit's activism and I plan to oppose his nomination on that \nbasis.\n  A number of Professor Fletcher's writings suggest a troubling \ntendency toward judicial activism. For example, Professor Fletcher has \nwritten in praise of Justice Brennan's mode of constitutional \ninterpretation. He also has criticized the Supreme Court for reading \nthe Constitution in a literalistic way. This is troubling, to say the \nleast. Justice Brennan, as even his admirers would admit, is the \ngodfather of the evolving Constitution and the primary critic of the \nliteral reading of the constitutional text.\n  You know, there are those who believe the Constitution can be \nstretched, and grows, and amends itself to mean what someone wants it \nto mean at the time a crisis arises. I reject that. I reject Brennan's \napproach. Professor Fletcher embraces it. Those who believe that the \nConstitution can be an evolutionary document really are those who would \nbe able to put their stamp of meaning anywhere they want anytime they \nchoose.\n  The debate over whether evolving standards of decency or the text \nshould guide judicial decisions is at the heart--the very heart--of my \nconcern over judicial activism. Nowhere in the country is the \nConstitution ``evolving'' more rapidly than in the Ninth Circuit. We \ncannot afford to send another activist to this court.\n  Although a number of Professor Fletcher's writings focus on \nrelatively esoteric subjects, they display a disturbing tendency toward \nactivism on the issues addressed.\n  He has criticized the current limitations on standing and has \nadvocated an approach that would focus more on the legislative intent--\nan inherently dubious guide--and would afford standing to plaintiffs \nexcluded by the current doctrine.\n  Likewise, he has written that the procedural history of an \namendment's enactment can lessen the presumption of constitutionality \nthat would otherwise attach to the enactment. Frankly, we ought to be \nevaluating the constitutionality on the basis of the Constitution, not \nthe procedural history. This is particularly disturbing in light of the \nNinth Circuit's apparent tendency to apply a presumption of \nunconstitutionality to popular initiatives and other legislation the \njudges dislike on policy grounds.\n  In an opinion piece written in the midst of Justice Thomas' \nconfirmation process, Professor Fletcher wrote that ``the Senate must \ninsist nominees articulate their constitutional views as a condition of \ntheir confirmation.''\n  Professor Fletcher's articles and answers to written questions \n``articulate'' his view of the Constitution. Let's look at them. It is \na view with which I disagree and which, in my judgment, will only \nexacerbate the problems of the Ninth Circuit.\n  Finally, I want to acknowledge that I realize we do not appear to \nhave the votes to defeat this nomination. Nonetheless, I believe it is \nimportant to come to the floor and debate this nomination, rather than \napprove it in a midnight session.\n  Those of us on the Judiciary Committee have had the opportunity to \nreflect on the problems of the Ninth Circuit--the shortfall and the \ninjustice for people who live in the Ninth Circuit, the likelihood that \nthey get bad decisions and only three-tenths of 1 percent of them will \never be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court. This nominee would only \nmake that problem worse. I urge my colleagues to oppose the nomination \non that basis.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of the time for those \nopposing the nomination.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor up to 5 minutes on the serious question of steel imports and \nintroduce a piece of legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, does the Senator ask for that time outside \nthe time of the Fletcher matter?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ashcroft). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 2580 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will now resume debate of the \nnomination of Judge Fletcher.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask the Chair, how much time is available \nto this side, the proponents of the Fletcher nomination?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Twenty-three minutes 16 \nseconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I yield myself such time as I may need.\n  We heard discussion about the Ninth Circuit. There was a suggestion \nthat it is reversed all the time.\n  In the year ending March 31, 1997, they decided 8,701 matters; the \nyear ending March 31, 1996, 7,813 matters; in 1995, 7,955 matters. \nWell, 99.7 percent of those matters were not overturned.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article by Judge Jerome Farris of the \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S11880]]\n\n   The Ninth Circuit--Most Maligned Circuit in the Country--Fact or \n                                Fiction?\n\n                        (By Hon. Jerome Farris*)\n\n     *Footnotes at end of article.\n       The Honorable Jerome Farris argues that the reason the \n     Supreme Court overturns such a high percentage of Ninth \n     Circuit cases accepted for review is not because the Circuit \n     is ``too liberal.'' Rather, Judge Farris emphasizes the high \n     volume of cases heard by the Ninth Circuit and its \n     willingness to take on controversial issues. He suggests that \n     any objective observer would conclude that the Ninth Circuit \n     is functioning well and that the system is working precisely \n     as the Framers of the United States Constitution intended.\n\n       The shell game has survived over the centuries because \n     there are always those who are not merely willing, but \n     delighted, to be deceived. If the game is played often enough \n     and mindlessly enough, one can come very close to fooling \n     ``all of the people all of the time.''\n       The Ninth Circuit--most maligned circuit in the country--\n     fact or fiction? It is absolutely true that the United States \n     Supreme Court accepted twenty-nine cases from the Ninth \n     Circuit for review in 1997 and reversed twenty-eight of those \n     decisions, affirming only one. The prior year, the Supreme \n     Court reviewed twelve Ninth Circuit cases and reversed ten. \n     In 1995, the Supreme Court reviewed fourteen Ninth Circuit \n     decisions and reversed ten. During that period, no other \n     circuit had so many decisions reversed or so high a \n     percentage of reversals of cases accepted for review.\\1\\\n       According to these statistics, the Supreme Court reversed \n     ninety-six percent of the Ninth Circuit cases it reviewed in \n     1997, an all time high.\\2\\\n       In the year ending March 31, 1997, the Ninth Circuit \n     decided 8701 matters. In the same period ending in 1996, the \n     Ninth Circuit decided 7813 matters. In 1995, the Ninth \n     Circuit decided 7955 matters. If one considers the number of \n     Ninth Circuit decisions reversed by the Supreme Court against \n     the total number of cases decided by the Ninth Circuit, an \n     entirely different picture emerges. Under this analysis, the \n     Supreme Court let stand as final 99.7 percent of the Ninth \n     Circuit's 1996 cases. No circuit in history has decided so \n     many cases, and no circuit in history has had so low a \n     percentage of cases reversed.\n       The point is not that one statistic is right and that the \n     other statistic is wrong, but that statistics can be \n     deceiving and can be used to paint almost any picture one \n     wants. Courts issue ``opinions''; they do not decide right \n     and wrong in an absolute sense. Courts cannot determine right \n     and wrong in an absolute sense because the law is not \n     absolute. Deciding a legal rule is not like figuring out an \n     immutable law of physics--a court always strives for ``the \n     right answer,'' but because the law has a life of its own, \n     time determines what is correct. Courts on occasion reverse \n     themselves for just that reason.\n       Any Ninth Circuit judge worthy of the title would want to \n     revisit the decisions that were taken for review to determine \n     whether in any single instance Supreme Court precedent was \n     ignored. One cannot expect newspaper reporters to make that \n     kind of review. News articles report the facts and others \n     analyze the facts. It is my view that no responsible \n     ``expert'' would comment before making such a review. What \n     the review would reveal is no mystery because all decisions \n     are in the domain of the public.\n       In 1997, the Supreme Court unanimously reversed twenty-one \n     cases (eight of those decisions were per curiam). In the one \n     Ninth Circuit case that the Supreme Court affirmed (the vote \n     was eight to one), the majority held that the opinion \n     properly followed Supreme Court precedent.\\3\\ In one case \n     that the Supreme Court unanimously reversed, the Ninth \n     Circuit followed a Tenth Circuit decision. The Eighth \n     Circuit, however, decided the issue a different way and the \n     Supreme Court resolved the split.\\4\\\n       In Saratoga Fishing Co. v. J.M. Martinac & Co., \\5\\ a six \n     to three reversal, Justice Scalia, joined by Justice Thomas, \n     noted in dissent that ``an impressive line of lower court \n     decisions applying both federal and state law'' \\6\\ has, like \n     the Ninth Circuit, precluded liability in analogous \n     situations. \\7\\\n       In eight of the reversed Ninth Circuit cases, the Supreme \n     Court resolved conflicts between the circuits: Old Chief v. \n     United States; \\8\\ California Division of Labor Standards \n     Enforcement v. Dillingham Construction; \\9\\ United States v. \n     Brockamp; \\10\\ Regents of the University of California v. \n     Doe; \\11\\ Inter-Modal Rail Employees Ass'n v. Atchison, \n     Topeka, & Santa Fe Railway; \\12\\ United States v. Hyde; \\13\\ \n     Glickman v. Wileman Bros. & Elliott; \\14\\ Quality King \n     Distributors, Inc. v. L'anza Research International, Inc. \n     \\15\\ Thus, in many of the cases that were reversed, the Ninth \n     Circuit was not alone in concluding a different result than \n     the result the Supreme Court reached. Make no mistake, \n     however, the Supreme Court did critcize the Ninth Circuit in \n     some of its reversals. In one reversal, the Supreme Court \n     stated that the Ninth Circuit failed to follow Supreme Court \n     precedent. \\16\\\n       Courts are bound to follow Supreme Court precedent. \n     However, what we write are opinions. The sin is not being \n     wrong, but being wrong when the guidance was clear and when \n     there was a deliberate failure to follow the guidance.\n       Two cases illustrate the dilemma of circuit courts: \n     Washington v. Glucksberg, \\17\\ regarding physician-assisted \n     suicide, and Printz v. United States, \\18\\ regarding the \n     Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. \\19\\ The Supreme Court \n     reversed both of these Ninth Circuit decisions.\n       The Brady Act was widely discussed publicly and received \n     much political interest. At issue in Printz v. United States \n     was whether the Brady Handgun Act violated Article I, Sec. 8 \n     and the Tenth Amendment of the United States Constitution by \n     commanding chief law enforcement officers to conduct \n     background checks of handgun purchasers. In a two to one \n     decision, the Ninth Circuit found no constitutional \n     violation. The Supreme Court, by a vote of five to four, \n     reversed. Justice Scalia delivered the opinion of the Court \n     in which Rehnquist, O'Connor, Kennedy, and Thomas joined; \n     O'Connor filed a concurring opinion; Thomas filed a \n     concurring opinion; Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, in \n     which Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer joined; Souter filed a \n     separate dissenting opinion; and Breyer filed a dissenting \n     opinion, in which Stevens joined. One might reasonably \n     conclude that the solution was less than obvious.\n       Physician-assisted suicide has also been soundly debated in \n     both public and political arenas. The question for decision \n     in Glucksberg was whether a Washington statue that imposes a \n     criminal penalty on anyone who ``aids another person to \n     attempt suicide'' denies the Fourteenth Amendment's Due \n     Process Clause liberty interest of mentally competent, \n     terminally ill adults to choose their time and manner of \n     death. The Ninth Circuit, in an eight to three en banc panel \n     decision, found a liberty interest in the right to die and \n     then weighed the individual's compelling liberty interest \n     against the state's interest. The Ninth Circuit found the \n     statute unconstitutional. The Supreme Court unanimously \n     reversed the Ninth Circuit decision with five separate \n     concurring opinions.\n       Was the Ninth Circuit ``wrong'' in either of these cases? \n     The Circuit would have been, in my opinion, if it had not \n     resolved each of the complex issues and given them full, \n     careful, and decisive consideration. The Supreme Court \n     reversed these decisions, but who would say that the system \n     is not functioning as it was intended to function? Everyone \n     is entitled to their own views, but the conclusion, in my \n     view, is that the system envisioned by the Framers of the \n     Constitution continues to function properly.\n       The decisions of the Supreme Court become the law of the \n     land because our system of government requires settled law. \n     It is therefore necessary that one court make a final \n     decision, and, right or wrong, that decision governs our \n     society.\n       That the Supreme Court can be ``wrong'' is evident to any \n     student of American law, history, politics, or society. This \n     county's jurisprudential history is filled with famous cases, \n     affecting our entire society, in which the Supreme Court \n     decided that it had previously reached an erroneous result: \n     Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka; \\20\\ Bunting v. \n     Oregon; \\21\\ Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit \n     Authority; \\22\\ and twice reversing itself on death penalty \n     cases in the 1970s, to name a few.\n       The Supreme Court also reverses itself in many less well-\n     known cases. This term it reversed a decision regarding \n     public school teachers in parochial schools. \\23\\ The term \n     before that it reversed itself in Seminole Tribe of Florida \n     v. Florida, \\24\\ and the year before that in Hubbard v. \n     United States. \\25\\ Justice Brandeis's dissent in the 1932 \n     case, Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., \\26\\ argued that the \n     Supreme Court should overrule an earlier decision \\27\\ and \n     cites thirty-five cases in which the Supreme Court overruled \n     or qualified its earlier decisions.\n       This list of Supreme Court reversals--in no way meant to be \n     comprehensive--actually constitutes a high reversal rate \n     considering that the Supreme Court currently averages about \n     eighty to ninety decisions a year, or one percent of the \n     number of cases that the Ninth Circuit hears. This comparison \n     suggests that the Supreme Court would have to reverse one \n     hundred Ninth Circuit cases a year in order to reverse the \n     Ninth Circuit at as high a rate as the Supreme Court reverses \n     itself (which it does about once a year).\n       In other instances, Congress has decided that the Supreme \n     Court had the wrong answer and enacted legislation to \n     effectively overrule the decision, such as the Religious \n     Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA) \\28\\ and the 1982 \n     Voting Rights Act Amendments.\\29\\ The Supreme Court upheld \n     the constitutionality of the 1982 Voting Rights Act \n     Amendments \\30\\ and it found RFRA unconstitutional.\\31\\\n       Do these results prove that Congress was right and that the \n     Supreme Court was wrong? Or do these results prove that the \n     Supreme Court was right and that Congress was wrong? Of \n     course not. Rather, the results provide examples of the \n     checks and balances designed in the Constitution to make our \n     government run properly. Similarly, when the Supreme Court \n     reverses an appellate court decision, it does not mean that \n     the decision was wrong in an absolute sense, and more \n     importantly, it does not mean that the appellate court was \n     not functioning properly in its role in the judiciary and in \n     the United States government.\n       Part of the cause of the misperception about right and \n     wrong is created in the training of lawyers at law school. \n     Most law schools begin teaching law in a formalistic manner: \n     the student learns the law, and there is only one correct \n     law. This formalism gets carried on as law students enter the \n     legal profession. Lawyers often argue before\n\n[[Page S11881]]\n\n     me that there is only one possible result (``The law dictates \n     this result!''). This is rarely true, and is never true in \n     complicated cases. There are always some arguments for each \n     side, otherwise the case would be frivolous. The bottom line \n     is that reasonable minds can differ and can each still be \n     reasonable.\n       The Ninth Circuit deals with more cases than any other \n     circuit. It is not surprising, then, that the Ninth Circuit \n     would deal with more complicated and important issues than \n     any other circuit. Both of these factors contribute to the \n     Supreme Court's review and reversal of more Ninth Circuit \n     cases than cases from other circuits.\n       Some observers contend that the Ninth Circuit is reversed \n     so often because it is the most liberal circuit in the \n     country and because the Supreme Court is currently \n     conservative. This hypothesis also provides ammunition to \n     those now arguing that the Ninth Circuit should be split (a \n     topic for another article).\\32\\ However, these observers have \n     failed to review the facts. Of the opinions signed by Ninth \n     Circuit judges that were reversed this year by the Supreme \n     Court, eleven were authored by Democratic presidential \n     appointees, and nine were authored by Republican presidential \n     appointees. Apparently the Supreme Court is an equal \n     opportunity reverser.\n       To function properly, each court must do its duty to the \n     best of its ability. Parties must be able to rely on the full \n     resolution of cutting edge issues in each court to which the \n     issues are submitted. There is always the risk of reversal, \n     but that risk should not--cannot--drive the system. The \n     Supreme Court was better able to treat the question of \n     physician-assisted suicide and the issue of the Brady Act \n     because it had decisive opinions to review. One could assume \n     that these issues are closed, and they certainly may be for \n     the immediate future. History reminds us, though, that \n     serious controversial issues are revisited from time to time. \n     This comment is written by a circuit judge whose life would \n     certainly have been different had the Dred Scott \\33\\ \n     decision not been revisited.\n       I make no prediction for the future of any of the Ninth \n     Circuit reversals, but one commentator was not so cautious. \n     Writing while Glucksberg \\34\\ was pending before the Supreme \n     Court, Roger S. Magnusson \\35\\ in the Pacific Rim Law and \n     Policy Journal, predicted:\n       Although an adverse Supreme Court opinion could potentially \n     retard the process of pro-euthanasia law reform, this would \n     be a temporary delay only which could not survive \n     generational change. In the United States and beyond, the \n     development of a legal right to die with medical assistance, \n     appears inevitable.\\36\\\n       What is important to remember is that opinions, unlike \n     arithmetic solutions, may vary. Our system under the \n     Constitution is designed to put an end to variations because \n     the Supreme Court makes the final decision. The danger is not \n     that an appellate court gets reversed, but that a court might \n     let possible reversal deter decisive, full, and reasoned \n     consideration of important issues. An even greater danger is \n     that the high regard in which all courts must be held if our \n     system is to be a rule of law, not of judges, is threatened \n     if those who are personally ambitious can dismiss a reasoned \n     decision of any court with the throwaway phrase--``Oh well, \n     that decision is just the irresponsible act of a coterie of \n     liberal judges.'' All tyrants first seek to malign the rule \n     of law.\n\n\n                               footnotes\n\n     *Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n     \\1\\ The Supreme Court decided a total of ninety-one cases in \n     the 1996 term, reversing sixty-five, affirming twenty-three, \n     and otherwise disposing of three.

See Dillingham Constr. v. \n     County of Sonoma, 57 F.3d 712, 722 (9th Cir. 1995). In \n     reversing, the Supreme Court found that the law at issue \n     neither referred to nor was connected with ERISA. See \n     Dillingham Constr., 117 S. Ct. at 834. Thus, the Court held \n     that the law did not ``relate to'' an ERISA plan for purposes \n     of preemption. See id.\n     \\5\\ 117 S. Ct. 1783 (1997).\n     \\6\\ Saratoga Fishing, 117 S.

Marco Seattle, Inc., 69 F.3d 1432, 1446 (9th Cir. \n     1995). The Ninth Circuit found that equipment added to a \n     vessel after purchase was part of the ``product itself.'' See \n     id.

See No. 94-30277, 1995 WL 325745 \n     (9th Cir. Apr. 14, 1995) (basing the decision on 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 922(g)(1)). The Supreme Court disagreed, finding that \n     the rejection of a defendant's offer to stipulate to a felony \n     conviction constituted an abuse of discretion where the name \n     or nature of the underlying conviction raised the risk of \n     tainting the jury's verdict.

The Supreme Court \n     reversed, holding that a state entity's potential legal \n     liability, rather than financial responsibility for \n     judgments, triggered the application of the Eleventh \n     Amendment.

Mr. President, it has been suggested that if a court is \noverturned by the Supreme Court, that people ought to start asking \nwhether those judges should be thrown out. And one Senator said, \n``Suppose we were overturned like that, how long would we last here in \nthe Senate?'' Well, it seems to me that the U.S. Senate voted very \nstrongly--84 Senators voted for the so-called Communications Decency \nAct even though it was obviously unconstitutional. That went to the \nSupreme Court and was overturned.\n  A majority of the U.S. Senators voted for the line-item veto--again, \nblatantly unconstitutional but popular back home. That was overturned \nby the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Eighty-five percent of the people, according to a poll, said they \nwanted some form of the Brady bill. This Senate voted for that \noverwhelmingly, knowing that it was probably unconstitutional. That was \noverturned by the Supreme Court.\n  I can think, since I have been here, of a number of times when this \nbody went pell-mell forward on a number of bills because it was so \npopular to vote for them. Many times I found myself as a lone dissenter \non matters that went to the U.S. Supreme Court and were then overturned \nas unconstitutional.\n  The same Senators who criticize judges who from time to time have an \nopinion reversed by a higher court ought to be careful with respect to \nwhat they advocate. If that standard were applied to Senators should \nall Senators who voted for a bill that gets\n\n[[Page S11882]]\n\noverturned as unconstitutional have to resign? Maybe not the first time \nthey vote for something declared unconstitutional; maybe they shouldn't \nhave to leave the first time, because everybody is allowed a mistake. \nIf they did it a second time, do they have to go then? I come from a \ntolerant State. I belong to a religion that believes in redemption and \nforgiveness. So we will let them get away with two.\n  We are in the baseball season. Suppose they voted for three \nunconstitutional bills because they were popular but they get \noverturned as unconstitutional. Well, we are now considering \nperspectives beyond religion and politics, we are going to baseball. \nThree times, three strikes--are you out? Let's be a little careful when \nwe use some of these analogies about who should or should not serve on \na court depending on how many times they get reversed.\n  Senators may not want to go back and ask how many times they voted \nfor something, how many times they gave wonderful speeches in favor of \nsomething, how many times they sent out press releases, sent feeds back \nto their TV station, maybe used them in their reelection ads, and then, \nguess what? The U.S. Supreme Court overturned that legislation as \nunconstitutional.\n  Especially, I say to some of my friends on the other side, when the \nmajority of those voting to declare those laws unconstitutional were \nRepublican members of the U.S. Supreme Court, reported by Republican \nPresidents, and extolled as great conservatives. In each one of the \ncases I have referenced, I agreed with them. They were the true \nconservatives. What they wanted to conserve was the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  Sometimes when we want to stand up here and tell how conservative we \nare, we ought to say: Are we conservative with regard to the \nConstitution of the United States? Are we prepared to conserve the U.S. \nConstitution?\n  I recall one day on a court-stripping bill on this floor years ago an \neffort was made to pass a court-stripping bill, a bill to withdraw \njurisdiction from the courts over certain matters of constitutional \nremedies, because the polls showed how popular it would be. One Friday \nafternoon, three Senators stood on this floor and talked that bill into \nthe ground.\n  I was proud to be one of those three Senators. As I walked out with \nthe other two--one, the Senator from Connecticut, then an independent, \nSenator Lowell Weicker; the third Senator who had joined with us to \ntalk down that court-stripping bill, my good friend, now deceased, \nSenator Barry Goldwater of Arizona. Senator Goldwater put his arms \naround the shoulders of both of us, and we were both a little bit \ntaller than he, and said, ``I think we are the only three conservatives \nin the place.''\n  I can't speak for Senator Weicker, how he might have felt about that; \nI took it as a heck of a compliment--not because I go back and claim to \nbe a conservative in my politics back home. I only claim to be a \nVermonter, doing the best I can for my State. When I stand up for the \nU.S. Constitution, as I have so many times for the first amendment, I \ndo it because I try to conserve what is best in our country.\n  Professor William Fletcher is a fine nominee. He is a decent man. He \nwas first nominated to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, \nMay 7, 1995, over 3 years ago. I don't know of any judicial nominee who \nhas had to endure the delay and show the patience of this nominee. He \nwas nominated May 7, 1995. We are only a few months away from 1999.\n  I have spoken on many occasions about how the Republican Senate is \nrewriting the record books in terms of delaying action on judicial \nnominees, but Professor Fletcher's 41 months exceeds the 33-month delay \nin the consideration of the nomination of Judge Richard Paez and \nAnabelle Rodriguez; or the 26 months it took to confirm Ann Aiken; or \nthe 24 months it took to confirm Margaret McKeown; or the 21-month \ndelay before confirmation of Margaret Morrow and Hilda Tagle who found, \nunfortunately, in this Senate, that if you are either a woman or a \nminority, you seem to take a lot longer to get through the Senate \nconfirmation process.\n  In the annual report on the judiciary, the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court observed:\n\n       Some current nominees have been waiting a considerable time \n     for a Senate Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. \n     The Senate confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, \n     well under the 101 judges it confirmed in 1994.\n\n  He went on to note:\n\n       The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry \n     it should vote him up or vote him down.\n\n  Mr. President, 3\\1/2\\ years is a long time to examine a nomination \nand to leave a judgeship vacant. Even at the pace of the U.S. Senate, \n3\\1/2\\ years is long enough for us to make up our mind.\n  Around Mother's Day in 1996, the Judiciary Committee did report the \nnomination of Professor Fletcher to the Senate, but that year the \nmajority, Republican majority, decided not to vote on any nominees to \ncourts of appeals, so the nomination was not considered by the Senate. \nThe committee vote, though, in 1996 was more than 2-1 in favor, \nincluding Senator Hatch, Senator Specter, Senator DeWine, and Senator \nSimpson. This year, the vote was delayed until past Mother's Day. The \nvote was taken May 21, 1998. The committee's second consideration of \nthe nominee resulted in a vote of 2-1.\n  I know some do not like Judge Betty Binn Fletcher. They do not agree \nwith her decisions. In our Federal judicial system, there are \nmechanisms for holding judges accountable. There are panels of judges \nat the courts of appeals. There are en banc considerations. There is \nultimately the controlling authority of the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge \nFletcher's decisions are subject to review and reversal, just like \nevery other judge.\n  No one should turn their anger with Judge Betty Fletcher into a \nreason to delay or oppose the appointment of Professor William A. \nFletcher. No one should try to get back at Judge Betty B. Fletcher \nthrough delay of the confirmation of her son.\n  Senate Republicans have continued their attacks against an \nindependent Federal judiciary and delayed in filling longstanding \nvacancies with qualified persons being nominated by the President. \nProfessor Fletcher's nomination has been a casualty of their efforts. \nForty-one months--41 months--and two confirmation hearings have been \nenough time for examination to bring the Fletcher nomination to a vote. \nProfessor Fletcher is a fine person and an outstanding nominee who has \nhad to endure years of delay and demagoguery as some chose to play \npolitics with our independent judiciary.\n  Professor Fletcher has the support of both Senators from California. \nThe ABA gave him the highest rating. He is supported by many judges and \nlawyers and scholars from around the State, the Ninth Circuit, and the \ncountry. I commend the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, the senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch, and many other \nRepublican Senators who have continued to support this fair-minded \nnominee.\n  I look forward to Senate action this afternoon and I look forward to \nthe fact that he will be confirmed.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nnomination of William Fletcher for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  When this nomination was first considered in the Judiciary Committee \nin 1996, I opposed it because I believed that the anti-nepotism \nstatute, 28 U.S.C. 458, prohibited him from serving on the Ninth \nCircuit based on the fact that his mother, Betty Fletcher, is a judge \non the same court. There has been some dispute about whether this \nstatute applies to judges rather than only inferior court employees, \nand the Senate yesterday passed legislation by Senator Kyl to clarify \nthat the statute does apply to judges. However, the revision is \nprospective in nature and does not apply to Professor Fletcher. In my \nview, Professor Fletcher's nomination violates the statute as it \nexisted before the Senate's clarification. Thus, I must oppose this \nnomination because I believe it violates the anti-nepotism laws.\n\n[[Page S11883]]\n\n  Moreover, I have serious reservations about Professor Fletcher's \njudicial philosophy. I believe we have a duty to oppose nominees who do \nnot have a proper respect for the limited role of a judge in our system \nof government.\n  One of the strongest and most influential advocates for an activist \nFederal judiciary in this century was Supreme Court Justice William \nBrennan. He believed that the Constitution was a living document and \nthat judges should interpret the Constitution as though its words \nchange and adapt over time. I have always believed that this view of \nthe Constitution is not only wrong but dangerous to our system of \ngovernment. The words of the Constitution do not change. They have an \nestablished meaning that should not change based on the views of a \njudge. They should change only through an amendment to the \nConstitution. It is through the amendment process that the people can \ndetermine for themselves what the Constitution says, rather than \nunaccountable, unelected judges making the decisions for them.\n  Professor Fletcher has written in strong support of Justice Brennan \nand his activist judicial philosophy. In a 1991 law review article, he \npraised Justice Brennan for his, quote, ``sense that the Constitution \nhas meaning beyond the bare words of the text.'' He stated that some \nparts of the Constitution are, quote, ``almost constitutional truths in \nsearch of a text.'' He even approvingly quoted Justice Brennan's famous \nstatement regarding Constitutional interpretation that, quote, ``the \nultimate question must be what do the words of the text mean in our \ntime.''\n  I firmly believe that the role of the judge is to interpret the law \nas the legislature intended, not to interpret the law consistent with \nthe judge's public policy objectives. A judge does not make the law and \nis not a public policy maker. Professor Fletcher has been critical of \nthe modern Supreme Court for its lack of political and governmental \nexperience. In a 1987 law review article, he criticized recent landmark \nSupreme Court decisions on the separation of powers, saying the Court, \nquote, ``read the Constitution in a literalistic way to upset what the \nother two branches had decided, under the political circumstances, was \nthe most workable arrangement.'' What is convenient in a political \nsense is irrelevant to a proper interpretation of the Constitution.\n  Moreover, Professor Fletcher has been nominated to the Ninth Circuit, \nand the Supreme Court routinely finds it necessary to reverse the Ninth \nCircuit. Indeed, in recent years, the Ninth Circuit has been reversed \nfar more often than any other circuit. This trend will be corrected \nonly if we confirm sound, mainstream judges to this critical circuit. I \ndo not see that problem abating with nominees such as the one here, who \neven characterizes himself as being in his words, quote, ``fairly close \nto the mainstream.''\n  If Professor Fletcher is confirmed, I sincerely hope that he turns \nout to be a sound, mainstream judge and not a judicial activist from \nthe left. I hope he helps to improve the dismal reversal rate of the \nNinth Circuit.\n  However, we must evaluate judges based on the record we have before \nus. As I read Professor Fletcher's record, it does not convince me that \nhe is an appropriate addition to the Court of Appeals. Therefore, \nbecause of my interpretation of the anti-nepotism statute and my \nconcerns about judicial activism, I cannot support this nominee.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of William A. Fletcher to the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Ninth Circuit. Mr. Fletcher has proven himself superbly \nqualified for this position. A man of deep personal integrity, of sound \njudgement and a well respected legal scholar, Mr. Fletcher's nomination \nis certainly deserved and given that five judgeships remain vacant on \nthe Ninth Circuit, his confirmation is well past due.\n  Mr. Fletcher's qualifications for this position are truly remarkable, \nMr. President. He is a graduate of Harvard University and a Rhodes \nScholar. William Fletcher earned his law degree from Yale, clerked at \nthe United States Supreme Court, and has dedicated himself to a career \nof exploring legal theories as a professor and as an esteemed author.\n  Fletcher has been a professor at Boalt Hall since 1977 where he was \nawarded the Distinguished Teaching Award in 1993, an honor bestowed \nannually upon the five finest faculty members on the Berkley campus. \nFletcher has also served as a visiting professor at the University of \nMichigan, Stanford Law School, Hastings College of Law, and the \nUniversity of Cologne, and he has served as an instructor at the \nSalzburg Seminars.\n  Professor Fletcher's scholarly works include influential law review \narticles that have been immensely useful to both academics and \npractitioners. His works include published articles relating to the \ntopics of civil procedure and federal courts, such as standing and the \nEleventh Amendment, sovereign immunity and federal common law. In \nexploring the law and authoring these esteemed articles, Fletcher \ndemonstrates his uncanny powers of analysis and steadfast objectivity.\n  In addition to my support Mr. President, William Fletcher's \nnomination enjoys broad support across political and ideological \nspectrums. He has been endorsed not only by an extensive array of his \npeers throughout the country, but also by a number of non-partisan \nobservers and the American Bar Association, all of whom comment on the \ncentrist, pragmatic approach he brings to the law. I am completely \nconfident that Mr. Fletcher is the best possible candidate to the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.\n  So again Mr. President I would like to express my unequivocal support \nfor William A. Fletcher as a highly qualified nominee to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I will conclude by quoting one of Mr. \nFletcher's colleagues in saying ``If Willy Fletcher presents a problem \n[for the Judiciary Committee], there is no academic in America who \nshould get a court appointment.''\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama has 6 minutes 40 \nseconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, there have been several speakers, \nincluding the Senator from Ohio and the Senator from Missouri, who have \ntalked about the unique circumstances that are at foot here in dealing \nwith the Ninth Circuit, and that we have a responsibility and a duty to \nmake sure that we use our advise and consent authority wisely to \nimprove the courts in America, and the Ninth Circuit is in need of, \nsevere need of reform. It has been reversed in nearly 90 percent of its \ncases in the last 2 years--an unprecedented record that no circuit, to \nmy knowledge, has even been suggested to have approached. The New York \nTimes has referred to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals--which \nincludes California and most of the west coast--and they said that a \nmajority of the Supreme Court considers the Ninth Circuit a rogue \ncircuit.\n  Now, some Senators suggest this is politics. Mr. President, I was \nelected by the people of my State to come here, and one of my duties is \nto evaluate Federal judges. I have affirmed and voted for the \noverwhelming majority of the Clinton nominees. I am willing to vote on \nthis one. I have agreed to this nomination to come up and be voted on. \nBut I want to have my say. I am concerned about this. I don't think \nthat is politics.\n  As a matter of fact, let me quote to you from an article that Mr. \nFletcher, the nominee, wrote a few years ago referring to the \nconfirmation process involving Justice Clarence Thomas. What he said \nabout the role of the Senate was this:\n\n       Does the Senate have the political will--\n\n  That is us, me--\n\n       to come down here and do the unpleasant duty of standing up \n     and--\n\n  And talk about a gentleman who is charming, I am sure, and a nice \nfellow--\n\n       talking about the unpleasant fact that he may not be the \n     right nominee for the court?\n\n  He said:\n\n       Does the Senate have the political will to insist that its \n     constitutional advise and consent role become a working \n     reality?\n\n  Mr. President, I have been here 2 years. One nominee withdrew before \na vote, and we hadn't voted on any nominees. So we are not abusing our \nadvise and consent power. As a matter of fact, I don't think we have \nbeen aggressive enough in utilizing it to ensure that the nominees to \nthe Federal bench are mainstream nominees.\n\n[[Page S11884]]\n\n  That is what we are talking about. He said, ``The Senate must be \nprepared to persuade. . . .'' This is Mr. Fletcher, who wrote this \narticle. He is an academic, a professor, so he can sit around and find \ntime to write these articles. We are not dealing with a proven \npractitioner, a person who served as a State or Federal judge, as we \nnormally have. We are dealing with a nominee who has never practiced \nlaw in his life, has never tried a lawsuit, has never been in court and \nhad to answer to a judge. Yet, he is going to be superintending the \nlargest Federal circuit in the country. This is what he wrote:\n\n       The Senate must be prepared to persuade the public that an \n     insistence on full participation in choosing judges is not a \n     usurpation of power.\n\n  That is all we are doing. We are telling the President of the United \nStates--and it is going to get more serious with additional nominees to \nthis circuit--that we have to have some mainstream nominees. We have to \ndo something about the Ninth Circuit, where 27 out of 28 cases were \nreversed in the term before last, and 13 out of 17 were reversed in the \nlast term. That has been going on for 15 or 20 years. It is not even a \nsecret problem anymore. It is an open, acknowledged problem in American \njurisprudence. The U.S. Supreme Court is trying to maintain uniformity \nof the law.\n  For example, this summer, the Ninth Circuit was the only circuit to \nrule that the Prison Litigation Reform Act--passed here to improve some \nof the horrendous problems we were having with litigation by \nprisoners--was unconstitutional. Every other circuit that addressed the \nissue upheld the constitutionality of this act, including the First, \nFourth, Sixth, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuit have affirmed the \nconstitutionality of the Prison Litigation Reform Act. But not the \nNinth Circuit. It is out there again.\n  As a matter of fact, I have learned that they utilize an \nextraordinary amount of funds of the taxpayers on defense of criminal \ncases. In fact, they have approved one-half of the fees for court-\nappointed counsel in the entire United States. There are 11 circuits in \nAmerica. This one is the biggest, but certainly not more than 20, 25 \npercent of the country--probably less than that. They did half of the \ncourt-appointed attorney's fees because they are turning criminal cases \ninto prolonged processes where there is no finality in the judgment--a \nproblem that America is coming to grips with, the Supreme Court is \ncoming to grips with, and the people of this country are coming to \ngrips with. That is just an example of what it means to have a problem \nthere.\n  Mr. President, I will just say this: This nominee was a law clerk, in \naddition to never having practiced, and he clerked for Justice Brennan, \nwho was widely recognized as the epitome of judicial activism. His \nmother is on this court today, the Ninth Circuit, and she is recognized \nas the most liberal member of the court. Perhaps one other is more \nliberal. It is a problem we have to deal with.\n  I would like to mention this. In talking about the confirmation \nprocess, he made some unkind and unwise comments about Justice Thomas \nin a 1991 article. He questioned, I think fundamentally, the integrity \nof Justice Thomas. What kind of standard do we need to apply here? He \nbelieved a very high standard. This is what he said:\n\n       Judge Clarence Thomas did have a record, although not \n     distinguished enough to merit President Bush's accolades. But \n     Thomas backed away from that record, pretending he meant none \n     of what he had written, and said that he never talked about \n     Roe v. Wade with anyone and, of course, he didn't talk dirty \n     to Anita Hill either.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think that was an unkind comment. I \ndon't believe he is the right person for this circuit, and I object to \nhis nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Mr. Fletcher has waited a long, long time--\nnearly 3\\1/2\\ years--for this moment. He has been voted out of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee by an overwhelming margin twice. He is \nstrongly supported by both Republicans and Democrats in this body. He \nhas waited long enough.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time so we can go to a vote on \nProfessor Fletcher.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the nomination. \nAre the yeas and nays requested?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I think the other side has forgotten to ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  To protect them, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of William A. Fletcher, of California, to be \na United States Circuit Judge for the Ninth Circuit? On this question \nthe yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Ohio (Mr. Glenn) and the \nSenator from South Carolina (Mr. Hollings) are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 41, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 309 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Ford\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Robb\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stevens\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--41\n\n     Abraham\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Glenn\n     Hollings\n       \n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 2281) amend title 17, United States Code, \nto implement the World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright \nTreaty and Performance and Phonograms Treaty, and for other purposes, \nand ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2281), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by all of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 8, 1998.)\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nConference Report on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (H.R. 2281). \nIn my view, we need this measure to stop an epidemic of illegal copying \nof protected works--such as movies, books, musical recordings, and \nsoftware--and to limit, in a balanced and thoughtful way, the \ninfringement liability of online service providers. The copyright \nindustry is one of our most thriving businesses. But we still lose more \nthan $15 billion each year due to foreign copyright piracy, according \nto some estimates.\n  And foreign piracy is just out of control. For example, one of my \nstaffers investigating video piracy on a trip to China walked into a \nHong Kong arcade and bought three bootlegged computer games--including \n``Toy Story'' and ``NBA '97''--for just $10. These games, combined, \nnormally sell for about $100. Indeed, the manager was so brazen about \nit, he even agreed to give out a receipt.\n  Illegal copying has been a longstanding concern to me. I introduced \none of the precursors to this bill, the Motion Picture Anti-Piracy Act \n(in the 101st Congress), which in principle has been incorporated into \nthis measure. And I was one of the cosponsors of the original proposed \nWIPO implementing legislation, the preliminary version of this \nproposal.\n  In my opinion, this bill achieves a fair balance by taking steps to \neffectively deter piracy, while still allowing fair use of protected \nmaterials. It is the product of intensive negotiations between all of \nthe interested parties--including the copyright industry, telephone \ncompanies, libraries, universities and device manufacturers. And \nvirtually every major concern raised during that process was addressed.\n  Unfortunately, however, the Conference dropped what I believe were \ncrucial protections for databases. It is my understanding, though, that \nthe Committee will be ``fast tracking'' consideration of database \nprotection next Congress. I look forward to working with Chairman Hatch \nto move forward on this matter early next year.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I am confident that this bill will reduce \npiracy and strengthen one of our biggest export industries. It deserves \nour support and the President's signature.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport on H.R. 2281, a bill to implement the World Intellectual \nProperty Organization copyright treaties. I am pleased that the final \nproduct of the many months of negotiations has produced a bill of \nappropriate scope and balance, and reflects many of the priorities I \nestablished through the introduction of my own bill to implement the \nWIPO copyright treaties, to begin updating the Copyright Act for the \ndigital era, and to address the potential problem of on-line servicer \nliability.\n  First, with respect to ``fair use,'' the conferees adopted an \nalternative to section 1201(a)(1) that would authorize the Librarian of \nCongress to selectively waive the prohibition against the act of \ncircumvention to prevent a diminution in the availability to individual \nusers (including institutions) of a particular category of copyrighted \nmaterials. As originally proposed by the Administration and adopted by \nthe Senate, this section would have established a flat prohibition on \nthe circumvention of technological protection measures to gain access \nto works for any purpose, and thus raised the specter of moving our \nNation towards a ``pay-per-use'' society. Under the compromise embodied \nin the conference report, the Librarian of Congress would have \nauthority to address the concerns of libraries, educational \ninstitutions, and other information consumers potentially threatened \nwith a denial of access to categories of works in circumstances that \notherwise would be lawful today. I trust that the Librarian of Congress \nwill implement this provision in a way that will ensure information \nconsumers may exercise their centuries-old fair use privilege to \ncontinue to gain access to copyrighted works.\n  Second, the conferees made an important contribution by clarifying \nthe ``no mandate'' provision of the bill. Because the conference report \nis silent, I thought that I should explain this provision in some \ndetail. As my colleagues may recall, I had been very concerned that S. \n2037 could be interpreted as a mandate on product manufacturers to \ndesign products so as to affirmatively\n\n[[Page S11888]]\n\nrespond to or accommodate technological protection measures that \ncopyright owners might use to deny access to or the copying of their \nworks. To address this potential problem, I authored an amendment \nproviding that nothing in the bill required that the design of, or \ndesign and selection of parts and components for, a consumer \nelectronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a \nresponse to any particular technological protection measure. The \namendment reflected my belief that product manufacturers should remain \nfree to design and produce the best, most advanced consumer \nelectronics, telecommunications, and computing products without the \nthreat of incurring liability for their design decisions. Creative \nengineers--not risk-averse lawyers--should be principally responsible \nfor product design. As important, the amendment reflected the working \nassumption of all of my colleagues that this bill is aimed \nfundamentally at so-called ``black boxes'' and not at legitimate \nproducts that have substantial noninfringing uses.\n\n  As my colleagues know, there had been some concern expressed that the \n``so long as'' clause of section 1201(c)(3) made the provision appear \nto be circular in its logic. In other words, there was concern that the \nentire provision could be read to provide in essence that manufacturers \nwere not under any design mandate to respond to technological measures, \nas long as they ``otherwise'' designed their devices to respond to \nexisting technological measures. I never shared that perspective. To \neliminate any uncertainty, the House Commerce Committee simply deleted \nthe ``so long as'' clause. As I explained on the floor in September, \nthat change merely confirmed my original conception of the amendment. \nNow that the conferees have adopted a provision requiring certain \nanalog videocassette recorders to respond to certain existing analog \nprotection measures, the ``so long as'' clause has a meaning that all \nshould agree is logical: Manufacturers of consumer electronics, \ntelecommunications, and computer products are not under a design \nmandate generally, but they are otherwise subject to a single, very \nlimited, and carefully defined mandate to design certain analog \nvideocassette recorders to respond to existing analog protection \nmeasures. Quite importantly from my perspective, this provision is \nlimited so as not to impair the reasonable and accustomed home taping \npractices of consumers recognized in the Supreme Court's Betamax \ndecision.\n  It thus should be about as clear as can be to a judge or jury that, \nunless otherwise specified, nothing in this legislation should be \ninterpreted to limit manufacturers of legitimate products with \nsubstantial noninfringing uses--such as VCRs and personal computers--in \nmaking fundamental design decision or revisions, whether in selecting \ncertain components over others or in choosing particular combinations \nof parts.\n  Third, I am pleased to see that the conferees have addressed the \ndevice ``playability'' problem. As I pointed out in my floor speech \njust prior to final passage of S. 2037, ``playability'' problems may \narise at two levels. Technological measures may cause noticeable and \nrecurring adverse effects on the normal operation of products, and thus \nadjustments may be necessary at the factory levels to ensure consumers \nget what they expect. In addition, adjustments to specific products may \nbe necessary after sale to a consumer to maintain their normal, \nauthorized functioning. Subsequently, I was pleased to see that the \nCommerce Committee's report explicitly reaffirmed my interpretation.\n\n  I also was pleased that the conferees shared my perspective on \nencouraging all interested parties to strive to work together through a \nconsultative approach before new technological measures are introduced \nin the market. As the conferees pointed out, one of the benefits of \nsuch consultations is to allow the testing of proposed technologies to \ndetermine whether they create playability problems, and to have an \nopportunity to take steps to eliminate or substantially mitigate such \nadverse effects before new technologies are introduced. As the \nconferees recognized, however, persons may choose to implement a new \ntechnological measure (or copyright management information system) \nwithout vetting it through an inter-industry consultative process, or \nwithout regard to the input of the affected parties.\n  Whether introduced unilaterally or developed with the input of \nexperts in the field, a new protection technology coming to market \nmight materially degrade or otherwise cause recurring appreciable \nadverse effects on the authorized performance or display of works. \nGiven the multiplicity of ways in which devices might be \ninterconnected, some playability problems may not be foreseeable. I was \nthus pleased that the conference report unambiguously provides that \nmanufacturers and persons servicing popular consumer electronics, \ntelecommunications, or computing products who make product adjustments \nsolely to mitigate a playability problem--whether or not taken in \ncombination with other lawful product modifications--shall not be \ndeemed to have violated either section 1201(a) or section 1201(b). \nHaving heard directly from a major trade association representing \nprofessional servicers, I am pleased we could include such strong \nlanguage so that they can go about their business without fear of \nfacing crippling liability.\n  Fourth, the conferees adopted specific provisions making it clear \nthat the bill is not intended to prohibit legitimate encryption \nresearch or security systems testing. As my colleagues know, Senators \nBurns, Leahy, and I have lead the effort in the Senate to ensure that \nU.S. business can develop and export world-class encryption products. \nby explicitly fashioning an affirmative encryption research defense, \nthe conferees made an important contribution to our overall efforts to \nensure that U.S. industry remains at the forefront in developing secure \nencryption methods. In addition, by including a security system testing \namendment, the conferees have confirmed that professional consultants \nand other well-established, responsible corporate citizens can survey \nand test IT security systems for vulnerabilities.\n\n  Finally, the conferees built on my efforts to ensure that this \nlegislation would not harm the efforts of consumers to protect their \npersonal privacy by including two important amendments proposed by the \nHouse Commerce Committee. The first amendment would create incentives \nfor website operators to disclose whenever they use technological \nmeasures that have the capability to gather personal data, and to give \nconsumers a means of disabling them. The second amendment strengthened \nsection 1202 of this legislation by making explicit that the term \n``copyright management information'' does not include ``any personally \nidentifying information about a user of a work or a copy, phonorecord, \nperformance, or display of a work.'' In my view, these amendments will \nhelp preserve the critical balance that we must maintain between the \ninterests of copyright owners and the privacy interests of information \nusers.\n  We should all be gratified that so much has been done to \nappropriately calibrate the WIPO copyright treaties implementing \nlegislation. Each of us, working alone, would undoubtedly have produced \na different bill. But we have a good bill, perhaps one more balanced \nand limited in scope than might have been thought possible at times \nthroughout the debate. I therefore urge my colleagues to vote in favor \nof the conference report.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I wish to express my strong support for \nthe Conference Report to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. As one \nof the conferees, I believe this bill represents a fair compromise \nbetween the House and Senate versions of this most significant \nlegislation.\n  Intellectual property is an increasingly important part of the \nAmerican economy. This bill recognizes the significance of our \ncopyright laws as America and the world have become increasingly \ncomputerized. The Internet is rapidly changing our lives, and our \ncopyright laws must keep pace.\n  This legislation implements the WIPO treaties to help protect the \nproperty rights of the creative community in our global environment. It \nalso clarifies the liability of on-line and Internet service providers \nregarding their liability for copyright infringement and permits fair \nuse of works. Together, these provisions do a great deal\n\n[[Page S11889]]\n\nto accommodate the interests of the owners of copyrighted works with \nthose who use or facilitate the use of those works in the digital age.\n  A final title of the bill is the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act. \nAlthough it was not part of the Senate version of the legislation, it \nwas accepted at conference. I share Senator Hatch's concerns about this \ncontroversial title. It contains not only industrial design protection, \nwhich itself has created controversy in the past because of its impact \non consumers and others, but it protects functionality of vessel hulls \nin addition to aesthetic aspects. It is my understanding that \nfunctionality is protected from copying through patent, and this title \nis a significant departure from that principle, although for a specific \nnarrow area.\n  Also, I wish to note that although data base protection is not \nincluded in this bill, I think it is important that we make every \neffort to address this significant issue next year.\n  In closing, I wish to thank the Chairman of the conference, Senator \nHatch, and all of the other members of the conference for their \ncooperation in resolving this matter. I am very pleased with the \noutcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the conference \nreport be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the conference report be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, in the wining days of a Congress, so many \nimportant measures need attention that the significance of individual \nbills is often not appreciated. This is even more true for a bill that \nhas copyright as its subject matter, such as the Digital Millennium \nCopyright Act, the conference report which passed the Senate today by \nunanimous consent. But the DMCA is one of the most important bills \npassed this session, as the distinguished majority leader stated \nyesterday.\n  ``Digital Millennium'' may seem grandiose, but in fact it accurately \ndescribes the purpose of the bill--to set copyright law up to meet the \npromise and the challenge of the digital world in the new millennium. \nDigital ``world'' is appropriate here, because the Internet has made it \npossible for information--including valuable American copyrighted \nworks--to flow around the globe in a matter of hours, and Internet end \nusers can receive copies of movies, music, software, video games and \nliterary and graphic works that are as good as the originals. Indeed, \nthe initial impetus for the DMCA was the implementation of the World \nIntellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties on copyright and on \nperformances and phonorecords.\n  The WIPO treaties and the DMCA will protect the property rights of \nAmericans in their work as they move in the global, digital \nmarketplace, and, by doing so, continue to encourage the creation of \nnew works to inspire and delight us and to improve the quality of our \nlives.\n  In addition to securing copyright in the global, digital environment, \nthe DMCA also clarifies the liability of on-line and Internet service \nproviders--OSPs and ISPs--for copyright infringement liability. The \nOSPs and ISPs needed more certainty in this area in order to attract \nthe substantial investments necessary to continue the expansion and \nupgrading of the Internet.\n  The final component of the DMCA is the Vessel Hull Design Protection, \nAct (VHDPA). This legislation was not part of the Senate-passed version \nof the DMCA; rather, it was accepted by the Senate conferees in \ndeference to the House of Representatives. Although I support the idea \nof industrial design protection as a legal regime outside of patent \nlaw, I appreciate how controversial it is, and I think that the Senate \nshould act circumspectly. Furthermore, I am concerned that this bill is \nnot like traditional industrial design protection in that the VHDPA \nprotects the functionality of vessel hulls, not only its aesthetic \naspects.\n  But because the VHDPA is limited only to boat hulls, I felt that I \ncould acquiesce in including it in the conference report as a limited \nexperiment in design protection. In order to make it truly \nexperimental, I suggested, and the conferees adopted, modifications \nthat ``sunset'' the bill two years after enactment and that require two \nstudies of its effect. Therefore, in the future, we will be able to re-\nevaluate the Act, and we will have the benefit of two studies--both of \nthem conducted jointly by the Register of Copyrights and the \nCommissioner of Patents and Trademarks--to help us make the right \ndecision.\n  In the nearer future--early in the next session--I intend to focus my \nattention on database protection legislation. The House bill on this \nissue, which was attached by the House to the WIPO implementation \nlegislation, was a good start toward tackling the problem of database \npiracy. It was quite controversial, however, so I asked the parties to \nsit down with me to work out a compromise bill, so that disagreements \non database protection would not jeopardize the DMCA. This effort \nresulted in a bill draft that attempted to accommodate the diverging \ninterests. The scientific research community, in particular, favored my \napproach because it allayed many of their fears that recognizing a \nproperty right in databases would hamper scientific research.\n  Neither the House bill nor my proposal was accepted by the conferees, \nbut I am determined to work on this issue in the next Congress. Indeed, \nI intend to introduce a bill based on my proposal, have a hearing on \ndatabase protection, and move database legislation as quickly as \npossible. We need to encourage the substantial investment of money, \ntime and labor that it takes to gather and organize information and at \nthe same time address the reasonable concerns of information users. In \nour global, high tech era, information will be the coin of the realm, \nand I see database protection as the next step in moving the law into \nthe digital millennium.\n  In closing, I would like to recognize the many people who brought \nthis bill to a successful conclusion. First, I would like to thank my \ncolleague, Senator Patrick Leahy, the distinguished ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, who was of invaluable assistance in getting \nthis important piece of legislation passed. Two other distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Storm Thurmond and Senator John Ashcroft, \nparticipated in the refining process that made the DMCA a better bill.\n  Second, I want to thank the House conferees, especially Congressman \nHenry Hyde, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nCongressman Howard Coble, the distinguished chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, and Congressman Tom \nBliley, the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee for their \nwillingness to consider the Senate's views objectively and \ndispassionately. They too wanted to get this done, and it was the \nspirit of cooperation on both sides that produced this admirable \nresult.\n  Finally, I would like to acknowledge the hard work done by the Senate \nand House staffs. There were so many who worked on this bill that it \nwould take a column of the Congressional Record to list them. But I \nwould like to mention just a few. Manus Cooney, the staff director and \nchief counsel of the Senate Judiciary Committee, was the staff pilot \nfor the DMCA. He was ably assisted by Edward Damich, Chief Intellectual \nProperty Counsel of the Committee, and Staff Assistant Troy Dow. \nSenator Thurmond was ably assisted in the conference committee by his \nJudiciary Committee Counsel, Garry Malphus.\n  Bruce Cohen, Minority Chief Counsel and Staff Director of the \nJudiciary Committee, Beryl Howell, Minority General Counsel, and Marla \nGrossman, Minority Counsel, provided invaluable assistance on all \nlevels. We had superb cooperation from the minority, and the DMCA is \ntruly a bipartisan bill.\n  Turning to the House side, I want to express my appreciation for the \ncontributions of Mitch Glazier, Chief Counsel of the Subcommittee on \nCourts and Intellectual Property, Debra Laman, Counsel of the \nSubcommittee, Robert Raben, Minority Counsel of the Subcommittee, \nJustin Lilley, General Counsel of the Commerce Committee, and Andrew \nLevin, Minority Counsel of that Committee.\n\n[[Page S11890]]\n\n  Mr. President, this bill, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, is \none of the most important bills in this whole Congress. It has taken a \ntremendous amount of effort from all of us to be able to put this \ntogether. It is going to make a difference in so many ways--in the \nprotection of copyrighted works, in digital communication and \notherwise--throughout the world, that I feel very, very happy to be \nable to say that this is being enacted into law at this particular \npoint.\n  I would like to state my agreement with certain important points that \nSenator Leahy made in his remarks about Section 1201(k), ``Certain \nAnalog Devices and Certain Technological Measures.'' The Senator \nemphasized that that section establishes requirements only for analog \nvideocassette recorders, analog videocassette camcorders and \nprofessional analog videocassette recorders. It is also my \nunderstanding that the intent of the conferees is that these provisions \napply only to analog video recording devices.\n  In addition, because innovation and technological development thrive \nin unregulated environments, this section should not be misconstrued as \nproviding any impetus or precedent for regulating or otherwise \ndictating to the computer software industry technological standards. I \nagree fully with the assessment of the conferees that technology \ndevelops best and most rapidly in response to marketplace forces. For \nthese reasons, this section applies to analog technologies only, and it \nis entirely without prejudice to digital technologies.\n  Let me just say that I am disappointed that we were not able to \ninclude database protection in this bill this year. There are so many \npeople who would like to have that done, on the floor and in the \nbusiness world and elsewhere, but we were unable to get it done because \nof objections and because of some dissent. But I would like to put \neverybody on notice that, shortly after we get back next year, I will \nfile a database protection bill. I believe my colleague from Vermont \nwill join me in this. That, hopefully, will be a bill that everybody \ncan support, because it is absolutely critical that we get this done.\n  It will be one of the highest orders of priority that we will have on \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee next year. It was one of the things that \nI feel disappointed we were unable to get done on this particular bill. \nIt just could not be done at this time. I know there are people who are \ndisappointed, but we will get it done next year--we will do everything \nwe can to get it done, and I hope we can call upon industry and \neveryone else interested in this issue throughout the country to help \nus in this matter. I hope our colleagues will, because it is very, very \nimportant.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, America's founders recognized and valued \nthe creativity of this nation's citizens to such an extent that \nintellectual property rights are rooted in the Constitution. Article I, \nSection 8, Clause 8 of the Constitution states that\n\n       The Congress shall have power . . . [t]o promote the \n     progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited \n     times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their \n     respective writings and discoveries.\n\n  The Continental Congress proclaimed,\n\n       Nothing is more properly a man's own than the fruit of his \n     study.''\n\n  Protecting intellectual property rights is just as important today as \nit was when America was a fledgling nation.\n  It is for this reason I am pleased that the Senate has today passed \nthe Conference Report on the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), \nH.R. 2281.\n  Title I of the DMCA will implement the two World Intellectual \nProperty Organization (WIPO) copyright treaties. These treaties will \nfortify intellectual property rights around the world and will help \nunleash the full potential of America's most creative industries, \nincluding the computer software, publishing, movie, recording and other \ncopyrighted industries that are subject to online piracy. By insuring \nbetter protection of the creative works available online, the DMCA will \nalso encourage the continued growth of the Internet and the global \ninformation infrastructure. It will encourage the ingenuity of the \nAmerican people, and will send a powerful message to intellectual \nproperty pirates that we will not tolerate theft.\n  I should note that there are provisions in Title I that address \ncertain technologies used to control copying of motion pictures in \nanalog form on video cassette recorders which were not part of either \nthe original Senate or House DMCA bills. These provisions establish \ncertain requirements only for analog videocassette recorders, analog \nvideocassette camcorders and professional analog videocassette \nrecorders. It is my understanding that these provisions do not \nestablish any obligations with respect to digital technologies, \nincluding computers or software.\n  It is also my understanding that the intent of the conferees is that \nthese provisions neither establish, nor should be interpreted as \nestablishing, a precedent for Congress to legislate specific standards \nor specific technologies to be used as technological protection \nmeasures, particularly with respect to computers and software. \nGenerally, Congress should not establish technology specific rules; \ntechnology develops best and most rapidly in response to marketplace \nforces.\n  Title II of the DMCA will limit the infringement liability of online \nservice providers. This title is intended to preserve incentives for \nonline service providers and copyright owners to cooperate to detect \nand address copyright infringements that occur in the digital networked \nenvironment.\n  Title III will provide a minor, yet important, clarification in \nsection 117 of the Copyright Act to ensure that the lawful owner or \nlessee of a computer machine may authorize an independent service \nprovider, a person unaffiliated with either the owner or lessee of the \nmachine, to activate the machine for the sole purpose of servicing its \nhardware components.\n  Title IV will begin to update our nation's copyright laws with \nrespect to library, archives, and educational uses of copyrighted works \nin a digital environment. It includes provisions relating to the \nCommissioner of Patents and Trademarks and the Register of Copyrights, \nand clarifies the role of the Copyright Office. It also addresses the \nassumption of contractual obligations related to the transfer of rights \nin motion pictures. Finally, this title creates a fair and efficient \nlicensing mechanism to address the complex issues facing copyright \nowners and users of copyrighted materials as a result of the rapid \ngrowth of digital audio services.\n  Title V, the ``Vessel Hull Design Protection Act,'' creates a new \nform of sui generis intellectual property protection for vessel hull \ndesigns. By adoption of this title, however, the Conferees wisely took \nno position on the advisability or propriety of adopting broader design \nprotection for other useful articles. Indeed, when broad industrial \ndesign legislation was considered by the Congress in the late 1980s and \nearly 1990s, a number of legitimate concerns were raised about the \neffects such legislation would have, particularly on the cost of auto \nrepairs. Establishing narrow protection for vessel hulls in the \nconference report should not be interpreted as signaling support, or \nsetting a precedent, for broader design protection that could \nnegatively affect the ability of consumers to obtain economical, \nquality auto repairs.\n  The Senate today is passing a balanced and important package. Certain \nissues that the House had included in the version it passed on August \n4, 1998, were eliminated to allow consideration of the rest of the \npackage in a timely manner.\n  One of the issues dropped was that of database protection. Title V of \nthe House passed DMCA bill created a new federal prohibition against \nthe misappropriation of databases that are the product of substantial \ninvestment, with both civil remedies and criminal penalties. The \nargument for enhanced database protection is that legal rulings and \ntechnological developments have eroded protections against database \ntheft. Companies may be able to copy significant portions of \nestablished databases and sell them, avoiding the substantial cost of \ncreating and verifying the databases themselves. I appreciate that the \nthreat to U.S. databases has been magnified because database protection \nlaws recently implemented in European Union countries will not be \navailable to U.S. publishers unless comparable legislation is enacted \nin the U.S.\n\n[[Page S11891]]\n\n  I have therefore been and continue to be supportive of legislation to \nprovide database producers with adequate protection from database \npiracy.\n  I am also sensitive, however, to the concerns about the House-passed \ndatabase bill that were raised by the Administration, the libraries, \ncertain educational institutions, and the scientific community. The \nDepartment of Justice, in a memorandum dated July 28, 1998, concluded \nthat the House passed database bill, H.R. 2652, which was later \nincorporated in Title V of the House DMCA, raised difficult and novel \nconstitutional questions.\n  The Department of Commerce has also advised me that while the \nAdministration supports legal protection against commercial \nmisappropriation of collections of information, the Administration has \na number of concerns with H.R. 2652, including that the Constitution \nimposes significant constraints upon Congress' power to enact \nlegislation of this sort.\n  Just this week, the Department of Commerce told me in a letter that:\n\n       Given the critical importance of implementing the WIPO \n     treaties, and the short time remaining in the Session, we \n     urge the Conferees to focus on issues germane to these \n     treaties, rather than unrelated matters.\n\n  Although there was not enough time before the end of this Congress to \ngive this important issue due consideration, it is my hope that the \nSenate Judiciary Committee will promptly commence hearings on the issue \nand move expeditiously to enact further legislation on the matter at \nthe beginning of the 106th Congress. The work that the Committee did \nthis year on the issue should be viewed as a beginning, and we are \ncommitted to making more progress as quickly as possible.\n  The legislation that the Senate passed today is the culmination of \nseveral years' work, both domestically and internationally, to ensure \nthat the appropriate copyright protections are in place around the \nworld to foster the enormous growth of the Internet and other digital \ncomputer networks.\n  Much of the credit for this legislation is due to the hard work and \ndedication of the Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator \nHatch. This is another example of when we work together, we get good \nthings done. It was also a pleasure to serve on the Conference with \nSenator Thurmond, former Chairman the Senate Judiciary Committee and a \nforce in his own right.\n  The Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Judiciary Committee--\nChairman Hyde and Congressman Conyers--and the Chairman and Ranking \nMember of the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property--\nChairman Coble and Congressman Frank--deserve particular recognition \nand praise for their fine work. Although Congressman Frank was not on \nthe Conference Committee, his tremendous efforts on behalf of the WIPO \nimplementing language as well as on the other matters in the DMCA are \nvery much appreciated. Congressman Goodlatte and Berman also \ncontributed considerable time and talent to the benefit of all who \nparticipated in the process.\n  Although I had not previously had the pleasure of working on WIPO \nwith the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Commerce Committee--\nChairman Bliley and Congressman Dingell--or the Chairman of the \nTelecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection Subcommittee, \nChairman Tauzin, I would like to acknowledge their significant \ncontributions to the final package.\n  The staff of all of the Conferees deserve special recognition. Manus \nCooney, Edward Damich, Troy Dow, Garry Malphrus, Mitch Glazier, Debbie \nLaman, Robert Raben, Bari Schwartz, David Lehman, Ben Cline, Justin \nLilley, Andy Levin, Mike O'Rielly, and Whitney Fox spent countless \nhours on this bill, when it was pending in Committee, on the floor and, \nfinally, in conference. Without their labor and talent, we would not be \nhere today considering the DMCA.\n  The DMCA also reflects the recommendations and hard work of the \nCopyright Office. Specifically, Marybeth Peters, Shira Perlmutter, \nDavid Carson, Jesse Feder, Carolina Saez, Sayuri Rajapakse, Rachel \nGoslins and Jule Sigall were invaluable on this legislation. The \nCopyright Office was there at every step along the way--from the \nnegotiation of the WIPO treaties to the negotiations and the drafting \nof the implementing legislation and the other issues in the DMCA. Given \ntheir expertise in copyright law, they will play a significant role in \nthe implementation of the legislation, particularly with regards to the \nrulemaking on the circumvention of technological measures that \neffectively control access to a copyrighted work and the studies \nmandated by the bill.\n  The Clinton Administration deserves praise for the role it played in \nmaking this legislation a reality. I would especially like to thank \nSecretary Daley, Andy Pincus, Ellen Bloom, Jennifer Conovitz and Justin \nHughes of the Department of Commerce, as well as Brian Kahin and Thomas \nKalil for all of their hard work on the DMCA.\n  From my perspective, those who deserve the most thanks are my \nJudiciary Committee staff who have assisted me during the hearings, \ndebates, negotiations, and conference on this bill. Bruce Cohen, Beryl \nHowell and Marla Grossman have worked tirelessly to ensure that this \nbill was well crafted and lived up to its promise.\n  This legislation is an important step for protecting American \ningenuity and creative expression. It addresses the needs of creators, \nconsumers and commerce in the digital age and well into the next \ncentury. I am proud that the Senate has passed this legislation today.\n  Mr. President, so Senators will know, the distinguished senior \nSenator from Utah and I spent enormous amounts of time on this piece of \nlegislation working to get us to this point. We both share great \nconcerns about the database part. We understood that we would not be \nable to get the bill passed had that stayed in the bill.\n  The distinguished Senator from Utah and I will work between the time \nwe go out and the time we come back in January to put together database \nlegislation. There will be a strong effort, I know, on my side of the \naisle, as there will be on his. We hope the Senate will be able to vote \non that and the House, too, early next year. I say this because I do \nnot want anybody to think that this has now disappeared because the \nrest of the legislation has gone through.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to implement the WIPO treaties. I also strongly support the \ncopyright term extension legislation that we recently passed by voice \nvote.\n  While I would like to congratulate the conferees and their staff for \nworking out a consensus on so many controversial provisions, I feel it \nis necessary to express my disappointment that we are unable to pass \nsome form of database protection this year. It is unfortunate that a \nconsensus could not be reached on an issue that is so vital to so many \npeople in our country. Agricultural databases, for example, are relied \nupon by our farmers and by others in our farming supply industry. While \ncomputers and the Internet make access to information available at our \nfingertips, we need to provide adequate protection for those who \ncompile that information in such a user friendly format. Such easy \naccess is essential to health care workers, for example, who need to \nhave fast access to accurate information about which drugs have adverse \nreactions to other drugs or which antidotes are most effective in \ncounteracting certain poisons.\n  I see my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, is on the floor, and I would like to ask if he \nwould agree that Congress should pass database legislation as early as \npossible next year to ensure that those who invest their time, money \nand effort in compiling and updating databases are protected from \nhaving their work pirated both domestically and internationally? Would \nthe Senator from Utah agree that without such protections, database \ncreators may decide that the risk of loss from piracy outweighs any \npotential gains from creating or updating databases.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as my colleague well knows, I have \nfacilitated a number of meetings with interested parties from all sides \nof this issue to try to work out a consensus bill. Obviously more work \nneeds to be done to pass a bill that is acceptable to all sides. This \nis an important issue, and I\n\n[[Page S11892]]\n\nthink everyone understands that. The Senator from Ohio has my assurance \nthat I will continue to work with him on this issue.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I again commend the Senator from Utah and the other WIPO \nconferees and their staff, especially Senator Leahy, for their tireless \nefforts to reach consensus on so many complex issues. I would simply \nlike to ask my friend from Utah to work with those of us on the \nJudiciary Committee to introduce and seek passage of legislation early \nnext year that protects our databases.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me assure my friend from Ohio that I \nhave spoken to our colleagues on the House side, Congressmen Hyde and \nCoble, and we have agreed to work together to introduce and seek \npassage of database protection legislation early next year. I will \ncontinue to work with the Senator from Ohio and our Senate and House \ncolleagues and address this issue early next year.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank the Senator from Utah for his comments.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. As I understand, the conference report has been agreed to. \nMr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the conference \nreport was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my friend, the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will my colleague yield for 1 other minute? I promised I \nwould yield to the distinguished Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. WARNER. I will be happy to yield to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona, provided I do not lose my right of recognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11887-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11892-S11896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              MEDICARE BENEFICIARY FREEDOM TO CONTRACT ACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. President, I rise with several of my fellow Senators in support \nof S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act. S. 1194 \ncurrently has 48 Senate and 192 House cosponsors.\n  We believe that Medicare beneficiaries should have the same right to \nobtain health care from the physician or provider of their choice as do \nMembers of Congress and virtually all other Americans.\n  It is dangerous to have the government control health care decisions \nin a free society.\n  What is the problem addressed by this legislation?\n  The problem is simply one of health care choice for seniors--a \nproblem which has been brought to our attention by countless \nconstituents all over America.\n  As I have mentioned on the Senate floor several times, this problem \nwas first brought to my attention in a letter I received from Mr. and \nMrs. C.B. Howard of Prescott.\n  Mary Ann Howard is a diabetic. The medicine she was taking was not \nworking, and she wanted to change doctors to one who specialized in \ntreating diabetics.\n  Her doctor told her that this was not possible. Amazed, Mary Ann \nasked why, and her original doctor replied that, due to the regulatory \nand administrative burdens of the Medicare system, the specialist \ncannot afford to take any more Medicare patients.\n  When Mary Ann--who had recently turned 65 and enrolled in Medicare--\nasked the specialist if she could pay for the treatment out of pocket, \nthe specialist said no. ``If I accept you as a patient, I would be \naccused of Medicare fraud.''\n  Yes, it's true: Because of a flawed interpretation of the Medicare \nlaw, the government has barred Medicare beneficiaries from using their \nown money to receive treatment from the doctor of their choice. It's \nMedicare or no care!\n  To end this unfairness, the Senate passed the Kyl amendment to the \nBalanced Budget Act of 1997 that would allow health care choice for \nseniors.\n  But the Administration threatened to veto the entire budget over this \nprovision, and forced the Senate-House conference committee to include \na poison pill:\n  In order to enter into a private contract, a physician or other \nprovider would have to sign out of Medicare for two years.\n  The two-year exclusion presents your doctor with a difficult choice: \nHe can either treat you, his patient of 30 years, on a private contract \nbasis, and drop his other Medicare patients for two years; or refuse to \ntreat you in favor of his current Medicare patients.\n  Over 96 percent of doctors accept some Medicare patients and would \nnot likely be willing to impose such a hardship on their current \npatients.\n  So your options will likely be reduced.\n  To remove this ``two year'' limitation on patient-choice, House Ways \nand Means Chairman Bill Archer and I introduced the Medicare \nBeneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act.\n  The bill removes the two-year exclusion and ensure that any Medicare \nbeneficiary can enter into an agreement with the provider of his or her \nchoice for any health care service.\n  In his 1998 State of the Union address, President Clinton said that \nall Americans ``should have the right to choose the doctor they want \nfor the care they need.''\n  We could not agree more. But as of January 1 of this year, seniors no \nlonger have this right because, as I mentioned, the President insisted \nlast year's Balanced Budget Act be changed to effectively preclude \nseniors from going outside of Medicare--even if they are willing to pay \nfor the care themselves.\n  S. 1194 could also be referred to as the Senior Citizens ``Medicare \nPoint of Service Option.''\n  Just as with a Point of Service Option in a private plan, this \n``Medicare Point of Service Option'' would allow seniors to go outside \nof the Medicare network to obtain care from the doctors of their \nchoice.\n  The only real difference is that the senior-patient would pay 100 \npercent of the cost of exercising this right, whereas the private plan \nwould subsidize this choice to some degree.\n  Sandra Butler, president of United Seniors Association, represents \nthe organization's 640,000 members who strongly support this bill.\n  United Seniors Association members believe that the government's view \nof private contracting ``violates a basic--no, the basic--principle of \nAmerican life: freedom.''\n  In addition, a broad array of organizations have expressed support \nfor the case to overturn current law.\n  This group includes the Christian Coalition, the American Civil \nLiberties Union, the Heritage Foundation, the American Enterprise \nInstitute, National Right to Life Committee, the American Medical \nAssociation, the American Conservative Union, Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, and the National Center for Policy Analysis.\n  Opponents of the bill make three basic arguments: the bill will \nincrease fraud, will put seniors at the mercy of doctors and other \nproviders, and will hurt Medicare.\n  1. With respect to fraud, the bill contains extensive anti-fraud \nmeasures, including the requirement of a written contract with clear \nterms, such as the fact that the service could be paid for by Medicare.\n  2. Others believe that unethical doctors would take advantage of \nvulnerable seniors.\n  Common experience with medical professionals who save lives without \nreimbursement in emergency situations, and seniors who read and \nquestion virtually every line in their Medicare bill, clearly refute \nthis claim.\n  Further, a senior can for any reason terminate the contract \nprospectively and return to Medicare for the covered benefit.\n  3. Some believe private contracting will destroy Medicare.\n  However, private contracting will result in fewer claims being paid \nout of the near-bankrupt Medicare trust fund.\n  We believe that the right of seniors to choose the health care \nprovider and benefits that suit their individual needs is essential to \nour Nation's concept of liberty.\n\n[[Page S11893]]\n\n  In fact, there is no more fundamental principle at stake in any \nlegislative issue before the Congress.\n  We must not be the Congress that denied seniors the right to spend \nmoney they may have saved for years on a medical procedure needed for \nthemselves or a loved one.\n  Imagine a law that made it illegal for seniors to supplement their \nSocial Security check with private funds!\n  In sum, Mr. President, we believe that the Congress should enact \nlegislation that ensures that seniors have the right to see the \nphysician or health-care provider they want, and not be limited in such \nright by the imposition of unreasonable conditions on providers who are \nwilling to treat seniors on a private basis.\n  Even Great Britain's system of socialized medicine gives its \nbeneficiaries this freedom.\n  Senators and their staffs have this freedom. Surely, America should \ndo no less for its seniors.\n  Mr. President, I take this opportunity to express my appreciation for \nmy colleagues' willingness to work with me to ensure seniors the \ncritical right of health-care choice.\n  I am joined by many of my colleagues in the Senate to ask the \nMajority Leader, Senator Lott, and Senate Finance Committee Chairman \nRoth, to work with us and the numerous outside organizations to address \nthis issue of Medicare freedom of health-care choice as soon as is \nreasonable in the 106th Congress.\n  As we know, President Clinton and some of our colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle want the government to continue to control all \nmedical decisions of seniors.\n  We must not rest until seniors are granted this basic civil right to \nchoose the doctors and benefits that best address their particular \nhealth needs.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader and my \ncolleagues for bringing the important issue of Medicare private \ncontracting to my attention in this constructive way. The individual \nstories described today on the floor illustrate why private contracting \nhas generating intense interest and deserves careful study. \nOrganizations including the United Seniors Association, American Civil \nLiberties Union, Christian Coalition, American Conservative Union, \nHeritage Foundation, National Right to Life Committee, CATO Institute, \nand Citizens Against Government waste share the concerns with current \nlaw and the belief that Medicare beneficiaries should be provided more \nfreedom-of-choice in Medicare. In the months ahead, I intend to work \nclosely with my colleagues here in the Senate to review the private \ncontracting provisions of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  (At the request of Mr. Kyl, the following statement was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record.)\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I want to express my continuing \nsupport for S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act.\n  It is ironic that the Balanced Budget Act--which purported to expand \nseniors' freedom of choice--took away most of the rights they already \nhad to spend their own dollars to purchase health care of their \nchoosing. Many senior citizens and disabled individuals in my state are \noutraged at this loss, and justifiably so. I must concur with the \ncomments made recently by Art Spitzer, legal director of the American \nCivil Liberties Union of the National Capitol Area in an amici curiae \nbrief in United Seniors Association vs. Donna Shalala:\n\n       ``. . . the government should be able to say `We are going \n     to provide a certain amount of health care, and that is how \n     much we will provide and we are not going to provide more \n     than that.' But it seems quite outrageous to us . . . that \n     the government could say `and you may not get any more health \n     care than we are willing to provide you, even if you and your \n     doctor agree that it would be good for you, even if you are \n     able to pay for it with your own funds.' ''\n  I ask that a letter I recently sent to the ranking member of the \nSenate Finance Committee be printed in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 5, 1998.\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Finance Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: As you know, the American Civil Liberties Union \n     of the National Capital Area has joined as an amici curiae \n     participant in the United Seniors Association vs Donna \n     Shalala lawsuit to enjoin enforcement of Section 4507 of the \n     Balanced Budget Act of 1997. I support the views expressed in \n     this lawsuit that Congress made a mistake in the Balanced \n     Budget Act by disallowing seniors from making the broadest \n     array of physician and medical point-of-service choices in \n     instances where they want or need services out of the \n     Medicare system badly enough to spend their own money. It \n     stepped far over the bounds of ``protection'' into erosion of \n     freedom.\n       I strongly supported requirements that physicians file \n     Medicare claims on behalf of beneficiaries. We've gotten the \n     program so complicated that hardly anyone understands it, but \n     doctors are better able to fight complex coding disputes and \n     coverage rules than their patients. Also, not getting paid \n     adds the incentive to resolve claim disputes while keeping \n     money in beneficiaries' pockets. Little did I realize this \n     protection would be used to restrict access to care. Section \n     4507 is an unwarranted intrusion on freedom of choice for \n     physicians and Medicare beneficiaries and adds unnecessary \n     costs to the Medicare that is already suffering financial \n     problems that scream for resolution.\n       While most of us are able to find satisfactory care for \n     which we are glad to have Medicare pay, many of my \n     constituents have given reasons why an individual may choose \n     to go outside the Medicare system from time to time. Take the \n     example of a Federal employee who retired to the Charleston \n     area after living sixty years in Washington. She wanted to \n     return to have eye surgery at the Wilmer Eye Institute at \n     Johns Hopkins but was prohibited from doing so because the \n     surgeon did not accept Medicare patients. She wrote me that \n     she is not wealthy and has chosen to live frugally so that \n     she has something left over after living expenses to spend as \n     she sees fit. ``What right does the Government have to tell \n     me I can't spend my own money to buy the health care that I \n     think I need,'' she asks. I have to agree that the Federal \n     Government telling us senior citizens what we can do with our \n     own money is simply unacceptable.\n       A great deal of confusion about Section 4507 remains. I \n     continue to believe we can reach a consensus that will permit \n     private contracting for seniors who choose to do so while \n     providing adequate protection for Medicare beneficiaries and \n     request that you give this matter your much respected expert \n     consideration early in the 106th Congress. If I can answer \n     any questions or be of any help, please don't hesitate to \n     call on me.\n       With kindest regards, I am,\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, we clearly cannot move forward with \nMedicare+Choice until the confusion over Section 4507 is resolved, and \nI join my colleagues in urging your earliest consideration of this \nmatter in the 106th Congress.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I speak today in defense of an essential \nfreedom--the right to make health care decisions outside of the \ngovernmental bureaucracy. Yet there is a segment of our population--our \nseniors--who have lost that freedom. At the administration's insistence \na provision was included in the budget reconciliation bill of 1997 that \nprohibits physicians from participating in the Medicare program for two \nyears if they accept private payment for services normally covered \nunder the Medicare program from a patient who is eligible for \nMedicare--essentially trapping our seniors in a government controlled \nhealth care program.\n  It is clear that the provisions included in the Balanced Budget Act \nare hurting seniors. One of my constituents stories was featured in the \nReader's Digest. Ray Perry wanted to pay for routine screening tests \nfor he and his wife because years before, prior to enrolling in \nMedicare, the Perry's had conducted a similar series of tests and were \nable to detect his wife's lymphatic leukemia very early when it was \nstill treatable. Medicare decided not to pay for the tests because the \nPerrys didn't have certain symptoms that would indicate these tests \nwere required. But, when the Perrys offered to pay out of their own \npocket, the doctor still wouldn't order the tests for fear of being \npenalized by Medicare. While both the Perrys and their doctor wanted \nmedical services that were clearly reasonable, and the Perrys were \nwilling to pay for these services, the restrictions currently found in \nMedicare prevented them from getting the kind of health care they \nneeded.\n  It is unconscionable that in a nation founded on the principles of \nfreedom that we would limit the freedom of the Perrys and millions of \nAmerican seniors just like them.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks \nconcerning the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom\n\n[[Page S11894]]\n\nto Contract Act. Most Americans believe that should control their \nhealth care to the greatest extent possible. Others continue to favor \ncomprehensive federal control of seniors, health care which results in \nrationing. All patients should be able to choose their own doctors and \nhave complete freedom to supplement their insurance, including \nMedicare, as they see fit. The right of seniors to pay out of their own \npocket for the health care of their choice is an essential element of \nour nation's concept of liberty.\n  Under this Act, Medicare would pay the standard fee for the standard \nprocedures by the standard practitioner with private contracting \nreserved for more specialized procedures. While it would be a right \nthat--because of economics--would be exercised only in special \ncircumstances, private contracting is a basic right every senior should \nhave. And importantly, it would provide a safeguard from government \nmanipulation--something which under the Clinton Administration is an \nall-too-real possibility.\n  Under this act, seniors would be even less likely to privately \ncontract than they are to go to nonparticipating physician, because \nwith private contracting they agree to pay the full cost of the service \nthemselves (just as they historically have.) In fact, if the desire to \npay out-of-pocket were widespread, seniors wouldn't join Part B (which \nis voluntary) at all. But seniors overwhelmingly choose Part B \ninsurance--just as most other Americans do in choosing doctor-visit \ncoverage in their health plans.\n  President Clinton said in the State of the Union that all Americans \nmust have the right to doctor choice, and assess to specialists without \nreferral. Why not seniors, too?\n  Mr. President, I believe that Americans are right when they tell me \nin letters and phone calls and personal visits that they do not want to \nbe trapped by a one-tiered Medicare program. I think I am correct in \nstating that senior citizens over age 64 are right in being angry at \nall members of Congress and the Clinton Administration for denying them \ntheir right to make any medical choice for themselves, to see any \nphysician they want for any service they want if they want to spend \ntheir own money. It is for this reason, that I ask all my colleagues to \nwork with us to restore to seniors their right to privately contract \nfor any medical service with physicians of their choice. I look forward \nto working with the distinguished Chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, and other Members of the Senate toward that \ngoal.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his work and \nsupport of this very important legislation.\n  I also thank Senator Kyl for his dedicated work on this issue. I was \npleased to join him as an original cosponsor of this bill, because I \nbelieve that this is a fundamental issue of freedom for all senior \ncitizens. Every senior citizen should have the fundamental right to pay \nout of their own pocket for the health care they want from the \nphysician they choose.\n  President Clinton has repeatedly stated, most recently in his State \nof the Union address, that ``all Americans should have the right to \nchoose the doctor they want for the care they need.'' But apparently, \nthe administration does not believe this should apply to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. In fact, during the debate on the Balanced Budget Act \n(BBA) of 1997, the administration repeatedly stated their opposition to \ngiving his unfettered freedom to senior citizens.\n  Finally, the administration agreed to drop their objections to this \nprovision if the BBA would grant seniors only limited freedom with \ncertain restrictions. In the spirit of compromise, the BBA included a \nlimited provision to allow physicians to enter into private contracts \nfor Medicare-covered services. Unfortunately, the provision in the BBA \ndid not go far enough.\n  Under BBA 97, in order to enter into these contracts, a physician or \nother provider would have to opt out of Medicare for two years and sign \nan affidavit, approved by HCFA, to ensure that no Medicare patients \nwere treated. But the two-year exclusion presents the doctor with a \ndifficult choice: either treat the patient on a private contract and \ndrop all other Medicare patients for two years; or refuse to treat the \npatient in favor of current Medicare patients. This is a difficult \ndecision that neither a physician or beneficiary should be required to \nmake.\n  Now, one can argue that the reforms in the BBA were a step forward \nfor Medicare private contracting. If is true that HCFA had interpreted \nMedicare law, prior to the passage of BBA 97, as effectively \nprohibiting private contracts. In fact, HCFA had gone as far as \nthreatening physicians and other providers with fines and exclusion \nfrom Medicare and even criminal prosecution. So if HCFA's \ninterpretation was correct, perhaps the provisions included in BBA 97 \nwere a step forward.\n  On the other hand, many respected Medicare experts have suggested \nthat HCFA did, in fact, misinterpret the Medicare statute. In other \nwords, Medicare law did not prohibit private contracts, but rather it \nwas silent on the issue. As I read the Medicare law, prior to BBA, I \nsee nothing that prohibits Medicare beneficiaries and providers from \nentering into these private arrangements. So if this interpretation is \ncorrect, the provisions included in BBA could be viewed as a step \nbackward.\n  In either case, the right thing to do is to allow seniors unfettered, \nunrestricted access to the doctor of their choice. The Kyl legislation \ndoes just that. It would extend this right to Medicare beneficiaries \nwith no limitation, allowing Medicare beneficiaries to be treated for \nMedicare-covered services by the physicians of their choice on a \n``case-by-case'' and a ``patient-by-patient'' basis. No doctor who \nchooses to enter into a private contracting arrangement with a senior \nwould be faced with fines or expulsion from the Medicare program.\n  Opponents of private contracting make two primary arguments against \nthis legislation: unethical doctors will take advantage of seniors to \nincrease their income; and it will result in excessive fraud and abuse \nin the Medicare program.\n  The argument that perplexes me the most is the concern that unethical \ndoctors would take advantage of vulnerable seniors and use private \ncontracts to increase their annual income. If I were a Medicare \nbeneficiary I would be offended by the notion that I am unable to make \nmy own financial and medical decision. Senior citizens are some of the \nmost frugal and well informed health care shoppers in the country. \nAdditionally, if I were a physician, I would be offended by the \nassumption that most doctors are unethical in their professional \nactivities. Any physician that were to engage in unethical or coercive \npractices faces tremendous risks, including the loss of their medical \nlicense for ethical violations.\n\n  I assume that those who believe physicians will use the Kyl \nlegislation to line their pockets would also be concerned with new \nfederal coverage mandates on private health insurance. Every federal \ncoverage mandate we place on health insurance providers increases the \ncost of health insurance and increases the revenues of physicians. But \nI haven't heard many members who are concerned that federal mandates \nwhich require insurance companies to pay for a variety of treatments \nmay increase the profits of physicians. Do we assume that physicians \nand other practitioners will be ethical when an insurance company is \npaying the bill and unethical when a vulnerable senior is paying the \nbill? The fact is that the opponents of this legislation simply want \nmore control over the health care of senior citizens.\n  The bill also contains strong consumer protection standards to ensure \nthat Medicare beneficiaries are not exploited. Private contracts must \nbe in writing, signed by the beneficiary, and identify the services \ncovered by the contract. It prohibits private contracts in emergency \nsituations, unless the contract was entered into before the onset of \nthe emergency medical condition.\n  Private contracts may only be entered into on a prospective basis and \nmay not apply to services rendered prior to the signing of the \ncontract. Such contracts must also notify the beneficiary that Medicare \nis not responsible for the payment of any services covered under the \ncontract and that the beneficiary has the right to have such services \nprovided by other physicians or practitioners to whom Medicare payment \nwould be made.\n\n[[Page S11895]]\n\n  Other opponents of this legislation argue that private contracting \nwill result in double billing and outright fraud. Perhaps the opponents \nhaven't looked closely at the extensive anti-fraud measures included in \nthis legislation. The legislation prohibits double payments by \nrequiring physicians and practitioners entering into private contracts \nto submit to the Secretary such information as may be necessary to \navoid any payment under Part A or Part B for services covered under the \ncontract. Fraudulent billing would be detected and punished through \nexisting fraud and abuse laws and standard auditing procedures used by \nMedicare and private plans. If Medicare did pay for a service, the \npatient would receive a statement and could easily notify Medicare of \nthe payment error.\n  Mr. President, this legislation adequately addresses the concerns \nthat have been raised by the opponents. The integrity of Medicare \nsystem is not at issue here. The defining issue is really quite simple. \nThis is a fundamental issue of individual freedom. Do you support \ngiving senior citizens the freedom to pay out of their own pocket for \nthe health care they want from the physician they choose? Or do you \nsupport limiting that freedom and restricting the health care choices \navailable to senior citizens? I hope my colleagues will join Senator \nKyl in supporting this legislation and supporting individual freedom \nfor every senior citizen.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Kyl's \ninitiative to provide more choice for our nation's senior citizens. I \nencourage the majority leader and Senate Finance Committee Chairman \nRoth to continue to work to address the issue of private contracting so \nthat S. 1194 can be enacted into law.\n  I believe that our seniors should have the right to make their own \ndecisions when it comes to matters of their health. Somewhere along the \nway, it has been mistakenly assumed that once a person reaches 65, they \nno longer are able to make their own decisions and do not desire the \nfreedom of choice that others enjoy. Since when did the seniors of our \nnation become so helpless? Shouldn't seniors be afforded the same \nrights that the rest of us enjoy--to determine what is in their best \ninterest?\n  Current law does not permit seniors to purchase their own health care \nservices if those services are covered under Medicare and provided by a \nphysician who accepts Medicare payments. This is ludicrous. Not only \ndoes this law take away rights of senior citizens, but these types of \nregulations within the Medicare system also discourage the \nparticipation of doctors. If a physician decides to accept a private \ncontracting fee, the doctor must give up all Medicare patients for two \nyears. In effect, this law has the potential of limiting physicians who \nparticipate in the Medicare program. This could consequently decrease \nthe quality of physicians in the Medicare system because doctors refuse \nto be part of such an oppressive system.\n  This issue is one of fundamental rights. No other government program \nrestricts the participants as does Medicare--including Medicaid and \nhealth programs for government employees. Medicare beneficiaries should \nbe given the right to pay out-of-pocket and to choose their own health \ncare provider.\n  One of the guiding principles of this nation is individual freedom. \nCongress should not support measures that clearly restrict freedom. I \nurge the enactment of S. 1194, the Medicare Beneficiaries Freedom to \nContract Act.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a co-sponsor of the \nMedicare Beneficiary Freedom to Contract Act. I want to commend the \nefforts of Senator Kyl, who introduced this important legislation and \nwho has worked so hard to secure its passage.\n  The central questions with respect to the issue of Medicare private \ncontracting are clear. It is the proper role of the Federal government \nto deny Medicare beneficiaries the ability to use their own money to \nget the health care services they believe they need? Is it good public \nhealth policy to force doctors who treat Medicare beneficiaries on a \nprivate-pay basis out of Medicare for two years?\n  I think these questions must be answered with a resounding ``no''. If \na Medicare patient--or any patient, for that matter--wants to spend his \nor her own money to pay for a health care service, it should be their \ndecision and not the government's decision. I also believe it is wrong \nto put a doctor in the position of having to decide between treating a \nMedicare patient who chooses to pay out-of-pocket, or stop treating all \ntheir other Medicare patients for two years.\n  The administration makes the argument that its opposition to this \nlegislation is based upon its desire to ``protect senior citizens''. I \ncertainly don't question the sincerity of their concern. However, \njudging from the response my office has received, seniors neither want \nnor need the Federal government to ``protect them'' from themselves. \nFlorida is home to the second largest Medicare beneficiary population \nin the nation. My office has been deluged with thousands of letters, \ntelephone calls, faxes, postcards and telegrams from Medicare \nbeneficiaries who are, quite frankly, outraged that the Administration \nis opposed to this legislation.\n  The communications I have received from seniors in Florida all have \ncommon themes--How can something like this be happening in America? Is \nthis not a profound assault on the freedom of American citizens? What \nright do you people in Washington have to tell me what I can and can't \ndo with my own money when it comes to my own health care? Who asked you \nto make this decision for me?\n  I couldn't agree with them more. It is clearly wrong to take \nimportant health care decisions out of the hands of patients and put \nthem into the hands of the Federal government. Moreover, this policy \nresults in a two-tiered system for those Americans who receive their \nhealth care from the Federal government. Patients who are beneficiaries \nof Medicaid, CHAMPUS, the Indian Health Service and Federal workers who \nparticipate in the FEHBP, which includes most of us in Congress and our \nstaffs, may legally enter into private contracts with physicians of our \nchoice. But this is not the case for Medicare beneficiaries--because \nthe government supposedly knows what is best for them.\n  Isn't it also ironic that a citizen of Great Britain, with its \nsocialized health care delivery system, has the ability to privately \npay for medical services, but Medicare patients in the United States \nare denied the ability to make this decision for themselves unless \ntheir physician is willing to opt-out of Medicare for two years?\n  To me, this issue exemplifies one of the most fundamental differences \nI have with this Administration when it comes to either health care \npolicy or the proper role of the Federal government in general. This \nabsurd policy is simply another example of big government run amok, and \nit's time to put a stop to it. The Senate should pass the Medicare \nBeneficiary Freedom to Contract Act now.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the issue of private contracting in the \nMedicare program is very important to my constituents in Iowa. I have \nreceived hundreds of letters asking Congress to repeal the provisions \nin the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requiring physicians who enter into \na private contract with beneficiaries to opt out of the Medicare \nprogram for two years. Seniors in my state believe it is not the role \nof the federal government to interfere with relationship with their \nphysician. They want to have as many choices and options as possible. I \nwant to make sure their freedom is protected. That is why I want to \nthank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth, for recognizing the importance of this \nissue to our nation's seniors and for agreeing to address this problem \nnext Congress. I want to offer my support to help with these efforts as \na cosponsor of Senator Kyl's legislation and as the Chairman of the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging and senior member of the Senate \nFinance Committee.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleague from \nDelaware, Mr. Roth, for his commitment to look further into the issue \nof medicare private contracting and to thank the honorable Senator from \nArizona, Mr. Kyl, for his leadership as the sponsor of S. 1194, the \nMedicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act. As one of 48 cosponsors \nof Mr. Kyl's bill, I believe that we need to take steps to maximize \nchoice, access and care for Medicare\n\n[[Page S11896]]\n\npatients, not restrict them in the name of patient protection. I have \nbeen contacted by hundreds of seniors from my state who understandably \nexpressed outrage that Congress had passed a law that will inevitably \nrestrict access to health care from the provider of their choice even \nwhen they are willing to pay for the care out of their own pocket. We \nhave been told that this provision was included in the Balanced Budget \nAct as a protection for Medicare patients. However, I believe we can \nprotect Medicare patients from fraud and abuse without restricting \ntheir access to desired care.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, once again, for their \ncommitment and leadership and I look forward to working with them in \nthe near future to address this important issue.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I, too, rise in support of S. 1194, the \nMedicare Beneficiaries Freedom to Contract Act.\n  You and I, Mr. President, and all other Americans not covered under \nMedicare, may obtain health services without informing the federal \ngovernment. However, our nation's senior citizens must first seek out \nWashington's approval--even when they prefer to pay for those services \nout of their own pocket.\n  Congress intended to correct this situation by permitting private \ncontracts. Unfortunately, the President insisted he would veto the \nentire 1997 Balanced Budget Act unless this fundamental right of all \nAmericans was eliminated or severely limited for senior citizens.\n  Medicare beneficiaries should have the same freedom to obtain the \nhealth care they choose from the physician or provider of their \nchoice--as do Members of Congress and virtually all other Americans. \nIt's ridiculous that this right was taken away and unfortunate that \nit's taken so long to correct.\n  Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and Senate \nFinance Committee Chairman Roth for acknowledging the importance of \nthis issue and for pledging to look into it further next year in the \n106th Congress.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished friend, Senator \nKyl, for introducing S. 1194--the Medicare Beneficiary Freedom to \nContract Act and for his leadership on this issue.\n  I firmly believe it is my obligation, as an elected member of the \nUnited States Senate, to defend the liberty of the constituents that \nput me in office. Freedom manifests itself in various ways, but one \nfundamental concept of importance in America is the protection of one's \ndiscretion over one's financial resources. I often raise this issue in \nthe context of taxes, but in addition to allowing one to reap what one \nsows, it is equally important that people have the ability to spend \ntheir earnings as they see fit.\n  I want to be perfectly clear what I think the essence is of what we \nare discussing when the issue of Medicare private contracting arises. \nWe are talking about allowing people to spend their money as they see \nfit. This is a very simple, yet important, freedom that people enjoy. \nWe are not talking about letting people buy illegal products, but \nrather about the right of people to spend their money on health care. \nOnly in Washington DC could such a notion be considered controversial. \nBut to those who have little regard for individual freedom, and who \nhave a vested interest in seeing the scope and power of government \ngrow, this is a controversial matter.\n  H.L. Menken once said that ``the most dangerous man, to any \ngovernment, is the man who is able to think things out for himself.'' \nThat is the threat, Mr. President. Those that favor the Medicare \nmonopoly, often even to the detriment of Medicare beneficiaries, resist \nthe freedom of people to make these private decisions, because it \nthreatens the government's control of health care delivery.\n  Unfortunately the era of big government is not over. In fact, it is \nalive and well and is embodied in Section 4507 of last year's Balanced \nBudget Act. Therefore, I want to request that Majority Leader Lott and \nFinance Committee Chairman Roth help us attach S. 1194 to the first \nappropriate legislative vehicle, so that we can repeal Section 4507. \nMr. President, we must restore the right of our elderly to buy the \nhealth care they feel they need, without any ``big government'' \nconstraints on their decisions. This effort is important not only to \nour ensuring quality health care to our elderly, but also to the larger \nbattle of defending freedom in America.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, \nand Finance Committee chairman, Senator Roth, for recognizing the \nproblem of many seniors who are not afforded choice in determining \nwhere they get their health care and on agreeing to address this \nproblem in the 106th Congress.\n  I also thank Senators Hollings, Roth, Gorton, Craig, Nickles, Allard, \nMack, Grassley, Bennett, Inhofe and Shelby for participating with \nstatements for the Record. We do intend to address this problem in the \nnext session of the Congress because we could not get it done this \nsession. I appreciate my colleagues' commitment to doing that and, \nagain, thank the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11892-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11896-S11900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wish to continue a series of remarks \nthat I have placed before the Senate in the past several weeks \nregarding the increasing problems relating to Kosovo. Together, with \nother Senators, I have tried to avail myself of every opportunity to \nlearn about this situation. Just weeks ago, I made a trip myself into \nthe region, accompanied by two outstanding ambassadors, Miles and Hill, \nand had an opportunity to get firsthand impressions. My trip included \nBosnia, Belgrade, Macedonia, and Kosovo.\n  Those impressions, together with many years of really hard work \nstudying the Balkan region, having first gone, in September 1992, into \nSarajevo, I have even greater concern today about the implications of \nthe problems unfolding in Kosovo and the necessity for the world to \nrespond to stop the tragic killing that is taking place every day.\n  I commend the majority leader--indeed, I am sure there are others who \nhave worked diligently on this--but he has, in this busiest of all \nweeks of the year in the Senate, found time to convene in his office \nand otherwise meet with people--and I have joined him on several \noccasions--about this situation. Indeed, a few days ago a group of us \nsent a letter to the President of the United States expressing our \nconcerns. This was a letter that followed the briefing by the \nSecretaries of State and Defense, with the National Security Adviser \nand the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.\n  Mr. President, I will address particular parts of that letter to the \nPresident and his response. The response was quite comprehensive.\n  Further today, I, and I am sure other Members of the Senate, have \nreceived drafts of proposed resolutions put forth by a Member on that \nside of the aisle and a Member on this side of the aisle. Given that \nthey are drafts, and I don't know what the ultimate intention of the \ndrafters will be, I will not identify the persons who distributed the \ndrafts as a senatorial courtesy, but I would like to address my \nconcerns relevant to both drafts.\n  The purpose today is, again, to give my personal views regarding the \nplan of operation that has been laid before us publicly by this \nadministration, by the NATO commanders and, indeed, by one or more of \nour allies, notably Great Britain.\n  I commend their Minister for National Security and Defense. He has \nspoken most forthrightly. Indeed, I think his views closely match my \nown, and that is, any planning to go forward to correct the problems \nthat exist in Kosovo today has to be, in my judgment, and in his, \ntwofold--ground as well as air.\n  One, a very decisive series of airstrikes, which I support. I \nbelieve, and others believe, that a necessary second component of any \nmilitary action, to back up the airstrikes, has to be the quick \nplacement of a stabilization ground force into Kosovo, into the region, \nprimarily the capital, Pristina. If that is not done, Mr. President, \nthe goals of the airstrikes can not have been fulfilled in my opinion.\n  In my judgment, the predominant number of military units involved in \nthat airstrike would be American, because of our specialized aircraft \nand air-to-ground precision ordinance. Our\n\n[[Page S11897]]\n\nAllies in NATO will provide other important air assets. I think in \norder to consolidate the gains that we can anticipate from those air \nstrikes, a stabilization force has to be put in place on the ground.\n  The main urgency of the moment--is some approximately quarter of a \nmillion Kosovars, Albanians who have been driven from their homes and \nvillages into the hills who are confronting now another enemy. Once it \nwas the Milosevic police, the Milosevic regular army, but now it is \nweather that is forcing these tragic people to endure conditions which \nwill be severely injurious to their health and safety.\n  Food, medicine, and shelter must be brought in beginning immediately, \nto alleviate that crisis. And secondly, we want to have a cessation to \nthe conflicts that have gone on between these peoples for these many \nmonths which have resulted in some 2,000-plus deaths, largely again \nsuffered by the Albanians, the 90 percent of the population. But, \nindeed, there are incidents where the KLA, the insurgent forces within \nthe Albanian population, have got to answer, themselves, for their \nresponsibility for certain tragic killings of Serbs in this area. There \nare not clean hands on either side.\n\n  But again, to summarize the objectives: Get immediate relief in for \nthese refugees; and, secondly, stabilize the fighting among the \nminority Serbians and the majority Albanians.\n  If that is not done, if that stabilization force is not quickly put \nin, this situation could even escalate in terms of the killing, because \nyou will have removed that military force, i.e., the Serbian \nparamilitary police, and indeed the regular army, and the remnants that \nwill be left of the Serbian people, such police that are left, will \nthen be faced with the preponderance of a 90 percent ethnic Albanian \npopulation coming down out of the hills. And I doubt that they will \ncome down and shake hands with their former Serbian neighbors--finding \ntheir homes ravaged, destroyed, their livestock killed, their fields \nburned. It will not be, Mr. President, a very peaceful setting once the \nair seals off the flow of heavy armaments and military down from \nBelgrade.\n  Mr. President, herein is the problem as I see it. Our administration, \nregrettably--and I will refer to their letter momentarily--regrettably, \nhas evaded, in my judgment, a full debate on the issue of the need for \na stabilization force. They have focused the public attention in our \ncountry solely on the need for an airstrike, leaving out what I think \nshould be responsible dialogue, beginning with the President and the \nSecretaries of State and Defense, on the need for a stabilization \nforce.\n  Yesterday, I met with a senior officer from NATO, together with other \nSenators, and he clearly understood the necessity for that \nstabilization force. Indeed, I happen to know firsthand NATO has \nstudied the need for it. NATO has contingency plans to address that. \nThe plans range all the way from taking the indigenous KDOM, which is a \nvery interesting creation in this conflict--it is a combination of \nmilitary people from the United States, Canada, and certain other \nEuropean nations, and indeed I think some Russians, together with \ndiplomatic officials from those nations who go out into this region, \nunarmed, for the purpose of reporting back on what is taking place in \nterms of the ravaging of the countryside, the condition of those who \nhave been driven into the hills. And it has been a very valuable source \nof information for the free world to have had the reports of KDOM. I \ntraveled with them; they are a brave lot.\n  One option is to enlarge the KDOM. But again, KDOM is not there for \nmilitary purposes. They are not trained as policemen. They are not \ntrained as security forces. The individual military officers may have \nsome training, but certainly by design and in terms of the logistic \nequipment, and the like, they are not prepared, in my judgment, to take \non the potential parameters of conflicts that could break out following \nair strikes.\n  Next it is thought that one or more organizations, like the O.S.C.E. \nin Europe, could come in and take over this situation to provide a \nstabilizing force. But that organization has no history. It has no \nhistory of taking on an operation of this magnitude. It has no \nlogistical support. It has no experience in coordinating, bringing in \ntroops from other countries.\n  And so after dialogue with our guests yesterday, and dialogue with \nmany others, it is my judgment that only NATO can provide such \nstabilization force as will be necessary in the immediate aftermath of \na series of airstrikes--I repeat that--only NATO. I believe it unwise \nfor the Administration now to rule out U.S. ground forces as being a \npart of a stabilization force composed of several NATO members.\n  When we had the Secretary of Defense before the Armed Services \nCommittee the other day, regrettably, he did not respond with the \nprecision I would have liked regarding U.S. participation. Indeed, I \nthink the record reflects statements to the effect that there will be \nno U.S. participation should a ground element for stabilization be \nnecessary.\n  Mr. President, I do not think that we should embark--I want to repeat \nthat--I do not think we should embark on these airstrikes without a \nresolution of how that stabilization force is to be constituted and \nwhether or not the United States will be a part of that force, because \nwe will have started a situation of hitting a sovereign country. We \nhave done that twice already here in the past month or two--hitting a \nsovereign nation with predominantly U.S. air assets--with really no \nclear understanding of what is going to take place immediately \nafterwards on the ground in Kosovo.\n  We talk about a peace settlement. All of us would like to have a \npeace settlement, but I cannot believe that if you inflict severe air \ndamage of the magnitude it will take to bring Milosevic, the principal \nwrongdoer in this whole situation--the principal wrongdoer for years \nand years, beginning back in Bosnia --you cannot suddenly expect him to \ncome to the negotiating table in a matter of days. And it is within \nthose days that the instability could grow in the Kosovo region. That \nis my concern.\n  This instability could spread over into Albania, which is already \ntorn by civil strife. Refugees could begin to flow into Montenegro. \nMontenegro is now burdened, heavily burdened, with refugees from \nAlbania. More refugees into Macedonia. This whole region could be \ndestabilized unless a stabilization force is put into Kosovo in a \ntimely way.\n  And further, in my judgment, the work that we have done, together \nwith our allies over many years, to secure Bosnia, to the extent we \nachieved any results there--certainly relative peace compared to the \nwar of several years ago--that could well be undermined, because if the \ninsurgents down in Kosovo are not contained, that will spread into \nBosnia and begin to undo what we have achieved, what little we have \nachieved thus far, toward the implementation of the Dayton accords.\n  So my purpose in addressing Kosovo, again, is twofold. These \nresolutions in draft form call for only U.S. participation in \nairstrikes. I mean, it is very clearly laid out in both these \nresolutions. One of them states that: Whereas the Secretary of Defense, \nWilliam Cohen, opposes the deployment of ground forces in Kosovo, as \nreflected in his testimony before Congress on October 6, and clearly \nsays that while we support the use of air, it will be air, and air \nalone.\n  That I think is an unwise position for the U.S. to take.\n  Let me give you an example. Should it be the consensus of NATO that \nyou have to bring a NATO ground force into Kosovo for stabilization, \nwhich is my judgment, and you plant the NATO flag, and the U.S. flag is \nnot on the staff, we are not represented there, the question arises \nwhy? I mean, we bring into question, who is the commander in chief of \nNATO? It is an American officer. An American officer is to command of a \nstabilization force put into a hostile region, and there is not a \nsingle additional American there in that force! We should not take that \nposition now.\n  I fought for many years placing the ground troops in Bosnia. Year \nafter year I voted against it. It was only on the last vote where I \njoined Senator Dole that I relented. I had no desire to see Americans \ngo in there. I questioned, in some way, the vital security interests. \nBut that s history; we are on the ground in Bosnia and our troops, with \nother SFOR elements are working\n\n[[Page S11898]]\n\nto secure a lasting peace. NATO's credibility is on the line now in \nKosovo, for only a credible threat to use force can move settlement \ntalks in Belgrade.\n  If NATO leaders, upon failure of diplomacy, launch a NATO air \noperation, the credibility of NATO is on the line.\n  I think you should not start the air until we have fully answered the \nquestion: How do you secure the benefits flowing from the air operation \nand stabilize that region until the negotiators can come to the table \nand work out a cease fire.\n  The other resolution being circulated today, likewise, calls solely \nfor air, very explicitly. It has another provision in here which \ntroubles me a great deal; that is, you can only use air for 6 months \nunless there is further consideration by the Congress.\n  Mr. President, we have known for a long time that setting deadlines \nwith regard to troops just does not work. Therefore, the placing of a \ndeadline in connection with the use of air and limiting it to 6 months, \nto me, is not a wise way to proceed. Therefore, I have indicated I \nwould not participate; indeed, I would vote against either of these \nresolutions should they come back in this form. Both resolutions limit \nthe U.S. participation to air. The President is authorized to use the \nU.S. Armed Forces for the purpose only of conducting air operations and \nmissile strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.\n  Again, you cannot plan an air operation without a concomitant means \nto secure the ground.\n  Let me pose the hypothetical: Suppose you strike with air and you are \nsuccessful in destroying certain targets, then is Milosevic likely to \nsit there and do nothing? He could counterattack. His only means of \ncounterattack, in all probability, given his air capability is largely \ndestroyed, his naval capability is hopefully bottled up in the caves or \nelsewhere, his only avenue to retaliate would be on the ground; \nperhaps, once again, send out his column of tanks and his column of \nheavy artillery. Bad weather and darkness of night travel could inhibit \nair operations.\n  Air could interdict, I am sure, much of it, but it might require a \nground force at some point to interdict such actions as may be taken in \nretaliation by Milosevic.\n  I urge the Senate to be very, very cautious as we proceed. I hope to \ncontinue our debate with other Senators here as it relates to this \nsituation.\n  I turn to the response of the President. As I said, it contained \nspecific responses. This is the President speaking. On page 4 he \nstates:\n\n       Second, on the question of ground force, although NATO \n     planners reviewed a broad range of options, some of which \n     would involve grounding forces and hostile circumstances. I \n     can assure you [this is written to all nine of us] the United \n     States would not support these options and there is currently \n     no sentiment in NATO for such a mission. The mission under \n     consideration involves the use of graduated air power, not \n     military forces on the ground.\n\n  Now, to me, that is just faulty planning.\n  I do support the use of force to stop the killing, to enable the NGOs \nand others to have an environment into which they can bring supplies to \nhelp these people. I do not give my support unless a convincing \nargument is put forth about a stabilizing force and the need to have \nthat force in order to secure the Kosovo region.\n  We have to be very careful that the credibility of NATO is protected. \nIt is on the line. We cannot allow the NATO force to be considered as \nacting in concert with the KLA. That is a tough call. Try and find a \nKLA leader. They are difficult to find. I am not talking about Rugova \nin Pristina. He has been accessible to all. These militants, the heads \nof the KLA troops, in this area of Kosovo are not well defined, not \nwell known, and not well coordinated. It is a problem to contain them \nonce we begin to use our air. We cannot seem to be coming in here with \na military hand to support Kosovo gaining independence from the Federal \nRepublic of Yugoslavia. That is not our goal.\n  Again, only a ground force containing this situation in Kosovo, until \nsuch time as a settlement can be worked out at the table, is the only \nway, in my judgment, that this matter can be resolved.\n  I hope other Senators will come forward and give their views because \nthis could break in military action any day now. I don't predict in any \nway when the strike may begin. Hopefully, diplomatic efforts, which are \nstill ongoing, can prevent the necessity of the use of force. It is \nonly that credible determination to use force, as perceived in \nBelgrade, that will bring about successful diplomatic negotiations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter to the \nPresident and his response to the majority leader, which I referred to \nearlier, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follos:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                Office of the Majority Leader,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 1998.\n     Hon. William Jefferson Clinton,\n     The White House, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to express our concerns \n     about your Administration's policy toward Kosovo. Since the \n     Serbian military offensive began in Kosovo more than seven \n     months ago, senior Administration officials have repeatedly \n     stated that Serbian actions would not be tolerated. For \n     example, in March 1998, Secretary of State Albright stated, \n     ``We are not going to stand by and watch the Serbian \n     authorities do in Kosovo what they can no longer get away \n     with in Bosnia.'' The same month, your Special Representative \n     threatened ``the most dire consequences imaginable'' in \n     response to Serbian offensives. Since these statements, many \n     of us indicated we would support military action to halt \n     Serbian ethnic cleansing. However, it is now more difficult \n     for us to have confidence that military action accomplish the \n     stated goals. U.S. credibility has suffered great damage \n     because U.S. threats have not been carried out. Milosevic has \n     had the luxury of time to accomplish his goals in Kosovo.\n       We listened carefully as your senior national security \n     officials briefed Senators yesterday. Clearly, we recognize \n     the stakes involved in Kosovo, including the danger the \n     conflict will spread to neighboring countries, the importance \n     for our credibility and for that of the NATO alliance, and \n     the ongoing human tragedy created by months of ruthless \n     attacks by Serbian forces. We also recognize the seriousness \n     of the action you are contemplating. It means, as Senator \n     Lugar stated yesterday, going to war with an attack on a \n     sovereign country. We do not believe you have taken the \n     necessary steps to prepare the Congress and the American \n     people for such a weightily decision. In fact you have not \n     even asked the Congress to authorize the use of military \n     force.\n       We are troubled by a number of aspects of the plans and \n     policies contemplated by your Administration.\n       First, we cannot support military operations by U.S. Armed \n     Forces in Kosovo unless and until you commit to request a \n     significant increase in the defense budget to address the \n     shortfalls in military readiness, personnel and modernization \n     recently acknowledged by the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The \n     crisis in military readiness that has only belatedly been \n     acknowledged by your Administration is grave. To support \n     ongoing operations around the world, our men and women in \n     uniform are deployed away from their homes and families for \n     unprecedented lengths of time during peacetime. Morale among \n     the troops is suffering, and recruiting and retention \n     statistics are dangerously low. Modernization of the force is \n     seriously underfunded across the services. Training in many \n     of the combatant commands must halt well before the end of \n     the fiscal year due to funding and supply shortages. Nearly \n     12,000 military families rely on food stamps. Failing to \n     provide additional funding for a potentially costly military \n     operation in Kosovo, while U.S. forces are about to complete \n     three years in Bosnia at a cost of nearly $10 billion, will \n     severely and perhaps irreparably exacerbate this critical \n     readiness crisis.\n       Second, the issue of potential deployment of U.S. ground \n     forces was not adequately addressed in yesterday's briefing. \n     Press accounts report that detailed plans for nearly 50,000 \n     ground troops in Kosovo have been developed. Yet Secretary of \n     Defense Cohen stated that there has been no discussion of \n     deploying U.S. ground forces in Kosovo. We believe that a \n     ground force in Kosovo, which could be a likely follow-on to \n     airstrikes, should be European, not American.\n       Third, we are concerned about the proposed use of NATO \n     airpower. Press reports contain information about U.S. \n     targeting plans that was not discussed in the briefing. To \n     the extent we understand the proposed strikes, they appear to \n     envision gradual and incremental measures. General Ralston \n     discussed a ``limited option'' that may or may not achieve \n     its stated objectives. A more ``robust'' option is under \n     consideration but apparently has not yet been finalized. We \n     believe any air attack should be sustained and overwhelming. \n     Air attacks should be designed to decimate Milosevic's forces \n     in Kosovo and in Serbia--in order to permanently end his \n     ability to perpetuate the conflict in Kosovo.\n       Finally and most importantly, we are concerned that U.S. \n     policy is not based on a coherent and convincing plan and \n     neither protects our interests nor recognizes the danger of \n     becoming involved in another open-ended\n\n[[Page S11899]]\n\n     military commitment in the Balkans. Your policy seems to \n     recognize that Milosevic is the problem but also proposes to \n     make him part of the solution. By so doing, your policy helps \n     to perpetuate his hold on power, your Administration has yet \n     to formulate a policy for replacing Milosevic with a \n     democratic government.\n       Yesterday, your officials stated that the credible threat \n     of force was necessary to induce Milosevic to negotiate \n     seriously. Yet in June, Secretary of State Albright stated, \n     ``The issue here is that we want a diplomatic solution. And I \n     don't want to threaten strikes when what I'm trying to do is \n     get a diplomatic solution.'' This is a disturbing and \n     confusing inconsistency. A central question involves \n     subsequent actions if any use of military force is not \n     immediately successful in accomplishing its stated objective. \n     If Milosevic does not accept U.S. or NATO demands either \n     before or after the employment of military force, what is our \n     next step? It is not sufficient to state, as Secretary of \n     Defense Cohen did yesterday, that you have not reached that \n     decision point.\n       Your policy apparently envisions a status of limited \n     autonomy for Kosovo, a status that both parties have shed \n     blood to reject. Independence has been the choice of the \n     majority of inhabitants in Kosovo. Serb assaults since \n     February have served to increase this sentiment. Your policy \n     currently opposes independence for Kosovo but we are \n     concerned that you do not have an achievable program to \n     implement your policy.\n       Mr. President, we believe in bipartisanship in foreign \n     policy. We will not support any plan that requires American \n     military personnel alone to bear the burden of the sacrifice \n     and risk involved. To the contrary, we expect other members \n     of NATO and their military personnel to share the sacrifice \n     and risk. We stand ready to work with you and your officials \n     to protect American interests in southeastern Europe.\n           Sincerely,\n         Strom Thurmond, Chuck Hagel, Pete V. Domenici, Ted \n           Stevens, Don Nickles, Trent Lott, John Warner, Richard \n           G. Lugar, Jesse Helms.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 6, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n       Dear Mr. Leader: Thank you for your letter about Kosovo. \n     You have raised a number of critical issues. Before \n     addressing your specific concerns, I believe it is \n     appropriate to lead-off by describing our overall approach \n     and the vital interests at stake.\n       We are entering a crucial period regarding the crisis in \n     Kosovo. Serb repression and violence, clear evidence of \n     atrocities, the uncertain fate of more than 250,000 displaced \n     persons and the approach of winter have coalesced an \n     international consensus behind U.S. efforts to resolve the \n     conflict. In United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199, \n     adopted on September 23, 1998, the international community \n     reaffirmed in clear terms what steps Milosevic must take:\n       Immediately cease offensive operations;\n       Withdraw security forces;\n       Allow full access to international monitors and relief \n     agencies; and\n       Negotiate a settlement with the Kosovar Albanians.\n       Since, as of now, Milosevic has not complied with these \n     requirements, we and our NATO allies will soon consider the \n     potential use of force. I want to provide you and others in \n     the Congress our full thinking and strategy on this issue.\n       As your letter recognizes, the crisis in Kosovo began when \n     Serbian special police launched an offensive against the \n     Kosovo insurgents in February of this year. In the seven \n     months that have followed, Serbian military and police have \n     steadily escalated their systematic campaign of violence and \n     expulsions designed to terrorize the local populations and \n     suppress armed insurgent groups. The roots of the current \n     crisis can be traced back to 1989, when Slobodan Milosevic \n     revoked the autonomous status that Kosovo had enjoyed since \n     1974. My Administration has long pressed Belgrade to restore \n     the rights and freedoms of the Kosovar Albanians, making \n     clear that this was a prerequisite to Serbia's reintegration \n     into the international community. However, Belgrade resisted \n     our support for building an effective dialogue with the \n     Kosovars, instead escalating the fighting by targeting \n     civilians with increasing brutality.\n       Over the past several months, we have endeavored to contain \n     and ultimately resolve the conflict through extensive \n     humanitarian and diplomatic efforts. On the humanitarian \n     track, we have committed more than $45 million in emergency \n     relief funds and other types of assistance and we have urged \n     the UNHCR and other international agencies and donors to do \n     the same. On the diplomatic front, Ambassador Chris Hill has \n     had some success, pulling together a Kosovar Albanaian \n     negotiating team under Ibrahim Rugova and obtaining \n     Milosevic's acknowledgment of an ``interim'' agreement that \n     would allow for self-government. Ambassador Hill has also \n     worked with Contact Group countries to develop the text of a \n     settlement that they now have endorsed. This settlement would \n     allow the people of Kosovo to administer their own local \n     affairs, including education, justice and a separate police \n     force, while protecting the human rights and cultural sites \n     of all ethnic groups, including the small Serb minority. It \n     would do so while preserving the FRY's territorial integrity, \n     we believe that an independent Kosovo could not survive as a \n     viable state. Moreover, independence would send entirely the \n     wrong signal to those in the region calling for a ``greater \n     Albania,'' and to minorities elsewhere in Europe, leading to \n     greater instability. However, our humanitarian and diplomatic \n     efforts have been thwarted by the tactics of Milosevic's \n     security forces.\n       In recent days, the intensifying threat of NATO military \n     action has caused Milosevic to throttle back the operations \n     of his security forces; some withdrawals have begun to occur. \n     However, he has not done enough to come into full compliance \n     with UNSC Resolution 1199. We cannot accept hollow promises \n     or half steps that leave open the prospect of renewed \n     hostilities in the coming weeks, or after this winter.\n       It is important to focus on U.S. national interests that \n     are at stake here.\n       First, Kosovo is a tinderbox that could ignite a wider \n     European war with dangerous consequences for the United \n     States. Throughout Balkan history, ethnic conflicts often \n     have been used for political manipulation. The violence \n     directed against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo already has \n     exacerbated political tensions and civil disorder in \n     neighboring Albania. Continuation of the fighting in Kosovo \n     likely would trigger further refugee flows into Albania \n     and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, with \n     dangerously destabilizing consequences. Wider instability \n     and refugee flows further south would threaten the \n     differing regional interests of NATO allies Greece and \n     Turkey, exacerbating tensions in the Aegean. The \n     radicalization of ethnic Albanians also could support \n     radical Islamic fundamentalist efforts to establish a \n     foothold in southeastern Europe, potentially creating new \n     sources of instability and increasing the threat of \n     terrorism to us and our allies in Europe.\n       Second, we are faced with a major humanitarian and human \n     rights crisis that could soon become a catastrophe. \n     Yesterday, the United Nations Secretary General's report on \n     the crisis condemned the wanton killing and destruction \n     perpetrated by security forces in Kosovo. These forces have \n     destroyed at least one quarter of the homes in over 200 \n     villages. They have committed atrocities, including the \n     mutilation and execution of senior citizens, women and \n     children. We must act to prevent widespread deaths with the \n     onset of winter, to prevent further atrocities and to \n     demonstrate that the international community will not \n     tolerate such acts.\n       Third, it is important to sustain NATO's credibility as the \n     principal peace and security instrument in Europe. Just as \n     NATO's effective response in Bosnia has had a stabilizing \n     influence throughout Europe, so too will NATO's efficacy in \n     responding to Kosovo help achieve our long-term goals for \n     Europe. Moreover, as the situation in Kosovo has \n     deteriorated, the credibility of U.S. warnings to Milosevic \n     first issued by President Bush in 1992, and reaffirmed by me, \n     also are challenged.\n       We prefer to advance each of these interests through \n     diplomacy that leads to a peaceful and principled settlement, \n     as our negotiating efforts have sought to accomplish. But \n     largely as a result of Milosevic's assault, those negotiating \n     efforts are impossible to pursue under these circumstances. I \n     believe the credible threat, and therefore the willingness to \n     use force, has become necessary. It now appears that our NATO \n     allies share this view.\n       I will now turn to the four specific issues raised in your \n     letter.\n       First, I too am concerned about military readiness, as I \n     discussed at length with the Chiefs and CINCs recently. As \n     noted in my letters to Congress and Secretary Cohen, we have \n     moved promptly to address these concerns, building on efforts \n     initiated by my Administration over the past several months \n     to support military operations. For example, in FY 1998 we \n     worked with Congress to secure a $1 billion reprogramming \n     that reallocated funds to readiness programs and a $1.85 \n     billion emergency funding package to cover the unanticipated \n     costs of the Bosnia and Southwest Asia contingencies. For FY \n     1999, I have proposed a $1.9 billion emergency funding \n     measure to cover the continuing costs of our Bosnia \n     deployment. To preclude serious readiness problems in FY \n     1999, I again urge Congress to approve this measure.\n       In addition to these actions, I committed my Administration \n     to work with Congress to provide adequate resources for \n     readiness and other defense programs in FY 1999 and beyond. \n     For the short term, I proposed that members of my \n     Administration work with you prior to the Congressional \n     adjournment to craft a $1 billion supplemental package that \n     will augment FY 1999 funding for key readiness programs. For \n     the longer term, the Office of Management and Budget and the \n     National Security Council have been instructed to work with \n     Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs to develop a multi-year \n     plan that provides the resources necessary to preserve \n     military readiness, support our troops, and modernize aging \n     weapons systems. This plan will be incorporated in my FY 2000 \n     defense budget request to Congress. As I wrote you last \n     month, the men and women of our armed forces will have the \n     resources they need to do their job.\n       The cost of potential military operations in Kosovo would \n     be a function of the scope and intensity of such operations. \n     My Administration will work with the Congress to ensure \n     timely passage of appropriate funding measures and that this \n     does not come at the expense of our defense program.\n\n[[Page S11900]]\n\n       Second, on the question of ground forces, although NATO \n     planners have reviewed a broad range of options, some of \n     which would involve ground forces in hostile circumstances, I \n     can assure you the United States would not support these \n     options and there currently is no sentiment in NATO for such \n     a mission. The mission under consideration involves the use \n     of graduated air power, not military forces on the ground.\n       In the event that Milosevic agrees to comply with UNSCR \n     1199, and if there is a subsequent political settlement, some \n     form of international presence may be needed. Whether this \n     can be done entirely by international civilian personnel and \n     whether Americans should participate are matters we will need \n     to consider in the context of any such agreement and with \n     full consultations with the Congress.\n       Third, regarding the nature of the air campaign in Kosovo, \n     NATO has developed a clear military plan. It entails the \n     graduated but effective use of air power harnessed to two \n     achievable objectives. The primary objective is by threat of \n     force, or its use, to persuade Milosevic to comply with the \n     demands of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199. \n     If initial use of air power does not result in compliance, \n     NATO's secondary objective is to strike Belgrade's military \n     capabilities in ways that will damage his ability to conduct \n     repressive operations in Kosovo, the same objective you \n     identify in your letter.\n       Let me assure you that NATO planning provides for air power \n     to be used effectively. There will be no ``pin prick'' \n     strikes. Even the initial use of air power will send a very \n     clear signal of our ability to disrupt operations by the FRY \n     military and special police, and follow-on phases will \n     progressively expand in their scale and scope. These \n     operations are planned to involve virtually all NATO allies.\n       Finally, regarding your desire for a clear policy linked to \n     our national interests and a defined end-state, NATO air \n     power will be used as part of a broader political strategy to \n     advance our overall objectives of promoting a political \n     settlement and averting a humanitarian catastrophe. We are \n     not replacing diplomacy with military force; rather we are \n     combining the two to achieve our objectives. Secretary \n     Albright recently dispatched Ambassador Holbrooke to the \n     region to make crystal clear to Milosevic what steps he needs \n     under UNSC 1199 to take to avoid NATO air strikes. Even if \n     Milosevic gives NATO no choice but to execute air strikes, we \n     will use them in a way designed to help bring an end to \n     Serbian operations in Kosovo, voluntarily or involuntarily.\n       Our desired end-state in Kosovo is clear, comprising three \n     parts. Our immediate objective is to achieve full compliance \n     with UN Security Council resolution 1199, thus reducing the \n     risk of wider conflict, averting a humanitarian catastrophe \n     and lessening the chance of further atrocities. Our mid-term \n     objective is to secure a political settlement that grants \n     broad autonomy to the Kosovars, while keeping Kosovo within \n     the FRY. In particular, the agreement should ensure that the \n     Kosovars have their own bodies of government and police. Our \n     longer-term objective is a FRY that is democratic and on the \n     path to European integration. This requires a responsible \n     government that is accountable to its own citizens, of all \n     ethnic backgrounds, and that carries out its obligations \n     abroad, including in Bosnia. In this regard, we continue to \n     support opposition parties and free and independent media in \n     the FRY. Further efforts in these areas are an important part \n     of our broader strategy.\n       The United Nations, the Contact Group, NATO and my \n     Administration all agree that Milosevic bears primary \n     responsibility for the current situation including the brutal \n     tactics of his security forces. Not only has he displaced a \n     quarter million of his own citizens, but he has also \n     suppressed the human rights of all citizens of the FRY and \n     forced them to bear the burden of the current conflict, of UN \n     economic sanctions and of isolation from the rest of Europe.\n       While Milosevic bears primary responsibility for the \n     current crisis, there are others whose actions could prolong \n     and exacerbate it. I am referring in particular to the \n     various armed insurgent groups in Kosovo, including the \n     Kosovar Liberation Army, or UCK. Ambassador Holbrooke this \n     week delivered a firm message to these groups to cooperate in \n     bringing about a peaceful solution. Armed reprisals against \n     Serb civilians, or the continued pursuit of independence by \n     military means, will only shatter a cease-fire and the hopes \n     of attaining a political settlement that gives Kosovo true \n     autonomy. We have told them that failure to cooperate will \n     cause us to reassess our operations against the Serbs.\n       Larry Eagleburger, our former ambassador to Yugoslavia, \n     once said that the war in Yugoslavia began in Kosovo and will \n     ultimately end there. His prediction was correct. Our job is \n     to bring that war to an end, to keep it from destabilizing \n     the region and to avert a humanitarian catastrophe. I \n     appreciate your willingness to work with the Administration \n     to protect American interests in southeastern Europe. We will \n     continue to consult closely with you in the critical days and \n     weeks ahead.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11896-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11900-S11901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL T. JOSEPH LOPEZ ON THE OCCASION OF HIS RETIREMENT\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Admiral Joe \nLopez on the occasion of his Change of Command as Commander of Allied \nForces, Southern Europe and U.S. Naval Forces, Europe and his \nretirement from the United States Navy after 39 years of dedicated \nservice to the nation.\n  Joe Lopez joined the United States Navy to see the world--and see the \nworld he did. A native of Powellton, West Virginia, he enlisted in the \nNavy in September 1959. In 1964, he was commissioned an Ensign via the \nSeaman-to-Admiral Program and upon commissioning, he was assigned first \nto the U.S.S. Eugene A. Greene (DD 711) and then to the U.S.S. Lind (DD \n703). While onboard both of these destroyers, he saw action in Vietnam.\n  Admiral Lopez received his first command in September 1969, when he \nassumed the duties as Commander, River Assault Division 153, which \noperated in the Mekong Delta in Vietnam and as part of a counter-\noffensive into Cambodia in May 1970. Admiral Lopez was the only Navy \ncommanding officer to lead a river assault into Cambodia.\n  Following tours of duty at the Naval Postgraduate School, the Armed \nForces Staff College, and as Flag Secretary and Staff Officer for \nCommander, Cruiser-Destroyer Group Eight, Admiral Lopez served as the \nExecutive Officer onboard the U.S.S. Truett (FF 1095) from 1977 to \n1979. While he was XO, the Truett operated in the Mediterranean and Red \nSeas.\n  Admiral Lopez commanded the U.S.S. Stump (DD 978) from September 1982 \nto November 1984. As the CO of Stump he completed a Persian Gulf \ndeployment. Admiral Lopez' next command tour was as Commander, \nDestroyer Squadron 32, which deployed to the Mediterranean Sea. He \nfollowed his Squadron Commander assignment with duties as Executive \nAssistant to the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Manpower, \nPersonnel and Training and as Executive Assistant to the Vice Chief of \nNaval Operations.\n  Admiral Lopez was promoted to Rear Admiral in July 1989. He served as \nDefense Secretary Dick Cheney's senior military assistant from July \n1990 to July 1992 including during the Persian Gulf Conflict. From July \n1992 to December 1993, he commanded the United States Sixth Fleet and \nNATO's Striking and Support Forces, Southern Europe, homeported in \nGaeta, Italy.\n  For the next three years he served as the Navy's senior acquisition \nofficial, the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations for Resources, Warfare \nRequirements and Assessments. He led the Navy's transition to a force \nthat is able to operate effectively in the littorals. His \naccomplishments include helping to develop the next generation of \nnuclear-powered attack submarines, the recently named Virginia class of \nfast attack subs, which are being built jointly by Newport News \nShipbuilding and Electric Boat.\n  Admiral Lopez became Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Europe \nand Commander in Chief, Allied Forces, Southern Europe on 31 July 1996. \nAs CINC AFSOUTH, he commanded the Peace Implementation Forces (IFOR) in \nBosnia-Herzegovina from July 1996 to November 1996.\n  Tomorrow, at a ceremony at Headquarters AFSOUTH in Naples Italy, \nafter more than two years as the senior military commander in NATO's \nsouthern region, Admiral Lopez will relinquish command to Admiral James \nO. Ellis, Jr. The ceremony will also mark the retirement of Admiral Joe \nLopez after a 39-year Navy career.\n  Mr. President, Admiral Lopez has had a tremendous career and I wish \nto thank him for the superb job he has done as Commander in Chief of \nAllied Forces, Southern Europe and U.S. Naval Forces Europe. He \ndemonstrated outstanding leadership as commander of the NATO forces in \ncharge of enforcing the Dayton Peace Agreement. In my travels to that \nwar-torn region of the world I have come to know Admiral Lopez well. We \nhave traveled together on official business. On many occasions, I have \nvisited Joe and his wife Vivian at their quarters in Naples, and have \nsought the Admiral's counsel, especially on the volatile situations in \nthe Balkans. Admiral Joe Lopez is a man of vision and an astute \nrealist. I will continue to seek his counsel during his retirement.\n\n[[Page S11901]]\n\n  I congratulate Joe and Vivian Lopez upon the completion of their \nactive duty Navy career and thank them for their service to the \ncountry. And finally, I want to thank Admiral Lopez for his friendship \nand honest counsel over the years. Since the closing days of World War \nII, 1945, I have known and served with many sailors. I rank him at the \ntop, a ``4.0 seaman patriot.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11900-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11901-S11902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEVELOPMENTS IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank Senator Warner for speaking \nabout Kosovo. I am disappointed that the Senate has not brought a \nresolution to the floor and had a debate about what our response should \nbe as a Nation to what is happening in Kosovo. I think it is a profound \nmistake on our part not to have this discussion given the fact that we \nare going to adjourn within the next couple of days.\n  Mr. President, I want to be held accountable. I think we should all \nbe held accountable as to what our viewpoints are and what we think our \ncountry should or should not do.\n  Mr. President, while there have been some indications in recent days \nthat the slaughter of innocent civilians has slowed--at least \ntemporarily--we cannot afford to turn our attention away from the \nsituation there.\n  President Milosevic claims to have ordered some units of his army \nback to their barracks, but it is too early to tell exactly what these \nactions mean and whether Milosevic actually intends to cease his brutal \noffensive against the Albanian Kosovars. There is considerable evidence \nthat he may not be truly pulling back in accordance with Western \ndemands, but rather taking halfway measures that would allow his troops \nand tanks to return to the fighting almost immediately. UN Secretary \nGeneral Annan reported earlier this week that there is still a \nsignificant presence of Serb armed forces in Kosovo, and that some \nspecial police units are continuing punitive operations against the \nlocal population. I remain deeply skeptical about Milosevic's \nintentions.\n  We have had too much experience with Milosevic to take his statements \nat face value and to assume that the killing has really ended. We have \nseen his defiance of world opinion and international law for years. \nRecently we were all shocked by the horrific massacres of civilians--\nthe massacre of women, elderly men, even young children and infants. \nThese killings, attributed to Serb security forces, are an affront to \nthe international community.\n  Now it looks as if Milosevic may have ordered a partial withdrawal of \nhis attack forces, hoping to avoid imminent military action by NATO. He \nmay believe that if the killings stop for a time, the attention of NATO \nand the U.S. will turn elsewhere. We must not allow that to happen. We \nmust keep our focus on the crisis in Kosovo, and not become distracted \nby other issues.\n  Unless immediate action is taken to forestall a humanitarian tragedy, \nwe may soon see even more disturbing and gruesome pictures from Kosovo. \nWith an estimated 150,000 people in Kosovo living out in the open \nwithout any shelter and with winter approaching, international relief \nagencies now fear that tens of thousands of those displaced persons \ncould face severe hardship and some even death from exposure unless \nthey can return to their homes or be provided adequate shelter within \nthe next couple of weeks.\n  The situation on the ground in Kosovo is heartbreaking. According to \na report from a representative of the International Rescue Committee \nwho recently visited the Kosovo countryside, young children are \nwandering around in the hills barefoot or in ripped sandals. Extended \nfamilies of several generations are sleeping 15 to 20 to a tent. The \ntents are clear plastic supported only by bent saplings. Mothers are \ndesperate to return home. Even if their houses are burned they would \nrather sleep in tents in their own yards then in the inhospitable \nhills. But they are afraid to return home, because every time they try \nto return snipers shoot at them.\n  As the IRC report relates, these displaced Kosovars are trying to \nsurvive in areas where there is no food, no shelter, no schools for the \nchildren, no latrine system, and no other basic infrastructure. They \nhave only the clothes they were wearing when they fled in the summer. \nThe children have diarrhea from the dirty water and lack of sanitation. \nParents watch, worried, as their children vomit all night and become \ndehydrated. Soon they will also have to face snow and freezing cold.\n  These appalling conditions cannot continue. We must get aid to this \nterrorized population swiftly. But we can only get relief to them if \nMilosevic ceases his repression and allows relief agencies unfettered \naccess.\n  The Administration and our NATO allies must keep the pressure on \nMilosevic to put an end to Serb military action in Kosovo and to comply \nwith the demands of the UN Security Council resolution of September 23. \nThat resolution demands that both parties cease hostilities and \nmaintain a cease-fire. The resolution also calls on Belgrade to (1) \ncease all action by the security forces affecting the civilian \npopulation and order the withdrawal of security forces used for \ncivilian repression; (2) allow free access for international diplomatic \nmonitors in Kosovo and unimpeded access for humanitarian organizations \nand supplies to Kosovo and; (3) make rapid progress on a clear \ntimetable in conducting autonomy talks with the Kosovo Albanian \ncommunity.\n  I have also been encouraged that NATO has instructed its military \ncommanders to begin preparations for possible military action and that \nNATO members have informed NATO Command what forces and equipment they \nare prepared to supply for actions in the Kosovo region.\n  I have always been a Senator who insists that military actions abroad \nshould always be a last resort. I still hope and pray, as a Senator \nfrom Minnesota, that in this situation we will not have to resort to \nforce. I view it as a last option if we cannot resolve this situation \nby diplomatic means. But I also recognize that we cannot rule out the \nuse of force, including the use of air strikes, in this situation. If \nthe killing resumes or if Milosevic prevents relief from getting to the \ndisplaced Kosovars and fails to comply with the UN resolution and the \ndemands of the international community, we may have to resort to \nmilitary action.\n  I met with Milosevic once. I wanted to see firsthand the genocide of \nseveral years ago. He was the first and only person I have met that I \nwould not shake hands with. I don't think he can be believed, and I \nthink that we have to send him a forceful message.\n  To prepare for possible implementation of more forceful options \ndeveloped by NATO planners, we should continue to move forward now, \nunder NATO auspices, with pre-deployment in the region of appropriate \nlevels of NATO military equipment and forces. This would include such \nactions as pre-positioning aircraft and naval vessels, and deployment \nof necessary materiel to support NATO troops.\n  These moves would be intended to send another clear message to \nMilosevic that he must comply with the UN Security Council Resolution \nimmediately. If he does not respond we must be ready to take further \nsteps to force compliance as necessary.\n  At the same time, we need to take other actions to keep the pressure \non Milosevic. The U.S. should press forward on an intensified \nmultilateral effort, at the United Nations and through regional bodies \nlike the European Union, to firmly tighten the existing sanctions \nregime on Serbia, to re-impose other sanctions lifted after signing of \nthe Dayton Peace Accord, and to otherwise increase pressure on \nMilosevic to comply.\n  We must also accelerate U.S. and NATO logistical support for the \nongoing international humanitarian aid effort in Kosovo, including pre-\ndeployment of humanitarian supplies in Kosovo in anticipation of winter \ndistribution by non-governmental organizations, while ensuring the \nsafety and security of those who will rely on such aid.\n  There must be no repeat of the disgraceful Bosnian ``safe haven'' \ndisaster of Srebrenica.\n  The U.S. and NATO must also press for immediate and unrestricted \naccess in Kosovo for internationally-recognized human rights monitoring \norganizations, including the Organization for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe, and increase aid and intelligence support to the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\n\n[[Page S11902]]\n\n  Mr. President, the U.S. and NATO are right to move forward now to \nsend a clear and forceful message to Milosevic that he can no longer \nbrazenly defy world opinion. The brutal slaughter of innocent non-\ncombatants in Kosovo must stop now. If it continues, the West must have \nthe resolve to do what is necessary to bring it to an end. And, if \nnecessary, I want to say as a U.S. Senator, I think there should be \nairstrikes.\n  I wanted to speak out before we leave and I want the Record to show \nthat I have spoken out. I wish that the U.S. Senate had brought this \nmatter up. Other Senators would have very different points of view, and \nI understand that. But it really troubles me, saddens me, that the \nSenate as a body has not had a thorough discussion and debate about \nwhat is a life-or-death matter. I wanted to at least have a chance to \nspeak out. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for giving me some time.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Parliamentary inquiry: I have been asked to propound a \nunanimous consent request which relates to another bill. Would it be in \norder at this time to ask unanimous consent that it may be considered \nseparately?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may make the request.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11901-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           OPERATION DESERT SHIELD AVIATION CONTINUATION PAY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 2584.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 2584) to provide aviator continuation pay for \n     military members killed in Operation Desert Shield.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, this legislation is introduced to correct \na legislative inequity that has adversely affected one of my \nconstituents, Mrs. Vicki Reid of Dauphin, Pennsylvania.\n  At the time of his death in Operation Desert Shield, Captain \nFrederick Reid was serving as a United States Air Force pilot. The Air \nForce had authorized an Aviator Continuation Pay contract contingent \nupon his continuing to serve in the Air Force. Unfortunately, on \nOctober 10, 1990, Captain Reid was killed during a flight training \noperation.\n  The Defense Department policy at the time was that one's death \nprecluded receiving the continuation pay. Congress responded by \nenacting the Mack Amendment, under which families of pilots killed in \naction during Operation Desert Storm are entitled to the deceased \npilot's Aviator Continuation Pay. This provision of the fiscal year \n1992 Defense Appropriations Act (P.L. 102-172) stipulates that in order \nto collect the Aviator Continuation Pay, the pilot must have died \nduring Operation Desert Storm (on or after January 17, 1991), but \nexcludes those pilots killed in Operation Desert Shield.\n  By letter to me dated August 3, 1998 from Under Secretary Rudy De \nLeon, the Department of Defense has confirmed that Captain Reid was the \nonly U.S. Air Force pilot killed in Operation Desert Shield who was \nentitled to Aviator Continuation Pay and that approximately $58,000 of \nCaptain Reid's Aviator Continuation Pay was unpaid at the time of his \ndeath. In a September 11, 1998 letter to me, the Air Force has \nexpressed its support for an extension of the Mack Amendment to cover \nthe Reid case.\n  While private relief legislation is a last resort to be used \nsparingly by the Congress, Captain Reid's service and dedication to his \ncountry are laudatory. Had he died only a few months later, his widow \nwould have been justly compensated. Accordingly, I am introducing this \nbill today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the \nDepartment of Defense and a letter from the Air Force be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                   Under Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 3, 1998.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Specter: This responds to your letter of July \n     2, 1998, to Secretary Cohen concerning Aviation Continuation \n     Pay (ACP) due to pilots at the time of their death while \n     serving in Operation Desert Shield.\n       A review of files pertaining to the members who died while \n     serving in Desert Shield indicate that, of the eight pilots \n     who died during that operation, only Captain Reid was serving \n     under an ACP bonus contract at the time of his death. \n     Approximately $58,000 of that bonus was left unpaid due to \n     Captain Reid's death and would be payable to his widow should \n     legislation be enacted to extend the Mack Amendment to P.L. \n     102-172 to cover members killed in Operation Desert Shield.\n       I appreciate the concern you have shown about this issue. \n     Please contact me if you require any further information.\n           Sincerely,\n     Rudy de Leon.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Department of Defense,\n\n\n                                  Department of the Air Force,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Arlen Specter,\n     U.S. Senator,\n     Philadelphia, PA.\n       Dear Mr. Specter: This responds to your inquiry for Ms. \n     Vicki Reid and the possibility of receiving the remaining \n     portion of her late husband's, Captain Frederick Reid, \n     Aviator Continuation Pay (ACP).\n       As currently codified in Section 301b, Title 37, United \n     States Code, ACP is paid upon the acceptance of a written \n     agreement to remain on active duty. Members who do not \n     complete the total period of service under the terms of that \n     agreement, even as a result of death while in military \n     service, are not entitled to the unearned portion of the \n     compensation. Current law does not permit the Air Force to \n     pay Ms. Reid the approximately $58,000 remaining on her \n     husband's agreement.\n       Air Force officials are aware of the possibility of \n     extending the Mack Amendment to cover members killed in \n     Operation Desert Shield and strongly support this initiative. \n     The Air Force officials sincerely appreciate the dedication \n     to duty exemplified by Captain Reid.\n       We trust you will find this information helpful.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marcia Rossi,\n       Lt. Col. USAF, Congressional Inquiry Division, Office of \n     Legislative Liaison.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill appear at this \npoint in the Record.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--I want to inquire, has that been cleared on this side?\n  Mr. SPECTER. It has been cleared on the other side of the aisle. It \nprovides for aviator continuation pay for Air Force personnel killed in \nOperation Desert Shield. It is for a Pennsylvania constituent, as I \nunderstand it, the only one who has not been so compensated.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 2584) was passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 5, 1998.)\n\n[[Page S11903]]\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to ask that my colleagues \nsupport the Conference Report on the Intelligence Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 1999.\n  I want to thank Chairman Young for his leadership in the Conference, \nand note for my colleagues that Chairman Goss was unable to chair the \nconference due to a serious medical condition in his family. We all \nwish Mrs. Goss a speedy recovery.\n  I believe that the Conference Committee put together a solid package \nfor consideration by the full Senate that fairly represents the \nintelligence priorities set forth in both the Senate and House versions \nof the Intelligence Authorization Act. I am pleased to report that the \nConference Committee accomplished its task in a strong bipartisan \nmanner, and I want to thank my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Kerrey, \nfor working so closely with me to produce this legislation.\n  I believe that the Conference Report embraces many of the key \nrecommendations that the Senate adopted in its version of the bill.\n  We recommended significant increases in funding for high-priority \nprojects aimed at better positioning the Intelligence Community for the \nthreats of the 21st Century, while at the same time reducing funds for \nprograms and activities that were not adequately justified or \nredundant.\n  The Conference Report includes key initiatives that I believe are \nvital for the future of our Intelligence Community.\n  These initiatives include: bolstering advanced research and \ndevelopment across the Community, to facilitate, among other things, \nthe modernization of NSA and CIA; strengthening efforts in counter-\nproliferation, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, counter-\nintelligence, and effective covert action; expanding the collection and \nexploitation of measurements and signatures intelligence, especially \nballistic missile intelligence; developing reconnaissance systems based \non new small satellite technologies that provide flexible, affordable \ncollection from space with radars to detect moving targets; boosting \neducation, recruiting, and technical training for Intelligence \nCommunity personnel; enhancing analytical capabilities; streamlining \ndissemination of intelligence products; and providing new tools for \ninformation operations.\n  The conferees have provided the funds and guidance to ensure that \nmilitary commanders and national policymakers continue to receive \ntimely, accurate information on threats to our security.\n  At the same time, we have found some critical areas within the \nCommunity that are in need of major improvements.\n  First, the CIA's foremost mission of providing timely intelligence \nbased on human sources (``HUMINT'') is in grave jeopardy. CIA case \nofficers today do not have the training or the equipment needed to keep \ntheir true identities hidden, to communicate covertly with agents, or \nto plant sophisticated listening devices and other collection tools \nthat will provide timely intelligence on an adversary's intentions.\n  Second, what many see as the ``crown jewel'' of U.S. Intelligence--\nthe National Security Agency's signals intelligence capability--\nlikewise is in dire need of modernization. The digital and fiber optic \nrevolutions are here-and-now, but NSA is still predominantly oriented \ntoward cold war-era threats.\n  The Director of NSA has recommended major changes in how NSA performs \nits mission--changes we endorse--but those recommendations were not \nadequately addressed in the President's budget.\n  Third, promising technologies and systems for detecting missiles and \nother threats were short-changed in the President's budget request. \nLikewise, robust funding for new tools for conducting information \nwarfare, new sensors to detect and counter proliferation, and a \ndemonstration of radar technology on small and affordable satellites \nwere not adequately addressed in the budget request.\n  And fourth, the declining quality of analysis within the Intelligence \nCommunity is cause for great concern.\n  Responding to the failure to predict the Indian nuclear tests, the \nDirector of Central Intelligence commissioned retired Admiral David \nJeremiah to review what went wrong and why. Among other findings, \nAdmiral Jeremiah concluded that Intelligence Community analysts were \ncomplacent; they based their analyses on faulty assumptions; and \nengaged in wishful thinking. It is my belief that such is the state of \nanalysis as it relates to many issues and problems, including \npolitical-military developments in China, the ballistic missile threat, \nand more. We can and should expect more from the Intelligence \nCommunity.\n  And as we demand more from our Intelligence Community in a number of \nareas, we also demand fiscal responsibility. The Conference Report \nincludes a number of reductions to programs that were not adequately \njustified or were redundant with other elements within the Intelligence \nCommunity.\n  The Conference Report also places some fiscal restraints on programs \nthat have historically been allowed to grow unbounded. These programs \nare primarily in the area of technical satellite collection, and the \nconferees placed a cost cap on the National Reconnaissance Office's \nnext generation imagery satellite constellation, called the Future \nImagery Architecture. I believe that this action is necessary to ensure \nthat the program stays on a solid fiscal footing from the start, and \nfocuses on the key performance parameters generated by the Intelligence \nCommunity and the Department of Defense's Joint Requirements Oversight \nCouncil.\n  Finally, the Conference Report includes a provision to name the CIA \nHeadquarters Compound after President George Bush. I am happy that we \nwere able to recognize President Bush's service to this country as both \nDirector of Central Intelligence and as President. As DCI, Mr. Bush \nbrought innovation to the CIA, and dramatically improved the morale \nwithin the Agency.\n  He demonstrated leadership and integrity at a time when both were \ndesperately needed to help restore confidence in the CIA and the other \nelements that make up the Intelligence Community. It is a fitting \ntribute that we designate CIA headquarters the George Bush Center for \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. President, the Conference Committee worked closely together, in a \nstrong bipartisan fashion, to produce a comprehensive Intelligence \nAuthorization Act, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote for this \nconference report and I urge the President to sign this bill into law. \nThis legislation is an essential part of Congress' annual duty to \nprovide and direct the resources which safeguard the independence of \nthe United States and the lives and livelihoods of the American people. \nChairman Shelby's leadership and sustained effort throughout this year \ncome to fruition in this excellent bill and I congratulate him. I also \nappreciate the vision and hard work of Chairman Goss and Ranking Member \nDicks of the House Committee, together with the leadership of Chairman \nYoung at the conference.\n  This legislation, like the intelligence agencies it authorizes, seeks \nto maximize America's capabilities against today's threats while \nsimultaneously building capability against the threats of 2010 and \nbeyond. The Intelligence Community cannot be pulled back from its \ndeployed status for retraining and retooling. It is operating tonight \naround the world, seeking to monitor every environment which could \nthreaten America or our allies. But the Intelligence Community must \nalso be able to master the steadily more complex technologies which \nwill be tomorrow's threat environments. The outlines of the new century \nare apparent, as we see the continuing explosion of communications \nmedia, the global growth of strong encryption, and the increasing \nporosity of international borders, to mention just of the future that \nare already upon us. In response to challenges like these, the \nconference authorized the start or continuation of a number of new \ntechnology initiatives, including most of those the Senate supported \npreviously.\n  The Committee's efforts to advance intelligence technology were \ngreatly assisted by a group of outside experts who formed a Technical \nAdvisory Group to the Committee. They helped the Committee focus on the \nfuture of signals intelligence and the necessity\n\n[[Page S11904]]\n\nfor the National Security Agency to modernize itself, as well as how \ntechnology could better support human intelligence. Their contribution \nof time and expertise is paying off already for the country, and they \ndeserve the thanks of all of us.\n  Throughout the authorization process, the two intelligence committees \nhave understood that their efforts to prepare U.S. intelligence to \nmaster the future must be bounded by budgetary realities. Most of the \nintelligence budget is dependent on a defense budget which, as we all \nknow, is under severe pressure. The intelligence agencies have \nambitious projects, and it is part of our job to set financial limits \nand time constraints and closely oversee the progress of these \nprojects. The conferees placed a cost cap on the National \nReconnaissance Office's Future Imagery Architecture for this reason.\n  The bill also encourages competitive analysis of important and \ndifficult intelligence topics. The Jeremiah Report which reviewed \nintelligence community performance following this year's Indian nuclear \ntest and the Rumsfeld panel report on the ballistic missile threat both \nstress the need to use competitive analysis drawing on experts from \nboth within and outside the government. This bill encourages that \nprocess.\n  Analysis will grow stronger in the coming year, not only because of \nthis legislation, but because there is now in place, under the Director \nof Central Intelligence, an Assistant Director for Analysis and \nProduction. This official has not been confirmed by the Senate, \nalthough he may well be in the coming year, but he is already using the \nDirector's authorities to make analysis in the Intelligence community \nmore effective and efficient. He and his counterpart, the Assistant \nDirector for Collection Management, and their supervisor, the Deputy \nDirector for Community Management, are already by their actions \nvalidating Congress' wisdom in creating these positions. As I go to \nbriefings and learn how these officials are marshaling resources in \ntimes of crisis, setting priorities, and identifying gaps, I am pleased \nwith the work we did two years ago.\n  Another aspect of the intelligence business should be praised, Mr. \nPresident, and that is the unparalleled level of cooperation between \nthe agencies these days. The relationship between FBI and the CIA is \nparticularly strong and it has paid off most recently in the \ninvestigation of the attacks on our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. \nDirector Tenet and Director Freeh have overcome corporate cultures and \nbureaucratic impulses to forge a strong team for America and they \ndeserve our thanks.\n  Team-building and sound oversight both depend on the flow of \ninformation. The Senate had gone on record three times in defense of a \nFederal employee's right to bring classified information on wrongdoing \nto the appropriate committees of Congress. The House had devised a \nprocess by which such information could come to Congress while insuring \nthe employee's privacy, making the employee's agency aware the \ninformation was going to Congress, and insuring the protection of \nsources and methods. The conference modified the House provision and \nagreed to make the information process faster. As one who has argued \nseveral times on this floor for the right of Congress to be informed, I \nam pleased with the conference outcome on this provision and with the \nwork of both bodies.\n  This legislation also recognizes the accomplishments of a great \npatriot, former President Bush, by naming the CIA Headquarters complex \nin his honor. From his initial service in World War II, President Bush \nhas always stepped forward to do hard and sometimes dangerous work for \nhis country. Leadership of the CIA has both characteristics. President \nBush distinguished himself in that job, as in all his service, and I am \npleased this legislation will honor him.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to address an issue of serious \nconsequence in the Intelligence Authorization Conference Report. \nAlthough I have signed the conference report and intend to support it \non the Senate floor, I feel compelled to voice my concern over the \nmanner in which the conference report deals with the Future Imagery \nArchitecture, a program managed by the National Reconnaissance Office. \nI make these remarks with the complete understanding that conference is \nalways difficult, and always improve compromises.\n  Although there are reasons to be concerned about cost growth in the \nFIA program, I am just as concerned that the intelligence conference \nreport will have negative and unforeseen consequences for this \nimportant program. The conference report mandates fixed deployment \ndates, fixed costs, and fixed portions of the budget for subsidizing \nthe commercial sector. Perhaps more troubling, the conference report \nfences one hundred percent of the FIA budget for fiscal year 1999 \npending the completion of several significant tasks, a number of which \nare outside the purview of the NRO. Since FY 1999 has already \ncommenced, this means that none of the FIA budget can be accessed for \nmany months, even to support completion of the tasks that the \nconference report has mandated. In my view, imposing such limitations \nbefore a contract has even been awarded is an unprecedented and \nunwarranted degree of micro-management.\n  Based on my concerns, I have requested the views of the Department of \nDefense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The preliminary report that I \nhave received indicates that OSD and JCS have serious concerns similar \nto mine.\n  It has been asserted that the FIA program must live under a \ncongressionally imposed cost cap in order to prevent it from ``eating'' \nthe entire National Foreign Intelligence Program. Some who make this \nargument, however, also want to see FIA's capabilities to support \nmilitary users reduced so that savings can be used to support other \nprograms within the NFIP that have a more ``national'' orientation. The \nfact of the matter is, however, even though FIA is funded in the NFIP, \nby its nature and the mission of the NRO, it must provide robust \nsupport to military forces. The Intelligence Committees must ensure \nthat their bill supports these military missions as well as the other \nprograms and missions funded within the NFIP.\n\n\n      intelligence community whistleblower protection act of 1998\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment to discuss \nlanguage that has been added to the Intelligence Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 1999. The language, establishing the ``Intelligence \nCommunity Whistleblower Act of 1998,'' creates a process by which \nemployees of intelligence agencies can provide information to Congress \nabout certain potential problems without fear of reprisal or threats or \nreprisal.\n  Some of these provisions create duties for the Inspectors General \n(IGs) of the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice, and \nmodify the Inspector General Act of 1978. As a result, they fall \nsquarely within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs, which is the Senate's primary oversight committee for the IG \ncommunity.\n  However, Senator Thompson, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, worked with me to ensure that the language comports with the \noverall framework of the Inspector General Act. I thank my colleague \nfor his participation in this issue.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for \nhis cooperation on this matter. The Committee on Governmental Affairs, \nwhich I chair, has long been a supporter and friend of the Inspector \nGeneral (IG) community. Twenty years ago, the Committee's leadership \nled to passage of the Inspector General Act, legislation which has \nserved Congress, the executive branch, and the public well. As their \nprimary committee of jurisdiction, the Committee has a longstanding and \nabiding interest in the IGs.\n  Thus, the Committee has an interest in any legislation that affects \nthe duties of the IGs. Portions of the ``Intelligence Community \nWhistleblower Protection Act of 1998'' amend the IG Act by vesting the \nDefense Department and Justice Department IGs with authority to act \nupon allegations received from intelligence community whistleblowers \nwho wish to complain to Congress about problems they see in certain \nsensitive areas. Recognizing the Committee's jurisdiction and interest \nin this matter, Senator Shelby solicited my views on how the \nwhistleblower provisions fit within the existing IG statute. I thank \nSenator Shelby for offering me\n\n[[Page S11905]]\n\nthe opportunity to work with him on this important issue.\n\n\n                        S.C. Secrecy Reform Act\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate Select Committee on \nIntelligence brings to the floor the conference report on the \nintelligence authorization bill. While I commend the Committee for \nbringing this legislation to the floor, I would like to take this \nopportunity to discuss a bill that the committee did not act on this \nyear: the government Secrecy Reform Act (S. 712).\n  This legislation stems from the unanimous recommendation of the \nCommission on Protecting and Reducing Government Secrecy. Senator Jesse \nHelms and I, and Representatives Larry Combest and Lee Hamilton (all \nCommissioners), introduced the Government Secrecy Act in May 1997. The \nbill sets out a new legislative framework to govern our secrecy system. \nOur core objective is to ensure that secrecy proceed according to law. \nThe proposed statute can help ensure that the present regulatory regime \nwill not simply continue to flourish without any restraint and without \nmeaningful oversight and accountability.\n  A trenchant example of the need for reform in this area came last \nweek by way of the Assassination Records Review Board. The Board has \nnow completed its congressionally mandated review and release of \ndocuments related to President Kennedy's assassination. It has \nassembled at the National Archives a thorough collection of documents \nand evidence that was previously secret and scattered about the \ngovernment. The Review Board found that while the public continues to \nsearch for answers over the past thirty-five years:\n\n       [T]he official record on the assassination of President \n     Kennedy remained shrouded in secrecy and mystery.\n       The suspicions created by government secrecy eroded \n     confidence in the truthfulness of federal agencies in general \n     and damaged their credibility.\n\n  Credibility eroded needlessly, as most of the documents which the \nBoard reviewed were declassified. And at considerable cost, as it \nrepresents the best-known and most notorious conspiracy theory now \nextant: the unwillingness on the part of the vast majority of the \nAmerican public to accept that President Kennedy was assassinated in \n1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone.\n  Conspiracy theories have been with us since the birth of the \nRepublic. This one seems to have only grown. A poll taken in 1966, two \nyears after release of the Warren Commission report concluding that \nOswald had acted alone, found that 36 percent of respondents accepted \nthis finding, while 50 percent believed others had been involved in a \nconspiracy to kill the President. by 1978 only 18 percent responded \nthat they believed the assassination had been the act of one man; fully \n75 percent believed there had been a broader plot. The numbers have \nremained relatively steady since; a 1993 poll also found that three-\nquarters of those surveyed believed (consistent with the film JFK, \nreleased that year) that there had been a conspiracy.\n  It so happens that I was in the White House at the hour of the \nPresident's death (I was an assistant labor secretary at the time). I \nfeared what would become of him if he were not protected, and I pleaded \nthat we must get custody of Oswald. But no one seemed to be able to \nhear. Presently Oswald was killed, significantly complicating matters.\n  I did not think there had been a conspiracy to kill the president, \nbut I was convinced that the American people would sooner or later come \nto believe that there had been one unless we investigated the event \nwith exactly that presumption in mind. The Warren Commission report and \nthe other subsequent investigations, with their nearly universal \nreliance on secrecy, did not dispel any such fantasies.\n  In conducting this document-by-document review of classified \ninformation, the Board reports that ``the federal government needlessly \nand wastefully classified and then withheld from public access \ncountless important records that did not require such treatment.'' How \nto explain this?\n  Beginning with the concept that secrecy should be understood as a \nform of government regulation. This was an insight of the Commission on \nProtecting and Reducing Government Secrecy, which I chaired, building \non the work of the great German sociologist Max Weber, who wrote some \neight decades ago:\n\n       The pure interest of the bureaucracy in power, however, is \n     efficacious far beyond those areas where purely functional \n     interests make for secrecy. The concept of the `official \n     secret' is the specific invention of bureaucracy, and nothing \n     is so fantastically defended by the bureaucracy as this \n     attitude, which cannot be substantially defended beyond \n     these specifically qualified areas.\n\n  What we traditionally think of in this country as regulation concerns \nhow citizens are to behave. Whereas public regulation involves what the \ncitizen may do, secrecy concerns what that citizen may know. And the \ncitizen does not know what may not be known. As our Commission stated: \n``Americans are familiar with the tendency to overregulate in other \nareas. What is different with secrecy is that the public cannot know \nthe extent or the content of the regulation.''\n  Thus, secrecy is the ultimate mode of regulation; the citizen does \nnot even know that he or she is being regulated! It is a parallel \nregulatory regime with a far greater potential for damage if it \nmalfunctions. In our democracy, where the free exchange of ideas is so \nessential, it can be suffocating.\n  And so the Commission recommended that legislation must be enacted. \nThe Majority and Minority Leaders have been persuaded on the necessity \nof such legislation and are cosponsors of the bill. On March 3, 1998, \nwe engaged in a colleague on the bill with the two Leaders, along with \nmyself, Senators Helms, Thompson, Glenn, Shelby, and Kerrey. At that \ntime we all agreed on the importance of considering the bill in this \nsession. The Majority Leader stated, ``I hope that this process of \ncommittee consideration can be completed this spring and that we can \nexpeditiously schedule floor time for legislation addressing this \nimportant issue. The Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by \nSenator Thompson, considered the bill and approved it unanimously on \nJuly 22. In its report to accompany the bill, the Committee had this \nimportant insight:\n\n       Our liberties depend on the balanced structure created by \n     James Madison and the other framers of the Constitution. The \n     national security information system has not had a clear \n     legislative foundation, but . . . has been developed through \n     a series of executive orders. It is time to bring this \n     executive monopoly over the issue to an end, and to begin to \n     engage in the same sort of dialogue between Congress and the \n     executive that characterizes the development of government \n     policy in all other means.\n\n  We are not proposing putting an end to government secrecy. Far from \nit. It is at times terribly necessary and used for the most legitimate \nreasons--ranging from military operations to diplomatic endeavors. \nIndeed, much of our Commission's report is devoted to explaining the \nvaried circumstances in which secrecy is most essential. Yet, the \nbureaucratic attachment to secrecy has become so warped that, in the \nwords of Kermit Hall, a member of the Assassination Records Review \nBoard, it has transformed into ``a deeply ingrained commitment to \nsecrecy as a form of patriotism.''\n  Secrecy need not remain the only norm--particularly when one \nconsiders that the current badly overextended system frequently fails \nto protect its most important secrets adequately. We must develop what \nmight be termed a competing ``culture of openness''--fully consistent \nwith our interests in protecting national security, but in which power \nand authority are no longer derived primarily from one's ability to \nwithhold information from others in government and the public at large.\n  Unfortunately, the Intelligence Committee did not take up this bill. \nPart of the delay was a result of the tardy administration response to \nthe changes made by the Governmental Affairs Committee. A formal letter \non the bill was not delivered until September 17. In addition, this \nletter sought the removal of the ``balancing test'' contained in the \nbill, a change that the administration had not previously sought.\n  Nevertheless, we were on the threshold of reaching agreement on the \nbill. The Intelligence Committee has been reviewing the bill \ninformally, and I hope the Chairman will agree that the difference \nbetween us are not that great, and that we can pass the bill early in \nthe 106th Congress.\n\n[[Page S11906]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter expressing the administration \nviews on the bill be printed in the Record at this point, along with \ncomments on the letter made in a joint letter by the National Security \nArchives and the Federation of American Scientists, and a letter by \nRepresentative Lee Hamilton.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 2, 1998.\n     Mr. Steven Aftergood,\n     Federation of American Scientists, 307 Massachusetts, Ave., \n         NE., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Aftergood, Thank you for your letter of September \n     24, 1998, concerning National Security Adviser Sandy Berger's \n     letter to me with the Administration's views on S. 712, The \n     Government Secrecy Reform Act of 1998.\n       I agree with you. I think it is a serious mistake to accept \n     the elimination of the public-interest balancing test as the \n     price for Administration support of the bill. To agree with \n     the Administration's proposed changes would amount to gutting \n     the bill. It would amount to a codification of existing \n     procedures in the Executive branch, and a rejection of the \n     work of the Secrecy Commission. I want to work with the \n     Administration in support of secrecy reform, but I cannot \n     accept a revised bill that does not change the unacceptable \n     status quo on classification and declassification.\n       As I read it, secrecy reform is dead in the current \n     Congress. In the absence of Administration support, moving \n     the bill forward just will not be possible.\n       On a personal note, I want to say that the efforts of you \n     and your organization have been very helpful to me and to \n     advocates of secrecy reform, and I wish you every success in \n     the 106th Congress.\n       With best regards,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lee H. Hamilton,\n     Ranking Democratic Member.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 24, 1998.\n     Re S. 712, the Government Secrecy Reform Act of 1998\n\n     Hon. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Moynihan: As three public-interest \n     organizations that have collectively spent more than 50 years \n     battling excessive government secrecy imposed in the name of \n     national security, we write to applaud S. 712, the Government \n     Secrecy Reform Act of 1998, as a truly important and \n     unprecedented step towards reforming the Cold War secrecy \n     system.\n       The bill includes the critical ingredient for any real \n     reform, namely the public-interest balancing test and \n     judicial review under the Freedom of Information Act applying \n     that test. The public-interest balancing test--whereby \n     classification standards must incorporate a weighing of the \n     public interest in knowing the information against the harm \n     to the national security from disclosure--was one of the key \n     recommendations of the Commission on Protecting and Reducing \n     Government Secrecy in 1997. And the experience of the past 20 \n     years confirms that Congress was correct in 1974, when it \n     recognized that an essential element for an effective Freedom \n     of Information Act is judicial review of whether \n     classification standards are being properly applied when \n     government agencies refuse to release information.\n       For these reasons, we are deeply disappointed that the \n     Administration objects to the bill's inclusion of the public-\n     interest balancing test for declassification and the \n     concomitant amendment to the Freedom of Information Act. \n     (Letter from Samuel R. Berger to Lee Hamilton, September 17, \n     1998; secs 2(c) and (f) in S. 712 as reported out of the \n     Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs.) The \n     Administration's demand to eliminate from the bill the \n     balancing test and its enforcement under the FOIA threatens \n     to eviscerate the bill and to gut any real reform. If the \n     bill were to be passed without these provisions, we fear that \n     secrecy reform would suffer a grievous setback. The historic \n     opportunity carved out by the Commission to advance reform \n     beyond the status quo will have been missed, and instead the \n     Congress risks codifying a Cold War understanding of national \n     security secrecy that ill serves democratic principles.\n       While we understand that the Administration's objections \n     may make it difficult to pass the bill as reported out of \n     Committee in this session of Congress, we urge you to insist \n     on keeping these provisions in the bill.\n       We believe that the administration's objections can be \n     overridden, if not in this Congress, then in the next one. \n     The objections are based on a dangerous and erroneous view \n     that the President has absolute and unreviewable authority \n     over national security information. This view of exclusive \n     authority challenges not only the judiciary's constitutional \n     role in enforcing the law but also Congress' shared \n     responsibility for national security information. It is \n     inconsistent with the Supreme Court precedent, (See, EPA v. \n     Mink, 410 U.S. 73 (1973) and contradicts decades of \n     congressional legislating. (Most recently, the Nazi War \n     Crimes Disclosure Act, but also the JFK Assassinations \n     Records Collection Act, the Foreign Relations Authorization \n     Act of 1992 (concerning the Department of State's Foreign \n     Relations of the United States series), and the Intelligence \n     Oversight Act, among others.) Indeed, this same argument was \n     rejected by the Congress in 1974 when it overrode President \n     Ford's veto of the amendment to the Freedom of Information \n     Act providing that federal courts should determine whether \n     information is properly classified. In now objection to \n     judicial review, the administration is seeking to repeal the \n     most important element of the FOIA.\n       Moreover, the oft-cited specter of ``judicial intrusion on \n     the President's constitutional authority'' is not grounded in \n     any real historical experience. The bill would authorize \n     judicial review to determine whether mid-level agency \n     officials have correctly applied declassification standards. \n     In reality, no federal court is ever going to release \n     national security information over the objection of the \n     President or even the head of an agency, and certainly no \n     appeals court would uphold any such decision. At the same \n     time, experience confirms that it is only the availability of \n     judicial review that ensures that agencies do, in fact, live \n     up to their legal obligations under the FOIA. For example, \n     only when the CIA was forced to defend its withholding of the \n     aggregate intelligence budget in 1997 in court did the agency \n     finally release the information.\n       As you have written, ``[s]ecrecry can be a source of \n     dangerous ignorance. . . . It is time. . . . to assert \n     certain American fundamentals, foremost of which is the right \n     to know what government is doing, and the corresponding \n     ability to judge its performance.'' These key provisions of \n     the bill are essential to allow the public to do just that--\n     to participate effectively in the political process and to \n     engage in democratic decision making on fundamental issues of \n     foreign policy and national security.\n       Thank you for considering our views.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                      Kate Martin,\n                             Center for National Security Studies.\n                                                 Steven Aftergood,\n                                Federation of American Scientists.\n                                                   Thomas Blanton,\n     National Security Archive.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                   Washington, September 17, 1998.\n     Hon. Lee Hamilton,\n     Ranking Democratic Member,\n     Committee on International Relations,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Lee: Thank you for your letter inquiring about the \n     Administration's views on S. 712, the Government Secrecy \n     Reform Act of 1998, which was reported out of the Senate \n     Committee on Governmental Affairs in July. I wrote to \n     Chairman Thompson on May 11, 1998, conveying Administration \n     views on this legislation; a copy of that letter is enclosed.\n       The amended version of S. 712 incorporates most of the \n     Administration's recommendations regarding the Office of \n     National Classification and Declassification Oversight \n     (NCDO); the use of classification and declassification \n     guidance; and the need to ensure that declassification \n     decisions are made only by the originating agency. The \n     Committee also clearly tried to address our concerns about \n     new rights of judicial review, but further clarification on \n     this vital point is necessary.\n       The additional improvements in S. 712 that we believe are \n     essential are discussed below. Based on recent discussions \n     with staff of Chairman Thompson. Senator Moynihan, and the \n     Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am hopeful that \n     needed changes can be made that would enable the \n     Administration to endorse this legislation. For each of the \n     key issues, our suggestions are included in a line-in/line-\n     out version of S. 712 enclosed with this letter.\n       1. The bill must be modified to make it unambiguously clear \n     that this legislation confers no new rights of judicial \n     review. While the text of Section 6 attempts to limit \n     judicial review, the interplay of other sections would create \n     new substantive and procedural rights. Section 2(c), which \n     requires a national security/public interest balancing test \n     before classifying or declassifying any information, also \n     sets forth specific standards for defining harm to national \n     security and the public interest. Section 2(f), which amends \n     the FOIA, clearly would make the application of a balancing \n     test subject to judicial review under FOIA. Indeed, the \n     Government Affairs Committee Report states that ``the \n     legislation necessarily imports into its new secrecy regime \n     the judicial review available under the Freedom of \n     Information Act (FOIA). For example, proper application of \n     the public interest/national security balancing test would be \n     within the scope of judicial review for Freedom of \n     Information Act requests for classified information. * * *'' \n     Since the bill was reported, we have considered several \n     approaches to revising the balancing test language or adding \n     additional language to limit judicial review. None of these \n     approaches completely addresses the concern that legislating \n     a mandatory balancing test could encourage judicial intrusion \n     on the President's constitutional authority and transform the \n     nature of judicial review of classification and \n     declassification decisions in FOIA litigation. We have \n     concluded that the balancing test must be eliminated in order \n     to protect essential Presidential authority and to ensure \n     that the legislation introduces no new rights of judicial \n     review.\n       2. Section 2(d) would forbid the classification of any \n     information for more than 10\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\n     years, without the concurrence of the head of the NCDO and a \n     written certification to the President. Since over half of \n     all original classification decisions made under E.O. 12958 \n     are properly designated for more than 10 years (down from 95% \n     under the previous Executive Order), implementation of this \n     requirement would be unworkable without the employment of a \n     huge new bureaucracy at the NCDO and hundreds of new \n     certification writers at the agencies. The standards for \n     duration of classification must be rewritten to make them \n     compatible with the E.O. 12958 standards.\n       3. Section 4 establishes a Classification and \n     Declassification Review Board, consisting exclusively of non-\n     Government employees, to decide appeals from the public or \n     agencies of decisions made by agencies or the NCDO. Agencies \n     may appeal decisions of this Board only to the President. \n     Given the new oversight authority assigned to the Director of \n     the NCDO, and the existing rights of FOIA or Executive Order \n     appeal, this new entity is redundant and unnecessary, and it \n     is likely to be quite costly to operate. At a minimum, the \n     legislation must be amended to permit the President to \n     appoint Review Board members of his choosing, including \n     current Government employees.\n       4. S. 712 locates the NCDO within the EOP, which is highly \n     problematic given the traditional constraints on the budget \n     and staffing levels of the EOP. Therefore, we believe the \n     best organizational placement for the NCDO is the National \n     Archives and Records Administration, which has a strong \n     institutional commitment to declassifying public records as \n     expeditiously as possible consistent with protecting national \n     security interests. That said, we also would recommend the \n     addition of language that would codify an ongoing NSC role in \n     providing policy guidance to the NCDO and would enhance the \n     prospects of adequate funding for the NCDO. With a continued \n     NSC imprimatur and adequate assured funding, organizational \n     placement outside the EOP would be a much less difficult \n     issue.\n       5. Section 2(c)(4) requiring detailed written \n     justifications for all classification decisions is the kind \n     of administrative detail that should be left to the \n     discretion of the executive branch. As drafted, this \n     provision would increase paperwork and cost, without any \n     assurance of improving classification decisions or the \n     management of the program. However, we agree that it would \n     make sense to require detailed justifications whenever \n     classification decisions are incorporated into an agency's \n     classification guide.\n       6. Section 3(d)(7) should be modified to limit NCDO access \n     to the most sensitive records associated with a special \n     access program. Limiting access to such records is consistent \n     with E.O. 12958 but will not undermine the NCDO's ability to \n     oversee special access programs.\n       I appreciate your continuing leadership on this matter. By \n     working together on the difficult remaining issues, I think \n     we have a chance to establish a statutory framework for the \n     classification and declassification program that enhances the \n     President's authority to manage the program effectively.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Samuel R.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment (No. 3789) is printed in today's Record \nunder ``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their \nparticipation and cooperation in making this act a reality, and \nparticularly my colleague, Senator Lieberman, for cosponsoring this. We \nhave 29 cosponsors of this bill.\n  Certainly, one of the principal cosponsors and leaders on combating \nreligious persecution and promoting religious freedom throughout the \nworld has been Senator Specter, the original cosponsor of the Specter-\nWolf bill which passed the House overwhelmingly. I commend Congressman \nWolf for his leadership and for the enormous vote they had in the \nHouse. I commend Senator Specter for combating religious persecution \nand promoting religious freedom throughout the world.\n  I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. At the outset, I congratulate my distinguished colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, for his leadership on this important \nmeasure, along with Senator Lieberman and Senator Coats.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation, which now appears to \nbe near fruition, with joint action by the House of Representatives. \nThis legislation, the International Religious Freedom Act, constitutes \na very firm stand by the United States against religious persecution \nworldwide. A bipartisan group of Senators have spearheaded this effort, \nand the outcome is one in which the Senate can be proud.\n  The rockbed of America is religious freedom. That is the reason that \nthe pilgrims came to this country, to the\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\nsettlements in Virginia in 1607 and in Massachusetts with the pilgrims \nin 1620. That was also the reason that my father, Harry Specter, came \nto this country in 1911 at the age of 18, and my mother, Lillie Shanin \nSpecter, came to this country at the age of 5 with her family which had \nlived in a small town on the Russian-Polish border. Freedom of religion \nis the heart of the first amendment, the provisions for religious \nfreedom.\n  We have seen worldwide unspeakable religious persecution. We have \nseen Catholic clerics mistreated and tortured in China. We have seen \nChristians sold into slavery in the Sudan. We have seen the risk of the \ndeath penalty in Egypt and in Saudi Arabia for those of the Islam faith \nwho seek to convert to Christianity.\n  This legislation is a very forceful statement by the United States of \nAmerica that religious persecution is intolerable wherever it exists, \nwhether it is against Christians, whether it is against Jews, or \nwhether it is against those of the Islam faith, Buddhist, or whatever \nthe religious persuasion may be, it is intolerable. This issue, as I \nhave already noted, goes to my own personal roots. I was motivated to \nact for legislative relief by a distinguished American named Michael \nHorowitz, who came to see me in early 1997 and said that there had been \nenormous support from the international Christian community to protect \nSoviet Jewry, and that there ought to be a firm, responsive action by \nthose of the Jewish faith to try to help on the issue of persecution of \nChristians. It soon expanded beyond persecution of Christians to people \nof any religious persuasion.\n  I have been working in the Senate on the issue of religious \npersecution for several years now. At the end of the 104th Congress, I \nintroduced Senate Resolution 283, which detailed the need for quick, \ndecisive action and called upon the President to appoint a White House \nadvisor on religious persecution. After that, I worked with Senators \nNickles, Nunn, and Coats on a broader Senate resolution, S. Con. Res. \n71, which included my provisions on a White House Senior Advisor on \nreligious persecution and expressed the sense of the Senate regarding \npersecution of Christians worldwide. S. Con. Res. 71, which I \ncosponsored, passed the Senate by voice vote but there was insufficient \ntime remaining in the 104th Congress to secure passage in the House.\n  In collaboration with Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, on May 21, \n1997, I introduced legislation in the Senate, S. 772, and Congressman \nWolf introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives. \nWe introduced a bill that directly confronted the horrendous situation \nin many countries. This legislation targeted those countries that \nengaged in the most egregious acts of persecution such as torture, \nslavery and forcible acts of conversion. The legislation was passed in \nthe House of Representatives on May 14, 1998 by a vote of 375-41. The \nmatter has been under consideration by the Senate. The provisions of \nSenate bill 772, which I introduced, had been criticized, or concerns \nwere raised because of the sanctions which had been imposed.\n  There is a widespread concern in Congress--and in the Senate, at \nleast among some Senators--that the sanctions are counterproductive and \nthat they ought not to be entertained.\n  My own personal view is that the sanctions would have been \nappropriate. But I think it is worthwhile to take two-thirds of a loaf, \n70 percent of a loaf, I think substantially more than half a loaf, in \nthe accommodation which we are making here in the legislation which has \nbeen introduced today.\n  Margaret Chase Smith, a distinguished Senator from Maine, articulated \na very important concept talking about the principle of compromise as \nopposed to the compromise of principle. And in the legislation which is \nbeing advanced today there is not a compromise of principle, but we are \nmaking accommodations to put this legislation through.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have conducted four hearings throughout \nPennsylvania to hear from panelists who have witnessed or experienced \npersonally the horrors of religious persecution. These hearings were \nheld in the Pittsburgh area, the Harrisburg area, Allentown/Reading \narea and the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton area. In addition, I have had \nseveral meetings with evangelical leaders and leaders of missionary \norganizations who have been striving to expose those governments and \nother organizations that tolerate or perpetuate serious, physical acts \nof religious persecution against their own population.\n  It is clear from my meetings with religious leaders in Pennsylvania \nthat there are regions of the world where the situation is particularly \nabhorrent. In China, the government distinguishes between ``Patriotic'' \nCatholic and Protestant churches that are endorsed by the government \nand the more than 50 million ``House'' church Christian Churches. The \nChinese government recognizes officially only the Patriotic churches. \nMembers of the House churches--those who refuse to register in a state \nreligion, or who remain faithful to the Vatican--are regularly \nimprisoned for having bibles or holding worship services without \npermission.\n  Just over two years ago in August 1996, I traveled to China and met \nwith Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen to express my strong concerns \nabout religious persecution in his country. The next month, however, \nthe Chinese Government released a statement warning the Chinese people \nthat open exercise of their religion could result in harsh retribution. \nThis Summer, when President Clinton traveled to China there was real \nhope that the Chinese Government would begin to reverse decades of \nreligious intolerance and persecution. Sadly, recent reports indicate \nthat the situation has improved little.\n  This past January, I traveled to the Mideast and Africa to gather \nevidence on such practices in Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Egypt and \nneighboring countries. I met with religious leaders and governmental \nofficials in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Yemen. I had \nwanted to visit Sudan to investigate persecution of Christians by the \nfundamentalist Islamic Sudanese government, but was told by the State \nDepartment that Sudan was unsafe for American delegations. I did meet \nwith the Sudanese government-in-exile in neighboring Eritrea, and \ndiscussed reports of Sudanese persecution with His Holiness Abuna \nPaulos, the Patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and with the \nleadership of the Ethiopian Supreme Islamic Council in Addis Ababa. My \nfact finding corroborated the widespread reports of bias, mistreatment \nand persecution of religious minorities in these countries. It is now a \nwell known fact that the government of Sudan has supported a campaign \nof forced enslavement and conversion of the Christian population in \nsouthern Sudan. Literally thousands of Christian children have been \ntaken as slaves in the last six years. The government of Sudan permits \nthe torture and forcible conversion of Christian worshipers.\n  I heard reports from Egyptian evangelicals who cited cases of eight \nand nine months in jail for Muslims who sought conversion to \nChristianity. Many of them complained about the long time it took to \nsecure official permission to build churches. Eritrean Christians \nconfirmed claims of Sudanese children being sold into slavery. They \nattributed it to profiteering by militia as part of the booty of war. \nOne Eritrean Christian commented on Sudanese government action in \nclosing churches in 1997.\n  Egyptian President Mubarak and Saudi Arabian Intelligence Director \nPrince Turki told me that public intolerance toward non-Muslim \nreligions springs from the Koran. Conversion from Islam to Christianity \nor any other religion carries the death penalty under Muslim laws that \nare based on teachings of the Koran.\n  In Egypt, I talked to the Copts, saw situations where religious \npersecution was present. Congressman Wolf and I have talked about being \ncriticized in the Egyptian press for our advocacy of religious freedom \naround the world. As the saying goes, you can tell a man or woman by \ntheir friends. And you can tell a man or woman by their enemies as \nwell. Perhaps it is a mark of distinction to have been criticized, as \nCongressman Wolf and I had been in the Egyptian press, for articulating \nand pushing the principles of religious freedom.\n  In Saudi Arabia, I talked to Christians and Jews who had been \npersecuted there, and was outraged to find\n\n[[Page S11909]]\n\nthat if you were a Christian in Saudi Arabia, you could not have a \nChristmas tree in your window, which could be viewed from the outside; \nthat the Jewish men and women who are stationed there in the American \nforces did not want to wear their dog tags, their identification, \nbecause the indication of being Jewish was a source of possible \nreprisal.\n  I heard conflicting statements in Saudi Arabia about whether the \ndeath penalty is actually imposed on conversion. In some cases there is \nquestion about whether individuals are put to death solely because of \ntheir faith, or if other charges are involved. There is no doubt, \nhowever, that the religious police in Saudi Arabia are very repressive \nagainst Christians.\n  While in Saudi Arabia, I visited a tent city right in the center of \nthe desert where we have 5,000 American soldiers who are there to \nprotect the Saudis, living under I think intolerable conditions, where \nthey cannot have an open exercise of their religious faith, be they \nJewish or Christian.\n  From my discussions with foreign leaders and religious minorities, it \nwas clear that the introduction of the Specter-Wolf bill has had a \nbeneficial impact by raising the issue's visibility. For example, \nArchbishop Silvano Tomasi, Vatican Ambassador to Ethiopia, complimented \nthe proposed legislation for raising the level of dialogue, adding \nthat, if it were enacted with a ``little bite,'' then so much the \nbetter.\n  I think this measure goes a long way in articulating the basic \nprinciples of religious freedom, which we prize so highly in America, \nand that we are exporting a fundamental American value. The bill I \nthink would have been preferable to have sanctions. But it would be \nimpossible to move it through the Senate. So we are taking a very \nsubstantial step forward in the legislation as it is currently framed. \nThe legislation brings fair and honest fact finding to the situation of \nreligious minorities around the world. It provides the necessary \nbalance of respecting cultural differences and promoting religious \ntolerance throughout the world. The legislation provides for a strong, \nindependent commission that can make recommendations based on honest \nfacts.\n  I want to compliment and commend especially New York Times columnist \nA.M. Rosenthal, who has had a very profound influence on the \nformulation of this legislation. You see his articles from time to \ntime, or you see a column from time to time, and there may be some \nimpact. But Mr. Rosenthal has published column after column and has \nbrought to the American people through the impressive op-ed page, or \neditorial page of the New York Times, discussions of the problems of \nreligious persecution around the world. I think it has had significant \neffect in moving this legislation forward.\n  In our discussions, again, I compliment our distinguished colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, for his leadership, along with Senator \nLieberman. Senator Coats has been a tower of strength. There have been \na number of kudos and compliments to Senator Coats as he leaves the \nU.S. Senate. However many compliments there have been, they are \ninsufficient, because he has made a tremendous contribution to the U.S. \nSenate. But I believe that this bill will be a tribute, in effect, to \nSenator Dan Coats and I think to all of those who have worked so hard \nfor its enactment.\n  Mr. President, how much of my 20 minutes remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Will the Chair doublecheck that? I have spoken very fast \nif I have said all of that in 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 9 minutes. He has 11 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You would have done better on the first one.\n  Mr. SPECTER. It all depends on what is ``better,'' Mr. President.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for \npermitting me to speak at the outset.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I want to again thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania for his support of this bill and for his leadership on the \nbill that passed the House of Representatives.\n  I will mention and compare a little bit between the House bill and \nthe Senate bill.\n  The House bill passed with an overwhelming vote. It came down very \nhard with punitive actions against countries that had gross violations \nof religious freedom, or had a lot of punitive action towards those \ncountries that participated in really the most atrocious type of \nreligious persecution--death, torture, imprisonment.\n  Again, I compliment Representative Wolf and Senator Specter for \nbringing that issue to the attention of the American people, maybe to \nthe world's attention, because a lot of people didn't know that people \nwere going to jail, that they were imprisoned for long periods of time, \nthey might be tortured, they might be actually killed for their \nreligious beliefs. This bill goes a little bit further than that. It \nmight be a little milder on the sanctions side because it gives the \nPresident a lot of options, and I would agree and I happen to think \nthat is the right action, but we also provide that we should recognize \nviolations of religious freedom including violations such as assembling \nfor peaceful religious activities, for speaking out on one's religion, \nfor changing one's religious beliefs, for possessing or distributing \nreligious materials or raising one's children in the religion of your \nchoice.\n  In other words, we believe religious freedom should be a basic right \nfor all Americans, for all people worldwide, and the United Nation's \ndeclaration includes such freedom. Countries that join the United \nNations say, yes, we believe in religious freedom, but yet we find \nthese things happening all the time.\n  As Members of the Senate and Members of the House, many of us have \nbeen engaged in trying to protect religious freedom when we find that \nmaybe our constituents are denied access, denied the opportunity to \nworship, maybe put in prison because they share their faith or they \nwish to worship in a particular country and they find that it is not \neven available. So our bill goes a little bit further than the House \nbill in the fact that we include a lot of other violations of religious \nfreedom.\n  I might mention a few other things, Mr. President, maybe outline some \nof the things that our bill does in comparison--not necessarily a \ncomparison with what the House did but an explanation of what our bill \ndoes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma will \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I would like to make a presentation of what is in the \nbill. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will wait until the gentleman is finished. I am going \nto ask a question about what is in the bill. I support the bill, but I \nwant to have just a brief discussion of something.\n  Let me ask the Senator from Oklahoma to finish, and then if he will \nyield for a question, I would appreciate it.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to.\n  Let me give a little rundown of what this bill does. And, again, I \nthank my colleague, Senator Lieberman, for cosponsoring it and for his \nwork. I will tell all my colleagues there has been a significant amount \nof work that has gone into this bill. Questions have been raised. We \ntried to alleviate some of those concerns.\n  I also wish to thank Senator Biden, Senator Feinstein, Senator Hagel, \nSenator Gramm, and others who have raised questions and who have worked \nwith us to try to solve some of those.\n  This bill creates a position with Ambassador rank called Ambassador \nat Large for International Religious Freedom. This Ambassador will \nserve as a full-time, high-level, single-issue diplomat working with \nthe State Department, trying to find out what religious persecution is \nhappening in various places around the world and to represent the \nadministration.\n  We also set up a Commission on International Religious Liberty. This \nis a 10-member, bipartisan commission with appointments from Congress \nand the President. It will provide an outside independent voice \ninvestigating religious persecution incidents, raising the profile of \nreligious persecution while making substantive policy recommendations \nto the Congress and the White House.\n\n[[Page S11910]]\n\n  On this commission of 10-members, the Ambassador at Large will be a \nnonvoting member. The President or the executive branch will be \nentitled to three commissioners and in Congress the President's party \nin each House will be entitled to an additional position on both sides \nfor a total of five, and the opposing party, in this case it would be \nthe Republicans--Democrats control the White House--the Republicans \nwould be entitled to two appointments from both the House and the \nSenate, for four.\n  This commission, being an independent commission, will have the \nauthority to investigate, to conduct hearings to find out what is \nhappening with religious freedom around the world, and be able to make \na report to the administration on their recommendations on how to \nalleviate religious persecution.\n  I might mention our goal is not to punish any country that is \nviolating or persecuting anybody because of their religious beliefs. \nThe goal is not to punish anybody. Our goal is to change behavior. Our \ngoal is to eliminate religious persecution. Our goal is to expand \nreligious freedom worldwide, and we have gone to great lengths to do \nthat.\n  Our bill says the commission will make its recommendations to the \nPresident and to Congress by May 1. There is also an additional report \nthat is made by the State Department on the advice of the Ambassador at \nLarge, and the State Department gives a country-by-country review of \nreligious freedom. They report that yes, there has been progress in \nsome countries or no, there has not been progress, but rather \nsignificant persecution in basically all countries with whom we have \nrelations.\n  I might mention we have human rights reports right now, human rights \nreports that cover these countries. But for the most part, in many \ncases, we have been silent on religious freedom in those countries. So \nnow we will be talking about an annual report on religious freedom and \npersecution.\n  And then we talk about responses, what can we do if we find that some \ncountries are violating individuals' or people's religious freedom. \nUnder the proposal, we have some positive things to promote religious \nfreedom.\n  The International Religious Freedom Act has several measures to \npromote religious liberty abroad. We have USAID funding for legal \nprotection of religious freedoms in restrictive countries. \nInternational broadcasting can be used to promote religious freedom. \nFulbright exchanges, for example, of religious leaders and scholars and \nlegal experts can be used. Religious freedom awards and performance pay \nfor meritorious Foreign Service officers; equal access to embassies for \nU.S. citizens at the embassy's discretion for nationals for religious \nactivities on terms not less favorable for other nongovernmental \nactivities; training for Foreign Service officers and refugee and \nasylum personnel to ensure the promotion of religious liberty, and \naccurate reporting of religious persecution and relief for victims of \npersecution.\n  We also have steps to directly target those agents and those \ncountries that are responsible for religious persecution, and we have \nseveral of those. Some people have said, well, those are various \nsanctions. And these people, talking about sanctions, they usually \nthink, well, we are going to have a wheat embargo. That is what \nhappened during the Carter administration when the Soviet Union invaded \nAfghanistan. I don't see that happening.\n  There are several items, so-called sanctions. We have 1 through 15, \nand I might mention the first one is a private demarche. The second one \nis an official demarche. Those can be letters to the embassy: We have \nreports of people being persecuted; we hope you don't do that anymore. \nIt might be a call to the Ambassador. It might be a call to the \nSecretary of State or to the diplomatic personnel that there are \nreports of religious persecution; we want that to be changed. Or it \ncould be more serious. We could cancel a scientific visit. We could \nhave cancellation of a cultural exchange. We could deny one or more \nState visits. We can cancel State visits. We can do several things.\n  And then we go into the possible range of economic sanctions. Some \npeople say, well, wait a minute, should you do this? Let's talk about \nit. These economic sanctions are only for the most egregious or the \nmore, what we define under our bill as particularly severe violations \nof religious freedom. And particularly severe violations of religious \nfreedom deals again with torture, imprisonment, deals with death, again \nthe most egregious forms of religious persecution. And in those areas \nwe have some economics--the withdrawal, limitation or suspension of \ndevelopment assistance. We have direction of the director of OPEC or \nTDA or EXIM not to approve guarantees, or we have the withdrawal, \nlimitation or suspension of security assistance. I might mention it \nsays ``limitation.'' It wouldn't have to be 100 percent. It could be 5 \npercent or it could be a little bit more.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask----\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  Mr. LOTT.

So that everybody will relax, I understand when I make some \nremarks and schedule announcements we will go back in a quorum. Nobody \nis disadvantaged. Nothing is going to change.\n  I have requested this time for two purposes.\n  No. 1, to say that we do have a lot of work we need to do. One of the \nthings I am considering doing here momentarily is going to a nomination \nso we will have time to work through and agree on a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  But the other thing is, I think right now we are seeing the worst of \nthe Senate, the worst of the Senate on all sides. We have work to do. \nWe have about 48 hours left. We have several bills that people want to \nget done, vocational education, religious persecution--a number of \nother bills that have been worked on all over this Capitol. Many of \nthem will be overwhelmingly or unanimously supported. And here we are, \nnow, locked in a procedure where neither side will agree to anything. I \njust don't think it is in the best tradition of the Senate. I realize \nthe Senate always works at the pleasure of any one Senator, but I think \nwe also work because we always seek consensus.\n  I am for H.R. 10. I have been for that legislation from the \nbeginning. I have given a lot of time to try to move it forward. I know \nthere are people who have objections to it. As a matter of fact, some \nof the objections that they have, I agree with. It is not a perfect \nbill. But I think that we need to try to find a way to work through \nthis, where we can continue to do business. I will do everything I can \nto make sure that neither side is disadvantaged. I have two of my very \nclosest friends and colleagues that have major problems with this bill, \nbut I am also very committed to dealing fairly with those who are for \nthe bill. I want to try to continue to work to find a way to get it \ndone. So I don't think it really serves either side to just shut us \ndown here at 6:15, 2 days before we go out, and not allow us to get \nanything else done tonight.\n  So, I am going to appeal to both sides to work with me, to try to \nfind a way to get this business done that we can do, some nominations \nthat are not controversial on either side, and the religious \npersecution bill, and vocational education--and without disadvantages \nto anybody. So I ask Senators on both sides to do that. I appeal to \nthem. And I will help try to make this happen.\n  But I want to go on the record saying that I think this spectacle \nthat we are seeing right now is very unbecoming of the Senate, and \nrather than just steam about it, I thought I would say it publicly. I \nfeel better now, Mr. President.\n  Momentarily I will move to a nomination or I will ask for a unanimous \nconsent agreement that will allow us to complete action on the \nreligious persecution bill. But I must say to both sides, I will not \nlet either side gridlock the Senate. I will not do it. I will use\n\n[[Page S11911]]\n\nevery tool at my disposal and I will also do everything publicly I can \nto make sure people understand who is not being cooperative in this \neffort.\n  I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the majority leader withhold that request? One of \nthe things we probably should have done a little earlier--I didn't know \nwe were going to get stuck in this mess --would the majority leader go \nahead and propound the unanimous consent request that we go ahead and \nvote tomorrow morning at 9:30 on the Religious Freedom Act, because I \ndon't think there is any objection to that. I don't know how long this \nlittle debate will go, but I want to make sure we get that request \nmade.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the recorded vote on religious \npersecution occur at 9:30 on Friday morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the majority leader withhold just for a moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. During this quorum call, would anyone be inconvenienced if \nsome of us who want to speak as in morning business be allowed to \nspeak?\n  Mr. LOTT. There is a problem with doing that until we get this \nagreement worked out. We would actually go to H.R. 10, as I understand \nit. I would like for us to use this time, but both sides are still \napprehensive about it. I asked for this time as majority leader and got \nit but I think, beyond that--we cannot do it\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, reserving the right to object, I obviously won't, \nwould the majority leader then, in the UC that you are working on, make \nprovision, then, for 30 minutes for morning business for me at the end \nof whatever else is going to be done here?\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to do that. And I would like for other \nSenators who might have a need for morning business time to get that \ntime. We will block that in before we finish up with the UC.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I will not, \nbut will we also at sometime before the chariots suddenly disappear on \nSunday or Monday or whenever it happens--will we go to some of the \njudges?\n  Mr. LOTT. We are working now to go to No. 597, which is a State \nJustice Institute position. And we are working to try to go to the \nnomination of Mr. Paez. There are those who want time to talk about \nthat. I hope we could do that tonight and tomorrow. But we will \ncontinue to try to get agreement on Paez. That is the one we are \nworking on right now. We will either get to debate and vote on that \ntonight or, more likely, it looks like now, tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If I may comment further, Mr. President, I will not delay \nthis further. We have about 25 on the calendar itself --judges. I hope \nduring the next few hours, or early tomorrow, the majority leader and I \nand a couple of others who are interested in this--Senator Hatch I am \nsure is--and others, that we might have a chance to talk about moving \nsome of these other judges.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I observe the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11910-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11911-S11912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that H.R. 10 now be \nthe pending business, and immediately following the reporting by the \nclerk, the Senate resume H.R. 2431--that is the religious persecution \nbill--and that following the conclusion or yielding back of the time, \nthe previous consent governing H.R. 2431, commence. I further ask that \nfollowing the disposition of time on H.R. 2431 this evening, the clerk \nthen report H.R. 10, and the Senate then proceed immediately to a \nperiod for morning business.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I would like to inquire of the majority leader, I take \nit, then, that it is not the intention of the majority leader to file a \ncloture motion on H.R. 10 this evening.\n  Mr. LOTT. It is not my intention to do that.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is, therefore, the intention of the majority leader \nto let this day pass and go over into another day; in other words, we \nlose a day on a cloture motion if one were to be filed.\n  Mr. LOTT. We do, because as I have assessed the situation, there are \nenough opportunities for cloture votes and delays that it would take us \ninto next week. If you just look at the math, that is where it would \ngo. You can go back and examine how we got in this position, and the \nanswer is very simple: We have been trying to do other bills.\n  The only way we are going to get H.R. 10 now is by concession and by \nconsensus, which is quite often the way the Senate works. We are going \nto have to see if we can find a way for Democrats who have worked on \nthis bill and Republicans who have worked on it, some who have problems \nwith it on both sides, can come together. There is also a concern from \nSecretary Rubin about a provision in the bill. But I would like to get \nit done. But we are not going to get it done by cloture motions. \nTherefore, I have no problem with going over another day and continuing \nto work and hope that we can find a way to come to an agreement on this \nbill.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I simply point out to the majority leader that the bill \ncame out of the committee 16 to 2; that the relevant cloture vote we \nhad where people differed was 88 to 11. There is extremely strong \nsupport for this legislation. It is obviously being frustrated and \nthwarted by a handful of people.\n  It was my concern that the opportunity to file this cloture motion \nnot pass. In view of the statement of the majority leader that he has \nno intention to do that, to file the cloture motion, I am not going to \nobject to the consent request, and then we move over until tomorrow. I \nwanted to keep this window of opportunity available, and now that I \nknow that the majority leader has no intention of availing himself of \nit, I am prepared to agree to this consent request.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator from Maryland is trying to get the majority \nleader to take full responsibility for not filing cloture today, I \naccept it. It is my goal to get a bill, and I concluded that another \ncloture motion at this time on this bill is fruitless. I am perfectly \nwilling to accept that responsibility.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Let me also point out to the majority leader that the \neffort to try to develop accommodations has to be a broad-based effort.\n  Mr. LOTT. It surely does.\n  Mr. SARBANES. When we come in with 88 people on one side of the \nequation, if the 11 are going to hold us hostage or some of the 11 \nhostage--actually the word ``extortion'' was used in another context in \nthe debate on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. LOTT. You wouldn't want to use that word. I think I have a card \nhere I can call you on.\n  Mr. SARBANES. People are going to be highly resistant, I might say to \nthe majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I want to remind the Senator from Maryland, I was one of \nthe 88, not one of the 11, but the 11 is on both sides of the aisle. We \nare never going to get an agreement until we get the 11 to feel \ncomfortable that they have the opportunity that they are entitled to \nunder the rules to make their point. It is the wonderful way the Senate \nworks.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I know, but a lot of us have given at the committee \nover and over again to get the bill where it is.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is the price you pay for that wonderful assignment. It \nis a great committee to be on. You get all that good stuff. We did the \ncredit union bill this year. A lot of credit goes to everybody for \nthat.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We did the housing bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Housing bill, you have done a lot of good stuff.\n  Mr. SARBANES. A lot of good work.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think I want on that committee next year.\n  Mr. SARBANES. We would welcome you. You would be a valuable addition\n\n[[Page S11912]]\n\nto the committee, and you can see the inner dynamics of the committee \nthat result in the kind of problem we are now facing on the floor of \nthe Senate. It would be welcomed for you to be in that cockpit seeing \nwhat takes place.\n  Mr. LOTT. I appreciate that invitation, but I want to assure the \nSenator from Maryland that Senator Daschle and I get to see the \ndynamics of such meetings every day in more ways than you would ever \nwant to know.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. That may be, but I don't think unless you are actually \nthere to see it firsthand you can fully appreciate exactly what takes \nplace.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I say to \nSenator Nickles, thanks for your diligent work. I say to Senator \nSarbanes, Senator Gramm and Senator Shelby thanks for your cooperation \nat this time. And we hope we will have it again tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11911-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11912-S11942]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FINANCIAL SERVICES ACT OF 1998\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I just simply want to say to my colleague, \nSenator Sarbanes, and to others who support this bill, that I am \nwilling, and have continued to be willing, to sit down and try to work \nsomething out. It may be that nothing can be worked out, but I just \nwant to reaffirm my willingness to sit down with Senator Sarbanes, or \nany other person, who is in a position to work anything out--certainly \nSenator Sarbanes is--and see if we could find some common ground. Maybe \nwe cannot. But I just want to reaffirm my willingness to do it. I have \nsat down and discussed this with Senator Dodd. And I am willing to do \nit again.\n  So it may be that there is no way we can accommodate the different \nviews we have, but I wanted to reaffirm my willingness to make an \neffort again. Though it may or may not prove fruitless, I am willing to \ndo it. And I would like to work something out because, save the so-\ncalled CRA provisions, I am for this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I know the distinguished Senator from \nOklahoma wants to be heard, but I would just like to pick up on this \nlast point, if I could, if my colleague from Texas would yield--\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not have the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. To say to my colleague from Texas, and others, I didn't \nhave the benefit of hearing my friend's comments from Maryland, but I \nfervently hope--it has taken almost 20 years for us to come to the \npoint where we are with financial services modernization. And my \ncolleague from Texas has been on that committee for a long time, the \ndistinguished Senator from Maryland even longer and knows the agony we \nhave gone through, Mr. President, over the years of coming close and \nfailing, for a variety of reasons, to be able to put through a \nmodernization bill that would enjoy the kind of support this bill does.\n  And here we have the world looking to us. You have news today of the \nyen now having, compared to the dollar in exchange rates, in the last \n48 hours, dropped to a lower rate than it has in 50 years--50 years. We \nhave a problem in Brazil of significant magnitude.\n  It is no secret here that the world looks to us for a sense of \nconfidence. And here we are within hours of leaving this session of \nCongress with a strong bipartisan bill, led by the Senator from \nMaryland, the Senator from New York, Senator D'Amato, the chairman of \nthe committee, with a 16-2 vote coming out of that committee, and 88-11 \non a cloture motion.\n  My colleague from Texas feels strongly about the CRA provisions, and \nI respect that. But I would strongly argue that there is going to be \nample time for us, whether today or tomorrow, if we can get it done, \nbut if not certainly the next Congress to deal with the CRA provisions.\n  There may not be another opportunity that comes along to deal with \nthis issue, I say to my friend from Texas. As he knows, we have spent \nso many years trying to put together--here we are on the threshold of \ndoing something truly significant in this Congress, and as strongly as \npeople feel about CRA, we should never allow that issue here to deprive \nus the opportunity to send a message not only here at home, but abroad \nthat this country, that this Congress can modernize its financial \ninstitutions to such a degree that we send that message of confidence \nat this critical hour, a message of confidence.\n  The Democrats and Republicans have been able to come together on an \nissue that has divided us over the years. So I fervently hope that we \nwill not allow that one issue to outweigh the enormous benefits that \nthis bill offers people at home and abroad when the world financial \ncrisis is literally on our doorstep.\n  So I hope that either something gets worked out or that those who are \nfor it would be willing to put aside their feelings on the CRA issue \nuntil another day when there will literally be dozens of vehicles when \nthat issue can be addressed. Mr. President, I tell you today, there \nwill not be the dozens of vehicles available to us to do what we on the \nBanking Committee were able to present to all of our colleagues here \nfor the first time in more than two decades, some would argue more than \nthree decades. So the opportunity is here. I just hope we do not miss \nthis.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I had the floor, and I think time is running. And we \nwant to get back to our bill. I appreciate the comments that were made \nby the Senator from Texas, the Senator from Connecticut. And I echo \nthose comments. I hope we can come to a compromise. I hope people do \nnot draw the lines too firm in the sand and not allow us to make some \nminor adjustments to save a bill that is very important.\n  Mr. GRAMM. At the risk of overdoing it, could I have 30 seconds?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator 30 seconds, but it is my \nintention to go back to the Religious Freedom Act.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It is interesting. I know what happens in these debates is \nwe end up talking past each other. But the Senator's statement about \n``let's leave CRA to deal with next year'' is precisely my position. \nThe problem is, the bill has six new CRA provisions. So if we were \nleaving CRA to be dealt with next year, we would have no dispute; we \ncould debate it next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will yield to my colleague from Maryland for 1 minute \nand then I am going to return to debate on the Religious Freedom Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair must ask if there is unanimous \nconsent for the Senator to yield, because questions have not been \nasked. And under the rules the Senator cannot--\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield to my colleague for a question.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I simply want to say to my colleague that I listened \ncarefully to the distinguished Senator from Texas and this offer to try \nto work this out. The fact of the matter is, that colleagues have been \nbuzzing around the Senator from Texas all week, like bees around a \nhoneypot, although I am not sure describing the Senator from Texas as a \nhoneypot is necessarily a very accurate description.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I like it.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I think there have been very reasonable efforts to \nreach an accommodation. They have not really gotten anywhere. If the \nSenator intends, in the name of accommodation, to make very substantial \nand substantive changes, then obviously a lot of people are going to \nhave great difficulty with that. We have worked through this issue, and \nwe reached an overwhelming consensus about it. And it seems to me that \nthe effort now to sort of significantly rewrite these provisions is \njust not going to happen.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I am going to return to debate. And I ask \nunanimous consent that the hour and 40 minutes that intervened since my \nprevious comments and the time allotted in the discussions and the \nquorum calls be outside the debate on the entire debate that we have on \nthe religious freedom issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I was running through the potential \nsanctions, sanctions that would only apply for countries that were \nguilty of particularly severe violations of religious freedom. And \nparticularly severe violations of religious freedom under our bill \nmeans: ``Systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious \nfreedom, including violations such as torture, cruel, inhuman, \ndegrading treatment or punishment, prolonged detention without charges, \ncausing the disappearance of persons by the abduction or clandestine \ndetention of those persons, and other flagrant denials of the right to \nlife, liberty or the security of persons.''\n  And so, Mr. President, we define that. That is really bad the actors. \nIn those cases, our bill says that we would have economic sanctions. I \nwas just discussing those. That would include the withdrawal, \nlimitation or suspension of development assistance. It says \n``limitation.'' It didn't say ``automatically all of it be limited, but \nat least some withdrawal or some limitation.\n  It gives the President the flexibility--a whole range of options. \nAlso it would direct the director of OPEC or TDA or EXIM not to approve \nguarantees, extensions or credits to the governments involving gross \nviolations to religious freedom.\n  It also would have a sanction that would allow the withdrawal, \nlimitation or suspension of security assistance. Again, it could be \nsuspension. It could be limitation.\n  Also, another option would be instructing U.S. directors of \ninternational financial institutions to vote against loans to \ngovernments involving gross violations of religious freedom.\n  Another sanction option would be to prohibit the licenses or \nauthority to export goods or technology to governments determined to be \nresponsible for such persecution involving gross violations of \nreligious freedom; another prohibiting any U.S. financial institution \nfrom providing credits totaling more than $10 million in any year to \ngovernments involving gross violation as to religious freedom; and one \nfinal one prohibiting the U.S. Government from procuring goods or \nservices from foreign governments involved in gross violations.\n  We have given the President a multitude of options, a range, which \ncould reduce economic assistance or economic loans to those countries. \nAlso, I might mention, we give the President the option to waive these \nsanctions. We have modified that to accommodate some of the concerns \nthat some of our people have. The sanctions can be waived to further \nthe purposes of the act.\n  If persons involved--maybe the commission that studied this, maybe it \nis the Ambassador, maybe the State Department--said, ``Wait a minute, \nsome of these sanctions might do more harm than good,'' the sanctions \ncould be waived. It might result in greater persecution of individual \nbeliefs by some governments. Our Government would have the option to \nwaive these sanctions. Or we modify it to include that the sanctions \ncould be waived for national security interests. We modified that to \nsay ``for important national interests'' the sanctions could be waived.\n  We have in this bill an ambassador-at-large for international \nreligious freedom; we have a commission of high-level people appointed \nby Congress and by the President to study and to make recommendations \nto the Congress and to the President, the Commission on International \nReligious Liberty, to make recommendations on what can be done to \npromote religious liberty worldwide; and we have given some tools and \noptions to encourage positive behavior, positive efforts as well as \nsome punitive efforts to try to modify behavior.\n  Our purpose in this bill is not to punish any country. Our purpose is \nto modify behavior to improve religious liberty worldwide. We don't \nwant to be picking up the paper as we did earlier this year when the \nNew York Times, for example, on May 11, had an article that said a \nPakistani Catholic cleric was buried. It said a Roman Catholic bishop \ncommitted suicide last week apparently to protest religious \ndiscrimination. Religious discrimination and persecution must be pretty \nsevere if a bishop would commit suicide to protest the degree of \npersecution.\n  Other people have talked about Christians being sold into slavery in \nSudan, or other countries where Christians, Jews, or other individuals \nwere placed in prison merely for practicing their faith.\n  I want to thank again my colleagues who worked with me on this \nlegislation. I mentioned Senator Specter earlier. I mentioned Senator \nLieberman who has worked with me in countless meetings for hours trying \nto work out this legislation. Senator Coats from Indiana is on the \nfloor and will be called upon momentarily. No one has worked harder. I \ntold him some time ago I feel that he is one of the best Senators I \nhave had the opportunity to work with, and I mean that in all \nsincerity. He is a person with very strong religious beliefs and \nconvictions, and his efforts to see this bill pass to make sure that we \nimprove religious liberty worldwide are very much recognized, very much \nappreciated by this Senator, and I think by all Senators. I also would \nlike to thank my colleagues, Senator Biden and Senator Feinstein, who \nhave also worked with us in putting this legislation together.\n  I want to thank a couple of other people who have also worked in this \neffort. Steve Moffitt of my staff put in a lot of energy and a lot of \nthe effort. John Hanford has put in years trying to enact measures to \nprotect people who have been persecuted worldwide for religious \nbeliefs. Also, on Senator Lieberman's staff, Cecile Shea has worked \ncountless hours on this. I thank them for their efforts.\n  I see my colleague from Indiana is on the floor. I am happy to yield \nhim such time as he desires on this legislation.\n  How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 41 minutes 49 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield my colleague as much time as he desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, first of all, I begin by thanking my \ncolleague and my friend from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, for his \nfriendship over the years as a Member of the Congress, in the last 10 \nyears as a Member of the Senate, for his tireless work on a number of \nimportant issues facing this country, and for his willingness to take \non this issue, as difficult as the negotiations have been, to \npersevere, to bring it to this particular point. Senator Nickles has \nprovided effective\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\nleadership and perseverance in resolving what I think is one of the \nmost important issues that this Senate will be dealing with in this \nsession of Congress.\n  There are many others and I will mention some of those names at a \nlater point.\n  The United States, which we are privileged and pleased to be citizens \nof, has long been considered a pillar of freedom around the world. Our \nNation was founded by individuals fleeing persecution and \ndiscrimination throughout Europe. The founding documents of our country \nenshrine the value and principle of religious freedom. The very first \nclause of the first amendment guarantees each of us the right of free \nexercise of religion and prohibits our Government from dictating or \nestablishing how we will worship and what we will believe.\n  Freedom of religion is enshrined in our founding documents because \nfreedom of religion is a basic human right. In our country, this \nfreedom is acknowledged as a right endowed not by man, not by those who \nwrote those documents, but by our Creator. Therefore, they are \nunalienable and cannot be removed.\n  Religious freedom is also recognized in the Universal Declaration of \nHuman Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948. That declaration \nguarantees freedom of religion, including the freedom to choose one's \nown religious belief, to worship, to observe and practice one's belief \nindividually or corporately. The freedom to practice one's religion \nwithout fear of outside intervention is the most fundamental liberty \nthat any human being can possess.\n  We have a history as a country of concern not only for our own \nreligious freedom but also for religious freedom in other countries. We \nwant to stand as a beacon for religious freedom because we believe it \ngoes to the most basic and most essential of all human freedoms and all \nhuman rights.\n  The cold war brought considerable national attention to the plight of \nSoviet Jews who faced extreme religious intolerance and persecution. \nUnited States concerns ultimately translated into national policy, \nincluding the enactment of the Jackson-Vanik law which tied trade with \nthe Soviet Union and other Communist nations to their allowing Jews to \nemigrate--just one example of how this Nation has translated into \npolicy these basic fundamental beliefs.\n  By contrast, there has been little focus lately, unfortunately, on \nsome of the increasing persecution of Christians and some of the \nhorrific persecution of Christians and other peoples of faith around \nthe world. As a nation, we have assumed a responsibility, a moral \nimperative, to raise the basic human rights issues, the basic examples \nof persecution, to use the tools available to us to motivate change \ntoward these individuals in various countries around the world \npracticing various faiths. Individuals are persecuted for that belief \nand that practice.\n  It is evident that many people--not just Christians, but several \nfaiths--suffer because of their faith. The form that these attacks take \ncan be everything from discrimination in employment, denial of \nparticipation in the political process, denial of common rights of \ncitizenship. But these attacks can also take the form of extreme \nphysical harm, torture, imprisonment, slavery, and even death. A fact \nof our time, the fact of the history of mankind, is that people have \nbeen persecuted and are being persecuted for their religious belief and \nfor their faith. There are abuses in many places around the world of \npeople persecuted simply because of what they believe.\n  Paul Marshall, in his book, ``Their Blood Cries Out,'' effectively \nchronicles where persecution is occurring. In great detail, he presents \na comprehensive view of this problem throughout the world. His \nexhaustive survey simply cannot be ignored. It is a powerful and \npersuasive analysis which ultimately begs the question: What will we \ndo? How will we respond? Will we respond? Is there action that we can \ntake?\n  He talks about offenses in countries around the world--these have \nbeen documented--in Sudan, Pakistan, Vietnam, Cuba, Iran, Saudi Arabia, \nChina, and others.\n  In the Sudan, possibly the worst of the offenders, it is not just \nChristians who have faced persecution, but Muslims and Animists, who \nhave opposed the repressive tactics of the Islamic military regime \nwhich took power in 1989. Many Arab Muslims from the north have been \narrested, imprisoned, tortured and killed. Christians driven from their \nhomelands to government-controlled areas of the country are forced to \nrenounce their faith in order to receive basic food. Others, including \nblack Africans, are forced to convert to Islam and are even enslaved. \nAll told, 1.5 million people have been killed by this totalitarian \nregime and another 5 million have been displaced from their homes.\n  In Pakistan, Paul Marshall describes the problem not as one of state-\ndirected intolerance, but as one due to the growth of militant Islamic \nforces attacking Christians. Christian Pakistanis often become the \nvictims of murder. The blasphemy law, passed in 1986, requires death \nsentences to any who blasphemes against the Prophet Mohammed or the \nQu'ran. This law has given way to a wave of terror against Christians \nand other religious minorities.\n  Buddhist and Christians in Vietnam are subject to arrest and \nharassment if they are not part of the officially recognized churches. \nAs in China, government control over religion seems due to fear of loss \nof control over the people. Paul Marshall writes that ``priests and \npastors are assaulted, harassed, fined, sentenced to re-education camps \nand imprisoned. Many die in prison, some of them after torture.''\n  In Cuba as well, the government attempts to rigidly control religion. \nChurches cannot run schools or use mass communications. They are \nprohibited from performing missionary work and the distribution of \nreligious material is controlled. There has, however, been tremendous \ngrowth in churches in Cuba, primarily in the form of house churches. \nThe Cuban Government has also sought to restrict religion by imposing a \nban on the sale of paper, ink, typewriters, computers and other \nprinting device to any religious organization.\n  In Iran, those who believe in the Baha'i faith are forcibly repressed \nby the Iranian Government. They are denied the right to assemble and \nelect their religious officials, their property is confiscated and they \nare denied basic civil and legal rights. More than 200 Baha'is have \nbeen killed in Iran since 1989. Christians and Jews likewise face \npersecution in Iran, including discrimination, imprisonment, and death. \nOne Christian human rights groups describes the treatment of Christians \nand Jews as ``Religious apartheid.''\n  In Saudi Arabia, only the practice of the Sunni form of Islam is \npermitted. No public expression of Christianity is allowed. Those found \nwith Bibles or crosses can be tortured and arrested. The Saudi \nGovernment even went so far as to demand that a Christian group meeting \nin the American Consulate be disbanded. Unfortunately, our Consulate \nobliged them by closing worship service, this in an American Embassy.\n\n  In China, the Christian home churches are flourishing despite the \nCommunist government moves to strictly control churches. I trust we are \nfamiliar with the accounts of thousands of Catholic and Protestant \nChinese who have been imprisoned for worshiping, preaching and \ndistributing Bibles.\n  This is but a handful of examples of where intolerance occurs around \nthe world. Clearly, we cannot hold each nation and people to the same \nstandard we have in the United States. But neither can we ignore the \ndramatic, reprehensible, and documented accounts of what is happening.\n  Yet it is clear we cannot oversimplify the problem of religious \nintolerance in these and other countries. While persecution in some \ncountries is the direct result of official government policy, in \nothers, persecution is undertaken by groups and individuals, with no \nattempt by the governing officials to intervene. Further, while some \nreligious persecution is simply part of an overall repressive regime \neager to control the lives of the people, other persecution is \nspecifically targeted at religious freedoms.\n  In addition, the promotion of human rights, including religious \nfreedom, is only one interest of the United States in conducting \nforeign policy. We also must promote strong relations with\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\ncountries vital to our national security and pursue policies designed \nto promote our economic interests.\n  Yet as a Nation, especially a Nation with our heritage, we cannot \nclose our eyes to real abuses and persecutions taking place. We cannot \nstand idly by, complacent, apathetic, pretending to be ignorant. \nBecause we are not ignorant. We must act wisely, but we must act. We \nneed a comprehensive policy which draws greater attention to specific \nproblems and works to change behavior. We must have a balance, always \nkeeping in mind the plight of individuals and the role the United \nStates can play in changing the behavior of other governments. \nReligious liberty has been our gift from the founders of this country; \nit is also our responsibility, and our torch to bear.\n  The Secretary of State's Advisory Committee on Religious Freedom \nAbroad issued an interim report in January 1998. That report described \nour policy goals in this way:\n\n       The aim of U.S. foreign policy in this area should be to \n     influence governments, with both positive and negative \n     inducements and through public and private diplomacy, to live \n     up to international standards of religious freedom.\n\n  This legislation can, first of all, alert us to the situations as \nthey exist around the world, and then provide us a road map in terms of \nhow we can most effectively address them.\n  The bill before us, introduced by Senators Nickel, Specter and \nLieberman, is designed to promote and elevate religious freedom in our \nNation's conduct of foreign policy. My friends on the House side, led \nby Congressman Frank Wolf of Virginia, have been tireless in pressing \nfor this issue. I would like to take a moment to give credit to \nCongressman Wolf who has, without a doubt, been the most persistent and \nrelentless advocate of our taking action to address the problem of \nreligious freedom, together with Chris Smith, and others in the House \nof Representatives. They have provided the impetus for this action and \nthey have, through persuasion and education of Members of the House, \nalerted them to the problem that exists and achieved a very significant \nvote in favor of what was then the Wolf-Specter bill. That bill has \npassed the House of Representatives and now, in the waning hours of the \n105th Congress, the Senate, after exhaustive negotiations, after a \nprocess that has gone on for an extraordinary amount of time, finds \nitself at this place.\n  Mr. President, a great number of people deserve credit for this work, \nincluding John Hanford of Senator Lugar's staff, Steve Moffitt, and my \nown very able legislative assistant, Pam Sellars, and others on Senator \nNickles' staff and Senator Lieberman's staff, have worked tirelessly to \nfashion legislation that will survive the myriad of procedural \nprocesses that we have to go through here in order to bring a bill to \nthe floor, particularly in the waning hours. A great deal of effort and \nwork has been put into making this a reality. I am so pleased that we \nstand here this evening on the verge of passage of what I think is an \nextraordinarily important piece of legislation.\n  This presents a viable policy to strengthen religious freedoms \nabroad. The bill is balanced in its approach, it is comprehensive in \nits treatment, and it enables our Nation to custom-tailor our response \nto religious persecution in other lands. It puts in place measures \nwhich institutionalize our Nation's historic principles and religious \nliberty in our relations with other nations.\n  We establish an ambassador for international religious freedom to \nhelp the State Department in assessing nations which engage or tolerate \nreligious persecution and to help promote religious freedom. We set up \na process to ensure that the State Department is adequately focusing on \nreligious freedom issues by requiring them to report to the Congress. \nEach year, State will issue a country-wide assessment of religious \nfreedom abroad with specific summaries of which countries are improving \ntheir records and in what ways our Government is actively engaging to \nchange behavior that is not acceptable.\n  Most important, this bill establishes an independent commission of \nexperts, appointed by the White House, the House of Representatives, \nand the Senate, to monitor religious freedom on an ongoing basis and to \nmake recommendations to Congress on actions the U.S. can take in \ncountries when persecution occurs. This is important because this is \ninformation that we need. We no longer will be able to simply consign \nreligious persecution and religious freedom to some clip we might read \nin the paper, or to some report that might come across our desk. We \nwill have a commission constituted of reputable individuals, \nknowledgeable individuals, who will be able to present to us, on an \nannual basis, a detailed report of exactly what we are facing around \nthe world. That can be the basis for this Congress and that can be the \nbasis for the State Department and the administration--whichever \nadministration is in power--to take significant action and specific \naction to address these problems. I think that is the most important \npart of this bill and the one that will provide the impetus for our \ntaking effective action.\n  There are a number of other provisions, and Senator Nickles has laid \nsome of them out--and others will discuss those--each of which is \nimportant to the success of this legislation.\n  On May 14, 1998, the House passed Congressman Wolf's legislation--the \nFreedom From Religious Persecution Act--by an overwhelming margin of \n375-41. Again, I commend my colleague, Frank Wolf, for his leadership \non this issue. His efforts, along with a number of others, have brought \nrecognition of the plight of people of faith throughout the world to \nour attention.\n  It is now time for us to act. It is time for us to establish an \neffective foreign policy which can respond to religious persecution \nthat we find around the world and which seeks to change the behavior of \nthose responsible. I trust that the Senate will follow what the House \nhas done and demonstrate a strong, if not unanimous, vote for this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I want to quote from the Statement of \nConscience, issued by the National Evangelical Association on January \n23, 1996:\n       Religious liberty is not a privilege to be granted or \n     denied by an all-powerful state, but a God-given human right. \n     Indeed, religious liberty is the bedrock principle that \n     animates our Republic and defines us as a people. We must \n     share our love of religious liberty with other peoples, who \n     in the eyes of God are our neighbors. Hence, it is our \n     responsibility and that of the Government that represents us, \n     to do everything we can to secure the blessing of religious \n     liberty to all those suffering from religious persecution.\n\n  Mr. President, we in this country cannot begin to comprehend what \npeople of faith in other nations have had to endure. They have had to \nput their health, their wealth, their family, their fortunes, and their \nvery lives on the line. Many lives have been sacrificed in the name of \nreligious expression, religious belief. The persecution, which takes \nplace in many countries around this world, is almost too horrible to \ndescribe. As a Nation, as a people who have been so blessed with the \nfreedom of religious belief, the least we can do is to hold ourselves \nout as an example and model to many nations around the world, but, more \nimportantly, demonstrate through our policy that this violent human \nrights issue is an issue that cannot be ignored, sacrificed to trade, \nsacrificed to diplomatic relations, or to anything.\n  The basic human right, endowed by our Creator, for freedom of \nworship, freedom of belief, is something that the world desperately \nneeds, something that we can promote. This legislation is designed to \ndo that. I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I cannot emphasize \nenough my deep conviction that we must act swiftly on this issue on \nwhich our country has, unfortunately, been silent on too long. We are \nnow acting. We have come to that point. It is with great joy, I \nbelieve, in our hearts and in the hearts of people of faith throughout \nthe world that the Senate will enact this. Our deep hope and belief is \nthat the President of the United States will sign it and it will become \nthe official policy of the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Lieberman, who will \nbe managing this bill for the other side of the aisle, is not present. \nI yield 10 minutes to my colleague from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, tomorrow, our Founding Fathers are \ngoing to be proud of us. Tomorrow as we pass, hopefully, this \nInternational Religious Freedom Act, they will be\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\nproud of the tradition that we have carried on, a tradition that finds \nits wording above our mantels here in this hall and says ``In God We \nTrust,'' a tradition that finds itself rooted in freedom, particularly \nreligious freedom and religious expression of freedom. They will be \nproud that we passed this act and that we stand--and stand strong--\naround the world for religious freedom, freedom from persecution, and \nallow people of conscience to express their conscience and their \ndesires as they see them fit before God.\n\n  Today, I stand to support the International Religious Freedom Act \nwhich addresses religious persecution worldwide. It is a noble and \nsignificant effort to confront an ancient prejudice which permeates \nsocieties and produces deep suffering.\n  I fervently hope that this legislation will be passed for many \nreasons. This legislation is an expression of solidarity with embattled \nminority faith communities worldwide. It supports those who simply and \nhumbly seek to practice their religion in peace without crushing \ngovernmental interference. It supports those who were commanded to stop \nworshiping their God and refused. It supports those who fear for safety \nand even life, yet continue against the odds.\n  This is a legislative memorial to anyone who has been unjustly \nimprisoned for their faith, especially for the ones who refused to \nrecant on principle and remained incarcerated for years, even decades. \nThis is a memorial to peaceful believers who presently sit in jails \nthroughout the world for the crime of daring to express their love of \nGod. We put it above our doors in the U.S. Senate. We have written ``In \nGod We Trust.'' Other people around the world sit in jail for uttering \nthat same phrase.\n\n  This is a memorial to all persecuted believers who strain towards \njustice and freedom, and have no advocates.\n  I admire this bill particularly because it addresses the problem of \nstate-sponsored persecution of peaceful religious groups. This is the \nmost insidious form of persecution. How do sincere people of faith \nstand against the crushing onslaught of a hostile government? How does \nan individual, or a small faith community, stand against a national \nsecurity force? Imagine countries where entire divisions of the \nnational police are dedicated to stalking peaceful people of faith. Now \nimagine being the victim of this onslaught without any defense or \nadvocates, whatsoever. This is true in communist nations, in developing \nnations, in ultra-nationalist nations. Bottom line--any individual who \ndares to stand alone, to stand against a hostile national government \nfor their peaceful faith convictions deserves our advocacy. And this \nlegislation provides tools for that advocacy.\n  In his 14th-century epic poem, ``The Divine Comedy,'' Dante believes \na place reserved in the Inferno for those who refused to take a stand \non the great moral issues of the day. I believe that religious freedom \nis one of those great moral issues. It is abundantly clear that in some \nparts of the world, your religious identity is your death-warrant. This \nis simply wrong and should not be. Knowing the generosity of the \nAmerican spirit, I believe that we all agree that religious liberty is \nworth our defense, that our nation was founded on this principle, and \nthat it is central to the core of our American character. This \nlegislation powerfully expresses our national concern for the sanctity \nof this fundamental right, internationally.\n  Is religious persecution advocacy our responsibility? It is certainly \nno less justified than our support for democracy dissidents in China or \nfor Sakharov and Soltzenitsyn during the earlier days of Soviet Russia. \nThere are striking parallels between both movements. Both, upon \nprinciple, refuse to bow their knee to the crushing dictates of hostile \nnational governments. I am compelled by the stark image of a lone \nperson refusing to recant a precious belief, and consequently \nincarcerated for the practice of fundamental rights, including free \nspeech, assembly and association.\n  This occurs routinely in communist countries and other fundamentalist \nregimes. There are countless Chinese Christians who have been \nincarcerated for 20 years and more for their faith. Jail is known as \n``Chinese seminary'' because the government incarcerates so many people \nfor the crime of illegally sharing their faith. In North Vietnam, it's \neven worse where, routinely, people of faith are incarcerated for 10 or \n15 years. But the government does not stop there. Extended family \nmembers are also imprisoned, from grandparents and parents, to siblings \nand children--three generations because of one religious believer.\n  If we freedom-loving people do not stand for this fundamental \nprinciple who will? It is my honor to continue to advance the \nelementary notion that this is an inalienable right, which no one can \ndictate, not even a government. It is a higher principle, protected, \ndivine, precious, fundamental, universal and vastly personal. And it \ndeserves our protest on shear principle, so I am grateful for the \nadvocacy tools provided by this legislation.\n  Throughout the centuries, many have fought for religious liberty at \ngreat personal cost. There is a magnificent cloud of witnesses who look \ndown upon us, their scars bearing testimony to their commitment even to \ndeath for religious freedom.\n  Countless, nameless believers have engaged in tremendous feats of \nfaith and self-sacrifice in the name of religious freedom and \nconviction. The 6 million Jews of Nazi Europe bear witness in an \nunmatched way for the sacrifice they made as a people for their \nreligious identity. There are over 200 million Christian believers \nworldwide who presently live in nations which are so hostile to their \nfaith that they are in physical jeopardy. The Bahai of Iran, one of the \nmost devotedly peaceful faith communities in the world was racked in \nIran with yet another execution last month and 15 more Bahai are \nsitting on death row presently. The Tibetan Buddhists had thousands of \nmonasteries destroyed, their nuns raped, their Dalai Lama forced into \nexile, their religion outlawed. The list is long, the suffering is \ngreat, and the goodness of their cause resonates throughout these great \nhalls of freedom today.\n  Religious freedom is a fundamental, universal right protected by \ntreaties and constitutions worldwide. I will continue to stand for this \nprinciple as long as people suffer for it, along with the many other \nMembers of Congress who share this conviction. In the face of crushing \npersecution, in apparent defeat, there is a light that continues to \npierce the darkness and it will not be extinguished. If we stand for \nanything, let us stand with those whose courage is a living testimony \nto the fundamental freedoms we love so deeply in America. Let us vote \n``yes'' on this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to do so.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, we would not be here today were it not for \nthe tireless efforts of Senator Don Nickles. Twenty-eight other \nRepublican and Democratic Senators who co-sponsored S. 1868 (which is \nessentially the pending substitute amendment) and, for that matter all \nAmericans, owe Senator Nickles and his able staff a debt of gratitude.\n  Now then, the pending amendment is a modification of S. 1868. I am a \ncosponsor of S. 1868, and while I will vote for the pending compromise \nlanguage, I confess that it does not go far enough for my taste.\n  To be sure, these compromises were forced upon the sponsors by a \nWhite House and State Department who fought us at every step and \nhabitually moved the goal posts during negotiations. The Clinton \nAdministration may prefer that we do nothing, but doing nothing isn't \nan option.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee has taken \nthe lead in several historic steps by the Senate in recent months to \nadvance U.S. foreign policy interests--including passage of a far-\nreaching State Department reorganization and U.N. reform package and \nthe NATO Expansion Treaty.\n  Nevertheless, I believe it is obvious that neither initiative has \nstirred the hearts and souls of the folks back home in churches and \nsynagogues to the same degree as the growing persistent torture and \nabuse of Christians, Jews and other religious minorities at the hands \nof intolerant foreign governments.\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\n  Americans are eager for their government to help ease the suffering \nof their brothers and sisters overseas. They are not at all satisfied \nwith the inaction they have gotten to date.\n  I am sure these people--who are the backbone of this nation--have no \nquarrel with establishing special committees, or issuing reports, or \nhaving high level meetings with church groups. But Americans are \nlooking for concrete action from the State Department and the White \nHouse--and certainly, people persecuted because of their faith in \nforeign lands deserve more than kind words and gestures.\n  It is important to emphasize that this issue, and the growing concern \nof Americans, have not fallen on deaf ears in the Senate. The Foreign \nRelations Committee held five hearings on this issue during the 105th \nCongress--two specifically on Senator Nickles proposal. I especially \nwant to thank Senators Brownback and Ashcroft for using their \nsubcommittees to focus attention on this issue.\n  I hope every Senator will review the video tape of Senator Ashcroft's \nmoving hearing on the tragic plight of Christians in southern Sudan. \n(These innocent people have been brutally tortured, sold into slavery \nand, in some instances, literally crucified by the radical Islamic \ngovernment simply because of their faith in Christ.)\n  The point is this: the vote we are about to take is a test to see \nwhether Senators finally realize that we, as a people and a government, \nmust do more to advance the cause of religious freedom across the \nglobe.\n  Finally, Mr. President, it is often pointed out--and I believe it \nwith all my heart--that no matter what laws are enacted, religious \nintolerance will never be erased from the earth. I also believe that \nthe prayers of millions of Americans and other believers around the \nworld will accomplish more than any Act of Congress.\n  That does not mean we should not try. I hope the President will join \nwith us as we attempt to strengthen U.S. leadership in this area.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, the Senate is debating the International \nReligious Freedom Act of 1998. In its current form, this bill is a \ncareful compromise that has been months in the making. I had serious \nconcerns about earlier versions of this legislation, but I am a \ncosponsor of today's compromise.\n  I am confident that we have crafted the right balance among different \nfacets of American foreign policy. Economic freedom and individual \nliberties are not competitors--they go hand-in-hand! We want nations \nthat are free, that respect rights and liberties, and that have free \ntrade and market economies.\n  This is a bill that will focus America's attention on the desire to \nadvance religious freedom around the world while doing no harm to \nAmerica's national security, diplomatic or economic interests abroad. \nThis is a bill that will give the President flexibility to craft a \ncomplete foreign policy--a foreign policy that does not elevate one \nfacet of our foreign relations above all others.\n  Religious freedom and tolerance have always been America's creed. \nFreedom of religion is the first freedom guaranteed in our Bill of \nRights. No person anywhere in the world--no Christian, no Jew, no \nHindu, no Muslim, no Buddhist, no Baha'i . . . no one--should suffer at \nthe hand of the State for worshiping as he or she sees fit. As a beacon \nof liberty and freedom, America has a moral duty to speak out against \nreligious persecution around the world and to defend for people \neverywhere the fundamental right of freedom of worship.\n  At the same time, this bill recognizes that America bears a heavy and \ncomplicated burden of international leadership. Our relationships with \nother nations are complex, and our policies must reflect those \ncomplexities. American leadership is essential for international peace \nand security, free and open trade, a stable international economy and \nmany other vital matters. Like all leaders, America must balance \ncompeting needs, interests and ideals.\n  This bill gives the President flexibility to use the full power of \nAmerican engagement to promote religious liberties abroad. America's \nstrong commercial and diplomatic ties with other nations remain our \nmost effective leverage to alter the behavior of authoritarian \ngovernments. American engagement abroad acts as a catalyst for change. \nThe United States government cannot mandate religious freedom around \nthe world, but America can lead the world in spreading respect for \nreligious beliefs--just as we used the power of our example and \ndetermination to spread liberty, democracy and economic freedom around \nthe globe.\n  This bill will focus U.S. government attention on religious \npersecution. It will make religious freedom part of American diplomacy \nfrom the training of foreign service officers to the granting of visa \nrequests to the use of our embassy facilities.\n  This bill also will shine the light of day on countries, or entities \nwithin countries, that engage in religious persecution. It will require \nannual reporting on the state of religious freedom in every country, as \nwell as annual publication of all actions the United States Government \nis taking around the world to promote religious liberty.\n  And, this bill establishes an orderly procedure for the President to \nconsider taking targeted, calibrated actions against the most severe \nviolators of religious liberty.\n  This compromise gives the President the flexibility he needs to \nconduct a balanced foreign policy.\n  The President will have substantial flexibility to calibrate the most \nappropriate action to help change the behavior of the worst violators \nof religious freedom, including broad waiver authority and broad \nlatitude to take actions other than sanctions.\n  Congress will not be required to undertake a new series of \ncounterproductive ``mini-MFN'' or ``mini-drug decertification'' debates \nabout religious persecution around the world.\n  The Commission on International Religious Freedom established by the \nbill will make recommendations but will have no official role in \nshaping U.S. foreign policy.\n  And the President will have substantial flexibility in deciding when \nand how to identify countries that will be subject to action under this \nbill. There will be no diplomatically damaging ``list'' of countries \nthat violate religious freedoms.\n  Mr. President, this is not a perfect bill. But it is a good bill. \nCongress cannot, by passing a law, put an end to religious persecution \noutside our borders. But we can ensure that America speaks out with one \nvoice, with a strong voice, to make clear that we will not stand idle \nwhile people suffer because of their faith.\n  This bill will amplify America's voice for freedom. It will \nstrengthen the President's ability to craft a complete foreign policy \nin which the whole of America's national interests is not held captive \nto any single dynamic. Security, economics, diplomacy, trade, human \nrights, individual liberties--these are all part of America's national \ninterests around the world. We can, we must, promote them all--we \ncannot afford to sacrifice any interest for any other interest.\n  When Congress returns next year, we should continue the effort to \nexpand American engagement abroad--by passing fast track trade \nnegotiating authority, by reforming outdated and counterproductive \nsanctions regimes, by reviewing every international institution in \nwhich America participates to ensure they are relevant to today's \nchallenges. And we must strengthen our military, which is the guarantor \nof our foreign policy. American leadership in all those areas is \nessential if we are to effectively promote individual liberties--\nincluding religious liberties--around the world.\n  We should pass this bill. And then Congress should resist the \ntemptation to legislate further on this matter in the months and years \nahead, and give this comprehensive new framework for religious freedom \na chance to work.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, last week, as many of our friends and \ncolleagues began the Jewish New Year with the Yom Kippur day of \natonement--in freedom and in peace--millions of men and women elsewhere \nin the world were suffering for their faith. Mr. President, I believe \nthat our freedom to pray is not complete until all people are free to \npray.\n  I am told of some specific examples which make me appreciate my \nfreedom\n\n[[Page S11948]]\n\nand move me to come to the floor today. In Pakistan, a young man faces \na death sentence based on trumped-up blasphemy charges. In Laos, ten \ncourageous men and women of faith serve out harsh prison sentences for \nthe crime of meeting for Bible study, an act which many of us take part \nin regularly. In China, millions of Catholics and Protestants are \nforced to worship in secret, paying the price of prison, fines, and \neven torture if they are discovered. Muslims and Tibetan monks in China \nsuffer a similar fate. In the Sudan, Christians and animists are sold \ninto slavery or brutally murdered by an extremist Muslim government.\n  These things ought not to be, and I believe that silence is no longer \nan option. We must act, and we must act wisely. For this reason, I join \nmy colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Nickles, in introducing S. 1868, \nthe International Religious Freedom Act of 1998. This bill presents a \nresponsible, flexible structure for responding to violations of \nreligious freedom around the world. It allows for action that is \ncomprehensive but calibrated. It requires consultation with those who \nbest know the country in order to devise the most effective policy. It \nensures that the action we take truly benefits the people who are \nsuffering. The only option this bill does not allow is silence.\n  The International Religious Freedom Act is not merely a short-term \nreaction to religious persecution. It has been carefully researched and \ncrafted to promote long-term change, not simply to punish. There are \nnumerous provisions for training our front lines in human rights \npolicy--Foreign Service officers, ambassadors and refugee and asylum \npersonnel. It incorporates religious freedom into numerous long-term \navenues for change, such as broadcasting, Fulbright exchanges and legal \nprotections for religious freedom.\n  This bill has strong support from a broad base of religious and \ngrassroots organizations. With my colleague Don Nickles, we have \nlistened to all who desired to contribute, and have worked with both \nsides of the aisle to address areas of concern. This bill is truly a \ncollaborative product of countless hours of work among members of the \nCongress and the administration.\n  As Americans, we prize the right to freedom of religion. Our founding \nfathers sought to establish, as George Washington, said, ``effectual \nbarriers against the horrors of spiritual tyranny, and every species of \nreligious persecution.''\n  We now have an historic opportunity to act on behalf of millions of \nreligious believers around the world who cannot speak for themselves. \nWe have a solemn responsibility to stand by those suffering for their \nfaith. I urge my colleagues to vote for this bill. It is the right \nthing to do.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise to speak in favor of the bill, as \nmodified, before us. I cosponsored S. 1868, the ``International \nReligious Freedom Act'', sponsored by the honorable Senator from \nOklahoma because I have become concerned with the trends or continued \npolicies of religious discrimination and persecution in certain \ncountries. I applaud his efforts to work with all interested parties in \nforming a consensus bill with 29 cosponsors--one that even prior \nopponents can support. He has been persistent in his efforts to form a \nbill that addresses the legitimate concerns of most of the bill's \nprevious detractors, including the Administration. I must also commend \nthe senior Senator from Pennsylvania for focusing Congress' attention \non this important issue.\n  I feel it is extremely important, as a nation that firmly believes in \nthe freedom of an individual to practice his or her religious belief, \nthat our foreign policy reflect and promote this basic right of \nindividuals. The manner in which we deal with other nations should \ninclude, but not be exclusive to, the way these nations honor the \nreligious liberty of their citizens and visitors. I believe this bill \nas amended, strikes a responsible balance between the national security \nor economic interests, and the importance America places in the freedom \nof religious thought and practice for all throughout the world. The \ngoal of promoting religious liberty in other countries is entirely \nconsistent with the United States' policies of promoting human rights \nand democracy throughout the world.\n  Many Europeans first settled this continent for the very reason of \ngaining freedom of religious thought and practice. We can look to \nWilliam Penn as just one example of an individual in American history \nthat strove to promote the rights of individuals to practice their \nreligion without interference. His goal was to create a land of \nreligious toleration--that land was called Pennsylvania. He even drew \nup Pennsylvania's colonial Constitution, which included in its first \narticle the protection of the freedom to worship according to one's own \nconscience. To this day, America continues to be a beacon to the world, \nguaranteeing the freedom to worship as one desires.\n  As a nation founded on Judeo-Christian principles, it especially \nsaddens me when I learn about the increase in the persecution of \nChristian individuals worldwide. However, it is not just Christians in \ncertain parts of the world that are being punished simply because of \ntheir beliefs--it is also those who practice Islam, Judaism, and just \nabout every other religion or belief. Our Founding Fathers made it \nclear in the Declaration of Independence that the basic Laws of Nature \nand of Nature's God are entitled to all individuals. This guiding \ndocument, a unanimous Declaration of the thirteen United States of \nAmerica, says that:\n\n       . . . all Men are created equal, that they are endowed by \n     their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among \n     these are Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness.\n\n  The ability to practice ones religious beliefs without undue \ngovernment interference is a fundamental right--an unalienable right. \nThe American Founders believed in this right so much that they included \nthe freedom to exercise one's religion in the First Amendment to the \nConstitution of the United States of America. The basic right to the \nfreedom of thought, conscience and religion has also been declared by \nmany other countries, as evidenced by the member signatories of the \nHelsinki Accords and the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n  I believe this legislation will promote ideals that America stands \nfor--specifically the freedom of religion--in the international \ncommunity. This bill is especially important because religious \npersecution takes many forms and even seems to be on the rise in some \nparts of the world. The bill before us will deal with countries that \ndisregard the basic right of individuals to believe as they choose in a \nmanner that is consistent, yet flexible--one that allows the President \nto choose from a variety of measures to address the injustices of the \nviolating country. It allows a flexible response from the \nAdministration, which recognizes that religious persecution takes many \ndifferent forms, with varying degrees of severity. The bill's \nflexibility also recognizes the importance of a foreign policy that can \nbe both pro-active and reactive to our national security and economic \ninterests. The one action in dealing with violators of religious \nfreedom that would not be allowed by this bill would be that of \ninaction or silence. If we, as defenders of freedom, are silent in \nmatters so fundamental to our political belief system as religious \nliberty, then we are no better than the perpetrators of this unjust \npersecution and discrimination. This bill would help create a \nconsistent U.S. foreign policy with respect to how we deal with \ncountries that do not respect individuals' freedom of thought and \nconscience. I urge my colleagues to join with me and the 28 other \ncosponsors to vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield my colleague from Minnesota 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much, Mr. President, and I thank Senator \nNickles also.\n  Mr. President, I rise to support the International Religious Freedom \nAct of 1998. While I continue to have serious questions about the \ngeneral concept that threatening to impose sanctions on a country \nconsidered a ``country of particular concern'' will enable us to make \nprogress toward ending religious persecution, I have co-sponsored this \nlegislation, considerable progress has been made to redraft the \nlegislation in a far more positive manner. Since it has significant \nsupport, it was important to ensure we will pass a version\n\n[[Page S11949]]\n\nthat had a better chance to work--not one that could have been \ncounterproductive.\n  The Nickles compromise to the Wolf-Specter version I believe is far \nsuperior, and has addressed the concerns of many religious leaders. \nThere was a fear the original legislation could have actually harmed \nbelievers in other countries. Let me repeat--those who served as \nmissionaries and promoters of religious freedom abroad told me this \nlegislation could actually have been counterproductive. In fact, some \nof them questioned a government involvement in this debate at all, \nother than through normal diplomatic efforts--or, even better than the \nefforts of religious leaders and missionaries themselves, who have been \nable to make progress on their own.\n  Yet, many Washington stakeholders, supported an approach, to publicly \nhumiliate and punish countries which meet our definition of ``a country \nof particular concern'' that is engaging in ``particularly severe \nviolations'' of religious persecution by publishing a list of them and \nimposing automatic sanctions.\n  Mr. President, I didn't believe this approach would work. I didn't \nbelieve that this was the right way to address religious persecution. \nFortunately, many religious leaders have stepped forward, often \nseverely criticized, to tell us they did not believe the original \napproach was the right approach.\n  Senator Hagel and I asked the Foreign Relations Committee to hold a \nhearing on the legislation, a hearing that would allow some of those \nwho believed the legislation could have been counterproductive to \ntestify. It is ironic that when we sought changes to the legislation, \nagain changes suggested by those who had served abroad, I was publicly \nattacked by some individuals claiming to understand how best to address \nreligious persecution. And some of these individuals, I believe, may \nhave placed their own personal agendas ahead of the very people that \nwe, through this bill and this legislation, want to help in these \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, I strongly commend my colleague, Senator Nickles, for \nhis understanding, his patience and his dedication to work with us on \nthis legislation. I know he made many revisions to the bill which were \nrecommended by myself and others that we thought would help change the \nfocus from an approach that was more negative to one that was very \npositive and had a better opportunity to work.\n  There is far more emphasis now on working with countries, working \nwith them quietly to try to end those violations of religious freedom, \nand to working with our allies in order to try to reach multilateral \nsolutions rather than a far less effective unilateral approach and \nsolution.\n  The revised Nickles substitute before us, I think, gives the \nPresident more flexibility regarding how efforts to achieve religious \nfreedom are reported and that we talk not only about the progress that \nmust be made, but also the progress that has been made. The report that \ndiscusses the progress that needs to be made is less inflammatory and \nit does not link any suggested sanctions to each country of particular \nconcern.\n  The President's waiver authority has been also expanded to permit a \nwaiver if an action, including sanctions, would be counterproductive. \nAnd just this week the waiver authority has been further expanded to a \nnational interest waiver which is significant progress, I believe, to \nimprove this bill. A waiver could be communicated to Congress the same \nday it is exercised rather than the earlier notice requirement.\n  One concern of mine, however, does still remain, and it relates to \nthe commission which provides its own report on religious freedom. \nWhile the commission should be advisory using, I believe, detailed \nemployees from the Government, language was added late in the \nnegotiations that awarded the commission $3 million for each of the 2 \nyears for its own staff. That is a lot of staff when ``free'' staff was \navailable.\n  Now, I agree that the commission needs some autonomy, but in my \njudgment this could further politicize the commission, which would make \nit less effective. But I am pleased that Senator Nickles added my \nrequirement that commission members must have some direct experience \nabroad in order to be appointed to the commission. We must have a \ncommission with members who have direct knowledge of religious freedom \nissues in targeted countries, those who have been there, those who know \nthe problems that these people could face in the form of any kind of \nretribution toward any US government action taken.\n  I was also pleased that language was added to track some of Senator \nLugar's Sanctions Reform Act in several sections of the bill. Those \nwere the provisions that would require consultation with interested \nparties in order to achieve a multilateral solution as well as an \nanalysis of whether an action would achieve the purpose of promoting \nreligious freedom, whether it would be counterproductive, and what the \ncost would be of that action to the rest of the economy.\n  Because so many changes were made to improve this legislation and \nbecause so many wanted to support some kind of bill, I worked very hard \nwith Senator Nickles and others to improve the bill. I now believe that \nwe must also exercise our oversight function over the commission as \nwell as the overall approach of this legislation in the years ahead. We \nmust continue to ask ourselves whether this kind of public approach \nreally works. We must consider whether we want a commission or our \nGovernment deciding what religious persecution is, which religions are \nwe going to help, and which ones will we ignore, and which countries we \nwill label a ``country of particular concern,'' and which will escape \nthat designation for some foreign policy reason. Where will we draw the \nline? Will we factor in every kind of discrimination against religion, \nincluding many we may have questions about? Will we be drawn into \ndisputes with other countries that question why they were named and not \nother equally violative countries?\n  Mr. President, we will need to monitor its results, and we need to do \nthat in order to make sure that it accomplishes its purpose. There may \nbe some fine tuning that we need to do to the bill to improve it to \nmake it work better.\n  This is a dangerous area in which we are treading. It is full of \npitfalls, I believe, but I think we can overcome them if we are ready \nand willing to have oversight authority. My support of the revised \nNickles bill is based on that willingness to see how this approach \nworks, but we must pay attention to how it is working and to have the \ngood sense to end it if it is not.\n  As we exercise our oversight over this legislation, I ask my \ncolleagues also to listen to the advice of The Reverend John N. Akers, \nof the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association and Chairman of the East \nGates Ministry International. He has been very helpful in forwarding \nconcerns of missionaries serving abroad. Dr. Akers, who also testified \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee, requested in a September 28 \nletter to my office, ``Do all you can to ensure that the final version \nwill help religious believers in other countries and not actually, if \nunintentionally, make their situation worse.''\n  Mr. President, this is good advice, and it shall dictate how I \npersonally analyze the success or failure of this legislation.\n  But tonight I want to urge all my colleagues to strongly support this \nas a beginning. Again, I thank Senator Nickles for all the hard work to \nget us to this point on this legislation.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Minnesota for \nhis leadership on this, for his willingness to meet with us for hours \nto work out some of the concerns that he had, the latest concern he \nmentioned being where some people who are in foreign countries who are \nmissionaries wanted to make sure this wouldn't have a counterproductive \neffect. We actually put in a waiver of any sanction that could be \nimposed if the administration felt like it would be counterproductive \nto the goals and purposes of the act.\n  Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Grams from Minnesota, for his \nwillingness to work with us, to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I did not do this at the beginning of the debate and I \nshould have. I ask unanimous consent to, in addition to myself and \nSenator Lieberman, have the following Senators be included as original \ncosponsors of this bill: Senators Mack, Kempthorne, Craig, Hutchinson, \nEnzi,\n\n[[Page S11950]]\n\nHelms, Sessions, Faircloth, Allard, DeWine, Brownback, Inhofe, Coats, \nCollins, Hutchison, Lott, Coverdell, Akaka, Ashcroft, Santorum, Breaux, \nHagel, Grams, Specter, McConnell, D'Amato, Hollings, and Senator Smith \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also have a list of organizations, \nreligious organizations that have been supporting this bill and endorse \nthis bill. I will name those for the record: Religious Liberty \nCommission of the Southern Baptist Convention, the National Association \nof Evangelicals, the International Fellowship of Jews and Christians, \nthe Christian Coalition, the Anti-Defamation League, the National \nJewish Coalition, the American Jewish Community, the Catholic \nConference, Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the Catholic \nConference of Major Superiors of Men's Institutes, the Jewish Council \nfor Public Affairs, the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the \nUnion of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America, the National \nConference on Soviet Jewry, United Methodist Church Women's Division, \nAmerican Coptic Association, Episcopal Church, Advocates International, \nTraditional Values Coalition, Justice Fellowship, and B'nai B'rith \nInternational.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Oklahoma has \n7\\1/2\\ minutes and the opposition has 75.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, several colleagues have requested time to \nspeak. I also know we went a little bit later than anticipated. Most of \nthe colleagues on my side of the aisle have spoken. I know Senator \nLieberman is returning to the floor momentarily and wishes to speak. So \nI reserve the remainder of time on our side and ask colleagues, if they \nwish to speak, to please come to the floor and do so. If not, we will \nbe happy to accommodate requests of other colleagues who wish to speak \nas in morning business.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent we, Senator Lieberman and \nI, have 5 minutes to speak prior to the vote tomorrow morning. That \nwill be at 9:25.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11942-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11950-S11951]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SUPPORT OF THE AGRICULTURE APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise tonight to express my grave \ndisappointment of President Clinton's decision to veto the 1998 \nAgriculture Appropriations conference report, which includes emergency \nrelief for farmers around the country, like those farmers in the Red \nRiver Valley area of my home state of Minnesota, who are struggling \nagainst a combination of devastating factors.\n  Inclement weather, low prices, high market yields generally, and \nmultiple years of wheat scab disease have converged to produce an \natmosphere where even the best, most competitive farmers in \nNorthwestern Minnesota are suffering.\n  This, despite the fact that the Market Transition Payments in the \nFAIR Act have provided our nation's producers with a much greater \nsafety net than the deficiency payments they would have received under \nthe old program--about $7.5 billion more under the new farm bill than \nthe old.\n  Yet the President's actions will delay this important relief. This \nbill provides twice as much assistance as he originally requested, yet \nhe has now joined the bidding war, changed his mind and now jeopardizes \nthis needed assistance to our farmers.\n  It is crucial for farmers in Minnesota, as well as other states, that \nthe Agriculture Appropriations bill be signed by the President and not \nused as a pawn in a political debate. The bill funds all of our \nagriculture programs including $675 million to Plains farmers to help \noffset crop failures, like those caused by the wheat scab epidemic.\n  It also includes $1.65 billion which is to be added to the annual \nmarket transition payments--this money will help to address depressed \ncommodity prices.\n  The conference report funds $56 billion to fund needed agriculture \nprograms. This includes funds for many crucial tools to help our \nfarmers promote their commodities at home and throughout the world.\n  The bill funds the Farm Service Offices in our states to aid farmers \nin making the adjustment to Freedom to Farm.\n  It also funds the Foreign Agricultural Service, which promotes U.S. \nagriculture products abroad. The Service coordinates CCC Export Credit \nGuarantee Programs; PL-480; Export Enhancement; and the Market Access \nProgram.\n  The bill will continue and expand needed assistance to farmers in the \nlong term, as well as the short term. It is a good compromise. I voted \nfor the conference report although there are sections that I, like \nmany, oppose, such as language from an earlier House version which \nwould create a backdoor extension of the Northeast Interstate Dairy \nCompact. I raised some strong objections to this political maneuvering \non the Senate floor last week.\n  It will allow an unjustifiable, reprehensible program to continue for \nanother six months.\n  While I have deep reservations, this compromise is one we should \ncontinue to support and one the President should sign.\n  Some say this compromise does not include enough to address the farm \ncrisis. Yet, this conference report provides over $4.2 billion in farm \nrelief money. This is money that will be available immediately to \nfarmers.\n  This is in addition to the regular AMTA payments-- that is the \nmarketing transition support payments which have provided roughly $17.5 \nbillion to farmers over the last two years. This is also in addition to \napproximately $4 billion that producers will receive in loan deficiency \npayments this year.\n\n  Both Democrat and Republican plans were debated thoroughly in \nCommittee, and the plan before the President is the one that the \nMembers decided to support. The concept behind this agreement is that \nit continues to support farmers through the transition from the old \nfailed system of our farm program to the new Freedom to Farm \nlegislation, as well as to address needs created by weather and disease \ndisasters.\n  It does not attempt to throw another net of Washington programs over \nour farmers.\n  Despite the partisan grandstanding you have heard, the plan before us \nwill provide the transition assistance that our farmers need. And it \nwill not undo the Freedom to Farm policy that we worked so hard to \nachieve.\n  Farmers in Minnesota have made it clear to me that they do not want \nwelfare. The relief plan currently in the Agriculture Appropriations \nreport avoids going in that direction. It is a one-time support \npackage, as opposed to returning to our failed agriculture policies of \nthe past. It also avoids the flaw of lifting the loan caps, a move that \nwould both exacerbate the current grain glut and also distort market \nsignals, encouraging excess production, which would continue low \nprices.\n  It is painfully clear by this point that the only purpose served by \npromoting ``lifting the loan caps'' is one of grandstanding, and we all \nknow that a higher loan rate leads both to increased production, larger \nsurpluses along with lower prices.\n  This option again was rejected by the Senate, Senate twice, yet it \nkeeps coming back, rearing its ugly head.\n  There is simply no justifiable basis for a Presidential veto of the \nAgriculture Appropriations bill.\n  As we have heard Chairman Cochran explain here on the floor, it \ncontains a lot of money for production agriculture. So a threatened \nveto is certainly not about money--it is about politics.\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\n  I remind my colleagues the President's original request for farmer \nrelief--the original request--was $2.3 billion. The current package \ncontains more than $4 billion. Now, however, he wants to veto \nlegislation providing more money than his request. He has changed his \nmind and now wants $3 billion more.\n  This is simply a half-hearted attempt by the President to back a \nDemocrat effort to revisit the Freedom to Farm bill. This is \nlegislation that only 2 years ago, the Congress and President Clinton \nhimself agreed it was needed to move the business of agriculture out of \nthe grip of Government control.\n  It is disturbing to me that when the White House does not get its \nway, it vetoes legislation or takes it to the courts, and if rejected \nthere, appeals to the higher courts. The bottom line is that it \ncontinues to try and go around Congress, rejecting decisions made by a \nmajority of Congress.\n  Minnesota farmers should not be used as pawns in an election-year \ndrama. The President should help farmers by signing this significant, \nemergency legislation, rather than joining those here who seek to undo \nthe progress that has been made on agriculture policy.\n  The solution is here before us, and delays will be laid right at the \nPresident's feet. For the sake of our nation's farmers, let's end the \nbidding war. Let's end it now. I strongly urge the President to \nreconsider his decision as he reviews this crucial legislation again in \nthe Omnibus Appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Grams from \nMinnesota, for his speech, but also for the homework and dedication \nthat he had on this piece of legislation. He had some concerns about \nit. He raised those concerns. He was an effective Senator. We worked to \nalleviate some of those concerns and we wanted to make sure that no \nperson who is in a foreign field--that these actions would cause them \ngreater pain or greater discrimination. So I thank him for his efforts \non the Religious Freedom Act, and I also thank him for his statement \nthat he just made on the ag bill. I happen to agree with his statements \nwholeheartedly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11950-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11951-S11952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FREEDOM FROM RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nFeinstein be included as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nInternational Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which is the substitute \namendment to H.R. 2431 being offered by the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  At the outset, I would like to express my appreciation and respect \nfor the distinguished Assistant Majority Leader, Senator Nickles, and \nthe distinguished Senator from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. I want \nto salute their deeply held commitment to religious freedom for all \npeople. I am aware that they and their staffs have been negotiating \nthis bill for many months. They have been through draft after draft, \ntalking with the Administration, a large number of Senators with \ndifferent interests, and a wide range of concerned outside \norganizations.\n  Their mission has been to produce a bill that would make a meaningful \ncontribution to combating the problem of religious persecution in \nforeign countries, one that would pass with broad support in the \nSenate, and a bill that the President would sign. I know how long and \nhard they have been working on this effort.\n  Earlier this week, they had hoped to move the bill forward. There \nwere still a number of provisions which I was concerned about, and I \nfelt that since the bill had not come through the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, on which I sit, and would not be open to amendment on the \nfloor, I wanted a chance to address those concerns.\n  Despite the marathon talks the Assistant Majority Leader and the \nSenator from Connecticut had already engaged in on this bill with so \nmany others, and despite my late entry into the fray, they graciously \nand without hesitation agreed to sit down with me to see if we could \ncome to common agreement. We were also joined by Undersecretary of \nState Stuart Eizenstat.\n  I am happy to report that, as a result of these discussions, with \ngood will by all sides, we were able to reach agreement on each of the \nprovisions that was of concern to me, and I think the bill is better \nfor it. Let me explain what we agreed upon.\n  First, I have come to the conclusion that when the Congress \nlegislates sanctions, we need to provide the President with a \nreasonable amount of flexibility in the implementation, both to respond \nto changing conditions, and to protect other American interests.\n  Normally, we provide the President with a waiver authority for \nsanctions, but the standard of that waiver is critical. The State \nDepartment believes, and I agree, that the ``national security'' waiver \nstandard in the most recent draft was too high--it would be difficult \nfor the President to waive the sanctions required under this act except \nin extraordinary circumstances. A waiver of ``national interest'' was \ndeemed by the sponsors to be too low. So we compromised: the President \ncan now waive the sanctions in this bill if the ``important national \ninterest'' requires it.\n  Second, the definition of what constitutes a ``particularly severe \nviolation'' of religious freedom was originally drafted in such a way \nthat it could have inadvertently triggered other sanctions--those \nrequired for gross violations of human rights --under sections 116 and \n502B of the Foreign Assistance Act. There was no intent on the part of \nthe sponsors to trigger two sets of sanctions, so it was simply a \nmatter of ensuring that a different standard was required for each \ntrigger.\n  The standard we agreed upon was proposed by Senator Lieberman. \nParticularly severe violations of religious freedom are now defined as \n``systematic, ongoing, egregious violations of religious freedom.'' To \nmy mind, this is neither a higher nor lower standard than the \n``consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights'' that \nrequires a separate set of sanctions under the Foreign Assistance Act, \nbut it is a sufficiently different standard that it a finding under one \nact should not automatically trigger sanctions under both acts. I think \nthis is an important improvement in the bill.\n  Third, we were concerned that there could be situations in which the \nPresident has already taken significant action against a country, in \nlarge part to respond to human rights abuses, and then a finding of \nparticularly severe violations of religious freedom would require \nadditional actions under this act. In the case of a country like Sudan, \nwhere we have already imposed extensive sanctions, it makes sense for \nthe President to be able to cite an existing sanction as fulfilling the \nrequirements of the International Religious Freedom Act.\n  Again, to the best of my knowledge, the sponsors of the bill had no \ndesire to force the President to impose redundant sanctions on a \ncountry. So, in section 402(C)(4) we have developed language that \nallows the President to cite an existing sanction as fulfilling the \nrequirements of this act. I think this change also makes the bill \nbetter.\n  We are all aware that there are people of faith who are suffering for \ntheir beliefs in many parts of the world. As a nation founded on the \nprecious principle of religious freedom, a principle which is enshrined \nin the Bill of Rights, we cannot and must not turn a deaf ear to the \ncries of the oppressed. Making the protection of religious freedom a \nhigh priority in our foreign policy is the right thing to do.\n  The challenge is to create mechanisms to promote religious freedom \nand protect persecuted believers that: provide enough flexibility to \nrespond to different conditions at different times and places; avoid \nunintentionally making life harder for those we seek to help; and, make \na meaningful contribution to the cause of religious freedom without \nunduly jeopardizing other important national interests.\n  That is why I have so much respect for what the distinguished \nAssistant Majority Leader and the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut have been\n\n[[Page S11952]]\n\ntrying to do these many months. They have worked hard to listen to the \nconcerns of the Administration, other Senators, religious organizations \nof every denomination, the business community, and other interested \nparties. They have tried to develop a bill that will help the United \nStates protect those in danger of persecution for their faith, while \ntaking into account the broad and deep requirements of U.S. foreign \npolicy interests. I think they have succeeded.\n  Evidence of their success is in the broad and diverse coalition of \nreligious organizations and human rights groups who have worked \ntirelessly to support the bill. Further evidence of this success, I \nbelieve, will be evident by the overwhelming support I expect the \nSenate will demonstrate when it votes shortly. And perhaps the most \nimpressive evidence of their success is that earlier today, National \nSecurity Adviser Sandy Berger informed the Minority Leader that the \nAdministration now supports the bill as drafted. After so many months, \nwe know that the President will sign this bill, and it will become law.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Connecticut will \nbe here shortly. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I know our colleague, Senator Lieberman, is \non his way over to speak on this bill. I want to take this opportunity \nto say how much his presence and his involvement on this issue was \nnecessary to our forging a bipartisan consensus on this.\n  I think it is important that we speak with one voice as a nation on \nan issue as critical as religious persecution. It was the work of \nSenator Lieberman, primarily on the other side of the aisle, that \nallowed us to address some of the concerns of some of our colleagues--\nmany of them legitimate concerns--and to work through the process, \nconvince his colleagues that what we were attempting to do was done in \na way that addressed their concerns. Really, without his help we could \nnot have forged this bipartisan consensus. So while he is not here for \nme to praise him personally, I just want to let the Record show that \nthe combination of Republicans and Democrats, liberals and \nconservatives, and everybody in between, resulted in a consensus bill \nthat I think sends a very, very important message and, really, a beacon \nof hope and light.\n  I am hoping the vote tomorrow will be unanimous, and I think it may \nbe. A lot of that credit goes to Senator Lieberman and also, as I said \nearlier, a lot of that credit goes to the bill's chief sponsor here in \nthe Senate, Senator Nickles, who patiently worked through trials and \ntribulations, weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, in order to \npull this together and get everybody on board. That appears to be what \nwe have, and we are looking forward to a solid vote tomorrow. Again, my \ncompliments to all of those who played such an important role in that.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Indiana for his \ncompliments. I want to reiterate my statement that Senator Coats was \nthere from the beginning, and he was there at almost every meeting \nsaying, ``Let's get this done,'' and, ``Let's forge the consensus,'' \n``Let's make the compromise,'' and he helped make it happen.\n  He is also very correct in complimenting Senator Lieberman for making \nit happen. I mentioned that earlier. Senator Lieberman has been with us \non this bill for a long time. He has worked with us. He has helped us \ncraft the bill and helped make compromises to make sure it is enacted.\n  I also thank our colleague from California, Senator Feinstein, whom \nwe met with last night at length to be sure, again, that this bill \nwould be acceptable and we could get it through. We did. We made a \nchange. We changed the waiver provision from ``national security'' to \n``important national interests,'' which, again, is something the \nadministration wanted.\n  I think it is still compatible with our goals and objectives of \npassing a good bill that will help move countries, that have been \npersecuting people because of their religious beliefs, away from that \nbehavior.\n  I thank my colleague from California for her work, and also the \nSenator from Delaware, Senator Biden, who worked with us, as well, in \nnegotiating with us, and helped us craft a package that I am confident \nwe will pass tomorrow with an overwhelming vote.\n  I am confident the House, likewise, will pass the bill, as we will \npass it in the Senate, and this bill will be on the President's desk \nand will become law. As a result, I think it will save lives and it \nwill help alleviate persecution of individuals because they are \npracticing their faith.\n  Again, I thank all of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nmaking this happen.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as I indicated before to the majority \nleader, I have about a 30-minute speech for morning business. He \nindicated that I could do this at the end of the proceedings tonight. \nBut since the floor is now not occupied--I understand Senator Lieberman \nmay be on his way--I thought I would proceed now, and it is my \nintention to do so. If Senator Lieberman comes, then we will try to \nmake whatever accommodation we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11951-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11952-S11957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW AND KENNETH STARR'S INVESTIGATION\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as one who three times in the last 15 years \nhelped to reauthorize the independent counsel law, I have been giving a \ngreat deal of thought to the way in which the independent counsel \nstatute has functioned in Kenneth Starr's investigation of President \nClinton.\n  The important purpose behind the statute was to have an objective \nperson investigate credible allegations of violations of criminal law \nagainst top Administration officials in order to give confidence to the \npublic that the Attorney General, an appointee of the President, was \nnot put in the position of investigating those allegations.\n  But what if the person selected to investigate those allegations by \nthe special court, the three-judge court that appoints independent \ncounsels, violates the restrictions in the very act creating him? What \ncould be done to rein in such an independent counsel?\n  Some will dismiss these questions and more specific ones related to \nMr. Starr's investigation of the President as defending the President's \nactions, actions which were irresponsible and immoral, and which by the \nPresident's own acknowledgment, hurt those closest to him and which \ndamaged the body politic of the nation. But dismissing such questions \nwould be wrong, because the actions of the independent counsel in this \ncase, and the implications his actions have on the future of the \nindependent counsel law and, indeed, upon the rule of law, demand our \nattention as well.\n  The authors of the law in 1978 attempted to put limits on the \nindependent counsel in the law itself and provided, for instance, that \nthe independent counsel must follow the policies of the Justice \nDepartment and that the Attorney General could fire an independent \ncounsel for cause.\n  The Supreme Court in Morrison v. Olson upheld the constitutionality \nof the independent counsel law in large part because of those \nprovisions, stating that:\n\n       . . .the Act does give the Attorney General several means \n     of supervising or controlling the prosecutorial powers that \n     may be wielded by an independent counsel. Most importantly, \n     the Attorney General retains the power to remove the counsel \n     for ``good cause,'' a power that we have already concluded \n     provides the Executive with substantial ability to ensure \n     that the laws are\n\n[[Page S11953]]\n\n     ``faithfully executed'' by an independent counsel. . . . In \n     addition . . . the Act requires that the counsel abide by \n     Justice Department policy unless it is not ``possible'' to do \n     so.\n\n  During each of the reauthorizations of the law, in 1983, 1987, and \n1994, Congress was concerned about the potential for an open-ended, \nunlimited investigation by an independent counsel, and we adopted \nvarious restrictions in an effort to prevent that. We added, for \nexample, a number of budgetary restrictions, reporting requirements, \nand a biannual GAO audit. And, we gave the Special Court the authority \nto terminate an independent counsel if it found the independent \ncounsel's work to be ``substantially completed.''\n  Those of us involved in those reauthorizations worked in a bipartisan \nmanner to put additional checks and limits on these investigations. We \ndid so in the hope that we could preserve the core principle of the \nlaw--that someone outside of the Department of Justice could \ninvestigate credible allegations of criminal violations by high level \nExecutive Branch officials.\n  Our goal has always been to have independent counsels be like \nordinary prosecutors, treating high-level government officials no \nbetter and no worse than a U.S. Attorney would treat a private citizen. \nThe specific questions that need to be addressed are whether Mr. Starr \nhas met that standard or whether he has violated important requirements \nof the independent counsel law, whether he has ignored his \nresponsibility not to abuse the grand jury process and whether he has \ncarried out the duty of all prosecutors as established by the Supreme \nCourt not just to prosecute but to prosecute fairly.\n\n\n                           role of prosecutor\n\n  A prosecutor's responsibility is unique in our criminal justice \nsystem. As articulated by Justice Sutherland in the 1935 Supreme Court \ncase of Berger v. the United States, a prosecutor's responsibility is \nnot to do whatever it takes to get a conviction, but to ``do justice.'' \nJustice Sutherland wrote:\n\n       The United States Attorney is the representative not of an \n     ordinary party to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose \n     obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its \n     obligation to govern at all; and whose interest, therefore, \n     in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win a case, \n     but that justice shall be done. . .He may prosecute with \n     earnestness and vigor--indeed, he should do so. But, while he \n     may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul \n     ones.\n\n\n                            the starr report\n\n  Let me address first Mr. Starr's decision to include in his report \ngraphic details of the sexual encounters between the President and Ms. \nLewinsky. Mr. Starr argues that he had to be so graphic in order to \nrebut the President's contention that the President didn't have \n``sexual relations'' with Ms. Lewinsky as defined in the Paula Jones \ncase. But that claim is a pretext, not a reason. There is no \njustification for Mr. Starr's inclusion of each and every detail of \nthese sexual encounters in the report. He could have easily referred \nthe readers to pages in the record to support his assertions. I've \nnever read a document by a prosecutor that is so needlessly salacious.\n  Mr. Starr's report also violated the fairness expected by the \nAmerican people by presenting information on possible impeachable \noffenses in a biased and prejudicial manner. Under the Constitution, \nthe House has sole responsibility to decide whether or not the \nPresident should be impeached. The independent counsel does not have a \nstatutory responsibility to argue for impeachment. His responsibility \nis to forward ``information'' to the Congress that ``may constitute \ngrounds for an impeachment.'' The independent counsel law says:\n\n       An independent counsel shall advise the House of \n     Representatives of any substantial and credible information \n     which such independent counsel receives, in carrying out the \n     independent counsel's responsibilities under (the independent \n     counsel law) that may constitute grounds for an impeachment.\n\n  That's it. That's the extent of the independent counsel's \nresponsibility. The law doesn't give an independent counsel the \nresponsibility to argue for impeachment. But the report in effect did \nthat. The independent counsel law doesn't give the independent counsel \nthe responsibility to draw conclusions from the information he presents \nto Congress. But the report did that as well. For example, in the \nintroduction to the report, Mr. Starr states unequivocally that ``(t)he \ninformation reveals that President Clinton'', and then it lists seven \nconclusions such as: ``lied under oath. . .''; ``attempted to obstruct \njustice. . .''; ``lied to potential grand jury witnesses.''\n  In other parts of the report, Mr. Starr makes conclusory statements \nsuch as these: ``the President's testimony strains credulity''; ``the \nPresident's denials--semantic and factual--do not withstand scrutiny''; \n``the President's claim . . .is belied by the fact . . .''; ``the \nPresident could not have believed that he was `telling the truth. . .;' \n'' ``the President lied under oath three times.''\n  The report not only is full of conclusions and arguments, it is also \nbiased in its presentation because it omits exculpatory evidence. For \ninstance, the report omits Ms. Lewinsky's clear statement before the \ngrand jury that ``no one ever asked [her] to lie'' and she ``was never \npromised a job'' for [her] silence. (Appendices, Part 1, page 1161.) \nThe report doesn't mention that Ms. Lewinsky testified that when she \nasked President Clinton whether she should get rid of his gifts to her \nin light of the Jones subpoena, his response was, ``I don't know, `` \nand that she left his office without ``any notion'' of what she should \ndo with the gifts. (Appendices, Part 1, page 1122.) The report omits \nMs. Lewinsky's statement that when she asked the President if he wanted \nto see her affidavit in the Paula Jones case before she filed it, he \nsaid he didn't want to see it. (Appendices, Part 1, page 1558)\n\n\n                     grand jury report in watergate\n\n  Contrast the Starr report with the grand jury report in the Watergate \ncase in 1974 to the House Judiciary Committee which was then \ninvestigating the possible impeachment of Richard Nixon. Judge Sirica \nwas asked to rule on whether the grand jury's evidence in the Watergate \nmatter could be forwarded to the House of Representatives since it was \nengaged in impeachment proceedings. Judge Sirica approved the \ntransmittal of the grand jury report in the Watergate matter, because \nhe determined that:\n\n       It draws no accusatory conclusions. . . It contains no \n     recommendations, advice or statements that infringe on the \n     prerogatives of other branches of government. . ..It renders \n     no moral or social judgments. The Report is a simple and \n     straightforward compilation of information gathered by the \n     Grand Jury, and no more. . . The Grand Jury has obviously \n     taken care to assure that its Report contains no \n     objectionable features, and has throughout acted in the \n     interests of fairness. The Grand Jury having thus respected \n     its own limitations and the rights of others, the Court ought \n     to respect the Jury's exercise of its prerogatives. (In re \n     Report and Recommendation of June 5, 1972, Grand Jury \n     Concerning Transmission of Evidence to the House of \n     Representatives, U.S. District Court, District of Columbia, \n     March 18, 1974. )\n\n  What a far cry the Watergate grand jury report was from Mr. Starr's. \nThe Starr Report violates almost every one of the standards laid out by \nJudge Sirica in the Watergate case.\n  Even prior to the report Mr. Starr acted in other ways inconsistent \nwith the independent counsel law and the rules governing the grand \njury.\n\n\n               violations of the independent counsel law\n\n  No person is above the law. That principle is the touchstone of our \nsystem of government. And the rule of law holds true for both the \nprosecutor and the prosecuted. Kenneth Starr has placed himself above \nthe law in a number of ways even before he sent his report to Congress.\n\n\n                     exceeding limited jurisdiction\n\n  The Supreme Court was clear in 1988 when it reviewed the \nconstitutionality of the independent counsel law that the specific and \nnarrow jurisdiction granted to each independent counsel by the \nappointing court is key to the law's constitutionality. The Supreme \nCourt in Morrison v. Olson held that, ``the independent counsel is an \ninferior officer under the Appointments Clause, with limited \njurisdiction and tenure and lacking policymaking or significant \nadministrative authority.'' ``Limited jurisdiction.'' ``Lacking \npolicymaking authority.'' Did Kenneth Starr respect this limitation in \nthe law that created his office? I believe not.\n  Again, the most fundamental limit in the law is that an independent \ncounsel can investigate only that which is within the scope of \njurisdiction granted by the court that appoints him.\n  Mr. Starr was appointed to office in August 1994 to investigate \nWhitewater.\n\n[[Page S11954]]\n\n Three months earlier, in May of 1994, Paula Jones had filed her civil \nlaw suit against the President accusing him of sexual harassment. Mr. \nStarr's grant of authority was completely unrelated to the Paula Jones \ncase and made no reference to it.\n  But in April of 1997, according to a June 25, 1997, article by Bob \nWoodward and Susan Schmidt in the Washington Post, FBI agents and \nprosecutors working for independent counsel Starr questioned Arkansas \nstate troopers about their knowledge of any extramarital relationships \nMr. Clinton may have had while governor and questioned a ``number of \nwomen whose names have been mentioned in connection with President \nClinton in the past.'' The two troopers who served on the governor's \npersonal security detail, Roger Perry and Ronald Anderson, are quoted \nin the article as follows:\n\n       ``In the past, I thought they were trying to get to the \n     bottom of Whitewater,'' Perry said in an interview with The \n     Washington Post. ``This last time, I was left with the \n     impression that they wanted to show he was a womanizer. . \n     ..All they wanted to talk about was women.'' He said he was \n     interviewed in April (1997) for more than 1\\1/2\\ hours by an \n     attorney in Starr's office and an FBI agent.\n       Perry, a 21-year veteran of the Arkansas state force, said \n     he was asked about the most intimate details of Clinton's \n     life. ``They asked me if I had ever seen Bill Clinton perform \n     a sexual act,'' Perry said. ``The answer is no.' ''\n       . . .. . .``They asked me about Paula Jones, all kinds of \n     questions about Paula Jones, whether I saw Clinton and Paula \n     together and how many times,'' Perry said.\n       . . ..Anderson said he refused to answer the questions \n     about personal relationships Clinton may have had with women. \n     ``I said, `If he's done something illegal, I will tell you. \n     But I'm not going to answer a question about women that he \n     knew because I just don't feel like it's anybody's business. \n     . .' ''\n\n  What justification did Mr. Starr provide to support these inquiries \nin April of 1997? The Washington Post said deputy Whitewater counsel \nJohn Bates defended Mr. Starr's action by saying that the purpose, as \nrestated by the Post, ``is to ensure that a full and thorough \ninvestigation is conducted that leaves no avenue unexplored.''\n  Mr. Starr's appointment was completely unrelated to the Paula Jones \ncase. Yet here he was inquiring in significant detail in April 1997, \nleaving ``no avenue unexplored,'' about possible relationships Mr. \nClinton had with various women, including Paula Jones. And the New York \nTimes reported on Sunday, October 4th, that contrary to Mr. Starr's \nstatements in his report to the House that his office first learned of \nthe Lewinsky affair from Linda Tripp on January 12th, the Starr office \nhad been contacted by Jerome Marcus, a Philadelphia lawyer with ties to \nthe Paula Jones legal team, at least a week earlier. The earlier \ncontact between Mr. Marcus and Mr. Starr's office has now been \nconfirmed by Mr. Starr's spokesman. The call from Mr. Marcus and his \nrelationship to the Jones case was not, according to the New York \nTimes, disclosed to the Justice Department when Mr. Starr sought to \nexpand his jurisdiction.\n  So when, on January 12, 1998, Linda Tripp, who had been subpoenaed in \nthe Paula Jones lawsuit, contacted Mr. Starr's office and told the \noffice she had tapes of Monica Lewinsky describing an affair with \nPresident Clinton, the Starr office had already gone beyond its \njurisdiction into the Paula Jones case.\n  Ms. Tripp apparently told Mr. Starr's office on January 12, 1998, \nthat she had tapes of several recorded telephone conversations \ncontaining allegations that the President had told Ms. Lewinsky to lie \nin the Paula Jones case. (Ms. Lewinsky later testified before the grand \njury that she was lying to Ms. Tripp when she had said that on the \ntape.) Because secretly tape-recording phone conversations is a felony \nunder Maryland law (Md. Code Ann. Section 10-402), Ms. Tripp discussed \nimmunity from prosecution for her own actions. According to the FBI \nsummary of Ms. Tripp's interview with Starr's office on January 12th, \nindependent counsel Starr not only discussed with Ms. Tripp a grant of \nimmunity under federal law and promised Ms. Tripp that his office \n``would do what it could to persuade the State of Maryland from \nprosecuting Ms. Tripp for any violations of that state wiretapping \nlaw'' (Page 223 of the Appendices to the Starr Report), Starr's office \nactually promised Ms. Tripp immunity. ``OIC attorneys. . .advised Tripp \nshe would be granted federal immunity by the OIC for the act of \nproducing the tapes to the OIC.'' (FBI 302, interview with Linda Tripp, \n1/12/98)\n  Again, with no jurisdiction to investigate matters involving the \nJones case, Mr. Starr instructed FBI agents to equip Ms. Tripp with a \nhidden microphone and surreptitiously record a four-hour conversation \nwith Ms. Lewinsky the following day, January 13th.\n  Where did Mr. Starr get the authority to enter into immunity \nnegotiations with Ms. Tripp on January 12th? Where did Mr. Starr get \nthe authority to instruct FBI agents to wire Ms. Tripp and tape her \nconversation with Ms. Lewinsky? Mr. Starr didn't have the authority and \nhe didn't have the jurisdiction on January 12th. (He didn't receive the \nauthority and jurisdiction until days later when he went to the \nAttorney General to obtain it.) He thereby ignored the statutory \nlimitations on his authority--the limits that confined him to matters \ninvolving Whitewater and investigations into the White House use of FBI \nfiles and the White House Travel Office which by that time the court \nhad also authorized. In doing so, he used some of the most powerful \ntools given to a prosecutor--immunity from criminal prosecution and \nelectronic surveillance by the FBI--to expand his reach beyond what the \nlaw permitted him to do.\n  It was only after he gave immunity to Ms. Tripp and used FBI agents \nto monitor four hours of conversation between Ms. Tripp and Ms. \nLewinsky on January 13th that independent counsel Starr sought \nauthority to expand his jurisdiction. On Thursday, January 15, he \ncontacted Attorney General Reno's office on an emergency, expedited \nbasis to get her to request the special court to authorize the added \njurisdiction. The emergency was apparently caused by the threat of a \nstory about the Lewinsky affair becoming public in an upcoming \n``Newsweek'' article.\n  A letter by Mr. Starr to Steve Brill, publisher of ``Brill's \nContent,'' in March 1998 suggests that Mr. Starr based his request for \nexpanded jurisdiction primarily on the FBI tape between Ms. Lewinsky \nand Ms. Tripp (again, a tape that the Starr office had no authority to \nobtain). The special court granted Mr. Starr jurisdiction in the \nLewinsky matter on January 16th.\n  (2) Failure to Follow Justice Department Policies\n  Mr. Starr also violated the independent counsel law's requirement \nthat he follow the policies of the Department of the Justice. 28 U.S.C. \n594(f)(1) states that independent counsels ``shall'' comply with the \n``written or other established policies of the Department of Justice.'' \nThe only exception to this rule is where compliance with Departmental \npolicies would be ``inconsistent with the purposes of the statute'' \nsuch as, for example, compliance with a policy requiring the permission \nof the Attorney General personally to take a specific act. Barring this \nexception, the law is clear that independent counsels must comply with \nJustice Department policies.\n  The Supreme Court placed great emphasis on the law's requirement that \nan independent counsel is bound by the policies of the Department of \nJustice and that the independent counsel law ``does not include any \nauthority to formulate policy for the Government or the Executive \nBranch.''\n  Yet there are at least five instances in which Mr. Starr appears to \nhave failed to follow Justice Department policy: discussing immunity \nwith Ms. Lewinsky without contacting her attorney of record; \nsubpoenaing the Secret Service; subpoenaing news organizations; \nsubpoenaing Ms. Lewinsky's mother; and subpoenaing the notes of the \nattorney for the late Vince Foster (arguing that the attorney-client \nprivilege terminates upon the death of the client).\n  First, when Mr. Starr confronted Monica Lewinsky on the afternoon of \nJanuary 16th he acted inconsistently with Justice Department policy. 28 \nCFR 77.8 explicitly prohibits federal prosecutors from offering an \nimmunity deal to a target without the consent of the target's legal \ncounsel. Yet Mr. Starr's staff, knowing she was represented by counsel, \nconfronted Monica Lewinsky in their first contact with her, outside the \npresence of her counsel, for the express purpose of offering\n\n[[Page S11955]]\n\nher an immunity deal. Indeed, the independent counsel's office made \nimmunity contingent upon her not contacting her counsel. (Appendicies, \nPart 1, pages 1143-1154)\n  Until recently, our understanding of what happened on January 16th \nwhen Ms. Lewinsky was first confronted by Mr. Starr's office was based \non speculation, but now we have a description of what happened under \noath from Ms. Lewinsky herself. It's a description of the intimidation \nof a woman whose crime was having a consensual affair with the \nPresident and trying to cover it up. I want to read from the grand jury \ntranscript, because Ms. Lewinsky's description is so chilling and \nspeaks for itself.\n\n                          Lewinsky Transcript\n\n       Juror: . . .I guess the other thing that we wanted to ask \n     you a little bit about is when you were first approached by \n     Mr. Emmick and his colleagues at the OIC. Can you tell us a \n     little bit about how that happened?. . .\n       Mr. Emmick: Maybe if I could ask, what areas do you want to \n     get into? Because there's--you know--many hours of activity--\n       Juror: Well, one specific--okay. One specific question that \n     people have is when did you first learn that Linda Tripp had \n     been taping your phone conversations? [Ms. Lewinsky answers \n     that she learned when she was, and these are her words, \n     ``first apprehended.'' The transcript continues.]\n       Mr. Emmick: Any other specific questions about that day? I \n     just--this was a long day. There were a lot of things that--\n       A Juror: We want to know about that day.\n       A Juror: That day.\n       A Juror: The first question.\n       A Juror: Yes.\n       A Juror: We really want to know about that day.\n       Mr. Emmick: All right. . . [Ms. Lewinsky then describes \n     meeting Ms. Tripp at the Ritz Carlton.]\n       Ms. Lewinsky: She was late. I saw her come down the \n     escalator. And as I--as I walked toward her, she kind of \n     motioned behind her and Agent------and Agent------presented \n     themselves to me and----\n       A Juror: Do you want to take a minute?\n       Ms. Lewinsky: And flashed their badges at me. They told me \n     that I was under some kind of investigation, something to do \n     with the Paula Jones case, that they--that they wanted to \n     talk to me and give me a chance, I think, to cooperate, \n     maybe. . . I told them I wasn't speaking to them without my \n     attorney. They told me that that was fine, but I should know \n     I won't be given as much information and won't be able to \n     help myself as much with my attorney there. So I agreed to \n     go. I was so scared.\n       (The witness begins crying.) [Then Ms. Lewinsky becomes so \n     upset with Mr. Emmick, an attorney with Mr. Starr who was \n     present when Ms. Lewinsky was confronted by Mr. Starr's \n     office on January 16th, that she asks him to step out of the \n     grand jury room, which it appears he finally does. Ms. \n     Immergut, another attorney with Mr. Starr's office then takes \n     over the questioning of Ms. Lewinsky and it turns into a \n     question/answer format.]\n       Q: Okay. Did you go to a room with them at the hotel?\n       A: Yes.\n       Q: And what did you do then? Did you ever tell them that \n     you wanted to call your mother?\n       A: I told them I wanted to talk to my attorney.\n       Q: Okay. So what happened?\n       A: And they told me--Mike (Emmick) came out and introduced \n     himself to me and told me that--that Janet Reno had \n     sanctioned Ken Starr to investigate my actions in the Paula \n     Jones case, that they--that they knew that I had signed a \n     false affidavit, they had me on tape saying I had committed \n     perjury, that they were going to--that I could go to jail for \n     27 years, they were going to charge me with perjury and \n     obstruction of justice and subornation of perjury and witness \n     tampering and something else.\n       Q: And you're saying ``they'', at that point, who was \n     talking to you about that stuff?\n       A: Mike Emmick and the two FBI guys. And I made Linda stay \n     in the room. And I just--I felt so bad. [She then discusses \n     why she feels bad and the question/answer session continues.]\n       Q: I guess later just to sort of finish up. I guess, with \n     the facts of that day, was there a time then that you were --\n     you just waited with the prosecutors until your mother came \n     down?\n       A: No.\n       Q: Okay.\n       A: I mean, there was, but they--they told me they wanted me \n     to cooperate. I asked them what cooperating meant it \n     entailed, and they told me that--they had--first they had \n     told me before about that--that they had had me on tape \n     saying things from the lunch that I had had with Linda at the \n     Ritz Carlton the other day and they--then they told me that \n     I--that I'd have to agree to be debriefed and that I'd have \n     to place calls or wear a wire to see--to call Betty and Mr. \n     Jordan and possibly the President. And--\n       Q: And did you tell them you didn't want to do that?\n       A: Yes. I--I--I remember going through my mind, I thought, \n     well, what if--you know, what if I did that and I messed up, \n     if I on purpose--you know, I envisioned myself in Mr. \n     Jordan's office and sort of trying to motion to him that \n     something had gone wrong. They said that they would be \n     watching to see if it had been an intentional mistake. Then I \n     wanted to call my mom and they kept telling me that they \n     didn't--that I couldn't tell anybody about this, they didn't \n     want anyone to find out and that they didn't want--that was \n     the reason I couldn't call Mr. Carter [Ms. Lewinsky's \n     attorney of record at the time], was because they were afraid \n     that he might tell the person who took me to Mr. Carter. They \n     told me that I could call this number and get another \n     criminal attorney, but I didn't want that and I didn't trust \n     them. Then I just cried for a long time.\n       A Juror: All while you were crying, did they keep asking \n     you questions? What were you doing?\n       Mr. Lewinsky: No, they just sat there and then--they just \n     sort of sat there.\n       A Juror: How many hours did this go on?\n       Ms. Lewinsky: Maybe around two hours or so. And then they \n     were--they kept saying there was this time constraint, there \n     was a time constraint, I had to make a decision. And then \n     Bruce Udolf came in at some point and then--then Jackie \n     Bennett came in and there were a whole bunch of other people \n     and the room was crowded and he was saying to me, you know, \n     you have to make a decision. I had wanted to call my mom, \n     they weren't going to let me call my attorney, so I just--I \n     wanted to call my mom and they--Then Jackie Bennett said, \n     ``You're 24, you're smart, you're old enough, you don't need \n     to call your mommy.'' And then I said, ``Well, I'm letting \n     you know that I'm leaning towards not cooperating.'' you \n     know. And they had told me before that I could leave whenever \n     I wanted, but it wasn't--you know, I didn't--I didn't really \n     know--I didn't know what that meant. I mean, I thought if I \n     left then that they were just going to arrest me. And so then \n     they told me that I should know that they were planning to \n     prosecute my mom for the things that I had said that she had \n     done.\n       (Ms. Lewinsky begins crying; Ms. Immergut asks if Ms. \n     Lewinsky wants to take a break, and she says she does. The \n     questioning then resumes.)\n       A Juror: Monica, I have a question. A minute ago you \n     explained that the reason why you couldn't call Mr. Carter \n     was that something might be disclosed. Is that right?\n       Ms. Lewinsky: It was--they sort of said that--you know, I--\n     I--I could call Frank Carter, but that they may not --I think \n     it was that--you know, the first time or the second time?\n       A Juror: Any time.\n       Ms. Lewinsky: Well, the first time when I asked that I said \n     I wasn't going to talk to them without my lawyer, they told \n     me that if my lawyer was there they wouldn't give me as much \n     information and I couldn't help myself as much, so that --\n       A Juror: Did they ever tell you that you could not call Mr. \n     Carter?\n       Ms. Lewinsky: No. What they told me was that if I called \n     Mr. Carter, I wouldn't necessarily still be offered an \n     immunity agreement.\n       A Juror: And did you feel threatened by that?\n       Ms. Lewinsky: Yes.\n\n  What could be clearer than that? If Ms. Lewinsky called her lawyer, \nshe wouldn't necessarily still be offered an immunity agreement and she \nfelt ``threatened.'' That's what Monica Lewinsky testified to under \noath about what happened on January 16th when she was confronted by \nindependent counsel Starr's office.\n  Look how Mr. Starr described the same event in his June 16th letter \nto Steven Brill months before Ms. Lewinsky's grand jury testimony was \npublicly released:\n\n       ``Ms. Lewinsky was asked to cooperate with the \n     investigation. She telephoned her mother, Marcia Lewis, who \n     took a train from New York City to confer with her daughter. \n     During the five hours while awaiting her mother's arrival, \n     Ms. Lewinsky drank juice and coffee, ate dinner at a \n     restaurant, strolled around the Pentagon City mall, and \n     watched television. She was repeatedly informed that she was \n     free to leave, and she did leave several times to make calls \n     from pay telephones. After her mother arrived, discussions \n     resumed with agents and attorneys. Ms. Lewinsky, after \n     talking with another family member by phone, chose to retain \n     William Ginsburg, a longtime family friend who specializes in \n     medical malpractice law in Southern California. As they left \n     the Ritz Carlton, both Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Lewis thanked the \n     FBI agents and attorneys for their courtesy. Recent media \n     statements by one of her attorneys alleging that she was \n     mistreated are wholly erroneous.''\n\n  That's what Mr. Starr says happened. The discrepancy is enormous. Ms. \nLewinsky ``was so scared''; she was told she faced 27 years in prison; \nat one point she was told she couldn't call her own attorney; at \nanother point she was told that if she called her lawyer, an immunity \noffer would not be likely; she cried for long time; she felt if she \nleft the room she would be arrested; and she felt ``threatened.'' All \nof this occurred without the knowledge or presence of her attorney of \nrecord in\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\napparent violation of Justice Department policy.\n  Consider also what Mr. Starr's office was trying to get Ms. Lewinsky \nto do. She says under oath, before the grand jury, that they wanted her \n``to agree to be debriefed and that [she'd] have to place calls or wear \na wire to . . . call Betty and Mr. Jordan and possibly the President.'' \nIn a letter from Mr. Starr to Steven Brill, Mr. Starr said, ``This is \nfalse. This Office never asked Ms. Lewinsky to agree to wire herself \nfor a conversation with Mr. Jordan or the President.'' Mr. Starr goes \non to criticize Mr. Brill for making such a claim by saying, ``You cite \nno source at all; nor could you, as we had no such plans.''\n  But a memo from Starr's office itself of an interview with Ms. \nLewinsky provides confirmation that Ms. Lewinsky was asked on January \n16th to wear a wire. The relevant part of the interview summary says:\n\n       ``Lewinsky, who was 24 years of age when approached by the \n     OIC on January 16, 1998, was not prepared to wear a wire and/\n     or record telephone conversations. The request to do so was a \n     lot to handle that day and Lewinsky relied on her advisors, \n     who included her parents and Bill Ginsberg.'' (Appendices, \n     Part 1, page 1555)\n\n  In Mr. Starr's report to the House of Representatives he states, ``In \nthe evaluation of experienced prosecutors and investigators, Ms. \nLewinsky has provided truthful information.'' If Ms. Lewinsky is \ntelling the truth when she swore that Mr. Starr's office tried to get \nher to tape phone conversations with Mr. Jordan or the President, then \nMr. Starr was not speaking truthfully in his letter. And if Ms. \nLewinsky is telling the truth that would mean Mr. Starr intended to \nsurreptitiously record the President of the United States in order to \ndevelop evidence against him. The second example of Mr. Starr acting \ninconsistently with Department of Justice policy involves the testimony \nof the Secret Service in the Lewinsky matter. Over the strong objection \nof the Justice Department and for the first time in the nation's \nhistory, Mr. Starr asked a federal court to force Secret Service \npersonnel to disclose how they operate and what they have observed of \nthe President in the course of protecting him. No federal prosecutor \nhad ever before asked a court to compel such testimony from a Secret \nService agent, according to the Justice Department.\n\n  Discounting arguments regarding the safety of the president and \neffective operation of Secret Service personnel, Mr. Starr issued \nsubpoenas which were in violation of Justice Department policy and in \nviolation of Mr. Starr's legal obligation to comply with Justice \nDepartment policy. Moreover, Mr. Starr argued in his report to the \nHouse that the President's ``acquiescence'' in the Justice Department's \nopposition to the Secret Service subpoenas was evidence of obstruction \nof justice on the part of the President presumably because, Mr. Starr \nargues, the Justice Department's opposition to the Secret Service \nsubpoena was ``interposed to prevent the grand jury from gathering \nrelevant information.'' This claim by Mr. Starr is so preposterous, \nparticularly in light of the letter of support for the position of the \nSecret Service from former President Bush, that it lays bare the \nexcessive zeal of this investigation.\n  The fact that the court eventually upheld the subpoenas issued by Mr. \nStarr does not vindicate his position. His pursuit of subpoenas of \nSecret Service agents may not have violated the law, but it violated \nthe policy of the Justice Department which Mr. Starr is bound to follow \nunder the clear requirements of the independent counsel law.\n  Third, Mr. Starr issued subpoenas to news organizations to obtain \nnonpublic information from their news gathering efforts despite Justice \nDepartment regulations which caution federal prosecutors to take a \nnumber of steps before subpoenas are issued in order to safeguard \nfreedom of the press. The regulations require trying elsewhere for the \ninformation, negotiating voluntary agreements to provide the \ninformation first, and, in a final provision that one court held was \nnot binding on Mr. Starr, obtaining the Attorney General's permission \nprior to issuing a subpoena. Despite the established policy \ndiscouraging media subpoenas, independent counsel Starr issued \nsubpoenas to news organizations on several occasions. When ABC News \nobjected to one such subpoena, Mr. Starr stated in a court pleading \nthat the Justice Department's ``regulations of this type do not govern \nan Independent Counsel.''\n  The fourth example of Mr. Starr not following Justice Department \npolicy is the subpoena to Monica Lewinsky's mother. He issued this \nsubpoena despite the U.S. Attorneys' Manual policy that ``the \nDepartment will ordinarily avoid seeking to compel the testimony of a \nwitness who is a close family relative of . . . the person upon whose \nconduct grand jury scrutiny is focusing.''\n  And fifth, in this same vein, but not related to the Lewinsky matter, \nMr. Starr subpoenaed the notes of the late Vince Foster, arguing in an \nunprecedented case before the Supreme Court that the attorney-client \nprivilege expires upon the death of the client. The Justice \nDepartment's general policy is that federal prosecutors ``will respect \nbona fide attorney-client relationships, where possible, consistent \nwith its law enforcement responsibilities and duties.'' The Supreme \nCourt rejected Mr. Starr's policy-setting position.\n  Violating the independent counsel law's limited grant of authority, \nignoring established Justice Department policies (indeed making the \nclaim that the independent counsel isn't governed by the Justice \nDepartment policies even though the independent counsel law says he \nis), Mr. Starr has made a mockery of the independent counsel process \nand the statutory constraints designed to insure that the independent \ncounsels obey the same rules that apply to all other federal \nprosecutors.\n\n\n                         use of the grand jury\n\n  I also have concerns about Mr. Starr's use of the grand jury. Was Mr. \nStarr properly using the grand jury when he subpoenaed a federal \nemployee who was on his personal time when he called friends in \nMaryland from his home to congratulate them on demanding an \ninvestigation of Linda Tripp for possible illegal taping of telephone \nconversations with Ms. Lewinsky? Robert Weiner was subpoenaed within 24 \nhours of the calls and wasn't even interviewed first or contacted by \nthe independent counsel as an initial step. Among other questions, \nprosecutors asked him to reveal the future plans of Maryland Democrats. \nHow could that possibly be an appropriate use of the grand jury?\n  Was Mr. Starr properly using the grand jury when he subpoenaed Sydney \nBlumenthal to testify before the grand jury on what he was telling \nreporters about Mr. Starr's office because Mr. Starr believed Mr. \nBlumenthal was trying to intimidate his staff? The answer is, ``no.'' A \nperson should be able to criticize a prosecutor to the press without \nfearing a grand jury subpoena.\n  There are numerous allegations that Mr. Starr and his staff \ninappropriately revealed grand jury information to third parties in \nviolation of rules governing grand jury secrecy. Rule 6(e) of the rules \nof federal criminal procedure prohibit prosecutors and grand jurors \nfrom discussing the proceedings before the grand jury.\n  Mr. Starr has explained communicating with the press in the August \n1998 edition of ``Brill's Content'' as ``countering misinformation that \nis being spread about our investigation in order to discredit our \noffice and our dedicated career prosecutors.'' Mr. Brill also quotes \nMr. Starr as saying that as long as the independent counsel is \nproviding reporters with information about ``what witnesses tell FBI \nagents'' or the independent counsel's office ``before they testify \nbefore the grand jury'' it is not subject to Rule 6(e). If such a \nstandard were adopted, there would be little practical restraint on the \ngrand jury information a prosecutor could discuss with the press.\n  Allegations of improper leaks by the Starr office were presented to \nJudge Norma Holloway Johnson, and the Associated Press reported in \nAugust of this year that Judge Johnson ruled that there is a prima \nfacie case of violations of the grand jury secrecy rules. The \nAssociated Press further reported that ``the U.S. Court of Appeals \nrejected Starr's efforts to stop Johnson's investigation, allowing her \nto continue to collect evidence and hold a hearing to determine if \nStarr's office should be punished.''\n\n\n                         conflicts of interest\n\n  Finally, there are the apparent and real conflicts of interest Mr. \nStarr has\n\n[[Page S11957]]\n\ncreated in the operations of his office. It started at the time of his \nappointment. Mr. Starr was an active partisan who had served as Finance \nChair for a Republican Congressional campaign in Virginia and who had \nhimself recently contemplated a run for the Republican nomination to \nthe U.S. Senate in Virginia. Within weeks of the filing of the Paula \nJones civil suit in May 1994, Mr. Starr appeared on television and \nespoused a legal position against the President. (He also began \ndiscussions with the Independent Women's Forum about filing a legal \nbrief on Paula Jones' behalf in opposition to efforts by the President \nto have the litigation postponed.)\n  The appointing court informed my staff it was not aware at the time \nof the appointment that Mr. Starr had expressed a position against the \nPresident in the Paula Jones case. As senior Democrat on the Senate \nsubcommittee charged with oversight of the independent counsel law, I \nurged the court shortly after Mr. Starr's appointment to make a fuller \ninquiry into Starr's apparent lack of objectivity about the President \nand based upon what the court learned, reconsider Mr. Starr's \nappointment. The court issued an order stating that, once it had \nexercised its appointment authority, it was without power to reconsider \nappointment of an independent counsel. The New York Times called on Mr. \nStarr to withdraw, while five past presidents of the American Bar \nAssociation warned the court that it needed to repair its appointment \nprocedures to ensure a selection process with the reality and \nappearance of objectivity.\n  While in office, Mr. Starr only reinforced the initial concerns about \nhis impartiality and judgment. For example, one month before the 1996 \nelection, he accepted a speaking engagement at Pat Robertson's \nuniversity at the request of Pat Robertson, including a press \nconference with Mr. Robertson, a visible and vocal opponent of the \nPresident with a history of public statements raising questions about \nVincent Foster's death, then being investigated by Mr. Starr. In 1997, \nMr. Starr announced his intention to accept a position at Pepperdine \nUniversity at a program funded with millions of dollars provided by \nRichard Scaife, another declared opponent of the President and a chief \nfunder of several organizations working on investigations into \nPresident Clinton, including the Paula Jones case. (He subsequently \nreversed course and stayed in office.)\n  During his employment with the federal government as independent \ncounsel, Mr. Starr continued his law practice at the firm of Kirkland \nand Ellis. He continued to receive his full annual remuneration as a \npartner and continued to handle a number of very high profile cases, a \nnumber of which involved issues where Mr. Starr represented the \nposition directly contrary to the Clinton Administration position.\n  In February 1998, Mr. Starr's law firm apparently sent the Chicago \nTribune copy of an affidavit of a witness in the Paula Jones case that \nwas to be filed in that case--before the affidavit had been filed in \ncourt. While Mr. Starr's firm denied assisting Jones' legal team, it \nalso resisted responding to a subpoena issued by the President's \ncounsel relative to the sending of that affidavit. Also, the press \nreported that a former counsel to Paula Jones, Joseph Cammarata, \nadmitted that he had sought legal advice on several occasions from one \nof the firm's partners, Robert Porter. So while Mr. Starr was working \nas independent counsel and continuing to serve as a partner at Kirkland \nand Ellis, one of his law partners allegedly was providing legal advice \nto the counsel in the Paula Jones case, in possible violation of the \nindependent counsel law which prohibits ``any person associated with a \nfirm with which (an) independent counsel is associated'' from \nrepresenting ``any person involved in'' any investigation conducted by \nsuch independent counsel.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  The position that Mr. Starr occupies is a position of public trust \nand duty, designed to be free from politics and partisanship, a \nposition with powerful tools for investigation, unlimited but for the \nparameters of the independent counsel law and for the common sense and \ngood judgment of the person holding the office.\n  Kenneth Starr has acted with no effective limits, because although he \nis subject to the ultimate authority of the Attorney General, given her \npower to fire him for cause, she is effectively powerless to rein in \nhis excesses because her discharge of him would be so reminiscent of \nthe ``Saturday Night Massacre'' in which Archibold Cox, the prosecutor \ninvestigating Richard Nixon, was fired. (In fact, the Attorney General \nhas already been threatened with impeachment simply because she has \ntaken a stand to protect her ongoing criminal investigations and \nprosecutions with respect to campaign finance abuses.)\n  I have urged the Attorney General, by letter, to go to court to \nenforce the requirement that Mr. Starr abide by the policies of the \nDepartment of Justice. She has not responded and perhaps could not \nbecause, I am speculating here, it could make it even more difficult \nfor her to finally act to restrain Mr. Starr should she decide to do \nso, as it might appear that she was doing so under pressure.\n  Some Democrats are reluctant to speak out against Mr. Starr's abuses \nof power out of fear that they will be perceived as defending the \nPresident's actions. Some Republicans I have spoken with, who feel Mr. \nStarr has gone too far, won't say so publicly because of the negative \nreaction it might engender in some circles in which they must function.\n  It will be difficult in this environment to salvage the legitimate \ngoal of the independent counsel law when it expires next year.\n  Any hope of achieving the radical surgery needed to prevent a \nprosecutor from abusing the powerful tools provided an independent \ncounsel will depend on Democrats and Republicans who still believe in \nthe legitimate purpose of the independent counsel law working together. \nOnly such a bipartisan effort has a chance of stitching into the \nindependent counsel law's fabric, now stretched beyond recognition, \nlimits on the exercise of an independent counsel's power which are so \nessential in our constitutional design of checks and balances to \nprevent abuses in the exercise of governmental power.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I just had the opportunity to hear the \nremarks of the distinguished Senator from Michigan concerning the \nindependent counsel.\n  I must say that those remarks are troubling to me and I do not \nbelieve contribute to really the kind of bipartisan effort that we need \nto make here in this body with regard to the delicate problem of the \nPresident's troubles.\n  It was raised under the pretension or the suggestion as part of an \nevaluation of the independent counsel but really amounted to, I think, \nan unfair restatement of many charges that have been made against the \nindependent counsel, most of which I believe have already been \nanswered, or could be answered pretty easily.\n  I served as a prosecutor for a number of years, and I would like just \nto share some thoughts.\n  I prosecuted a number of government officials. And it was my \nexperience during that process that government officials, more than any \nother person I had the occasion to investigate, were the most \naggressive and most impossible to the prosecutor. It is part of their \nteam effort with their attorneys to attack the person who is out \nspeaking the truth.\n  It is not an easy job for this independent counsel to obtain the \ntruth. These officials don't want it out. It is not their choice. It is \nnot their preference, or their desire, that what they may have done is \nrevealed, particularly if what they have done may involve perjury or \nsome illegality.\n  So it is not an easy thing to do. And when the independent counsel \nwas charged with going out and finding the truth, he faced a systematic \neffort to\n\n[[Page S11958]]\n\nobfuscate that truth. I wish it weren't so, but that is what appears to \nbe.\n  So now when we get through this process--it took several years to \nfinally get this information that we now have--we have Members of the \nother party wanting to come in here and attack the man who ultimately \nproduced what appears to be the truth. At least I have not heard it \nsubstantially disputed. And he submitted a report. They said, ``Oh, \nwell.'' Judge Sirica, he said, wanted to review the grand jury \ntestimony. That was before the independent counsel law. That was an \nunprecedented thing, I suppose, for Judge Sirica to report grand jury \ntestimony. There was no law.\n  But now, under the independent counsel law, the independent counsel \nis required to submit the information that he finds to the Congress, to \nthe House of Representatives. That is what his duty was--to find out \nthe truth and to submit it. And it was not easy to find the truth. It \noften is not. It was particularly difficult with the clever people he \nwas dealing with in this instance.\n  So it just disturbs me, I must say. And if it is true, if he has so \nviolated his oath, the Attorney General can remove him from office. If \nshe has a basis for it, she ought to do it. And she will not be \ncriticized by this Senator.\n\n  So they say, ``Well, his duty is to prosecute fairly.'' Well, you \ndon't prosecute until you get the truth. You don't prosecute until you \nget the facts. And his responsibility was to find those facts.\n  They say graphic details were not necessary. Well, I am glad that we \nhave some fastidious concern. I think we do have too much unhealthy sex \nand stuff in this country today. But we have a denial. We had a \nsuggestion that, ``What I did was not really sex.''\n  So I suppose the details of what the President may have done are \nrelevant to whether or not he had sex or not, and I am certain that is \nwhy the independent counsel felt it was his obligation to do so. And \nhis goal is to report that information.\n  They say, ``Well, he shouldn't have suggested in his report that the \nPresident lied under oath.'' That is one of the words that was said he \nused. But he was required to report on matters that may lead to \nimpeachment charges.\n  So by nature his summary report was his opinion as to whether or not \nthere was evidence accumulated sufficient to lead to impeachment. He is \nrequired to give his opinion and his summary of the evidence as to \nwhether or not it required impeachment, and he concluded, based on all \nthe studies, that the President lied under oath, apparently, and he put \nthat in his report.\n  I submit he was required to do so.\n  Oh, they say, you didn't get all the exculpatory evidence, that that \ndidn't all come out, and that she said, Miss Lewinsky said, ``No one \never asked me to lie.'' Well, I am not sure and therefore--but from \nwhat I read in the report, it would suggest to me that the Starr report \ndidn't say anybody ever said she was asked to lie. The Starr report \nsimply said that there were circumstances that led to that, apparently. \nBut it did not use those words and he would not have been required to \nput forth her statement in that regard.\n  So Judge Sirica's circumstances are not quite the same, is all I am \nsaying. And I respect the distinguished Senator and his comments and \nhis concern, and we ought to hold every public official accountable. We \nought to scrutinize all of our behavior here and we ought to be \nprepared to stand the heat. I am sure Mr. Starr has got to stand the \nheat like everybody else if he is going to be in the kitchen. If you \nrecall, we have a word in the criminal lexicon today called ``Sirica.'' \nAnd what happened was, if you will recall, some of those burglars who \nsaid, oh, this is just a two-bit burglary--do you remember that? Judge \nSirica gave them the maximum sentence, the maximum ``John,'' and that \nis when they testified.\n  So I am sure these things are tough for Miss Lewinsky or anyone else. \nShe had a choice whether she was going to cooperate and tell the truth \nor continue to hold fast to her previous story, and it does appear that \nshe did for a while adhere to one story and then changed it.\n  So I don't believe the independent counsel has placed himself above \nthe law. I don't believe he has abused his office. And I don't believe \nmost of the other complaints that have been made about the independent \ncounsel, once the full facts are out, are going to suggest any \nproblems. No doubt, there are so many complex rules over the period of \nan investigation, somebody will say you should have done this under \nthis circumstance and you should not have done this under that \ncircumstance.\n  Normally what happens is any evidence obtained from an improper \nsource gets excluded from the trial and can't be used, but it doesn't \nundermine the overall integrity of the investigation if that was \nobtained properly.\n  So I don't know what the end of this will all be. It would please me \nif things get settled and that is the end of it and this body isn't \ninvolved. I don't think we need to be debating these issues on this \nfloor, and the only reason I have spoken on this floor fundamentally is \nbecause others have made statements related to those issues, so I felt \nI ought to suggest there might be another interpretation that could be \ngiven to those issues.\n  So, to me, the issues are complex. The House is dealing with this \nmatter. Let's let the House deal with it. Let's try to make sure we \nhave a bipartisan effort, or a nonpartisan effort, that no partisanship \nshould be involved in this. Let's let the process work its way. My \nunderstanding of the reputation of Judge Starr is it is very good, and \nit remains to be seen whether he committed any error. If he did, that \nwill come out. That does not undermine the basic facts we are dealing \nwith here.\n  Mr. President, I thank this body for allowing me to make these \ncomments. I have some other things I could say but I will not. I just \nbelieve that we need to be careful. Let's let the House do their \nbusiness. They have had votes over there. It is their business, not our \nbusiness. And I think we would be better off if we left it there. I \nthank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the Random House College Dictionary defines \nthe term ``hero'' first as ``a man of distinguished courage or ability, \nadmired for his brave deeds and noble qualities,'' and second as ``a \nsmall loaf of Italian bread.''\n  There is, of course, a wide disparity in these two definitions. I \nthink I shall appropriately use the initial definition to describe the \nhero of whom I am about to speak, Senator John Herschel Glenn, Jr. I \nhave had the honor of serving with him in the Senate for the last 24 \nyears.\n  He is a gentleman. He is a great public servant to all the Ohioans \nwhose beliefs and values he has so ably represented in this body.\n  As Senator Glenn prepares to officially retire from the Senate and \ntake up his wings of flight once again, I shall take a few minutes to \nthank this distinguished Senator from Ohio for all that he has done for \nour Republic as a United States Senator and as a hero.\n  I thank him for his achievements as a Senator. I thank him for his \ndedication to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, on which he \nhas served since 1975.\n  Following his personal motto: ``You Keep Climbing,'' Senator Glenn \nhas moved up in the ranks.\n  From 1987 to 1995 he served as the chairman of the committee, and \nthen as the ranking Democratic member until the present time.\n  As a member of the committee, Senator Glenn has worked to protect our \nNation and its people, using his expert knowledge to combat the issue \nof nuclear proliferation, to protect our fellow Americans from all the \nenvironmental dangers that are associated with the byproducts of \nnuclear weapons, and is making the Government more accountable for \nwaste and fraud.\n\n  As a member of the Senate Committee on Armed Services, on which I am \npleased to serve with him, Senator\n\n[[Page S11959]]\n\nGlenn has worked to ensure that the United States military remained \nready and strong in the perilous aftermath of the cold war.\n  He has shared a concern over the dangers of chemical weapons. He has \njoined with others of us in attempting to ensure that our military has \nabsorbed the lessons of the gulf war and is prepared to protect our \ntroops from low levels of chemical weapons.\n  On these two committees, Senator Glenn has served as a voice of \nreason and common sense.\n  Senator Glenn is a hero for all of us to emulate as a result of his \nhonor and dedication to his country, his family, and his own high \nstandards.\n  I have asked this question in the Senate before: ``Where have all the \nheros gone?''\n  To this question I have no definitive answer, but I do know where \nthis hero is going to go . . . again.\n  Senator John Glenn is a steam engine in britches; he is atomic energy \nin the flesh.\n  The senior Senator from Ohio has been a daredevil virtually all of \nhis life.\n  Not one to know when to slow down, Senator Glenn has risked life and \nlimb, both on the Earth's surface and in the vastness of space which \nencompasses it, for one thing, and one thing only--the United States of \nAmerica.\n  John Glenn has been uniquely blessed to have had the opportunity \nto soar above this Earth of ours, soar like an eagle, surveying the \nbeauty of creation that is God's Green Earth.\n\n  To quote William Shakespeare in ``twelfth night,''\n\n       Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have \n     greatness thrust upon them.\n\n  Senator Glenn is one who has achieved greatness through his service \nto his country; he is truly a great American hero.\n  Not only a veteran of World War II, having served in combat in the \nSouth Pacific after he was commissioned in the Marine Corps in 1943, \nJohn Glenn is also a veteran of the Korean war.\n  Having survived 149 combat missions as a marine, our hero--our hero, \nmy hero, your hero--our hero wanted to move on to a more challenging \ncareer as a test pilot of fighter and attack aircraft for the Navy and \nMarine Corps. And then, looking for new and extreme ways to test his \nmortality, on February 20, 1962, Astronaut John Glenn gently squeezed \nhis body into the Friendship 7 rocket and became the first American to \norbit the Earth at almost 18,000 miles per hour.\n  Think of that. When I was young, I read a book by Jules Verne titled, \n``Around the World in 80 Days.'' John Glenn went around the world in 89 \nminutes.\n  This may well have been the pinnacle of John Glenn's life and career.\n  On that fateful Tuesday in 1962, not only was America waiting with \nnervously clenched fists for news on Lt. Col. John Glenn's condition \nafter his return to Earth, but the whole world was watching.\n  People from all nations prayed for the safe return of this brave man.\n  Mr. President, I quote from an article entitled ``Man's `Finest \nHour.' '' I have been saving this article, now, for almost 37 years--\n``Man's `Finest Hour','' by the late David Lawrence, which was \noriginally published in the March 5, 1962, edition of U.S. News & World \nReport:\n\n       Miracles do happen when the world shows its humility in \n     prayer.\n       The voices that besought Almighty God to save the life of \n     Colonel Glenn can speak again, as even more of us petition \n     him to save humanity from nuclear war.\n       For those prolonged minutes of prayer on Tuesday, Feb. 20, \n     constituted man's ``finest hour''.\n\n  Now, if the Good Lord is willing, on October 29, our friend and \ncolleague--and hero--John Glenn, still brimming with vital energy, will \nbe leaving the relative comfort of Mother Earth far behind.\n  It is always a melancholy time when the institution of the United \nStates Senate has one of its finest Members move on. But it is a glad \ntime when one of its Members moves on to something greater.\n  ``Excelsior, ever upward.'' That is the motto of John Glenn. He has \nbigger fish to fry, so he is ready to get away from Washington, DC--\nfar, far away.\n  Senator Glenn's return to space aboard shuttle Discovery will add \nanother significant page to the annals of history.\n  The capacity in which Senator Glenn will be operating on the \nDiscovery is representative of the way in which he had lived the last \nthree decades of his life, despite his global fame--modestly and \nwithout great fanfare.\n  I am certain that he will perform his mission on Discovery with the \nsame diligence and sense of duty that he has shown in serving his great \nState of Ohio in the United States Senate.\n  The world in 1998 is a lot different from that world of 1962, when \nJohn Glenn was first catapulted into space. Similarly, the space \nshuttle Discovery is about as close in design to the Friendship 7 \nrocket as an old Oliver typewriter--I was trying to remember the name \nof an old typewriter I had around the house when I was a boy--about as \nclose in design to the Friendship 7 rocket as an old Oliver typewriter \nis to a home computer.\n  The one thing that shall remain constant in this most recent launch \nis that the world will once again be watching, gripping chairs, biting \nfingernails, and saying its prayers for the Glenn family. For John \nGlenn, and for all the crew members of Discovery, and for Annie, that \nsweet little wife of Johns.\n  It is hard to relate, to those Americans who were not yet born in \n1962, the thoughts and emotions of the world on Tuesday, February 20, \nof that year.\n  Technology has become so advanced that flights into space are \nroutine.\n  Men and women are able to live for months at a time in floating space \nstations.\n  America tends to take for granted the risks that our Nation's \nastronauts take to perform scientific experiments, carefully placing \ncommunications satellites into orbit, and repairing important \ninstruments of observation--all of which make life on Earth much more \nenjoyable.\n  In 1962, the risks were greater and there were many unknown factors \nthat experience has now brought to light and revealed and smoothed \nover.\n  Senator Glenn's return to space brings that all back, and reminds us \nof the tremendous changes wrought by Americans within the career of one \nman.\n  So, this evening I take this opportunity to wish the best of luck to \nJohn Glenn and to Annie and to others of his family.\n  I anxiously anticipate Discovery's safe return to Earth, and I extend \nmy best wishes, and those of my wife Erma, to Senator Glenn and to \nAnnie for many years of health and happiness after he returns to Earth \nand leaves the Halls of the Capitol behind.\n  Thank you, thank you, thank you, Senator Glenn.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is almost kind of sad in a way to \nthink that Dirk Kempthorne will be leaving the Senate after only one \nterm in the U.S. Senate. It has been a pleasure to work with Dirk, to \nbe with him, to get to know him, to get to know his family, his wife \nPat. But I will just say Dirk Kempthorne is a Senator's Senator. He is \na person who comes from the great State of Idaho.\n  He brought a great deal of, I must say, refreshing energy to the \nSenate. He served as mayor of Boise City for 7 years. He was elected to \nthe U.S. Senate in 1992 and proved something unconventional: He could \nget a lot done in his first term in the Senate. Most people have the \nidea you have to be in the Senate a long time before you can get \nanything accomplished, but he proved quite the opposite.\n  He proved to be a very effective legislator. He proved to be a person \nwho could work on both sides of the aisle, that he could work with \nDemocrats and Republicans and make things happen.\n  He was the principal sponsor of a bill that most of us have claimed \nsome part to, the unfunded mandates bill that President Clinton signed \nand it became\n\n[[Page S11960]]\n\nlaw. It was strongly supported by States, Governors, mayors and \ncommissioners and others who said, ``Let's quit passing unfunded \nmandates on to the States, cities and counties.''\n  He has been instrumental in leading the fight in needed reform in the \nEndangered Species Act. He has been a tireless worker on the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  He has always kept his priorities straight. His family has always \nbeen first and foremost. His love for his State is very evident.\n  Now he will return to the State of Idaho. He is running for Governor. \nI am very confident he will be elected Governor, and I am quite \nconfident he will be one of the outstanding Governors in the country. I \nappreciate his service and his friendship. He has been an outstanding \nSenator. I hate to see him leave the U.S. Senate, but I do wish him, \nhis wife and his family best wishes as he leaves the Senate and returns \nto his State and continues his public service in a different capacity, \nand that will be as Governor of the great State of Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11959-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SENATOR DAN COATS\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I also wish to pay my compliments and \naccolades to Senator Dan Coats of Indiana. I have had the pleasure of \nknowing Dan Coats. He actually was elected to the House of \nRepresentatives in 1980, the same year I was elected to serve in the \nU.S. Senate. He had something unusual happen.\n  When Dan Quayle was selected as Vice President and elected in 1988, \nDan Coats was appointed to take his place in 1988.\n  That almost sounds like it was easy, but it turned out he had to run \nfor reelection in 1990; and he won. But that was only for a partial \nterm, and so he also had to run for reelection in 1992. So he had the \nunenviable task of having really challenging races both in 1990 and in \n1992 for the U.S. Senate. He won both, and deservedly so, because he \nhas been an outstanding U.S. Senator.\n  I remember Dan Quayle telling me, ``You're really going to like Dan \nCoats.'' Dan Quayle and I were good friends. And Dan Coats and I have \nbecome very good friends. And he was exactly right. Dan Coats and his \nwife, Marcia, his family, are not only good friends of our family, but \nI would say anybody serving in this body--anybody--whether they be on \nthe House side or the Senate side, cannot help but like Dan and Marcia \nCoats. They are a couple--they are a couple--in the greatest tradition \nof the Senate.\n  His wife Marcia has been active in the Senate wives' groups and \nactive with the prayer groups that many of our wives are involved with. \nThey go to functions together. They are athletically involved. They \nboth play tennis. They both play golf. They both have a good time. They \nkeep their priorities straight. They both have a very strong belief in \nGod and in their families, and work comes down somewhere below that.\n  He has done an outstanding job as a Senator for the great State of \nIndiana. I would say he has done an outstanding job as a Senator for \nall of us in America, whether it be his work on the Armed Services \nCommittee, whether it be his tireless efforts on welfare reform in the \nLabor Committee, his efforts to try to reduce poverty, his efforts to \nalleviate suffering amongst kids.\n  Many of our colleagues are not aware of it, but he is national \npresident of the Big Brothers program, which could probably be a full-\ntime job for anybody, but he is able to do that. He has been a Big \nBrother. He actually was a Big Brother in a town for a youngster who \ndid not have a dad, did not have a mentor. Dan Coats became his \nmentor--as a matter of fact, became his best man at his wedding.\n  What a great compliment for an individual who, of course, had \nunlimited demands on his time, was willing to take time out and serve \nas a Big Brother to a youngster who did not have a dad, and he did it \nfor years. Ultimately this young man became quite a success, a success \nin his own right, and I think in large part because of the time and \nattention and love that Dan Coats gave to him. He selected Dan Coats as \nhis best man at his wedding, which is quite a compliment.\n  Dan Coats was recently selected as Christian Statesman of the Year by \na national organization. They had a big banquet honoring him, and it \nwas well deserved. I have the pleasure of knowing Dan Coats in many \nrespects. His belief in God, it is sincere, it is real. He is the \nembodiment of a Christian statesman. And so that award was well \ndeserved.\n  He has been leader, as many of us know, of the Senate Prayer \nBreakfast that we have ongoing in the Senate that goes back for years \nand years. He has been chairman or president of that group for us for \nthe last year or so and has done a good job--done an outstanding job in \nevery respect.\n  So he is absolutely a dear friend, and I hate to see him leave the \nSenate. He has served now in the Senate since 1988, so only for 10 \nyears. But he also served 8 years in the House, and before that he \nserved a couple years in the Army. So he has given a lot of years in \npublic service, and he deserves, I guess, a chance to do something \nelse.\n  But I am confident--absolutely confident--that whatever he does will \nbe a great service to this country. He has been a real blessing to this \nbody. He and his wife have been a real blessing to this country. And it \nis with great regret that I see Dan Coats join the group of retiring \nSenators. But I do wish every best wish to him and his family, and I \ncompliment them for their outstanding service to their State, to their \ncountry, to God, and to their family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a fellow Pascagoulian \nand personal friend, Mr. Douglass Fontaine. Doug has devoted his life \nto an industry for which Mississippians are proud to be recognized--\nhospitality.\n  A third generation hotelier, Doug grew up surrounded by the hotel \nindustry. Both Doug's parents and grandparents managed the historic \nAllison's Wells Spa in Way, Mississippi. He too took his turn at \nmanaging Allison's Wells after returning from Germany, where he managed \nan R & R hotel. He then eventually relocated to Pascagoula, and for \nmore than 35 years has owned La Font Inn. Doug has not\n\n[[Page S11961]]\n\nonly brought a friendly and welcoming smile to patrons, but a legacy \nfor hotels around the United States, Europe, and the Caribbean.\n  While being the only Mississippian to serve as President and Chairman \nof the Board of the American Hotel and Motel Association, Doug \nimplemented his world renowed program ``Quest for Quality.'' This has \nnot been Doug's only contribution to society. He has held many \npositions of leadership, including residing over such community service \norganizations as the Jackson County Heart Fund, Rotary Club, United Way \nof Jackson County, and many others.\n  Doug has dedicated himself to economically develop his Gulf Coast \ncommunity by working to establish the Mobile-Pascagoula Airport, Naval \nStation Pascagoula, the Sunplex Industrial Center, and again many \nothers. He also chaired the committee to ``Save the Homeport'' from \nbase closures for many years. Currently, Doug is serving on the Board \nof Directors of the Hancock Band, a position he has held for more than \n27 years, and serves as a lifetime Director of the American Hotel and \nMotel Association.\n  On October 23, 1998, the Mississippi Hotel and Motel Association will \nestablish a Hotel and Restaurant Scholarship in his name. This great \nhonor could not be bestowed upon a finer person. An opportunity for \nfuture members of the industry, this serves as a deserving tribute to \nDoug, his wife Lou, and their children and grandchildren. I am proud to \ncongratulate this great Mississippian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11960-5", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     COMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL COMMUNITY \n                        PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I want to congratulate the National \nCommunity Pharmacists Association (NCPA) as its 100th anniversary \napproaches. One of the Nation's leading membership organizations--\nrepresenting some 30,000 independent pharmacies across the United \nStates--NCPA will celebrate its 100th anniversary on October 17th. It \nis an honor to celebrate this landmark with NCPA and recognize \nprofessionals who truly exemplify high quality, patient-focused health \ncare.\n  Throughout its 100 years of service, NCPA has been a respected voice \nin the public policy arena--not only as a highly effective advocate for \ncommunity pharmacists, but as the link to individual pharmacists with \nthe demonstrated expertise and front-line experience required to help \nevaluate policy options.\n  I'd like to take a few moments to recognize the enormous \ncontributions of the men and women NCPA represents: local, community \npharmacists. They play a critical role in our nation's health care \ndelivery system through careful drug monitoring services, personalized \nservice, coordination with other health providers and services, and \ncommunity-oriented care.\n  Each year, millions of Americans purchase prescription and non-\nprescription medications at their local pharmacy, where an on-site \npharmacist can help them select the medication that is most appropriate \nand prevent harmful drug interactions. Pharmacists have the experience \nand expertise to help consumers face an intimidating array of \nmedication options. They prevent the wasteful spending and pain and \nsuffering associated with drug complications.\n  Community pharmacists provide personalized care, and offer a \nfriendly, neighborhood presence for individuals facing illness and \ndisease. An NCPA membership survey shows that 98 percent of independent \npharmacists counsel patients face-to-face on prescription medications \nand make recommendations on over-the-counter drugs and general health \ncare issues, and 97 percent maintain patient profiles. As more drugs \nare offered through the mail and without the opportunity to meet \npersonally with a pharmacist, community pharmacists provide reassurance \nand inspire the confidence of those they serve.\n  Community pharmacists play a crucial role in local health care \ndelivery systems, by coordinating with other health professionals, \npromoting public health, and educating consumers on pharmaceutical and \nhealth issues. Many independent pharmacists report meeting regularly \nwith local physicians on drug therapy and pharmacy services. In \naddition, they educate and assist their customers with the management \nof ongoing and chronic conditions such as diabetes and hypertension.\n  Independent community pharmacies are primarily family businesses, and \nthey have roots in America's communities. They are owned by civic \nleaders who are actively involved in a variety of community-oriented \npublic health, civic, and volunteer projects. Many hold local elected \nor appointed offices. Public service and commitment to community are \nhallmarks of independent pharmacy.\n  For all of these reasons, it is my pleasure to pay tribute to \nindependent, community pharmacists and the organization that represents \nthem. Through integrity, expertise and tenacity in the face of dramatic \nchanges in our health care system, community pharmacists have inspired \nthe confidence and trust of millions of Americans. Our Nation is truly \nwell served by them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11961-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to make a brief comment, on \nthe appropriations process, and to express some concerns which I have \nabout the procedures where some of the legislative proposals have not \nbeen considered in regular order and in due course--specifically, the \nlegislation on the appropriations bill for Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education.\n  In articulating these concerns, I understand the tremendous pressures \nwhich have been presented to leadership to conclude our session with \nthe target date of October 9.\n  The Constitution gives to the Congress the authority and \nresponsibility of the appropriations process. And that customarily \nproceeds with action in the appropriations subcommittee, then the \nappropriations full committee, then the full body of the Senate, where \nSenators have an opportunity to comment on the legislation and to offer \namendments, and then, when acted upon, goes to a conference in the \nHouse of Representatives, which has followed the same pattern--\nconsideration of the subcommittee, full committee, and by the House, \nand then the conference committee.\n  That process has been short-circuited this year without having the \nlegislation, the appropriations bill on Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education, come to the Senate floor. We have sought a \nconference with our distinguished House Members--Congressman Porter, \nwho chairs the House equivalent of the subcommittee, and Congressman \nObey, the ranking minority leader--along with Senator Tom Harkin, my \ndistinguished ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  It would be my hope that as we proceed with the business of the \nSenate in future years, we would be able to proceed in regular order so \nthat the Senate has an opportunity to consider the measure, Senators \noffer amendments, and go through the regular procedure on the House-\nSenate conference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11961-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11961-S11962]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     CHRISTOPHER HAYES HONORED BY NATIONAL CRIME PREVENTION COUNCIL\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

The award recognizes individuals who \ndemonstrate outstanding leadership, courage, and dedication to crime \nprevention in their neighborhoods, states, or nationally.\n  This honor is a well-deserved tribute to Christopher Hayes and his \n13-year career as Founder and Director of the Neighborhood Crime Watch \nUnit of the Boston Police Department.\n  Mr. Hayes founded the Neighborhood Crime Watch Unit in 1985 as a one-\nperson organization based on the philosophy that the key to crime \nprevention is to rely on connections from neighbor to neighbor. He \nurged people to work together and with the police to create innovative \nsolutions for reducing local crimes. The initial model for his crime \nwatch group was simple phone tree and\n\n[[Page S11962]]\n\nwhistle alert system that allowed neighbors to keep in touch with each \nother.\n  Today, the Neighborhood Crime Watch Unit offers support and training \nfor such neighborhood groups, which now total 962 in Boston and account \nfor a third of all streets in the city. The successes have been \nimpressive. Entrenched drug dealers have been exposed and forced out. \nMuggings have been averted. Suspects have been arrested. Drugs have \nbeen seized. Vacant lots have been reclaimed. Neighborhoods have been \nreborn. Neighborhood watch units have been a vital part of the effort \nto reduce the crime rate in Boston to the record lows the city is now \nenjoying.\n  I commend Christopher Hayes for his innovative leadership and his \nextraordinary contribution to our city.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11961-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11962-S11964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATIONS TO DR. SHUKRI KHURI OF MASSACHUSETTS WINNER OF THE \n                    BERRY PRIZE IN FEDERAL MEDICINE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. It is an honor to call to the attention \nof my colleagues that Dr. Shukri F. Khuri of the Brockton/West Roxbury, \nMassachusetts Veterans Affairs Medical Center, has been awarded the \n1998 Frank Brown Berry Prize in Federal Medicine. This high honor is \nbestowed each year in memory of Dr. Frank Brown Berry, a thoracic \nsurgeon and brigadier general who served in both World War I and World \nWar II, and who served for seven years as the top medical officer in \nthe Department of Defense. The award is presented jointly by U.S. \nMedicine newspaper and the Science Applications International \nCooperation.\n  Dr. Khuri was chosen for this high honor from a large pool of \nnominees by a committee of representatives from the National Institutes \nof Health, the Department of Defense, the Veterans Health \nAdministration, and the staff of U.S. Medicine.\n  Dr. Khuri received his medical education at the American University \nof Beirut before coming to the United States in 1972. Many of us know \nAUB well as one of the premier institutions of higher education in the \nMiddle East, and as one of the strongest bulwarks of American ideals \nand values in that part of the world. Dr. Khuri's recognition as one of \nthe leading medical practitioner-scientists in the United States \nreminds us of another important fact about AUB. Many of its graduates--\n5,000 distinguished alumni--live here in the United States and make \nmajor contributions to life and society in America. In fact, Dr Khuri \nserves as President of AUB's Alumni Association of North America.\n  Dr. Khuri is now Chief of Surgical Services and Chief of \nCardiothoracic Surgery at Brockton/West Roxbury VA Medical Center, the \nlargest open-heart surgery program in the VA health care system. He \nalso serves as the Vice-Chairman of the Department of Surgery at \nBrigham and Women's Hospital and is a Professor of Surgery at the \nHarvard Medical School.\n  Dr. Khuri was honored with the Berry Prize for his accomplishments in \nthree important areas of medical research and innovation. First, he \ndeveloped a device that monitors on-line myocardial protection during \nopen heart surgery, a device which enables surgeons to monitor the \neffect of open heart surgery on the patient and to reduce the chance \nthat the surgery will cause irreversible damage. Dr. Khuri's device is \na major innovation, and it seems likely to become a standard piece of \nequipment in all cardiac surgeries.\n  Second, in cooperation with the Navy, Dr. Khuri devised strategies to \nincrease the conservation of blood during open-heart surgery. Third, he \ndirected the creation of a model system to assess the quality of care \nthat patients receive by using risk adjustment outcomes. These \ninnovations have significantly affected the practice of medicine in the \nUnited States.\n  I congratulate Dr. Khuri on the Berry Award and for his important \ncontributions to American medicine. I ask unanimous consent to insert \nat this point in the Record an article from the August 1998 issue of \nU.S. Medicine, which describes Dr. Khuri's accomplishments in greater \ndetail.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the U.S. Medicine, August 1998]\n\n    The Frank Brown Berry Prize for 1998; Cardiac Surgery, Quality \n                               Assessment\n\n       Name: Shukri F. Khuri, M.D.\n       Title: Chief of Surgical Services and Chief of \n     Cardiothoracic Surgery, Brockton-West Roxbury VA Medical \n     Center; Vice Chairman, Department of Surgery, Brigham and \n     Women's Hospital; Professor of Surgery, Harvard Medical \n     School.\n       Summary Of Accomplishment: Three disparate areas of \n     achievement:\n       Directing the creation of a model system to assess quality \n     of care using risk adjustment outcomes.\n       Developing a device that monitors online myocardial \n     protection during open heart surgery.\n       Through a collaboration with the Navy, devising strategies \n     to better conserve blood during cardiac surgery.\n       Path To Accomplishment.\n       Research-Clinical Link: Dr. Khuri chairs the largest open \n     heart surgery program in the health care system, and his \n     medical contributions promise to have a far-reaching impact \n     on medicine.\n       A native of Palestine, Dr. Khuri received his medical \n     degree with distinction from the American University of \n     Beirut in Lebanon. Following his residency there, he received \n     further training in the 1970s at Johns Hopkins University and \n     at the Mayo Clinic.\n       Today, his curriculum vitae reads like a book.\n       When he first arrived in the U.S. in 1972, he relates, his \n     intention was to return to Lebanon eventually, but \n     unfortunately it was 1976 and the strife there was at its \n     height. He could not think of returning.\n       Harvard University recruited Dr. Khuri to come to West \n     Roxbury VAMC. Again, he planned to stay only a few years, but \n     instead has remained for 22 years.\n       The West Roxbury VAMC has the oldest and the largest open \n     heart surgery program in the VA system and have been \n     designated by the agency as a Center of Excellence in cardiac \n     surgery, West Roxbury VAMC proudly states.\n       ``I've been chief of cardiac surgery [at West Roxbury] \n     since 1977,'' he relates, emphasizing that one of the \n     facility's major strengths is offering the ability to combine \n     investigative research with clinical practice.\n       ``I feel we can only improve the way we deliver care by \n     simultaneously conducting practical research that will answer \n     the frustrations that we meet in our daily work. VA is an \n     ideal environment that allowed me to combine both research as \n     well as clinical care.''\n       For example, shortly after arriving he was allowed to \n     pursue his interest in medical informatics. The result was \n     the first automated ICU in the VA system. Subsequently, he \n     chaired the surgery SIUG (Special Interest User Group), and \n     was instrumental in developing software that is in current \n     use in all VA surgical services.\n       pH In Heart Surgery: Almost all his achievements, Dr. Khuri \n     explains, ``have been bome out of some frustration with \n     certain limitations of our current clinical efforts.''\n       During open heart procedures, cardiac surgeons must cross-\n     clamp the aorta and totally interrupt the blood supply to the \n     heart in order to arrest it. However, to avoid irreversible \n     tissue damage to the heart, they also must employ myocardial \n     protection techniques, comprised of administering solutions \n     to the heart. Without such fluids, he explains, surgeon would \n     be able to safely cut off the blood flow to the hear only for \n     15 to 20 minutes.\n       This is not enough time; cardiac surgery takes a lot \n     longer, he emphasizes.\n       ``What was frustrating to me was that when we arrested the \n     heart, we had no way of assessing how well we were protecting \n     the heart during this period. There is no way today of \n     knowing while you are operating on the heart how well you are \n     protecting it from irreversible damage.\n       ``This is why we felt it was important in our research to \n     try to come up with a methodology or a technology that would \n     allow us, in an online manner, to monitor the adequacy of the \n     protection of the heart,'' he explains.\n       Based on animal experiments, which he had conducted to the \n     John's Hopkins Hospital and West Roxbury. Dr. Khuri proposed \n     in 1983 a novel approach monitoring myocardial tissue and \n     acid-balance as a valuable way to evaluate how successfully \n     the surgeons were protecting the heart during surgery. In a \n     large series of basic animal experiments, which he \n     subsequently conducted both at the West Roxbury VAMC and the \n     NMR Magnel Laboratory at MIT, Dr. Khuri demonstrated that the \n     rise in myocardial tissue hydrogen ion concentration (or fall \n     in myocardial tissue pH, measured with a glass electrode \n     which he had developed in conjunction with Vascular \n     Technology, Inc., based in Chelmsford, Mass., provided an \n     accurate metabolic measure of the magnitude of regional \n     myocardial ischemia (i.e., the damage caused by the lack of \n     adequate nutritive supply).\n       The electrode which he developed for this purpose is made \n     of special 1 mm in diameter pH-sensitive glass containing \n     silver-silver chloride. Although the full 10 mm length of the \n     electrode is inserted perpendicularly into the heart muscles, \n     is sensing surface is limited to its distal 4 mm tip, \n     allowing assessment of the acid-base balance of the deeper \n     and more vulnerable tissues of the heart.\n       The most recent prototype of the electrode also allows for \n     the simultaneous measurement of the temperature of the \n     tissues at the\n\n[[Page S11963]]\n\n     same site of electrode insertion. The electrode is attached \n     to a computerized monitor which corrects for the changes in \n     temperature and provides online readings of both the pH and \n     the hydrogen ion concentration in the heart.\n       Dr. Khuri's research group conducted animal studies which \n     also demonstrated the utility of the electrode and monitor to \n     measure regional pH changes in tissues other than the hearts, \n     specifically in transposed musculocutaneous flaps and the \n     intestinal wall.\n       The first myocardial pH measurements in man were reported \n     by Dr. Khuri's group in 1983. Since then, his group has \n     measured pH in more than 600 patients undergoing cardiac \n     surgery. Based on the observations, a new concept of ``pH-\n     Guided Myocardial Management'' has been formulated by Dr. \n     Khuri and his group.\n       FDA approval for the Khuri pH Electrode and Monitor was \n     obtained in 1987. At that time, however, ``we were reluctant \n     to distribute it nationwide, mainly because there was a lot \n     more that we needed to understand about myocardial tissue pH \n     and what it meant. Most importantly, the thing that really \n     took a great deal of time after we developed the technology \n     was to figure out what maneuvers to employ to maintain normal \n     pH levels in the heart and to reverse a fall in pH.\n       ``That was the key question that we addressed in our \n     clinical and laboratory studies since 1987,'' Dr. Khuri \n     explains.\n       The final results of these studies was the development of a \n     set of maneuvers that formed the basis of pH-Guided \n     Myocardial Management.\n       ``The underlying hypotheses behind all of this, which we \n     ultimately have verified, is that acidosis, particularly when \n     severe is bad for the heart.'' So if a surgeon can prevent \n     myocardial acidosis during surgery chances are it will \n     improve the protection of the heart and ultimately improve \n     the outcome of the patients.\n       Dr. Khuri is optimistic that the impact of pH-guided \n     myocardial management will be two-fold: surgeons will improve \n     on the adequacy to protect the heart and therefore improve \n     the outcomes of these patients, and also they will have a \n     tool which allows them to assess, in coronary bypass \n     operations exactly how well they have improved the blood \n     supply to the heart.\n       His data are very compelling and have been shared with \n     leading experts, who ``feel that it is a very promising and \n     valuable tool in cardiac surgery,'' he relates. One leading \n     expert has compared it to the now standard Swan-Ganz catheter \n     developed some 30 years ago. The monitor, which he emphasizes \n     has no known dangers or ``downside.'' might one day become a \n     routine piece of cardiac surgery equipment.\n       Once it becomes widely available commercially he is \n     confident the Veterans Health Administration will make it a \n     standard operating room device. ``The VA [medical] \n     facilities, particularly in cardiac surgery, have a wonderful \n     tract record in the use of innovative technology from the \n     pacemaker onwards'' he relates. Once the device is available \n     commercially, then ``I'm almost certain that it would be \n     applied within the VA.''\n       ``But these things do take time. There are many skeptics \n     out there'' he notes. ``There are many surgeons who believe \n     they already know how to protect the heart and do not need \n     anything new.''\n       Defeating The Bleeding: In 1983, Dr Khuri formed a \n     collaboration with colleagues at the Naval Blood Research \n     Laboratory (NBRL) in Boston. ``one of the most outstanding \n     naval research institutes in the country,.'' to tackle \n     another frustration of cardiac surgeons--unavoidable bleeding \n     following open heart surgery.\n       All cardiac surgeons, he explains, are seeking methods to \n     decrease this bleeding which sometimes can be substantial. \n     Through ``a very fruitful collaboration'' with Dr. C. Robert \n     Valeri and his team at the NBRL, Dr. Khuri has gained a \n     better understanding of this postoperative bleeding.\n       Through his years of research trying to alleviate this \n     frustration, he has come to understand the exact role of the \n     platelets in bleeding diatheses and has identified a host of \n     factors associated with the platelet which resulted in \n     platelet-dysfunction during cardiopulmonary bypass. These \n     include hypothermia, heparinia, and hemodilution.\n       In addition,``we have demonstrated, for the first time, the \n     value of using frozen platelets as an alternative to using \n     fresh platelets'' and have shown, ``I think unequivocally \n     that you can use heparin-coated circuits with low-dose \n     heparin to a big advantage during cardiopulmonary bypass.''\n       ``We are advocating a compendium of techniques and \n     maneuvers that, in our hands at least, have decreased the \n     magnitude of postoperative bleeding'' by almost 80 percent, \n     he relates.\n       ``Our blood loss postoperatively now is really minimal in \n     these patients.'' His unit has not taken a patient back to \n     the operating room for bleeding in several months, a step \n     which was commonplace previously.\n       Part of the technique he advocates is the use of heparin-\n     coated circuits with low-dose heparin, which decreases the \n     need for heparin and protamine during cardiopulmonary bypass. \n     Not many institutions are using this technique--including VHA \n     facilities, he points out.\n       The cardiac surgery unit at Boston University, where the \n     technique also is used, he states, ``has had just as dramatic \n     an experience in reducing their blood loss as we have here.''\n       Part of this work has been published, and one paper \n     explaining his work on cryopreserved platelets has been \n     accepted for publication in the Journal of Thoracic and \n     Cardiovascular Surgery, which he hopes will add ``academic \n     credibility'' to his strategy. Dr. Khuri suspects that, \n     following publication, a number of institutions will adopt \n     these procedures to reduce bleeding.\n       Again, in describing the medical community's reaction, he \n     explains that it often takes time for professionals to adapt \n     a new method or theory. ``It's exciting in a way that we are \n     at the cutting edge, but it's also disappointing that it \n     takes time to get this thing to people.''\n       Science is cautiously slow, he concedes.\n       National Outcome Assessment: Dr. Khuri, as chief of \n     surgery, has found another frustration to consume his time.\n       ``I am someone that believes very, very strongly that VA \n     results have always been excellent in surgery. We have very \n     good surgical centers at the Veterans Health Administration, \n     particularly those that are affiliated with major \n     institutions,'' he asserts, noting that he is a full \n     professor at Harvard Medical School and all his staff have \n     academic appointments at Harvard.\n       Unfortunately, the VA has been often criticized for having \n     high mortality rates after surgery. In fact, in the mid '80s, \n     ``a very concentrated attack'' by the media attempted to \n     ``discredit'' VA by publishing surgical outcomes, which \n     various periodicals claimed were evidence of higher mortality \n     rates than in the private sector.\n       ``I felt very frustrated by this,'' he relates. ``We were \n     all convinced we were doing a good job and that our results \n     were the same as [his affiliated hospital at] the Brigham.''\n       The difference, he points out, is that VA patients are \n     sicker patients and therefore are at higher risk of dying as \n     a result of surgery. ``No one would dispute this,'' he \n     stresses.\n       This debate over higher VA mortality rates reached a climax \n     in 1986, Dr. Khuri relates, prompting Congress to pass a \n     mandate that VA must report its surgical outcomes in \n     comparison to national averages and risk-adjusted for the \n     patients' severity of illnesses. VA also was to report to \n     Congress every two years on how it addressed this mandate.\n       In 1987, VA asked him to chair a committee to fulfill this \n     task. ``It became very evident to us when we met as a group \n     that the congressional mandate was untenable because there \n     were no national standards for surgical outcomes anywhere in \n     the world.'' There were no models for risk-adjusted outcomes \n     either.\n       Dr. Khuri's committee advised VA to explain to Congress the \n     lack of national standards and pointed out that the agency \n     was in the unique position not only to develop these national \n     standards, but also to develop risk-adjusted outcomes with \n     which it could compare one VA medical facility to another and \n     to the private sector.\n       It took almost three years to convince VA to make this \n     claim to Congress and to agree to fund an initiative to \n     address these issues.\n       The committee he chaired put together a study to examine \n     the unadjusted outcomes in the VA surgical services. In 1991, \n     it launched the National VA Surgical Risk Study in 44 VA \n     medical centers and assigned clinical nurses to collect \n     preoperative, intraoperative, and outcomes data--both deaths \n     and complications on all major operations.\n       From the inception of the study, an advisory board \n     comprised of leading outside experts advised the study how to \n     proceed and conduct analyses. Dr. Khuri also recruited Dr. \n     Jennifer Daley, an expert in health science research, as his \n     co-chair of the risk study. The results of this prospective \n     analysis ultimately lead to the development of national \n     models that allowed VA to report its outcomes adjusted for \n     the severity of illness of its patients.\n       O/E Ratio: An assessment system was developed that enabled \n     a particular surgical service to calculate the expected \n     mortality or complications rate for patients undergoing \n     surgery over a certain period of time in that hospital, based \n     on the preoperative severity of their illnesses.\n       Then using the observed mortality rate for the same period, \n     an observed to expected ration, or ``O/E Ratio'' could be \n     generated, he explains.\n       If the observed ratio is much higher than that expected, \n     based on the severity of the illness of the patients, he \n     explains, the assumption is that there are other factors that \n     have contributed to the high mortality rate of that \n     population, probably related to the quality of care in that \n     institution.\n       A study was performed to validate the O/E Ratio as a \n     measure of quality of care, and by January 1995, ``we had \n     developed for the first time models that would allow for risk \n     adjustment, not only in cardiac surgery, but in almost every \n     major field of non-cardiac surgery.''\n       VA recognized the value of this as a way to continuously \n     monitor the quality of surgical care, Dr. Khuri notes.\n       ``The VA leadership was insightful enough to go along with \n     our recommendation that the models that had been developed \n     should be applied to all the VA's that were doing surgery.'' \n     The result was the National Surgical Quality Improvement \n     Program (NSQIP), which Dr. Khuri chairs and which basically \n     expanded the methodology employed in the National VA Surgical \n     Risk Study of all 123 VA medical centers performing surgery.\n\n[[Page S11964]]\n\n       The program uses 88 full-time nurses to collect data on all \n     major surgery in the VA, which is transmitted to the program \n     database in Chicago. The ``very rich database'' contains more \n     than 500,000 cases, he relates, and generates annually a \n     detailed report for each surgical service at the VA.\n       The program has published more than 17 publications about \n     the NSQIP data and, within the coming year the program will \n     be accessed through the Internet.\n       VHA had certain advantages as it implemented the outcome \n     assessment program, he explains. First, the agency's uniform \n     clinical and administrative database and software program--\n     the Decentralized Hospital Computer Program, now known as \n     VISTA--has permitted the NSQIP to access a consistent \n     surgical scheduling module and operating room log in every \n     VAMC to identify all operations performed in operating rooms \n     throughout the country and to centralize the data so that the \n     surgical nurse reviewers enter uniform data.\n       However, the NSQIP risk models and outcomes may have a few \n     limitations, he cautions, because they may not be \n     generalizable to populations dissimilar to veterans. Further, \n     to reduce the data collection burden for the nurse reviewers, \n     operation- and subspecialty-specific patient risk factors are \n     not collected for non-cardiac surgery.\n       A final limitation, Dr. Khuri notes, is that the outcomes \n     measured in the NSQIP currently are restricted to the adverse \n     occurrences of postsurgical mortality and morbidity, and \n     length of stay.\n       ``There is a lot of interest now, not just among the VA \n     surgeons, but among the surgical community outside of VA.'' \n     Dr. Khuri contends, especially with modern medicine's current \n     emphasis on managed care and cost containment.\n       ``VA has completely adopted this,'' Dr. Khuri proudly \n     notes, and ``it is leading the world in the use of risk-\n     adjusted outcomes.\n       ``We think that the NSQIP is providing models that are \n     leading the way towards the qualification of quality of \n     surgery and the ability to compare the quality of care at \n     various institutions using risk adjusted outcomes,'' Dr. \n     Khuri declares.\n       Results of the National VA Surgical Risk Study were \n     published as to lead three articles in the October 1997 issue \n     of the Journal of the American College of Surgeons, and a \n     full description of the NSQIP will be published in the \n     upcoming October issue of the Annals of Surgery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11962-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n TRIBUTE TO BILL SHIELDS FOR HIS DISTINGUISHED SERVICE TO THE CONGRESS \n                             AND THE NATION\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to pay tribute to Bill \nShields of the Department of Defense, who is retiring after two decades \nof impressive service to the Nation. He is an outstanding attorney \nwhose intellectual skills and dedication have helped to maintain and \nimprove our country's military.\n  Bill is a native of Buffalo, New York. He received his BA and JD \ndegrees from the University of Buffalo, and a L.LM from the National \nLaw Center at George Washington University.\n  Bill then served in a number of legal positions in the Department of \nDefense, including assistant in charge of a legal office in Florida, \ncounsel for an air station in Maine, and international law attorney in \nJapan.\n  I first met Bill in 1987, when he joined my staff as a Congressional \nFellow with the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources. As \nChairman of that Committee I was extremely impressed with Bill's work \non the Polygraph Protection Act and the Minimum Wage Act. He spent \nendless hours researching these issues, drafting the statutory \nlanguage, and preparing witnesses and Senators for hearings. His \nefforts were indispensable in obtaining enactment of those two critical \npieces of legislation.\n  After leaving the Committee, Bill served as Deputy Assistant for \nCivil Affairs and as Deputy Director of the Appellate Government \nDivision in the Department of the Navy, and excelled in both \nassignments.\n  In 1993, he became Legislative Counsel in the Secretary of the Navy's \nOffice of Legislative Affairs. In that position, he worked closely with \nus on the Senate Armed Services Committee on key issues such as \nacquisition reform, the A-12 aircraft contract termination, and the \nSeawolf submarine.\n  In 1994, Bill was appointed as Counsel and Special Assistant for \nLegislative Affairs in the Office of the Secretary of Defense. In that \nposition, he has been deeply involved in issues such as research and \ndevelopment, test and evaluation, acquisition policy, major weapons \nsystems, and intelligence. Bill was primary liaison with Congress for \nthe Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, the \nDirector of Defense Research and Engineering, the Director of Test \nSystems Engineering and Evaluation and the Director of the Defense \nAdvanced Research Projects Agency.\n  In this capacity, Bill worked with Senators and staff on a daily \nbasis to ensure the effective use of scarce defense resources during a \nperiod of major defense restructuring. He was responsible for \noverseeing the authorization of $67 billion of the annual DOD budget \nfor such projects as the F/A-18, F-22 and Joint Strike Fighter \naircraft, the New Attack Submarine, the Commanche helicopter, numerous \nmedical research projects and the Technology Reinvestment Program. On \nall of these issues, Bill's leadership, intelligence, and integrity \nhave contributed significantly to the readiness and ability of our \ntroops in the field.\n  Congress and the nation owe a debt of gratitude to Bill Shields. His \nskillful leadership will continue to have a lasting impact on our \nnational security for years to come. It has been an honor to be \nassociated with this exceptional public servant. His distinguished \nservice will genuinely be missed, both in the Pentagon and in Congress.\n  All of us who know Bill are grateful for his leadership and his \nfriendship. We wish him every success in his new position as General \nCounsel for the American College of Radiology. We know that his wife \nMaryann, and his three children, Andrew, Molly and Brian, are proud of \nhim as he reaches this special milestone, and all of us in Congress are \nproud of him too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11964-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11964]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today I want to take a few moments to \nlet my colleagues in the Senate and House of Representatives know about \nthe progress we have made in promoting Honesty in Sweepstakes during \nthe 105th Congress.\n  Over the past month, the Honesty in Sweepstakes Act of 1998, S. 2141, \nmade excellent progress as it was refined and polished. These \nrefinements reflect the valuable input I received from witness \ntestimony and my fellow Senators during a Governmental Affairs \nSubcommittee hearing on S. 2141. The newest Honesty in Sweepstakes \nlanguage also reflects the results of numerous productive discussions \nand negotiations with interested parties, including the Postal Service, \nthe industry, the AARP and consumer protection groups.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Senator Thompson and Senator Cochran, \nwho as the respective Chairmen of the Governmental Affairs Committee \nand the International Security, Proliferation and Federal Services \nSubcommittee, have been helpful and gracious in their efforts to help \nme move this sweepstakes reform legislation during the 105th Congress. \nI also want to thank my good friend, Senator Collins, who cosponsored \nmy original Honesty in Sweepstakes bill and provided valuable input \nthat is reflected in the new language I am talking about today.\n\n[[Page S11965]]\n\n  This revised Honesty in Sweepstakes legislation would go a long way \ntoward protecting our nation's seniors and other vulnerable consumers \nfrom misleading and deceptive sweepstakes promotions. This is something \nwe should do this year to protect consumers. I urge my colleagues to \npass this legislation before the 105th Congress concludes.\n  For my colleagues' reference, I ask unanimous consent that this new \nHonesty in Sweepstakes language be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the language was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                  S.--\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled.\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to \ncommend Senator Campbell for his efforts to protect consumers from con \nartists who try to cheat Americans using deceptive mailings. I am \npleased to join in support of his legislation.\n  Senator Campbell's bill would require a disclosure on mailings to \ninform individuals that they have not automatically won a prize and \nthat a purchase is not necessary to participate in a sweepstakes \ncontest. New civil penalties could be imposed on violations of the \nprovisions against sending deceptive mail.\n  Senator Campbell has been a strong leader and forceful advocate for \ncurtailing abuses by sweepstakes firms who send misleading mailings \nthat suggest that people have won hundreds of thousands, or even \nmillions, of dollars. Such deceptive mailings have caused people across \nthe country to buy unnecessary products or to send money in the hope of \nwinning a large prize. One scam even prompted some individuals to fly \nto Florida thinking they had won the grand prize in a major \nsweepstakes.\n  Millions of Americans have received sweepstakes letters that use \ndeceptive marketing ploys to encourage the purchase of magazines and \nother products. A common tactic is a promise of winnings printed in \nlarge type, such as: ``You Were Declared One of Our Latest Sweepstakes \nWinners And You're About to Be Paid $833,337 in Cash!'' Of course, the \nrecipient isn't really a winner, as the fine print said the money is \nwon only ``If you have and return the grand prize winning number in \ntime.''\n  Another problem is what I call ``government look-alike mailings,'' \nwhich look deceptively like mailings from Federal agencies. An example \nof such a deceptive mailing was sent to be by a woman from Machiasport, \nMaine. The letter was marked ``Urgent Delivery, A Special Notification \nof Cash Currently Being Held by the U.S. Government is ready for \nshipment to you.'' A postcard asks the consumer to send $9.97 to learn \nhow to receive this cash. Of course, this was not a legitimate mailing \nfrom the Federal Government, but simply a ploy used by an unscrupulous \nindividual to trick an unsuspecting consumer into sending money.\n  The experience of my constituents, as well as testimony presented by \nSenator Campbell and others at the hearing chaired by our colleague, \nSenator Cochran, convinced me that Congress must pass strong \nlegislation to stop sweepstakes fraud and deceptive mailings.\n  As Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I have \nfocused our agenda on a number of consumer frauds, and I will be \nworking with Senator Cochran to further examine the issue of deceptive \nmailings in the coming months. I commend Senator Campbell for his \nleadership and look forward to working with him on this issue next \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11964-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11965-S11966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PROSTATE CANCER RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nprostate cancer research, and to thank Senator Stevens and my other \ncolleagues for their leadership on this important issue. While I am \npleased with the strides this Congress has made in funding research at \nthe National Institutes of Health (NIH), I share the concern that the \nallocation of NIH funds may be done in a manner disproportionate to a \ndisease's severity and occurrence. I understand that prostate cancer \nresearch is one of those areas.

Mr. President, I would like to pay a brief tribute to my \nfriend and colleague and neighbor from the State of Arkansas for his 24 \nyears of service in the Senate.\n  I have had the pleasure of working with Senator Dale Bumpers since I \nwas elected to the Senate 18 years ago. So I am completing three terms. \nHe is just completing four terms. Twenty-four years in the Senate is a \nlong time. But I think the Senate has been blessed by his humor, his \nlevity. The camaraderie that Senator Bumpers has brought to the Senate \nfloor and to the Senate group has been enjoyable, educational, and \nhumorous, to say the least.\n  I have had the pleasure of serving with Senator Bumpers on the Energy \nCommittee where he has been ranking member for the last several years. \nWe have worked together on a lot of legislation. We passed some good \nlegislation, I might add, as well. So I compliment him for his years of \nservice.\n  He served 4 years as Governor of Arkansas; I think he was elected in \n1970; and elected to the U.S. Senate in 1974. It seems like he has been \nin the same chair for years. He has been the same Senator who will \nstill get excited on a speech and pull his microphone cord to the \nlimit. Maybe he might test the limit of the cord as much as anybody I \nknow in the Senate--a very good speaker, a very good friend who has \nserved his State very well.\n  We worked together on several pieces of legislation, including \nlegislation that dealt with the exchange of lands, both for the Forest \nService and for protecting lands in both Arkansas and Oklahoma, that \nwould not have happened if it had not been for his good work and \nleadership. And frankly, he was a pleasure to work with on that bill, \nand many other pieces of legislation throughout our careers.\n  So I certainly wish Dale Bumpers and his wife Betty every best wish \nin their days ahead. He has made a valuable contribution as a Member of \nthe U.S. Senate and as a Member of our Senate family.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Let me first join my good friend from Oklahoma in his \naccolades for Senator Bumpers. I expect that I, as a Republican, \nprobably supported some of Senator Bumpers' pieces of legislation more \nthan any other Republican. And I had an opportunity to work with him on \nmany that were not popular with some of the people, especially in the \nfar West. But I point out that I have enjoyed so much working with him, \nespecially on things which most all of us agreed on, as the \npreservation of Civil War sites and other of our historical aspects \nwhich are so important to this Nation.\n  I am going to be so sorry to see him leave. We had many wonderful \ntimes together. And I expect we will have some more out in his great \nState.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11966-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting one \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \napprorpriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11966-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11966]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Hayes, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 4104) making appropriations for the Treasury Department, the \nUnited States Postal Service, the Executive Office of the President, \nand certain Independent Agencies, for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 1999, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  The message also announced that Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2392.

A bill to amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to \npermit certain youth to perform certain work with wood products; to the \nCommittee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n           legislation amending the fair labor standards act\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation designed to permit certain youths (those exempt \nfrom attending school) between the ages of 14 and 18 to work in \nsawmills under special safety conditions and close adult supervision. \nWhile I realize that this legislation cannot be enacted so late in the \nsession, I believe it is important to introduce the bill and promote a \nserious discussion on this issue.\n  As Chairman of the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nAppropriations Subcommittee, I have strongly supported increased \nfunding for the enforcement of the important child safety protections \ncontained in the Fair Labor Standards Act. I also believe, however, \nthat accommodation must be made for youths who are exempt from \ncompulsory school-attendance laws after the eighth grade. It is \nextremely important that youths who are exempt from attending school be \nprovided with access to jobs and apprenticeships in areas that offer \nemployment where they live.\n  The need for access to popular trades is demonstrated by the Amish \ncommunity. Earlier this week I toured an Amish sawmill in Lancaster \nCounty, Pennsylvania, and had the opportunity to meet with some of my \nAmish constituency. They explained that while the Amish once made their \nliving almost entirely by farming, they have increasingly had to expand \ninto other occupations as farmland disappears in many areas due to \npressure from development. As a result, many of the Amish have come to \nrely more and more on work in sawmills to make their living. The Amish \nculture expects youth upon the completion of their education at the age \nof 14 to begin to learn a trade that will enable them to become \nproductive members of society. In many areas work in sawmills is one of \nthe major occupations available for the Amish, whose belief system \nlimits the types of jobs they may hold. Unfortunately, these youths are \ncurrently prohibited by law from employment in this industry until they \nreach the age of 18. This prohibition threatens both the religion and \nlifestyle of the Amish.\n  The House has already passed by a voice vote H.R. 4257, introduced by \nmy distinguished colleague, Representative Joseph R. Pitts, which is \nsimilar to the bill I am introducing today. I am aware that concerns to \nH.R. 4257 exist: safety issues have been raised by the Department of \nLabor and Constitutional issues have been raised by the Department of \nJustice. I have addressed these concerns in my legislation.\n  Under my legislation youths would not be allowed to operate power \nmachinery, but would be restricted to performing activities such as \nsweeping, stacking wood, and writing orders. My legislation requires \nthat the youths must be protected from wood particles or flying debris \nand wear protective equipment, all while under strict adult \nsupervision. The Department of Labor must monitor these safeguards to \ninsure that they are enforced.\n  The Department of Justice has stated that H.R. 4257 would ``raise \nserious concerns'' under the Establishment Clause. The House measure \nconfers benefits only to a youth who is a ``member of a religious sect \nor division thereof whose established teachings do not permit formal \neducation beyond the eighth grade.'' By conferring the ``benefit'' of \nworking in a sawmill only to the adherents of certain religions, the \nDepartment argues that the bill appears to impermissibly favor religion \nto ``irreligion.'' In drafting my legislation, I attempted to overcome \nsuch an objection by conferring permission to work in sawmills to all \nyouths who ``are exempted from compulsory education laws after the \neighth grade.'' Indeed, I think a broader focus is necessary to create \na sufficient range of vocational opportunities for all youth who are \nlegally out of school and in need of vocational opportunities.\n  I also believe that the logic of the Supreme Court's 1972 decision in \nWisconsin v. Yoder supports my bill. Yoder held that Wisconsin's \ncompulsory school attendance law requiring children to attend school \nuntil the age of 16 violated the Free Exercise clause. The Court found \nthat the Wisconsin law imposed a substantial burden on the free \nexercise of religion by the Amish since attending school beyond the \neighth grade ``contravenes the basic religious tenets and practices of \nthe Amish faith.'' I believe a similar argument can be made with \nrespect to Amish youth working in sawmills. As their population grows \nand their subsistence through an agricultural way of life decreases, \ntrades such as sawmills become more and more crucial to the \ncontinuation of their lifestyle. Barring youths from the sawmills \ndenies these youths the very vocational training and path to self-\nreliance that was central to the Yoder Court's holding that the Amish \ndo not need the final two years of public education.\n  At this stage in the legislative process, so close to the end of the \n105th Congress, passage of my bill requires a unanimous consent \nagreement. I have already been notified that there are Senators who \nwould object to such an agreement, and I do understand that a measure \nof this nature cannot be rushed through the Senate. Nevertheless, I \noffer my legislation in the hope of beginning a dialogue on this \nimportant issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Hollings, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2580. A bill to amend the Trade Act of 1974, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                     THE TRADE FAIRNESS ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation responding to the critical steel import crisis \nalong with my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, who \nserves with me as co-chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, Senator \nHollings, and Senator Santorum. Our bill is entitled the ``Trade \nFairness Act of 1998'' because it would amend the Trade Act of 1974 to \nremove statutory provisions which put our domestic industry at a \nsignificant disadvantage compared to their foreign competitors. \nSpecifically, this bill makes technical corrections to the so-called \n``Section 201'' provisions of the Trade Act of 1974 to harmonize our \nlaws with international laws administered by the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  While I know it is very late in the 105th legislative session, we \nintend that the introduction of this legislation will demonstrate our \nbipartisan commitment to responding to the current steel import crisis. \nFurther, this should send a strong signal to the administration that it \nis high time that we respond.\n  Yesterday, Senator John D. Rockefeller, Congressman Ralph Regula and \nCongressman Jim Oberstar, and I met with representatives of the Clinton \nadministration, specifically Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, Commerce \nSecretary William Daley, United States Trade Representative Ambassador \nCharlene Barshefsky and National Economic Council Advisor Gene \nSperling, to discuss the steel import issue. At that meeting, \nrepresentatives of the Clinton administration assured us that they are \nlooking into actions that the administration can take to respond to the \nillegal dumping of foreign steel on the U.S. market but have yet to \nmake a final decision on their response.\n  While I appreciate their efforts to take a closer look at the \nproblem, I am disturbed by the Administration's failure to take \nimmediate action up to this time to prevent more cheap steel from \nflooding the American market. I am further disturbed by the fact that \nsenior administration officials could\n\n[[Page S11972]]\n\nnot give me a specific date or timetable as to when we could expect a \nresponse from the administration on this crucial and pressing issue.\n  The urgency of this crisis and the failure of the administration to \ntake action was evident from testimony presented on September 10, 1998, \nwhere, as Chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus, I joined House Chairman \nRegula in convening a joint meeting of the Senate and House Steel \nCaucuses to hear from executives from the United Steelworkers of \nAmerica and a number of the nation's largest steel manufacturers about \nthe current influx of imported steel into the United States. At that \nmeeting, I expressed my profound concern regarding the impact on our \nsteel companies and Steelworkers of the current financial crises in \nAsia and Russia, which have generated surges in U.S. imports of Asian \nand Russian steel.\n  The past three months have been the highest monthly import volumes in \nU.S. history and, with Asia and Russia in economic crisis and with \nother major industrial nations not accepting their fair share of the \nadjustment burden, U.S. steel companies and employees are being damaged \nby this injurious unfair trade.\n  The United States has become the dumping ground for foreign steel. \nRussia has become the world's number one steel exporting nation and \nChina is now the world's number one steel-producing nation, while \nenormous subsidies to foreign steel producers have continued. In fact, \nthe Commerce Department recently revealed that Russia, one of the \nworld's least efficient producers, was selling steel plate in the \nUnited States at more than 50 percent, or $110 per ton, below the \nconstructed cost to make steel plate. The dumping of this cheap steel \non the American market ultimately costs our steel companies in lost \nsales and results in fewer jobs for American workers.\n  Specifically, in the first half of 1998, total U.S. steel imports \nwere 18.2 million net tons, which is a 12.4 percent increase over \n1997's record level of 16.2 million net tons for the same period. For \nthe month of June 1998, total U.S. imports of steel mill products \ntotaled over 3.7 million net tons, which is up 39.2 percent from the \nJune, 1997 level of 2.6 million net tons. In June 1998, U.S. imports of \nfinished steel imports were a record 3 million net tons, a 41.6 percent \nincrease over the June 1997 2.1 million net tons.\n  Also in the first half of 1998, compared to the same period in 1997, \nsteel imports from Japan are up 114 percent, steel imports from Korea \nare up 90 percent, and imports from Indonesia are up 309 percent. Most \nsignificantly, the U.S. steel industry currently employs 163,000 people \ndown from 500,000 people in the 1980's. This situation is untenable for \nthe American steelworkers, steel manufacturers, their customers, and \nthe American people in general.\n  I believe that the growing coalition of steel manufacturers, \nsteelworkers, and Congress must work together to remedy this import \ncrisis before it is too late and the U.S. steel industry is forced to \nendure an excruciatingly painful economic downturn. The United States \nhas many of the tools at its disposal to protect our steel industry \nfrom unfair and illegally dumped steel; therefore, I submitted Senate \nConcurrent Resolution 121 on September 29, 1998, to call on the \nPresident to take all necessary measures to respond to the surge of \nsteel imports resulting from the Asian and Russian financial crises. \nSpecifically, the resolution called on the President to: pursue \nenhanced enforcement of the U.S. trade laws; pursue all tools available \nto ensure that other nations accept a more equitable sharing of these \nsteel imports; establish a task force to closely monitor U.S. imports \nof steel; and, report to Congress by January 5, 1999, on a \ncomprehensive plan to respond to this surge of steel imports. I am \npleased to state that as of today's date, twenty-nine of my Senate \ncolleagues have joined me in sponsoring this resolution.\n  While this resolution is an appropriate way for Congress to express \nour concerns and request immediate actions by the administration to \nrespond to the steel import crisis, I think it is also important to \ngive the administration all the necessary tools to fight the surges of \nforeign steel. After reviewing the U.S. trade laws with Senator \nRockefeller, we discovered that our laws regarding safeguard actions \nactually put the United States at a disadvantage in the international \ntrade arena. Safeguard actions, or section 201 of the 1974 Trade Act, \nprovide a procedure whereby the President has the discretion to grant \ntemporary import relief to a domestic industry seriously injured by \nincreased imports. Our laws in this area are actually more strict than \nthose agreements made during the Uruguay Round negotiations on the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). That agreement, which \nthe Senate considered and passed on December 1, 1994, established the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) to administer these trade agreements.\n  One such trade agreement established rules for the application of \nsafeguard measures. The agreement provides that a member of the WTO may \napply a safeguard measure to a product if the member has determined \nthat such product is being imported into its territory in such \nincreased quantities, absolute or relative to domestic production, and \nunder such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause serious injury \nto the domestic industry that produces like or directly competitive \nproducts. The comparable U.S. statute, referred to as section 201, goes \nfurther than this agreement by requiring that foreign imports are the \nsubstantial cause of the injury. It just does not make sense to hinder \nthe administration by placing this additional burden on it in \nevaluating a claim of injury due to surges of imports. We need to level \nthe playing field so that all countries are playing by the same rules. \nThis oversight is one example of the technical corrections that must be \nmade to U.S. trade laws to bring them in line with WTO's rules.\n  Specifically, the bill that Senator Rockefeller and I are introducing \ntoday, the Trade Fairness Act of 1998, makes three technical changes. \nFirst, it removes the requirement that imports must be a \n``substantial'' cause of the serious injury by deleting the word \n``substantial.'' The WTO's Safeguards Agreement does not require that \nincreased imports be a ``substantial'' cause of serious injury. This \nchange will lower the threshold to prove that the influx of imports \nwere the cause of injury to the affected industry and will make U.S. \nlaw consistent with the WTO rules.\n  Second, the legislation clarifies that the International Trade \nCommission (ITC) shall not attribute to imports injury caused by other \nfactors in making a determination that imports are a cause of serious \ninjury. This provision will require the ITC to evaluate causation to \ndetermine which factors are causing injury. If serious injury is being \ncaused by increased imports, whether or not other factors are also \ncausing injury, safeguard relief is justified. This provision is a more \nfaithful implementation of the GATT Agreement and will prevent \ncircumstances such as a recession from blocking invocation of Section \n201 by the administration.\n  Finally, this legislation brings the definition of ``serious injury'' \nin line with the definition codified in the GATT Agreement. The bill \nstrikes the definition of serious injury and replaces it with the WTO's \nlanguage regarding evaluation of whether increased imports have caused \nserious injury to a domestic industry. Specifically, it states ``with \nrespect to serious injury'', the ITC should consider ``the rate and \namount of the increase in imports of the product concerned in absolute \nand relative terms; the share of the domestic market taken by increased \nimports; changes in the levels of sales; production; productivity; \ncapacity utilization; profits and losses; and, employment.'' These \nfactors are important guidance to the ITC in evaluating a petition of \nserious injury. Again, I think it is appropriate to be consistent with \nthe WTO language as America increasingly interacts on a global scale.\n  The U.S. steel industry has become a world class industry with a very \nhigh-quality product. This has been achieved at a great cost: $50 \nbillion in new investment to restructure and modernize; 40 million tons \nof capacity taken out of the industry; and a work force dramatically \ndownsized from 500,000 to 170,000. With these technical changes, the \nAdministration will be armed with ammunition to bring a self-initiated \nSection 201 action on behalf\n\n[[Page S11973]]\n\nof the steel industry that has been harmed not only by the onslaught of \ncheap imports on a daily basis but by U.S. law that has prevented swift \nand immediate action by the U.S. government. This legislation is \nessential to allow the President to respond promptly to the current \nsteel import crisis. It will allow steel companies to compete in a more \nfair trade environment, preventing bankruptcies that would cause the \nloss of thousands of high-paying jobs in the steel industry. Too many \nsteelworkers have lost their jobs due to unfair cheap imports.\n  Mr. President, to summarize, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation on behalf of Senator Rockefeller, Senator Santorum, Senator \nHollings and myself, to try to deal with a very serious surge of steel \nimports into the United States, which is threatening to decimate the \nsteel industry and take thousands of jobs from American steelworkers in \na way which is patently unfair and in violation of free trade \npractices.\n  It is obvious that the matter is a sensitive one where imports are \ncoming from Russia illustratively. The Russians are having enormous \neconomic problems, and they are dumping steel in the United States far \nbelow cost to try to remedy their economic situation. Sympathetic as we \nmay be to the problems of the Russians, when they dump, unload steel in \nthe United States far under their cost, it violates international trade \nlaws and it violates the trade laws of the United States.\n  To reiterate our meeting yesterday was one where those of us in \nCongress on the steel caucus asked the administration to take \nadministrative action. We have requested a meeting with the President \nfor tomorrow before the session ends to try to persuade him to take \nthis action. Our requests are not protectionism. They are not \nprotectionism because they come within the definition of ``free trade'' \nwhere our laws are defined consistent with GATT and the World Trade \nOrganization to prohibit subsidized goods and dumped goods from coming \ninto this country.\n  Again, the legislation we are proposing today would remove the \nrequirement that imports must be a substantial cause of the serious \ninjury and only require that the damages be caused by the imports, by \nstriking the word ``substantial,'' which is consistent with GATT, and \nwith the World Trade Organization. We have a higher standard than we \nhave to. Our laws ought to be changed to eliminate ``substantial \ncause'' to ``cause in fact.''\n  Secondly, this bill would change the existing law by not seeking an \nexcuse where there are other factors which may result in the imports.\n  A third part of the bill changes the definition of ``serious injury'' \nto include a consideration by the International Trade Commission of \nfactors such as the rate and amount of increase of imports of the \nproduct, the market share taken by the increased imports, changes in \nlevel of sales, profits, losses, production, productivity, capacity, \nutilization, and employment.\n  Stated succinctly, what we are seeking to do is to amend existing \ntrade laws to conform to international rules of the World Trade \nOrganization and GATT so that we may see to it that our own steel \nindustry is not victimized by foreign imports and is not victimized by \nstandards under our own trade laws, which are tougher and more \nstringent than international trade laws.\n  We realize that in introducing this legislation today that it cannot \nbe enacted before the end of the session. But we do want to make a \npoint with the administration as to where we are heading in the \nfuture--a resolution which was introduced which has some 29 cosponsors \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  The House of Representatives has a similar resolution. There are more \nthan 100 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. It is our hope \nthat the administration will provide some relief which will be fair, \nequitable, and just.\n  In the absence of relief by the administration, then it will be \nnecessary for the Congress to move ahead in a more forceful manner.\n  I have introduced legislation over the past decade which calls for a \nprivate right of action, which I believe is the realistic answer, where \nan injured party could go into the Federal court and get injunctive \nrelief which would be immediate.\n  Under the trade actions which have been filed by the United \nSteelworkers and by quite a number of companies, filed on September 30, \nit is possible under a complicated timetable to grant relief effective \nas of November 20 where duties would be imposed to try to stop this \nflooding and this dumping in U.S. markets.\n  In the interim, the President could act, and in the interim, the \nCongress ought to consider ways to amend our trade laws so that we are \nnot at a disadvantage in dealing with this very serious problem to our \nsteel industry, which is so important for national defense and domestic \npurposes, and so important for the steelworkers themselves where the \nnumber of steelworkers has declined from some 500,000 to 163,000 at the \npresent time.\n  It is an urgent matter. The Congress ought to consider it. The \nadministration ought to act on it. For these reasons, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting the adoption of legislation to \nbring fairness to our trade laws.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwhich will help the President deal with the flood of dirt-cheap steel \nimports from our trading partners. The Section 201 reform bill I am \nproposing with my colleague and Senate steel caucus co-chair, Senator \nSpecter, will strengthen the President's ability to help domestic \nindustries receive the relief they need and deserve when imports are a \ncause of serious injury.\n  Import relief is what the U.S. steel industry desperately needs right \nnow. West Virginia steel makers deserve help now, before this crisis \nworsens, as I fear it will. All U.S. steel manufacturers deserve that \nassistance. That's why I am introducing this legislation before \nCongress recesses. I intend to push to improve our ability to remedy \nharm against domestic industries and at the same time remain consistent \nwith rules we expect our world trading partners to live by. We can be \ntough and fair on trade at the same time and the bill I am introducing \ntoday proves it.\n  In my state of West Virginia, our two largest steel manufacturers, \nWeirton Steel and Wheeling Pittsburgh Steel have both already begun to \nsuffer the effects of the steel import crisis. Weirton has laid off 200 \nworkers and reports that their fourth quarter earnings and lack of \npending orders could force the companies to consider additional lay \noffs in the near future. Wheeling Pittsburgh is also worried about the \naffect of the crisis on their bottomline. Laying off workers is never \neasy, but this crisis is forcing such hard decisions. West Virginia \nsteel makers are producing world-class products as efficiently as any \nforeign competitors, but when foreign competitors are blatantly dumping \ntheir product at prices which are sometimes actually below the cost of \nproduction, it cuts the legs out from under American companies--but \nsuch unfair practices are absolutely unacceptable. U.S. industry, the \nU.S. steel industry and other industries, deserve just remedies when \ncompetitors unfairly dump their product on the U.S. market. We want to \ngive the President the policy tools he needs to deal with unfair import \ncompetition.\n  Import data tells the story of a worsening steel crisis--the first \ntwo quarters of 1998 have shown a 27% increase in imports of hot-rolled \nsteel. Japanese imports increased by an astounding 114% in that same \ntime frame. Steel imports from South Korea increased 90%. There is no \nend in sight. Russia and Brazil are nations who are other prime \noffenders.\n  The tragedy of this crisis is that the U.S. steel industry has spent \nover a decade reinventing itself, adjusting and modernizing, in order \nto become a top-notch competitor as we approach the 21st century. This \nindustry is a true success story--productivity has shot up and we can \nbeat any producer in the world on price and quality when provided with \na level playing field. For decades, I have worked with leaders in the \nsteel industry at Weirton Steel, Wheeling-Pittsburgh, Wheeling-Nisshin, \nand others. I have watched and encouraged these steelmakers and unions \nworking together to make the tough, necessary decision to modernize.\n  Unfortunately, just as United States steel manufacturers are \nrealizing the gains of such investments, they are\n\n[[Page S11974]]\n\nfacing a flood of imported steel being sold at rock bottom prices--\nagain, below the cost of production in some instances. We cannot \ncompete against that kind of unfair competition. The legislation \nSenator Specter and I are introducing today will give the President an \nimproved tool to ensure that when there is serious injury as a result \nof imports, the U.S. can respond.\n  Specifically, our legislation will reform Section 201 which permits \nthe President to grant domestic industries import relief in \ncircumstances where imports are the substantial cause of serious \ninjury.\n  Under current law, domestic industries must show that increased \nimports are the ``substantial cause'' of serious injury--which means a \ncause that is important and not less than any other cause. This imposes \nan unfair, higher burden of proof on domestic industries than is \nrequired to prove injury under World Trade Organization standards. The \nSafeguards Code of the World Trade Organization was established to make \nsure that fair trade did not mean countries had to put up with unfair \npractices. The WTO standard requires only that there be a causal link \nbetween increased imports and serious injury. I believe that U.S. law \nshould not impose a tougher standard for American companies of harm \nthan the WTO uses for the international community. Applying the WTO \nstandard is responsible and reasonable. In this bill, we propose to \nestablish the same standard for the U.S. as is used by the WTO. Free \ntrade must mean fair trade.\n  In addition, in this bill we also intend to conform U.S. law to the \nstandard in the WTO Safeguards Code when considering the overall test \nfor judging when there has been serious harm to a domestic industry. We \nclarify that the International Trade Commission (ITC) should review the \noverall condition of the domestic industry in determining the degree of \nthat injury by making it clear that it is the effect of the imports on \nthe overall state of the industry that counts, not solely the effect on \nany one of the particular criteria used in the evaluation.\n  It is our sincere hope that Congress will act on this legislation and \nsend the message that the United States will fight for the right of its \nindustries to complete on a level playing field in world trade. If \nimports flood our markets, we will act to protect American industries \nagainst the consequences.\n  I am someone who adamantly believes the promotion of free trade is \nessential to our country's continued economic growth. If we are to \ncontinue to expand the trade base of our economy we need U.S. industry \nto know that we will keep it fair. American industry and American \nworkers can deal with fair trade, but they shouldn't be asked to sit \nstill for unfair trade practices that hurt workers and their families, \nwhile robbing the profit-margins of U.S. companies.\n  I intend to work in Congress, with my colleagues on the Finance \nCommittee and those in the Administration responsible for trade policy \nto give the President better, more effective tools to ensure that our \ncountry can insist trade be free and fair. Our steel industry, indeed \nall U.S. industries, deserve no less. I will carefully monitor the \nsteel import crisis and consider other appropriate actions as we see \nhow this situation develops.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 2581. A bill to authorize appropriations for the motor vehicle \nsafety and information programs of the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration for fiscal years 1999-2001; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n    National Highway Traffic Safety Administration Authorization Act\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, my purpose today is to introduce \nlegislation that would increase the authorization level of the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration. The recently passed TEA-21 \nlegislation authorized NHTSA at its requested level, approximately \n$87.4 million. The Office of Management and Budget recently asked that \nNHTSA receive $99.9 million in the budget request.\n  Although the Department of Transportation had requested $87.4 \nmillion, we are now informed by Secretary Slater that this \nauthorization level will not permit the funding of ``key safety \ninitiatives.''\n  I know that no one in this body wants a situation where highway \nsafety is degraded in any way. I also know that there is no opportunity \nthat this legislation can be passed yet this Congress. This is an issue \nthat we will address in the next Congress. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to address this important issue of highway safety in \na manner that provides an appropriate funding level to meet safety \nneeds while also meeting our budget obligations and the consensus of \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself and Mr. Mack):\n  S. 2582. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for a prospective payment system for services furnished by \npsychiatric hospitals under the Medicare Program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n  Medicare Psychiatric Hospital Prospective Payment System Act of 1998\n\n Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today my colleague Connie Mack and \nI are introducing legislation that would improve Medicare inpatient \npsychiatric care by reforming how Medicare pays for services provided \nin free-standing psychiatric hospitals and distinct-part psychiatric \nunits of general hospitals. The Medicare Psychiatric Hospital \nProspective Payment System Act of 1998 would establish over time a \nprospective payment system (PPS) for these providers. Currently \npsychiatric hospitals and units are exempt from PPS. Their costs are \nreimbursed under provisions in the 1982 Tax Equity and Fiscal \nResponsibility Act, or TEFRA.\n  The Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 made significant changes to the \nTEFRA payment system by reducing incentive payments and imposing a \nlimit on what Medicare will pay for services provided in psychiatric \nfacilities, regardless of a facility's costs. The result is that many \nof these providers will be hit hard by deep and sudden cuts, with no \ntransition period to adjust to the changes. I believe that moving \npsychiatric hospitals to a prospective payment system will ensure that \nthese changes do not reduce patient access to psychiatric care.\n  Our legislation proposes to transition psychiatric inpatient \nhospitals to a prospective payment system--a system that will be more \nefficient, allow for better planning, and lead to improved patient \ncare. This legislation also addresses the short-term viability of many \nof these facilities to enable patients to continue receiving the \nspecialized care these providers offer. For that reason, our \nlegislation includes immediate financial relief to those psychiatric \nfacilities hardest hit by the BBA: twenty-five percent of facilities in \nthe first year, about thirteen percent in year two, and approximately \nten percent in year three. The relief will then be paid back when a \nprospective payment is implemented in year four to ensure that this \nbill is budget neutral by the end of year five. Specifically, the \nBreaux-Mack bill would limit an individual facility's payment \nreductions to no more than five percent in the first year, seven and \none-half percent in the second year, and ten percent in year three. \nAfter the third year, a PPS based on per diems would be phased in. In \nthe first two years of the new PPS, the per-diem rates would be \nadjusted downward to pay back the savings lost to the Medicare program \nas a result of the ``hold harmless'' provisions of the bill. \nConsequently, our bill is budget-neutral over five years, yet it \nprovides some measure of relief to those Medicare providers most \nseverely affected by the BBA and guarantees that beneficiaries will not \nlose vital services. But perhaps the most important feature of our bill \nis that it moves the last of the TEFRA providers--psychiatric \nfacilities--out of a cost-based payment system and into a\n\n[[Page S11975]]\n\nsystem where they will be paid prospectively, like most other Medicare \nproviders.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this important piece \nof legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2582\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, I am pleased to join my \ncolleague John Breaux in sponsoring the Medicare Psychiatric Hospital \nProspective Payment System Act of 1998. This legislation maintains the \nintegrity and availability of Medicare inpatient psychiatric care by \nchanging how Medicare currently pays for services provided to \nbeneficiaries in free standing psychiatric hospitals and distinct-part \npsychiatric units of general hospitals. This bill eases the transition \nof psychiatric facilities to a prospective payment system (PPS) while \nphasing in substantial cuts in payments to these providers as required \nby the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  Currently, psychiatric hospitals and units are exempt from PPS. This \nbill is budget neutral over five years, and ensures that until PPS is \nestablished, inpatient psychiatric care will not be compromised or \ndisrupted because of major budget reductions. Finally, this legislation \nprevents the type of dislocations we now face in the Home Health Care \nindustry.\n  The purpose of this bill is to give psychiatric facilities a period \nof adjustment to the mandates of BBA while not jeopardizing patient \ncare. It provides for a transition period that will help providers \nadjust to a prospective payment system that will be installed in three \nyears. At the end of this time period psychiatric facilities will be \npaid on a prospective payment basis like other hospital providers in \nthe Medicare program. Psychiatric hospital managers understand that the \nfinancial limitations imposed by BBA on their facilities must be met, \nand this bill smooths out the requirements for accomplishing this in \nsuch a way that the integrity of patient care is maintained. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in co-sponsoring this important piece of \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 2583. A bill to provide disadvantaged children with access to \ndental services; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n Mr. Bingaman. Mr. President today I introduce with my friend \nand colleague, Senator Thad Cochran, the Childrens Dental Health \nImprovement Act of 1998. The bill is designed to increase access to \ndental services for our disadvantaged children.\n  Medicaid's Early and Periodic Screening Diagnosis and Treatment or \n``EPSDT'' program requires states to not only pay for a comprehensive \nset of child health services, including dental services, but to assure \ndelivery of those services. Unfortunately, low income children do not \nget the dental service they need. Despite the design of the Medicaid \nprogram to reach children and ensure access to routine dental care, the \nInspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services \nreported in 1996 that only 18 percent of children eligible for Medicaid \nreceived even a single preventive dental service. The same report shows \nthat no state provides preventive services to more than 50% of eligible \nchildren. Dentist participation is too low to assure access. We are \nfalling short of our obligation to these children.\n  In the past few months, I have had the opportunity to speak to many \nof New Mexico's rural health providers and have learned that for New \nMexico, the problem is of crisis proportions. Less than 1% of New \nMexico's Medicaid dollars are used for children's oral health care \nneeds. My state alone projects a shortage of 157 dentists and 229 \ndental hygienists. Children in New Mexico and elsewhere are showing up \nin emergency rooms for treatment of tooth abscesses instead of getting \ntheir cavities filled early on or having dental decay prevented in the \nfirst place.\n  Some will say: ``Why care about a few cavities in kids?'' In reality, \nthis is a complex children's health issue. Chronically poor oral health \nis associated with growth and development problems in toddlers and \ncompromises children's nutritional status. These children suffer from \npain and cannot play or learn. Their personal suffering is real. In \nreality, untreated dental problems get progressively worse and \nultimately require more expensive interventions. Many of these children \ncome to emergency rooms and ultimately must be treated in the operating \nroom.\n  Tooth decay remains the single most common chronic disease of \nchildhood and according to the Children's Dental Health Project, it \naffects more than half of all children by second grade. Tooth decay in \nchildren six year olds is 5 to 8 more common than asthma which is often \ncited as the most common chronic disease of childhood.\n  National data confirm that pediatric oral health in the U.S. is \nbacksliding. Healthy People 2000 goals for dental needs of children \nwill not be met. As this chart shows:\n  52% of our 6 to 8 year olds have dental caries, or cavities compared \nto 54% in 1986. Our goal was to decrease this to 35% by the year 2000; \nwe have only succeeded in a 2% change in this area.\n  Additionally, we have slid backwards in some areas. The Healthy \nPeople 2000 oral health indicators show an increase in the percentage \nof children with untreated cavities. In 1986, 28% of our 6 to 8 year \nolds had untreated cavities compared to now where we find 31% of these \nchildren have untreated cavities.\n  Tooth decay is increasingly a disease of low and modest income \nchildren. A substantial portion of decay in young children goes \nuntreated. In fact, forty seven percent of decay in children aged 2 \nthrough 9 is untreated.\n  The Children's Dental Health Improvement Act is designed to attack \nthe problem from many fronts. First, our bill addresses the issue of \nprovider shortage by expanding opportunities for training pediatric \ndental health care providers. Next, we will work toward increasing the \nactual care provided under the Medicaid program. Additionally, we have \nlooked at the need for pediatric dental research to facilitate better \napproaches for care. Finally, we have put into place greater measures \nfor surveillance of the problem and have looked at the need to increase \naccountability in the area of actual treatment once a problem is \nidentified.\n  I am committed to solving the problem of adequate access to dental \ncare for our children and view this as a public health issue that has \ngone unnoticed for too long. I will welcome my colleagues to work with \nme to ensure that these children have healthy smiles vs. chronic pain \nfrom untreated problems.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the \nChildren's Dental Health Improvement Act of 1998 printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11977]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2583\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to eliminate a \nthreshold requirement relating to unreimbursable expenses for \ncompensation under the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n     Amendment to the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce, with my friend \nand colleague from South Dakota, Tim Johnson, legislation to make \nseveral common-sense changes to the National Vaccine Injury \nCompensation Program. This bill removes an unintended and unjustified \nbarrier blocking certain children from qualifying for the compensation \nprogram. It also makes the necessary changes to allow new drugs to be \nincorporated into the program, including the newly-approved rotavirus \nvaccine.\n  The Vaccine Act dates back to 1986, when Congress determined that a \nno-fault alternative to the tort system would best accommodate the dual \nobjectives of ensuring proper compensation to victims of vaccine \ninjuries and fostering continued development and broad-scale \navailability of lifesaving vaccines.\n  Through the Vaccine Act, children seriously injured by a childhood \nvaccine can receive compensation for medical care, custodial or \nresidential care, lifetime lost earnings, pain and suffering, and \nemotional distress--benefits comparable to those awarded through the \njudicial tort system.\n  Tragically, some children have been unfairly denied the right to \npetition for benefits under the program because they did not incur \n$1,000 or more in out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n  At first glance, the eligibility requirement of at least $1,000 in \nout-of-pocket medical expenses may seem like a reasonable way of \ndeterring individuals from petitioning for benefits if they lack a \nmaterial claim to compensation. In reality, however, the absence of \nout-of-pocket health care expenses does not mean a child has not been \nseriously injured, nor does it suggest they have access to other \nsources for recoupment of the losses their injury has exacted.\n  Many children, including the children of military personnel, Native \nAmerican children covered by the Indian Health Service, children with \nMedicaid coverage, and children covered under employer-sponsored health \nplans with minimal cost-sharing requirements, do not have high out-of-\npocket health care costs.\n  While health insurance may remove the burden of high medical bills, \nit does not replace lost income or cover custodial and residential \ncare. It cannot compensate for the toll these injuries have taken and \nwill take on the lives of these children. Health care costs are just \none component of the compensation for which a seriously injured child \nis eligible.\n  I know of a Native American child in my own state who was profoundly \ninjured after receiving a diptheria-pertussis-tetanus vaccination. \nWithin hours of receiving the shot, this five-month-old child had a \nseizure and suffered severe brain damage because of the defective \npertussis component of the shot.\n  The doctors tell us that his disabilities will, throughout his \nlifetime, preclude this little boy from having a normal life. He will \nnever live or work independently. But, because he receives health care \nfrom the Indian Health Service (IHS), he is not eligible for any \nbenefits under the vaccine compensation program. Not only is this child \nbarred from compensation for lost income and emotional trauma, he is \ndenied financial support for his injury-related assisted living needs.\n  Through legislation intended to foster continued improvements in \npublic health, the federal government has obstructed this child's right \nto sue vaccine manufacturers. But the program's gate-keeping mechanism \nis off the mark. What we are saying--however unintentionally--to this \nparticular child and others like him is: ``Fend for yourself.'' To deny \nthis child the benefits available to other injured children is \nindefensible.\n  The Vaccine Act contains other safeguards to prevent unjustified \nrequests for compensation. For example, no benefits claim is accepted \nwithout a thorough review and significant medical proof of severe \ninjury directly related to a childhood vaccination. The $1,000 \nthreshold is unnecessary.\n  Senator Johnson and I certainly are not alone in calling for the \nrepeal of the $1,000 threshold. In fact, we are in very good company. \nThe Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines voted unanimously to \nrecommend elimination of the $1,000 threshold.\n  I hope this Congress will seize the opportunity to reconcile the \nintended and actual standards of fairness by which the National Vaccine \nCompensation Program fulfills its role in the public health system. In \nso doing, we will make a tremendous difference in the lives of children \nin desperate need of our support.\n  There is also a disconnect between the Act's intended consequences \nand its actual effect in regard to enrollment of new vaccines. Several \nvaccines that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration \nand have met the standards established in the Vaccine Act are still not \nfully integrated into the program.\n  There are currently several vaccines Congress has approved for \ntaxation and inclusion in the Vaccine Compensation Program that, \nbecause of a technical error in the legislation, were not authorized as \ncompensable. This bill will fully integrate those vaccines into the \nprogram, and it will ensure that all new vaccines will be automatically \ncompensable once the tax is levied.\n  In addition, it initiates the 75 cents-per-vaccination tax on the \nrotavirus vaccine, which will ensure compensation for recipients of \nthat vaccine. The rotavirus vaccine was approved by the FDA in August \nof this year to protect against rotavirus gastroenteritis, which causes \nabout 125 deaths and 50,000 hospitalizations per year among infants in \nthe United States. Initiation of the excise tax will help protect the 4 \nmillion children who are expected to receive the vaccine annually.\n  The changes proposed in this bill are not controversial. They are \ncommon-sense, and they are overdue. When Congress established the \nVaccine Compensation Program, its intent was to protect the rights of \nvictims without jeopardizing an invaluable weapon against childhood \nillnesses. The underpinning of this program is fairness, a standard \nthat cannot be met until Congress makes these important changes.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11981]]\n\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2585\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend parts A and D of title IV of the Social \nSecurity Act to require States to pass through directly to a family \nreceiving assistance under the temporary assistance to needy families \nprogram all child support collected by the State and to disregard any \nchild support that the family receives in determining the family's \nlevel of assistance under that program; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            Children First Child Support Reform Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to put \nAmerica's children first by putting more resources into the hands of \nfamilies and encouraging more parents to live up to their child support \nobligations. My legislation, the Children First Child Support Reform \nAct, would direct that all child support collected through the Federal-\nState Child Support Enforcement Program be passed through, or paid, \ndirectly to the children and families to whom it is owed and \ndisregarded in the calculation of public assistance benefits. My \nlegislation will assure non-custodial parents that the child support \nthey pay will actually contribute to the well-being of their child, \nrather than the government, and will also reduce administrative burdens \non the state.\n  As my colleagues know, since its inception in 1975, our Federal-State \nChild Support Enforcement Program has been tasked with collecting child \nsupport for families receiving public assistance and other families \nthat request help in enforcing child support. Towards this end, the \nprogram works to establish paternity and legally-binding support \norders, while collecting and disbursing funds on behalf of families so \nthat children receive the support they need to grow up in healthy, \nnurturing surroundings.\n  But on one crucial point, the current program does not truly work on \nbehalf of families and, perhaps more importantly, may actually work \nagainst families by discouraging non-custodial parents from meeting \ntheir child support obligations.\n  If the family was never on public assistance, the support is \ncollected by the Child Support Enforcement Program and sent directly to \nthe family. However, under current law, most child support collected on \nbehalf of families receiving public assistance is retained by the state \nand Federal governments as reimbursement for welfare expenditures. In \naddition to this cost recoupment function, collections made on behalf \nof welfare families are used to fund the child support program in many \nstates.\n  Thus, under current law, we have a system where the vast majority of \nchildren on public assistance never actually receive the child support \nthat is paid on their behalf. The government keeps the money. The \nresearch shows that many non-custodial parents who pay support do not \nbelieve that their payment actually benefits their children. They \nrealize and resent that they are paying the government. Worse yet, some \nnon-custodial parents may decide not to pay support because it does not \ngo to their children. Some custodial parents also are skeptical about \nworking with the child support agency to secure payments since the \nfunds are generally not forwarded to them.\n  Mr. President, we know that an estimated 800,000 families would not \nneed public assistance if they could count on the child support owed to \nthem. In addition, we know that 23 million children are owed more than \n$40 billion in outstanding support. Clearly, the vital importance of \nchild support in keeping families off of assistance remains as true \ntoday as when the program began. In a world with TANF time limits, it \nhas never been more important. And with these figures in mind, it is \nnot unthinkable that some policymakers may have or might still consider \nthis program as a means of recovering welfare expenditures.\n  But I am convinced that that thinking must change, if not cast off \nentirely, because, simply put, times have changed. The welfare reform \nlaw of 1996, which I supported, paved the way for time limits and work \nrequirements that provide clear and compelling incentives for families \nto enter the workforce and find a way to stay there. Open ended, \nunconditional public support is no longer a reality, and our goal and \nresponsibility as policymakers, now more than ever before, is to give \nfamilies the tools and resources they need to prepare for and \nultimately survive the day when they are without public assistance.\n  We fundamentally changed welfare, now we must fundamentally reexamine \nthe central role of child support in helping families as they struggle \nto become and remain self-sufficient. And I say we go down the road of \nputting children first, a path on which we have already made some \nprogress. Under the welfare reform law, states will eventually be \nrequired to distribute state-collected child support arrears owed to \nthe family before paying off arrears owed to the state and Federal \ngovernments for welfare expenditures. In addition, states were given \nthe option of continuing to passthrough directly the first $50 of child \nsupport to the family.\n  One state, my state of Wisconsin, has opted to pass through all child \nsupport collected on behalf of participating families to those \nfamilies. As you know, Wisconsin has been a leader and national model \nin the area of welfare reform. Under Wisconsin's welfare program, child \nsupport counts as income in determining financial eligibility for \nwelfare assistance, but once eligibility is established, the child \nsupport income is disregarded in calculating program benefits. In other \nwords, families are allowed to keep their own money. Non-custodial \nparents can be assured that their contribution counts and that their \nchild support payments go to their children. And both parents are\n\n[[Page S11982]]\n\npresented with a realistic picture of what that support means in the \nlife of their child. I believe we, as a nation, should follow \nWisconsin's example.\n  The full passthrough and disregard approach also has significant \nbenefits on the administrative side. The current distribution \nrequirements place significant computer, accounting and paperwork \nburdens on the states. They are also costly. Data from the Federal \nOffice of Child Support demonstrates that nearly 20 percent of program \nexpenditures are spent simply processing payments. States are required \nto maintain a complicated set of accounts to determine whether support \ncollected should be paid to the family or kept by the government. These \ncomplex accounting rules depend on whether the family ever received \npublic assistance, the date a family begins and ends assistance, \nwhether the non-custodial parent is current on payments or owes \narrears, the method of collection and other factors.\n  We know that we have already asked much of the states in the realm of \nautomation, systems integration and welfare law child support \nenforcement adjustments. We hope and believe these improvements will \nlead to better collection rates. Now we have a chance to simplify and \nimprove distribution of support. What could be simpler than a \ndistribution system in which all child support collected would be \ndelivered to the children to whom it is owed? A distribution system in \nwhich child support agencies would distribute current support and \narrears to both welfare and non-welfare families in exactly the same \nway?\n  Mr. President, I am raising these points and introducing this \nlegislation today, in the final week of the 105th Congress, as a \nmarker, as a starting point to this discussion. Child support financing \nmust be addressed. First, our current distribution scheme is out of \nstep with the philosophy of current welfare policy. We must move the \nchild support program from cost-recovery to service delivery for all \nfamilies. Second, the current financing scheme is no longer workable. \nTANF caseloads are decreasing dramatically, even as overall child \nsupport caseloads are increasing. Therefore, while the system needs \nadditional resources, the portion of the caseload that produces those \nresources is decreasing. We must put the child support program on a \nsound financial footing that confirms a strong Federal and state \ncommitment to the program.\n  So, I believe it is time to begin a discussion on the issue of child \nsupport financing and the vital role of the child support program in \nhelping families help themselves. The Administration has already begun \nto meet with policymakers, state administrators, and children's \nadvocates to discuss the future of child support financing. I want to \nbegin today, and ultimately end the debate, by pushing for a financing \nsystem that puts more resources into the hands of children, that lets \nour nation's families keep more of their own money.\n  But let me strongly affirm that adopting a children first policy is \nonly one of my goals. At this time, my proposal addresses only one half \nof the financing issue. Yes, we should put children first, but let me \nstress that I have every intention of continuing to refine this \nproposal so that it addresses the second point as well--finding \nalternative financing mechanisms so that states can maintain and \nstrengthen their child support programs. Without adequate funding, \nstate child support programs cannot deliver effective child support \nservices to the families that so desperately need them. I want to \ncontinue working with my colleagues, Wisconsin and the other states, \nadvocates and families to sort out the rest of the financing question. \nBy advocating a full passthrough and disregard approach, I am \nabsolutely not advocating a disinvestment in our child support system \nby either the Federal government or the states. Our commitment to this \nprogram must remain strong and steadfast.\n  But it is time for us to create a system that truly serves families \nby giving them the tools to survive in a world without public support. \nIt is time for a child support financing system that truly puts \nfamilies, and not the government, first.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2586\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to protect the public, especially seniors, against \ntelemarketing fraud and telemarketing fraud over the Internet and to \nauthorize an educational campaign to improve senior citizens' ability \nto protect themselves against telemarketing fraud over the Internet; to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n             telemarketing fraud and seniors protection act\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, online consumer purchases are poised to \nexplode to more than $300 billion early in the next Century. But the \ngoldrush in cyberbuying is likely to carry along with it a boom in \ncyberfraud. Congress can help head-off this cybercrime by extending our \ncurrent telemarketing laws to encompass fraud on the Net.\n  In response to the staggering $40 billion consumers lose in telephone \nfraud each year, Congress earlier this summer passed the 1998 \nTelemarketing Fraud Prevention Act. I strongly supported that effort. \nThe new law builds upon the four federal laws enacted since the early \n1990s that deal directly with telemarketing fraud. The 1998 law \nstiffens penalties for telemarketing fraud by toughening the sentencing \nguidelines--especially for crimes against the elderly, requires \ncriminal forfeiture to ensure the booty of telemarketing crime is not \nused to commit further fraud, mandates victim restitution to ensure \nvictims are the first ones compensated, adds conspiracy language to the \nlist of telemarketing fraud penalties so that prosecutors can find the \nmasterminds behind the boiler rooms, and will help law enforcement zero \nin on quick-strike fraud operations by giving them the authority to \nmove more quickly against suspected fraud.\n  The 1998 law is a good step forward but it's not enough to deal with \ntoday's digital economy. As more Americans go online, cyberscams are \nbound to proliferate. The Congressional crackdown on telemarketing \nfraud will only encourage cyberscammers to migrate to the Net unless \nthe law gets there first. That is the purpose of the legislation I am \nintroducing today.\n  The Telemarketing Fraud and Seniors Protection Act simply extends \ncurrent law against telemarketing fraud to include the same crimes \ncommitted over the Internet. The approach expands the existing law \napplicable to mail, telephone, wire, and television fraud to fraud over \nthe Internet, and its enforcement would follow the same division of \nlabor there is today between the Federal Trade Commission and the \nDepartment of Justice. The bill would apply the same tough penalties \nthat Congress enacted earlier this year to cyberscams. The growth of \nInternet telephony makes it more attractive for cyberscammers to set up \nshop offshore, beyond the reach of U.S. law. My bill would address this \nproblem by allowing law enforcement to freeze the assets and deny entry \nto the United States of those convicted of cyberfraud.\n  The bill takes special aim against those attempt to defraud one of \nour most vulnerable groups--our senior citizens. Seniors are the target \nfor more than 50 percent of telemarketing fraud. Although telemarketers \nconvicted of fraud face stiff penalties--a minimum of 5-10 years in \njail and restitution payments to their victims, we also need to better \neducate and inform senior citizens on how to avoid becoming victims of \ntelemarketing fraud in the first place, and how to assist law \nenforcement in catching the perpetrators.\n  The legislation would also authorize the Administration on Aging, \nthrough its network of area agencies of aging, to conduct an outreach \nprogram to senior citizens on telemarketing fraud. Seniors would be \nadvised against providing their credit card number, bank account or \nother personal information unless they had initiated the call \nunsolicited. They would also be informed of their consumer protection \nrights and any toll-free numbers and other resources to report \nsuspected illegal telemarketing.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Trade Commission is off to a good start \nagainst cyberscammers. Some of the operations the FTC has targeted are \nnot companies at all, but merely websites that promise consumers \neverything from huge new consulting contracts to the elimination of bad \ncredit reports. They may use scare tactics to frighten consumers into \nsending important personal financial information and hundreds of \ndollars for services the consumer will never see, or attempt to lure \nconsumers with the promise of help them cash in on the Internet \nexplosion. The FTC also has a strong operation going against junk e-\nmailers. My legislation will complement and strengthen the FTC's effort \nto target telemarketing fraud over the Internet and especially when \nsuch fraud is aimed at seniors.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this important legislation, and \nask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n             TITLE I--TELEMARKETING FRAUD OVER THE INTERNET\n\n     SECTION 101.

A bill to provide for the review and classification of \nphysician assistant positions in the Federal Government, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               office of personnel management legislation\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Nickles and Senator Inouye to introduce legislation that \ndirects the Office of Personnel and Management (OPM) to develop a \nclassification standard appropriate to the occupation of physician \nassistant.\n  Physician assistants are a part of a growing field of health care \nprofessionals that make quality health care available and affordable in \nunderserved areas throughout our country. Because the physician \nassistant profession was very young when OPM first developed employment \ncriteria in 1970, the agency adapted the nursing classification system \nfor physician assistants. Today, this is no longer appropriate. \nPhysician assistants have different education and training requirements \nthan nurses and they are licensed and evaluated according to differnt \ncriteria.\n  The inaccurate classification of physician assistant has led to \nrecruitment and retention problems of physician assistants in Federal \nagencies, usually caused by low starting salaries and low salary caps. \nBecause it is recognized that physician assistants provide cost-\neffective health care, this is an important problem to resolve.\n  This legislation mandates that OPM review this classification in \nconsultation with physician assistants and the organizations that \nrepresent physician assistants. The bill specifically states that OPM \nshould consider the educational and practice qualifications of the \nposition as well as the treatment of physician assistants in the \nprivate sector in this review.\n  Mr. President, I believe that this legislation will make an important \ncorrection that will help federal agencies make better use of these \nproviders of cost-effective, high quality health care.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOSWKI:\n  S. 2589. A bill to provide for the collection and interpretation of \nstate of the art, non-intrusive 3-dimensional seismic data on certain \nfederal lands in Alasks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n         legislation authorizing 3-d seismic testing in alaska\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \nensure that when Congress looks at ways to reduce the United States' \ndependence on foreign oil, it does so with the best science available.\n  The legislation I introduce today would require the Secretary of the \nInterior to conduct 3-dimensional (3-D) seismic testing on the Arctic \nCoastal Plain of Alaska.\n  This testing leaves no footprint. In fact, just last year the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service allowed such testing to be done in the Kenai \nNational Wildlife Refuge, declaring such testing would have no \nsignificant impact.\n  It would have even less impact on the frozen tundra in ANWR.\n  It is also a possibility that the oil industry would be willing to \nshare in the cost of such testing. Let's at least find out what kind of \nresource we are talking about.\n  Mr. President, I think it is important that we look at some of the \nhistory of his area and the testing that has occurred there.\n  In May of this year, the U.S. Geological Survey estimated that a mean \nof 7.7 billion barrels of producible oil may reside in the 1002 Area of \nthe Arctic Oil Reserve.\n  This estimate was in stark contrast to a declaration by Secretary \nBabbitt in 1995 when he pronounced the Arctic Oil Reserve's oil \npossibilities to be about 898 million barrels.\n  In the interest of looking at this amazing leap in the estimate of \nthe AOR's producible oil, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee last week, and invited the U.S. Geological \nSurvey to participate.\n  Three things rang clear at that hearing:\n  First, while these estimates were the highest ever and proved the \n1002 area of the AOR has the greatest potential of securing our \nNation's energy needs--they were extremely conservative.\n  For instance, these estimates were based on a minimum economic field \nsize of 512 million barrels. When in practice the minimum economic \nfield size in Alaska is much lower than that. Consider the following \nexamples of current economic fields in Alaska:\n  Northstar: 145 mm/bb (With a sub-sea pipeline) is deemed economic. \nBadami: 120 mm/bb is deemed economic. Liberty: 120 mm/bb is deemed \neconomic. Sourdough: 100+ mm/bb (adjacent to Aor) is deemed economic.\n  The second fact that rang clear is while these new estimates show a \nclearer picture of the Western portion of the AOR, much remains unclear \nabout the oil and gas potential of the massive structures present in \nthe Eastern portion.\n  The USGS has slightly downgraded the potential of the Eastern portion \nbecause they do not have similar data that was available to them on the \nWestern portion.\n  Third, technology has increased so dramatically that we can now \nextract greater amounts of oil from wells with far less impact on the \nenvironment at a cost of 30 percent less than 10 years ago.\n  Consider this, Mr. President: In June of 1994, Amerada Hess concluded \nthe Northstar field in Alaska was uneconomic because development would \nexceed $1.2 billion and eventually sold the field to BP.\n  Today, BP expects to begin production of that field's 145 million \nbarrels of reserves in 2000. Estimated development costs: $350 \nmillion--a 70 percent reduction from just 4 years ago!\n  Mr. President, all these factors point toward the logical conclusion \nthat underlying the 1.5 million-acre oil reserve in Alaska lies greater \nreserves than recently estimated, and we need to confirm them with \nbetter science.\n  Dr. Thomas J. Casadevall, acting director of the USGS, was very clear \nin his explanation that if the newer three dimensional (3-D) seismic \ndata were available from the Arctic Oil Reserve, their high May \nestimates of producible oil could increase significantly.\n  Casadevall explained that their new estimates, while supported by \nsound science and peer review, were still based on 2-D seismic tests \ndone more than a decade ago.\n  Kenneth A. Boyd, director, Division of Oil and Gas of the Alaska \nDepartment of Natural Resources, likened the advance of the new testing \nto the difference between an x-ray and a CAT-scan.\n  He said the available information from 2-D seismic as opposed to 3-D \nseismic is that the former produces a line of data while the latter \nproduces a cube of data. The cube can be turned\n\n[[Page S11985]]\n\nand examined from all sides and the geologic information proves \ninvaluable for exploration.\n  This data has revolutionized exploration and development of the North \nSlope of Alaska. Modern 3-D data provides enhanced and incredibly \naccurate imaging of potential subsurface reservoirs.\n  This in turn reduces exploration and development risk, reduces the \nnumber of drilled wells, and in turn reduces both overall costs and \nenvironmental impacts.\n  Of course there is little pressure to allow testing or exploration of \nthe Coastal Plain with gas prices at a 30-year low. However, the \nDepartment of Energy's Information Administration predicts, in 10 \nyears, America will be at least 64 percent dependent on foreign oil. It \nwould take that same 10-year period to develop any oil production in \nAOR.\n  It seems prudent to plan ahead to protect our future energy security.\n  If the Nation were to be crunched in an energy crisis--like the Gulf \nwar that would require the speedup of development; that development \ncould impact the environment negatively because it would not have the \nbenefit of thoughtful planning.\n  I believe it is as criminal as stealing gold to refuse to acknowledge \nthe potential for producible oil in the Coastal Plain of the AOR. If we \ndon't know what the resource is, how can we protect it or make an \ninformed decision about the use of the area?\n  And how can those in this administration or the environmental \ncommunity argue it is a bad idea to seek a greater understanding of \nthese public lands? Particularly, when the Congress set aside the area \nunder a special designation for future Congresses to determine whether \nit contains the quantities of oil that, if produced, would \nsignificantly enhance our national energy security.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will also better enable the Secretary \nof the Interior to protect the Federal petroleum resources underlying \nthe Coastal Plain. However, without knowing what those Federal \nresources are however, there is no way to protect them.\n  Just last year a major oil discovery was announced on State lands \nimmediately adjacent to the federal border. Production from this well \ncould drain portions of the federal reserve without adequate \ncompensation to the federal treasury.\n  The Secretary has an obligation to protect the Federal resource \nunderlying ANWR and this legislation will provide him the tools to do \nso.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to make it perfectly clear that this \nbill is being pushed by those of us in Congress who believe that if you \nare to make a decision about the best use of our public lands that you \nshould do so with the benefit of the best available science.\n  It is not, as Secretary Babbitt has suggested, an effort being pushed \nby the petroleum industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 2591. A bill to provide certain secondary school students with \neligibility for certain campus-based assistance under title IV of the \nHigher Education Act of 1965; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n                      TECH-PREP OPPORTUNITIES ACT\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today I introduce a piece of \nlegislation that, I believe, takes an important step toward giving more \nindividuals the ability to earn good wages so that they can support \nthemselves and their families. This bill will allow community colleges \nto use their campus-based student aid to assist students who are \nconcurrently enrolled in a high school and in a vocational-technical \nprogram in a community college. This legislation helps us solve a \nnational problem, but it also helps more young people achieve the \nAmerican Dream.\n  We must recognize that a degree from a four-year college or \nuniversity is not the only ticket to a successful, productive life. \nOnly 60% of high school graduates enroll in college, and only 20% end \nup with a four-year degree. Community colleges are playing an \nincreasingly important role in helping the other 80% of our students \nobtain the advanced technical training that is vital to our economy and \nto their futures.\n  Today the Senate also passed the conference report that will \nreauthorize vocational education. I am pleased to have played a role in \nthis process. At my request the conferees have included language that \nwill encourage institutions to investigate opportunities for tech-prep \nsecondary students to enroll concurrently in secondary and \npostsecondary coursework. The bill that I am introducing today builds \nupon this concept in a tangible way.\n  As we address the need for highly skilled workers in Nebraska and \nthroughout the nation, we must change the way that we think about our \neducation system, and especially the way that we think about those \nstudents who are on the verge of graduation. We must make certain that \na high school diploma has real value, that it says to an employer, ``I \nhave the skills and the knowledge to make a valuable contribution to \nyour business.''\n  This legislation allows community colleges to offer a helping hand to \nstudents who are still in high school but have exhausted the \nvocational-technical offerings and are ready and able to enroll in such \nprograms at a community college. Throughout the nation many students \nare already dually enrolled, but either the school district pays the \ntuition or the student must pay it. In Nebraska, more than 100 students \nin Omaha Public Schools are dually enrolled. And more than 50 in \nBellevue Public Schools are dually enrolled. Some students have the \nability to enroll in a vocational-technical program, but they do not \nhave the financial means. By making this change in law, community \ncolleges can assist those students if they choose to do so.\n  With a Federal commitment of $7,400,000 last year, Nebraska provided \nvocational and applied technology education to approximately 70,000 \nsecondary students and 47,800 postsecondary students. This money is a \nwise investment, but we need to do more.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in Congress next year to \nfurther our commitment to preparing our young people to achieve the \nAmerican Dream.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Baucus, and Mr. \n        Conrad):\n  S. 2592. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to permit a State to register a Canadian pesticide for \ndistribution and use within that State; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n\n               canadian cross-border chemical legislation\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I introduce the first in \nwhat will be a number of bills addressing the inequalities in the \navailability and pricing of agricultural chemicals between the United \nStates and Canada. This bill focuses on the differences in prices \nbetween identical or nearly identical chemicals. The need for this bill \nis created by chemical companies who use our chemical labeling laws to \nprotect their pricing and marketing system. By labeling similar \nproducts only for use in different states or countries or only for use \non certain plants, chemical companies are able to extract unreasonable \nprofits from farmers who desperately need their products.\n  A second part of my effort to correct differences between \nagricultural chemicals used in Canada and the United States is a study \nby the General Accounting Office (GAO). I am now finalizing discussions \nwith GAO as to the specific areas to be studied and the scope of the \nstudy. It is my expectation that I will introduce legislation in the \nnext session of Congress to correct the remaining deficiencies.\n  Of particular concern lately has been the significant difference in \nfarm chemical prices between Canada and the United States. Because our \nfarmers are engaged in a difficult trade battle with Canada, \ndifferences in agricultural chemical prices between Canada and the \nUnited States place our farmers at a disadvantage with their Canadian \ncompetition. This bill is drafted to correct\n  As introduced today, the bill sets up a procedure by which states may \napply for, and receive, an Environmental Protection Agency label for \nagricultural chemicals sold in Canada which are identical or \nsubstantially similar to agricultural chemicals used in the United \nStates. Initially, this bill will allow the cross border movement of \nsimilar chemicals. Eventually, it is my expectation that this bill, \nalong with the GAO study, will lead to an equalization of farm chemical \navailability and prices across the border.\n\n[[Page S11986]]\n\n  I request my colleagues' support in this effort to bring fairness to \ncross-border chemical pricing.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM:\n  S. 2593. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na credit against tax for employers who provide child care assistance \nfor dependents of their employees, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n         The Worksite Child Care Development Center Act of 1998\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to aid millions of American families with one of their most \npressing needs--child care. This legislation would make child care more \naccessible to millions of families who find it not only important, but \nnecessary, to work.\n  In the ideal world, most parents, I believe, would prefer to have \ntheir children raised by at least one parent at home. However, for a \nvast majority of families in America, this ideal is not possible. And \nfor the working poor and many in the middle class of our society, this \nideal is a luxury that they cannot afford.\n  The legislation which I am introducing today would not solve the \nchild care needs of American parents. However, it would serve to \nprovide a much needed incentive--a jump start--to promote employer \nprovided child care, particularly among our nation's small businesses.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would offer a tax credit to \nthose employers who undertake the responsibility of assisting their \nemployees with child care expenses. This bill--the Worksite Child Care \nDevelopment Center Act of 1998--would modify that part of the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 which relates to business tax credits. It would do \nso by providing child care tax credits to employers for--\n  A one-time 50 percent tax credit, not to exceed $100,000, \nspecifically for facilities start-up expenses, which includes expansion \nand renovations of an employer-sponsored child care facility;\n  A 50 percent tax credit, not to exceed $25,000 annually, for those \nexpenses related to the operating costs of maintaining a child care \nfacility; and\n  A 50 percent tax credit, not to exceed $50,000 annually, specifically \nfor those employers who provide payments or reimbursements for their \nemployees' child care expenses.\n  One may ask, ``Why is this legislation important to American \nemployers and employees?'' Mr. President, I submit to you that there \nare four compelling reasons for the Congress to pass this legislation.\n  First, child care is a major concern for American families. We should \nbe concerned about child care because it has become one of today's most \npressing social issues. Ask working parents today to identify their top \ndaily concerns, and a large proportion will most certainly identify \nquality, affordable child care as one of them.\n  On June 1st of this year, I hosted a Florida statewide summit on \nchild care, which was attended by over 500 residents of my state who \nshared with me their concerns, and sometimes their frustrations, about \nthis issue. The feedback that I received from my constituents covered a \nmyriad of issues reflecting the high level of concern that parents have \nregarding access, quality, and the level of investment we are making in \nchild care. We had five panel sessions moderated and staffed by 25 of \nFlorida's most distinguished professionals in the field of child \ndevelopment and human services and education. The panels covered a wide \nrange of issues from affordability and access, to quality of care, to \npublic-private partnerships between government and businesses.\n  I am pleased that I was able to hear from my constituents and from \nexperts regarding the extent and nature of the problem. One participant \nsummed it up well, ``The issues addressed in the summit today are \nconcerns that need to continue to be addressed until the needs are met; \nhowever, the needs are going to continue to grow as our preschoolers \nand school-agers go into middle schools.''\n  Mr. President, it's no wonder that there is so much interest in the \nissue of child care. Child care, when it is available, is provided to a \nchild at one of the most important times in that child's life. Indeed, \nrecent research has confirmed what many of us had always believed--that \nquality child care can positively influence cognitive and social \ndevelopment. Current scientific research tells us that the most crucial \nperiod in children's brain development and brain readiness--which \ndetermines so much of the course for the rest of their lives--is that \ntime between birth and the age of three.\n  Second, America's workforce is changing. The work place has changed \ndramatically over the past fifty years. In 1947, just over one-quarter \nof all mothers with children between 6 and 17 years of age were in the \nlabor force. By 1996, the labor force participation rate of working \nmothers had tripled. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that 65 \npercent of all women with children under 18 years of age are now \nworking. This percentage is not expected to decrease--it is expected to \ngrow. As we enter the 21st century, women will comprise 60 per cent of \nall new entrants into the labor market. A large proportion of these \nwomen are expected to be mothers of children under the age of six.\n  The implications for employers are clear. Employers understand well \nthat our nation's workforce is changing rapidly. Those employers who \ncan attract and hold onto the best employees are likely to be among the \nmost competitive.\n  Many of our larger corporations and government agencies have \nrecognized this and are already moving in that direction. For example, \nour nation's military is often cited as having a model child care \nprogram for its personnel. Military leaders know well the relationship \nbetween a parent's peace of mind and satisfaction with good child care \nand job performance.\n  In my State of Florida, several major firms have taken similar steps \nto invest in their employees. I recently visited Ryder Corporation's \nKids' Corner child care center in Miami where more than 100 children \nare cared for in a top-notch day care program. Ryder has received many \naccolades, including being recognized as the Best Employer of Women in \nthe State of Florida by the Florida Commission on the Status of Women. \nRyder now plans on extending the care that it provides to the children \nof employees by establishing a charter school on-site.\n  Similarly, NationsBank, formerly Barnett Bank, in Jacksonville, \noperates a state of the art child care facility for its employees. \nAccording to Ms. Mari White, the Senior Vice President of Work \nEnvironment Integration at NationsBank--and a member of my informal \nAdvisory Committee on Child Care--this program makes good business \nsense. She views the availability of child care at the work site as a \nworkforce retention tool for NationsBank as well as a great recruitment \ntool for new employees. In addition to its day care center, NationsBank \nalso operates a Satellite Learning Center--a charter school for \nemployees' children.\n  I commend Ryder Corporation, NationsBank, and the many other \ncorporations in Florida and throughout the nation, which have taken the \nimportant step forward in providing child care for its employees. I \nsubmit to you that small businesses, which do not have the resources to \nundertake such efforts, ought to have the ability to offer similar \nbenefits to its employees. My legislation is intended to make it easier \nfor them to do so.\n  Third, child care is important for the success of Welfare Reform. \nThis legislation is an important component to our national welfare \npolicy. While most American families struggle with child care, this \nproblem is most acute among the working poor and the middle class.\n  In 1996, Congress and the President changed welfare as we knew it. We \nmade fundamental changes to the policies, and the social expectations, \nrelating to work and welfare. The federal government has asked our \nbusiness community and governmental agencies to work in partnership in \nkeeping the working poor off of the welfare rolls. If we are to see the \nreforms of 1996 succeed, we must ensure that the means to succeed are \nprovided.\n  The working poor--particularly those formerly on welfare--face major \nchallenges associated with staying off of welfare. These challenges \ninclude their ability to:\n  (1) get to and from work;\n  (2) obtain the job training they need to get and hold onto their job; \nand\n\n[[Page S11987]]\n\n  (3) access to affordable and quality child care.\n  Although States spend millions of dollars each year on subsidized \nchild care, at any given time there may be up to twice as many children \neligible who are not enrolled in the system. These children are on \nchild care waiting lists. In the State of Florida for example, as of \nJuly of this year, there were 29,744 children on the state's wait list \nfor these services. Many of these families on waiting lists do not \nreceive temporary cash assistance because they work in low-wage jobs, \nsuch as in the retail sector, hotel and motel business, fast food \nrestaurants, nursing homes, and child care centers. They earn too much \nmoney to qualify for many government programs, yet they earn too little \nmoney to have real choices about their child care.\n  This is not an issue of whether they should stay at home or work--\nthey must work. In other words, for them child care is not an option, \nit is a necessity. I am reminded of a letter that I recently received \nfrom Ms. Ruth Pasarell-Valencia, the Commissioner at the Housing \nAuthority of the City of Miami Beach, in which she states, ``We need to \nwake up from the nightmare of child care neglect. In this era of \nWelfare Reform and cuts in many public assistance benefits, we have to \nbe very careful not to hurt our children in the process of making \nadults self-sufficient.''\n  By addressing our citizens' child care needs, particularly that of \nour working poor, the federal government has an opportunity to \ncontribute to the success of welfare reform. This legislation offered \ntoday would be one part of the federal government's response to this \nneed.\n  Fourth, small businesses need this support.\n  Mr. President, I believe that the provisions contained in my \nlegislation will be a boon for American small businesses. According to \nthe Small Business Administration, small businesses in America employ:\n  Fifty two percent of all private workers;\n  Sixty one percent of private workers on public assistance; and\n  Thirty eight percent of private workers in high-tech occupations.\n  Small businesses have contributed virtually all of the net new jobs \nwhich have been created during these recent years of job growth. And \nsmall businesses represent 96 percent of all exporters of goods leaving \nthe United States. Small businesses are truly a big piston in the \nengine of our nation's economy.\n  Yet, we know that the owners of small businesses struggle to make \nends meet. That is why initiatives like the one I propose are important \nfor strengthening the vitality of our small business community. For \nsmall businesses, resources are limited and survival in a competitive \nworld market is difficult. Think of the impact on a small business when \none of its employees is absent for the day to care for his or her child \nbecause that employee's day care worker is sick that day with the flu.\n  According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, employers surveyed \nreported positive benefits associated with providing child care to its \nemployees. The Treasury Department's data indicates:\n  Sixty two percent reported higher morale;\n  Fifty four percent reported reduced absenteeism;\n  Fifty two percent reported increased productivity; and\n  Thirty seven percent reported lower job turnover.\n  Providing child care to employees can be a major step-up for small \nbusinesses. My legislation would provide tax credits to the employers \nwho make investments to help their businesses and their employees with \nchild care, or back-up child care when their regular services are not \navailable.\n  Mr. President, in concluding, I would like to thank the 30 members of \nmy Informal Children's Development Advisory Committee in Florida which \nhas provided invaluable support to me, my staff, and Floridians \nthroughout the state. This group of dedicated individuals, who hail \nfrom a wide variety of professions, were instrumental in organizing the \nChild Care Summit which we held in South Florida in June of this year. \nThey have worked with child care professionals, parents, and business \ngroups to raise awareness on this issue, and have supported my efforts \nto draft this important legislative proposal.\n  To them, I offer my deepest thanks for the assistance they have \nprovided me and for all of their hard work on behalf of the welfare of \nchildren in Florida.\n  I would like to quote Ms. Janet Ndah, the Dean of Students at the \nPunta Gorda Middle School in Punta Gorda, Florida, who says of my \nlegislation: ``As an educator and a working parent, care for children \nis definitely a priority and a challenge. Therefore, I am extremely \nsupportive of this child care act and in particular, the tax credits \nthat employers would receive as they begin a site-based child care \nfacility.''\n  Ms. Phyllis J. Siderits, who works at the Florida Department of \nHealth--and who has served as a member of my Advisory Committee--also \nhas written to me of the benefits of this proposal: ``This Act is of \nbenefit to employers as well as employees. For too long, I have \nwitnessed the inability to maintain qualified and competent employees \nbecause of child care issues, whether those issues were ones of \ncompensation, scheduling and work time difficulties, or caretaker \nconcerns. It is especially gratifying to know that this act would be of \nbenefit to employees who have children with special needs and allow the \nemployees to have closer contact with their children during the day \nwhere employer-sponsored child care facilities exist. We have not \nsupported single-parent or dual-parent families who work and have \ntremendous difficulties obtaining child care. The ideal solution is an \nemployer-sponsored child care facility. I think this proposed \nlegislation offers all of the incentives to create a win-win solution \nfor employers and employees.''\n  Mr. President, I am disappointed that it seems that the \nAdministration's child care initiatives will not pass Congress this \nyear. That comprehensive proposal outlined by the President at the \nstart of this year would have provided much needed support to American \nfamilies in this vital area. However, I believe that the legislation \nwhich I am introducing today would make a valuable contribution to the \nquality of life and care for families; the success of Welfare Reform; \nand the strengthening of our small business community.\n  On July 30, 1998, I introduced, with 20 of my colleagues, a Senate \nResolution which would designate October 11, 1998 as National \nChildren's Day. That legislation now has 52 cosponsors and is awaiting \npassage by this Congress. It is only fitting that I am introducing this \nchild care legislation just days prior to that date which the United \nStates Senate is designating as ``National Children's Day.''\n  Mr. President, it is in recognition of our commitment to the children \nof our nation that I introduce the Worksite Child Care Development \nCenter Act of 1998. Our children and their families deserve our \nsupport. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of S. \nRes. 260 and a list of the members of the Advisory Committee be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              S.

A bill to amend the Housing and Community Development Act of \n1974 to provide affordable housing and community development assistance \nto rural areas with excessively high rates of outmigration and low per \ncapita income levels; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n\n\n                     the rural recovery act of 1998\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that \nwill help rural areas affected by severe population loss improve their \neconomic conditions and create high-paying jobs. We are experiencing \nfirst-hand the challenge of retaining entire generations in many parts \nof rural South Dakota as the agricultural crisis deepens and fewer and \nfewer young people can find economically-rewarding opportunities that \ngive them reason to stay. As a result, young people are being forced to \nleave the towns in which they grew up for better jobs in urban areas, \ncausing a depressing loss of generational continuity and a foreboding \nsign for the future of these rural communities.\n  Too often we forget that while the economic growth experienced in our \nurban areas is a necessary element of a sound national economy, the \nhealth and vitality of our rural areas are just as critical to our \nNation's economic future, and to its character. If nothing is done to \naddress the out-migration that is currently being experienced by our \nmost rural communities, we will continue to jeopardize the future of \nrural America.\n  That is why I am introducing legislation to provide these critical \nrural areas with the resources necessary to create the good jobs that \nwill help young families remain active residents of the rural \ncommunities in which they choose to live. The Rural Recovery Act of \n1998 would provide a minimum of $250,000 per year to counties and \ntribes with out-migration levels of fifteen percent or higher, per-\ncapita income levels that are below the national average, and whose \nexterior borders are not adjacent to a metropolitan area.\n  The legislation authorizes the United States Department of Housing \nand Urban Development to set aside $50 million in Community Development \nBlock Grant funding. The money, which is already included in the \nagency's budget, will be allocated on a formula basis to rural counties \nand tribes suffering from out migration and low per-capita income \nlevels.\n  County and tribal governments will be able to use this Federal \nfunding to improve their industrial parks, purchase land for \ndevelopment, build affordable housing and develop economic recovery \nstrategies. All of these important steps will help rural communities \naddress their economic challenges and plan for stable long-term growth \nand development.\n  While Federal agencies such as the United States Department of \nAgriculture's Office of Rural Development and the Economic Development \nAdministration do provide aid for rural development purposes, there are \nno federal programs that provide a steady source of funding for rural \nareas most affected by severe out migration and low per-capita income. \nFor these areas, the process of encouraging economic growth is arduous. \nI strongly believe the Rural Recovery Act of 1998 will provide the long \nterm assistance required to aid the coordinated efforts of local \ncommunity leaders as they begin economic recovery efforts that will \nensure a bright future for rural America.\n  In August, Senator Murkowski and I introduced legislation to provide \nassistance to rural communities that experience extremely high electric \npower rates. Today, I am pleased that he has agreed to join me in \ncosponsoring this legislation to assist rural areas with high out-\nmigration and low per-capita incomes. It is important that Congress do \nwhatever it can to assist these economically-challenged rural areas to \nremain vibrant participants in the American Dream. Senator Murkowski \nand I expect to combine these bills and introduce them as a single \npiece of legislation next year.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join Senator Murkowski and I during \nthe 106th Congress to enact these important new policies. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2596\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

BLIND AND VISUALLY IMPAIRED\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                              S. Res. 292\n\n       Whereas currency is used by virtually everyone in everyday \n     life, including blind and visually impaired persons;\n       Whereas the Federal reserve notes of the United States are \n     inaccessible to individuals with visual disabilities;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act enhances the \n     economic independence and equal opportunity for full \n     participation in society for individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas most blind and visually impaired persons are \n     therefore required to rely upon others to determine \n     denominations of such currency;\n       Whereas this constitutes a serious impediment to \n     independence in everyday living:\n       Whereas electronic means of bill identification will always \n     be more fallible than purely tactile means;\n       Whereas tactile currency already exists in 23 countries \n     worldwide; and\n       Whereas the currency of the United States is presently \n     undergoing significant changes for security purposes: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) endorses the efforts recently begun by the Bureau of \n     Engraving and Printing to upgrade the currency for security \n     reasons; and\n       (2) strongly encourages the Secretary of the Treasury and \n     the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to incorporate cost-\n     effective, tactile features into the design changes, thereby \n     including the blind and visually impaired community in \n     independent currency usage.\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, today I am submitting a \nresolution that encourages the Bureau of Printing and Engraving to \nincorporate tactile features on the currency to aid the blind. This \nresolution enjoys considerable bipartisan support, and was passed by \nvoice vote in the House of Representatives.\n  Four years ago, Mary Scroggs, a constituent of mine, was hit by a \ndrunk driver on the sidewalk in front of her office as she walked to \nlunch. As a result, she was left visually-impaired. Since this time, \nshe has tirelessly pursued opportunities to improve the ability of the \nvisually-impaired to live independently. It was her voice on this issue \nwhich brings me to introduce this important legislation.\n  In March 1994, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing commissioned the \nNational Academy of Science to execute a study entitled ``Current \nFeatures for Visually Impaired People.'' This report explored the \nmethods of making currency more accessible for all Americans.\n  In 1997, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing began implementing \nsignificant changes to simplify the identification of currency, such as \nlarger numbers and higher color contrast, to ease identification of \ncounterfeit currency. This resolution simply endorses the efforts of \nthe Bureau of Printing and Engraving to study the cost-effective \ntactile changes to aid those afflicted with low vision or blindness and \nencourages those changes in the national currency.\n  This minor change in currency will have a significant impact on the \nindependence of visually impaired Americans. Moreover, incorporating \ntactual features can serve other purposes, such as being an additional \ncounterfeit deterrent.\n  Visually impaired individuals are capable, independent people whose \nvaluable contributions touch all of our lives. It is important that all \nAmericans are afforded equal opportunities to perform at the best of \ntheir abilities. I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11991-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 293--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT NADIA \n   DABBAGH SHOULD BE RETURNED HOME TO HER MOTHER, MS.

Res. 293\n\n       Whereas Mr. Mohamad Hisham Dabbagh and Mrs. Maureen Dabbagh \n     had a daughter, Nadia Dabbagh, in 1990.\n       Whereas Maureen Dabbagh and Mohamad Hisham Dabbagh were \n     divorced in February 1992.\n       Whereas in 1993, Nadia was abducted by her farther.\n       Whereas Mohamad Dabbagh later fled the country with Nadia.\n       Whereas the governments of Syria and the United States have \n     granted child custody to Maureen Dabbagh and both have issued \n     arrest warrants for Mohamad Dabbagh.\n       Whereas Mohamad Dabbagh has escaped to Saudi Arabia.\n       Whereas the United States Department of State believes \n     Nadia now resides in Syria.\n       Whereas Maureen Dabbagh, with the assistance of missing \n     children organizations, has been unable to reunite with her \n     daughter.\n       Whereas the Department of State, the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation and Interpol have been unsuccessful in her \n     attempts to bring Nadia back to the United States.\n       Whereas Maureen Dabbagh has not seen her daughter in over \n     five years.\n       Whereas it will take the continued effort and pressure on \n     the part of Syrian officials to bring this case to a \n     successful conclusion: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that the \n     governments of the United States and Syria immediately locate \n     Nadia and deliver her safely to her mother.\n\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I am submitting a resolution today \nexpressing the Sense of the Senate regarding a heinous crime affecting \na family in Virginia and a growing problem in this country.\n  According to Department of Justice statistics, 114,600 children are \nthe subject of an abduction attempt by a stranger each year, and 12 \nchildren are actually abducted by a stranger every day. The statistics \non child abductions by non-custodial parents is even more alarming, \nwith 983 abductions each and every day.\n  I believe that we, as members of Congress, as parents, and as \nconcerned citizens of this country, should use all available resources \nin an exhaustive effort to locate missing and abducted children.\n  Today, through this Sense of the Senate resolution, I seek to bring \nto your attention the plight of Ms. Maureen Dabbagh of Virginia Beach. \nMs. Dabbagh has not seen her daughter, Nadia, in five years. At the age \nof three, Mr. Mohamad Hisham Dabbagh illegally abducted Nadia and fled \nthe United States. He is wanted on state and federal warrants in \nconnection with this abduction and he has been the subject of an \ninternational ``wanted'' notice since 1996. Since the abduction, Ms. \nDabbagh has not seen or heard from her child. She has been aided in her \nordeal by many caring people, groups and government agencies, however, \nto this day, Nadia still has not been returned to her mother.\n  Mr. President, I greatly sympathize with the plight of Maureen \nDabbagh and other parents facing similar situations. I wish to redouble \nall efforts to bring Nadia home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11991-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11991-S11992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 125--EXPRESSING THE OPPOSITION OF CONGRESS \n       TO ANY DEPLOYMENT OF UNITED STATES GROUND FORCES IN KOSOVO\n\n  Mr. INHOFE (for himself, Mr. Lott, Mr. Helms, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Hutichinson, Mr. Smith of New \nHampshire, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Allard, Mr. Campbell, Mr. \nMack, Mr. Craig, Mr. Grams, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Enzi, and \nMr. Hatch) submitted the following concurrent resolution which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S.

Mr. President, today, along with my colleague from \nOregon, Senator Ron Wyden, I submit a Concurrent Resolution opposing \nthe unilateral declaration of a Palestinian State. The House version of \nthis resolution is being introduced by Rep. Jim Saxton, my colleague \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, Yasir Arafat seeks to abandon the Oslo process and \nunilaterally declare a Palestinian state at the conclusion of the \ntransition period of five years, in May 1999. He has even gone as far \nas calling upon world leaders to support an independent Palestinian \nstate. This is wholly unacceptable.\n  I have in the past questioned Arafat's motives and his sincerity and \nI do so again. This act on his part will be a clear abrogation of the \nPeace Process and a slap in the face to Israel which has adhered to the \nprocess, despite continual non-compliance by the Palestinians. But \nthen, we should not be surprised. This is the same group that harbors \nand praises those who kill innocent men, women and children in bus \nbombings that kill Israelis and Americans alike.\n  Five years ago, the world was provided with a glimmer of hope that \nthe leopard had changed its spots, but that hope was never realized. \nNot only did the leopard not change his spots, he has grown bigger and \nbolder. The Palestinian Authority, which Arafat now heads, has been \nlegitimized and now carries out its aggressive policies, not under the \ncover of darkness like the PLO used to do, but in broad daylight for \nall to see. In no way can the United States lend further credence to \nthis terrorist force.\n  The purpose of this resolution is to send the message that the United \nStates cannot and should not extend recognition to a unilaterally \ndeclared Palestinian state. Moreover, the President should publicly and \nunequivocally state that the United States will actively oppose such a \ndeclaration. If Israel were to take a unilateral action in defiance of \nOslo, the Palestinians would express outrage over the violations. The \nPalestinians view themselves as different however. Such a move by the \nPalestinians cannot be allowed. The final political status of the \nPalestinians can only be determined through bilateral negotiation and \nagreement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, not by a \nunilateral act in defiance of the very agreement the Palestinians \nsigned with Israel.\n  Mr. President, my colleagues and I are serious. The Administration \nmust understand that such a move by the Palestinians is an insult to \nall those who were patient in light of all of the Palestinian \nviolations of the peace. Moreover, the Administration in legitimizing \nthese acts, would be humiliating Israel which is the only true \ndemocracy in the Middle East and our close ally. The Administration's \nconfusion on the issue in recent months has not helped matters and the \nextension of diplomatic recognition would severely harm the U.S. \nability to act as an impartial mediator between the two parties. Simply \nput, U.S. recognition of a Palestinian declaration of statehood would \nbe the acceptance and acquiescence of the Palestinians' violation of \nits commitments under Oslo. We would be rewarding them for their \nflagrant violations of the Peace Process. This would be an error of \nhistorical proportion. I can only hope we do not make this mistake.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and \nurge its speedy passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11992-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   ADVISORY COUNCIL ON CALIFORNIA INDIAN POLICY EXTENSION ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      CAMPBELL AMENDMENT NO. 3788\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. CAMPBELL submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by him to \nthe bill (H.R. 3069) to extend the Advisory Council on California \nIndian Policy to allow the Advisory Council to advise Congress on the \nimplementation of the proposals and recommendations of the Advisory \nCouncil; as follows:\n\n       Strike section 4.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S11992-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11992-S12001]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FREEDOM FROM RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION ACT OF 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       NICKLES AMENDMENT NO. 3789\n\n  Mr. NICKLES proposed an amendment to the bill (H.R. 2431) to \nestablish an Office of Religious Persecution\n\n[[Page S11993]]\n\nMonitoring, to provide for the imposition of sanctions against \ncountries engaged in a pattern of religious persecution, and for other \npurposes; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS; POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to freedom of religion undergirds the very \n     origin and existence of the United States. Many of our \n     Nation's founders fled religious persecution abroad, \n     cherishing in their hearts and minds the ideal of religious \n     freedom. They established in law, as a fundamental right and \n     as a pillar of our Nation, the right to freedom of religion. \n     From its birth to this day, the United States has prized this \n     legacy of religious freedom and honored this heritage by \n     standing for religious freedom and offering refuge to those \n     suffering religious persecution.\n       (2) Freedom of religious belief and practice is a universal \n     human right and fundamental freedom articulated in numerous \n     international instruments, including the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on \n     Civil and Political Rights, the Helsinki Accords, the \n     Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance \n     and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the United \n     Nations Charter, and the European Convention for the \n     Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.\n       (3) Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \n     recognizes that ``Everyone has the right to freedom of \n     thought, conscience, and religion. This right includes \n     freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either \n     alone or in community with others and in public or private, \n     to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, \n     worship, and observance.''. Article 18(1) of the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \n     recognizes that ``Everyone shall have the right to freedom of \n     thought, conscience, and religion. This right shall include \n     freedom to have or to adopt a religion or belief of his \n     choice, and freedom, either individually or in community with \n     others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or \n     belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching''. \n     Governments have the responsibility to protect the \n     fundamental rights of their citizens and to pursue justice \n     for all. Religious freedom is a fundamental right of every \n     individual, regardless of race, sex, country, creed, or \n     nationality, and should never be arbitrarily abridged by any \n     government.\n       (4) The right to freedom of religion is under renewed and, \n     in some cases, increasing assault in many countries around \n     the world. More than one-half of the world's population lives \n     under regimes that severely restrict or prohibit the freedom \n     of their citizens to study, believe, observe, and freely \n     practice the religious faith of their choice. Religious \n     believers and communities suffer both government-sponsored \n     and government-tolerated violations of their rights to \n     religious freedom. Among the many forms of such violations \n     are state-sponsored slander campaigns, confiscations of \n     property, surveillance by security police, including by \n     special divisions of ``religious police'', severe \n     prohibitions against construction and repair of places of \n     worship, denial of the right to assemble and relegation of \n     religious communities to illegal status through arbitrary \n     registration laws, prohibitions against the pursuit of \n     education or public office, and prohibitions against \n     publishing, distributing, or possessing religious literature \n     and materials.\n       (5) Even more abhorrent, religious believers in many \n     countries face such severe and violent forms of religious \n     persecution as detention, torture, beatings, forced marriage, \n     rape, imprisonment, enslavement, mass resettlement, and death \n     merely for the peaceful belief in, change of or practice of \n     their faith. In many countries, religious believers are \n     forced to meet secretly, and religious leaders are targeted \n     by national security forces and hostile mobs.\n       (6) Though not confined to a particular region or regime, \n     religious persecution is often particularly widespread, \n     systematic, and heinous under totalitarian governments and in \n     countries with militant, politicized religious majorities.\n       (7) Congress has recognized and denounced acts of religious \n     persecution through the adoption of the following \n     resolutions:\n       (A) House Resolution 515 of the One Hundred Fourth \n     Congress, expressing the sense of the House of \n     Representatives with respect to the persecution of Christians \n     worldwide.\n       (B) Senate Concurrent Resolution 71 of the One Hundred \n     Fourth Congress, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding \n     persecution of Christians worldwide.\n       (C) House Concurrent Resolution 102 of the One Hundred \n     Fourth Congress, expressing the sense of the House of \n     Representatives concerning the emancipation of the Iranian \n     Baha'i community.\n       (b) Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United States, \n     as follows:\n       (1) To condemn violations of religious freedom, and to \n     promote, and to assist other governments in the promotion of, \n     the fundamental right to freedom of religion.\n       (2) To seek to channel United States security and \n     development assistance to governments other than those found \n     to be engaged in gross violations of the right to freedom of \n     religion, as set forth in the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, \n     in the International Financial Institutions Act of 1977, and \n     in other formulations of United States human rights policy.\n       (3) To be vigorous and flexible, reflecting both the \n     unwavering commitment of the United States to religious \n     freedom and the desire of the United States for the most \n     effective and principled response, in light of the range of \n     violations of religious freedom by a variety of persecuting \n     regimes, and the status of the relations of the United States \n     with different nations.\n       (4) To work with foreign governments that affirm and \n     protect religious freedom, in order to develop multilateral \n     documents and initiatives to combat violations of religious \n     freedom and promote the right to religious freedom abroad.\n       (5) Standing for liberty and standing with the persecuted, \n     to use and implement appropriate tools in the United States \n     foreign policy apparatus, including diplomatic, political, \n     commercial, charitable, educational, and cultural channels, \n     to promote respect for religious freedom by all governments \n     and peoples.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird \n     Conservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the \n     United States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and \n     the large majority of those species, the neotropical \n     migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean;\n       (2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable \n     environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits \n     to the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;\n       (3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once \n     considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to \n     the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in \n     jeopardy; and\n       (B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations \n     of those species is habitat loss and degradation (including \n     pollution and contamination) across the species' range; and\n       (4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across \n     numerous international borders each year, their conservation \n     requires the commitment and effort of all countries along \n     their migration routes; and\n       (B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve \n     migratory birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be \n     significantly strengthened and enhanced by increased \n     coordination.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to perpetuate healthy populations of neotropical \n     migratory birds;\n       (2) to assist in the conservation of neotropical migratory \n     birds by supporting conservation initiatives in the United \n     States, Latin America, and the Caribbean; and\n       (3) to provide financial resources and to foster \n     international cooperation for those initiatives.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, now that it seems the debate on \ncampaign finance is over for this session, I wanted to make a few \ncomments concerning the current approach to reform and what I believe \nwould be the best approach. I agree that something needs to be done in \nfixing the system, but the problem is that the approaches debated this \nyear raise constitutional issues.\n  I have supported Congressional reform since entering Congress in \n1990, especially term limits. If we want to end the so-called money \nchase, then lets end the life terms in Congress. Many outside groups \nwho favor campaign finance reform are against term limits for they \nbelieve it to be undemocratic. I find quieting peoples voices and \nstopping them from participating in the electoral process to be even \nmore undemocratic, and probably unconstitutional.\n  We have heard that people have become disenchanted with the process. \nI believe this disenchantment has less to do with the fact that \ncampaigns have become expensive, than they are tired of campaign laws \nbeing broken. Let's enforce the laws on the books before we pass more \nlaws and make it even more difficult for citizens to participate. Let's \nnot penalize law abiding citizens because some elected officials will \nnot follow current laws.\n  Regarding expensive campaigns, lets take a look at some numbers. When \nI first came to Congress in 1990, there were 1,759 federal election \ncandidates in the U.S., who raised 471.7 million dollars and spent \n446.3 million dollars. This roughly averages to 268,168 dollars raised \nand 253,753 dollars spent by each federal candidate in the U.S.\n  By comparison, in 1996 there were 2,605 federal election candidates \nwhich raised 790.5 million dollars and spent 765.3 million dollars. \nThis means that each candidate raised 303,454 dollars and spent 293,781 \ndollars.\n  We can see that spending on campaigns has increased but so has the \nnumber of candidates. This influx of new candidates could make some \nincumbents nervous. But, I say that competition is a positive thing for \nthe electoral system. So, when we hear that there are fewer people who \nwant to run because of the cost of campaigns, we know that this is \nincorrect according to the Federal Election Commission.\n  Yes, fewer incumbents are running for reelection, but more people are \ntrying to replace them in representing their states or districts.\n  With overall campaign spending going up, I can understand how some in \nthis body and around the United States find that the cost of campaigns \nare just too high. However, during my 63 town meetings in 1998, this \ntopic has come up only a few times. But, more and more people are \ncomplaining abut taxes being too high.\n  Last year, as a percentage of GDP, federal tax revenue reached its \nhighest level since World War II to 19.8% and rising to 19.9% this \nyear. I am much more worried about the working man and woman who must \nwork long hard hours to make ends meet only to find that nearly 40% of \ntheir hard earned money must be given to the local, state, and federal \ngovernment. I think we should give the American people a tax cut.\n  My town meetings also indicated that Coloradans are concerned about\n\n[[Page S12016]]\n\nthe national debt and the interest their children and grandchildren \nwill pay. I don't see this getting much attention by the so-called \n``good government'' groups. I am more concerned about the abusive 5.5 \ntrillion dollar debt that we have levied on this nation. Let's pass my \nbill, S. 1608, the American Debt Repayment Act, and get this burden off \nthe American people's back.\n  In regards to campaign finance reform, I believe that reform should \npass three tests. First, it should be voluntary; Second, it should be \ninclusive, not exclusive; And third, it should be constitutional.\n  The United States is based on freedom and we have become the model \nfor freedom around the world. However, with freedom comes rights and \nresponsibilities. One of these rights is the ability to join or not to \njoin, to participate or not to participate, to speak or not to speak. \nThe decision to participate should be made by the individual and \nCongress has the responsibility to preserve this right for all \nAmericans.\n  When I ran for the Senate, people participated in my campaign only if \nthey wanted to. They could give either their time or their money. I had \nto assume that if they did, they did so because they believed in me and \nthe ideas that I stressed. I never forced any person to put out a sign, \nwear a button, or give a contribution to my campaign, it was always \nvoluntary.\n  We need to ensure that any campaign finance reform makes \nparticipation a voluntary activity for all individuals. If someone \ndoesn't want to give, they have the right to say no or at least should \nbe able to provide their consent.\n  That is why it is important to include the Paycheck Protection Act in \nany campaign finance reform. I find it confusing at best that we allow \nlabor unions to take money out of a paycheck and use it on political \nmatters without their members expressed written consent.\n  According to the Department of Labor, 80 percent, or 8.1 million, of \nall private sector workers covered by a union contract are required \nunder that contract to pay union dues as a condition of employment, \nAmerican workers should not have to choose between their jobs which \nprovide the food and clothing or political activity with which they may \ndisagree. I have yet to hear a solid reason how asking people to give \ntheir consent to use their required dues for political purposes would \nhinder a group's ability to participate.\n  When I was a small business owner, I was a member of a few groups, \nbut I joined each one voluntarily. I could have removed my name at any \ntime without any threat to my job or well being. Whenever a person is \nforced to join a group, like those in a closed shop, their dues should \nnever be used for political purposes unless they first state that it is \nOK to do so. To do less would be deceptive.\n  Another problem area is the possibility that the FCC may require free \nTV time to be provided to federal candidates.\n  First, I have never believed that a regulatory agency should act \nwithout the authorization of Congress. The Constitution states that \n``all legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress \nof the United States * * * .'' Regulatory agencies only enforce the \nlaws as set by Congress, not make them.\n  Second, the American media is a large, vast enterprise. I understand \nthat the broadcasting medium is unique, but I am afraid that this may \ntake us down a slippery slope. How long will it take before we order \nfree space in newspapers and magazines, or free time on cable, or free \nweb sites on the Internet, or free postage for our mailings, just in \nthe name of clean campaigns?\n  Lastly, for the states without any major media outlets, such as New \nJersey and Delaware, their neighboring states which supply the \nbroadcasting signal will be subsidizing not only their own federal \ncandidates but also the federal candidates of the states that depend on \nthem for the broadcast. Not only do I believe it is wrong for the FCC \nto implement this without Congressional authorization, but it would \nforce the media to be unwitting volunteers for candidates.\n  Freedom must be preserved for all individuals to choose the ideas \nthat they support or oppose. Thomas Jefferson said it best, ``To compel \na man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions \nwhich he disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.''\n  The Supreme Court has been very clear in its decisions regarding the \nFirst Amendment and campaign finance laws. Since the post-Watergate \nchanges to the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, twenty-four \nCongressional actions have been declared unconstitutional, with nine \nrejections based on the First Amendment. Out of those nine, four dealt \ndirectly with campaign finance reform laws. In each case, the Supreme \nCourt has ruled that political spending equals political speech. This \nSenate attempted to change this through a constitutional amendment \nlimiting the amount one can spend in a campaign, which only tells me \nthat this fact is undeniably recognized by this body.\n  The First Amendment is not there to hinder Americans from speaking \ntheir ideas, but to ensure that their ideas can be spoken. One way \nCongress and outside groups speak is through political campaigns, and \nit is a fact of life that it takes money. After deciding the Valeo vs. \nBuckley case, former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall stated \nthat, ``One of the points of which all Members of the Court agree is \nthat money is essential for effective communication in a political \ncampaign.''\n  When we pull the rug out from underneath people who want to speak \ntheir mind, whether they have little or lots of money, we pull the rug \nout from underneath their basic right to freedom of speech.\n  From the much quoted Buckley case, this fact is placed into its \nproper context. It states, ``A restriction on the amount of money a \nperson or group can spend on political communication during a campaign \nnecessarily reduces the quantity of expression by restricting the \nnumber of issues discussed, the depth of exploration, and the size of \naudience reached. This is because virtually every means of \ncommunicating ideas in today's mass society requires the expenditure of \nmoney.'' This encompasses the ``distribution of the humblest handbill'' \nto the more ``expensive modes of communication'' such as radio and \ntelevision.\n  The Court ensures that ``a major purpose of the [First] Amendment was \nto protect the free discussion of governmental affairs'' and that any \nlimitations of contributions and/or expenditures ``operate in an area \nof the most fundamental First Amendment activities.'' While, the Court \nfound that contribution limits were constitutional up to a certain \npoint, expenditure limits were not.\n  The Buckley decision also stated that ``* * * the mere growth in the \ncost of federal election campaigns in and of itself provides no basis \nfor government restrictions on the quantity of campaign spending.'' \nThey went further to say, ``the First Amendment denies government the \npower to determine that spending to promote one's political views is \nwasteful, excessive, or unwise. In the free society ordained by our \nConstitution, it is not the government, but the people--individually as \ncitizens and candidates and collectively as associations and political \ncommittees--who must retain control over the quantity and range of \ndebate on public issues in a political campaign.''\n  Simply stated, the government can not ration or regulate the \npolitical speech of a citizen through spending limits or limit its \nquantity any more than it can regulate what newspapers publishes, its \ncirculation, or when it can be printed.\n  Which brings me to another point concerning who and how one can spend \ntheir money. Our system should not exclude people from expressing their \nideas. In the much debated McCain-Feingold bill, there is a provision \nwhich would not allow groups to issue ads 60 days before an election. A \nperson or a group's speech is just as valid the day before an election \nas it is 61 days before. We all have experienced attack ads during a \ncampaign and many times they are very difficult to take. But to quiet \nthem so that a candidate can have an easier time during an election is \njust flat wrong. Every American should have the opportunity to speak in \nfavor or against any elected official whenever they choose.\n  So how can I support legislation which I believe would make our \nsystem exclusive, when our political process\n\n[[Page S12017]]\n\nshould be inclusive for all citizens who want to speak their minds? I \ntruly do believe it is wrong for me to try and silence people who want \nto criticize my voting record. That is their right and they should be \nable to do so whenever they choose and I should be able to defend it \nwhenever I choose and groups that support positions I take should be \nable to support my position whenever they choose.\n\n  From the beginning, I have believed the 60 day blackout provision to \nbe unconstitutional and a recent case in Michigan shows this to be \nright. In August, a federal court struck down, on First Amendment \ngrounds, a Michigan election rule prohibited incorporated groups and \nlabor unions from using the names and likeness of political candidates \nfor 45 days before the election. The state argued that the ban should \nbe allowed because it applied ``only'' to a limited time period and did \nnot apply to PACs and that ``the rule does not suffer from \nconstitutional overbreadth because it is content neutral, and is \nnarrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in the integrity \nof the electoral process.'' However, the U.S. District Judge Robert \nHolmes Bell ruled that the ban violated the First Amendment.\n  Judge Bell ruled that ``[I]n this case the censorial effect of the \nRule on issue advocacy is neither speculative nor insubstantial.'' He \nalso stated that ``[W]hile the time period is short, it could involve a \ncritical time period for communications. . . . A 45-day blackout on \nusing names would protect incumbents seeking re-election from \ngrassroots lobbying efforts on pending legislation, and incumbents \nwould soon learn to schedule votes on controversial legislation during \nthis time period and thus avoid unwanted publicity and attention. . . . \nThe ban on the use of candidates' names is a heavy burden on highly \nprotected First Amendment expression. Voters have an interest in \nknowing what legislators are associated with pending litigation, an \norganization's ability to educate the public on pending legislation is \nunduly hampered if they are unable to name the legislators involved.''\n  In conclusion, Judge Bell said, ``The mere fact that we are dealing \nwith a corporation rather than an individual does not remove its speech \nfrom the ambit of the First Amendment. . . . Because the rule not only \nprohibits expenditures in support of or in opposition to a candidate, \nbut also prohibits the use of corporate treasury funds for \ncommunications containing the name or likeness of a candidate, without \nregard to whether the communication can be understood as supporting or \nopposing the candidate, there is a realistic danger that the Rule will \nsignificantly compromise the First Amendment protections of not only \nthe Plaintiff, but many other organizations which seek to have a voice \nin political issue advocacy.''\n  I believe Judge Bell's ruling will stand the test of appeal for he \nstated that any decision regarding the ``constitutionality of campaign \nfinance must begin with and usually ends'' with the Buckley case. And \nagain, the Buckley decision clearly states that, ``. . . the \ndistinction between discussion of issues and candidates and advocacy of \nelection or defeat of candidates may often dissolve in practical \napplication. Candidates, especially incumbents, are intimately tied to \npublic issues involving legislative proposals and governmental actions. \nNot only do candidates campaign on the basis of their positions on \nvarious public issues, but campaigns themselves generate issues of \npublic interest.''\n  This clearly states that it is a constitutional right to criticize an \nelected official and their record, and that no citizen needs to ask \npermission from the government when and how this can be done. Believe \nme, I can understand wanting to control the debate of a campaign and \nsilence some of the critics, but I cannot constitutionally, or in good \nconscience, do that. For every citizen has the right to be a part of \nthe debate. I believe that placing a road block to the First Amendment \nonly closes doors to the system not opens them.\n  We will always hear that money is the reason why people don't run or \nget involved. I can say that I am not a wealthy man. I started a \nveterinarian hospital with sweat and hard work. When I decided to run \nfor Congress, I didn't have a lot of money, but worked hard to make \nmyself known. When I ran for the Senate, I still wasn't wealthy, but I \ndid run against a wealthy man. When the campaign was over, I had more \nvotes and no campaign debt despite the fact that I was outspent by \n750,000 dollars, three-quarter of a million dollars. You don't have to \nhave a lot of money to win a race, just the right message. I will not \nvote for legislation that I believe would stop someone from speaking \ntheir message, even if it's my opponent.\n  While I do not believe closing the door on the First Amendment is the \nright approach, I do believe that opening up the system to fuller and \nmore timely disclosure would provide for a much more robust campaign \nsystem.\n  This is why I introduced my own bill, the Campaign Finance Integrity \nAct, S. 1190. My bill does not restrict one from exercising their \npolitical speech rights, but asks for complete and honest disclosure of \nall campaign spending. While this statement is not one of endorsement \nconcerning my legislation, the American Civil Liberties Union did state \nin a review of the McCain-Feingold bill that, ``Disclosure, rather than \nlimitation, of large soft money contributions to political parties, is \nthe more appropriate and less restrictive alternative.'' My bill does \njust that. As a matter of fact, I believe my bill has some of the \nstrongest disclosure requirements of any bill introduced.\n  My bill also:\n  Requires candidates to raise at least 50 percent of their \ncontributions from individuals in the state or district in which they \nare running.\n  Equalize contributions from individuals and political action \ncommittees (PACs) by raising the individual limit from $1000 to $2500 \nand reducing the PAC limit from $5000 to $2500.\n  Indexes individual and PAC contribution limits for inflation.\n  Reduces the influence of a candidate's personal wealth by allowing \npolitical party committees to match dollar for dollar the personal \ncontribution of a candidate above $5000, by using only hard money.\n\n  Requires organizations, groups, and political party committees to \ndisclose within 24 hours the amount and type of independent \nexpenditures over $1,000 in support of or against a candidate. Only the \norganization discloses it expenditures, not the names of the individual \ndonors.\n  Requires corporations and labor organizations to seek separate, \nvoluntary authorization of the use of any dues, initiation fees or \npayment as a condition of employment for political activity, and \nrequires annual full disclosure of those activities to union members \nand shareholders.\n  Prohibits depositing of an individual contribution by a campaign \nunless the individual's profession and employer are reported.\n  Encourages the Federal Election Commission to allow filing of reports \nby computers and other emerging technologies and to make that \ninformation accessible to the public on the Internet less than 24 hours \nof receipt.\n  Completely bans the use of taxpayer financed mass mailings.\n  Lastly, S. 1190 creates a tax deduction for political contributions \nup to $100 for individuals and $200 for a joint return to encourage \nsmall donations.\n  Another way to ``clean up'' the campaign finance system and reduce \nthe so-called special interest money is to reduce the size and scope of \nthe Federal Government and I am not alone in believing this. Last year, \nRasmussen Research did a survey showing that 62% of Americans think \nthat reducing government spending would reduce corruption in \ngovernment. The same survey showed that 44% think that cutting \ngovernment spending would do more to reduce corruption than campaign \nfinance reform, while 42% think campaign finance reform would reduce \ncorruption more than cutting government spending. I have said many \ntimes, if the government rids itself of special interest funding and \ncorporate welfare, then there would be little influence left for these \nlarge donors.\n  I know that no one in this chamber takes the first amendment lightly. \nIt is the cornerstone by which many of the rights we enjoy today are \nset. It is there to ensure that the Government does not control us, but \nthat the Government is under control. In 1808, Thomas Jefferson stated \nwhat the first\n\n[[Page S12018]]\n\namendment should and would mean to each of us--``The liberty of \nspeaking and writing guards our other liberties.'' And again in 1828, \nhe said, ``The force of public opinion cannot be resisted when \npermitted to freely be expressed. The agitation it produces must be \nsubmitted to.'' This is why any campaign finance reform should be \nreform that preserves the right of free speech and which allows all \nAmericans to voice their opinion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12015-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12018-S12019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, a little more than a year ago \nserious financial problems began to arise in Thailand. What began in \nThailand, however, quickly spread to other Asian financial markets like \nIndonesia, South Korea, and even Hong Kong and Japan. In recent months, \nwe have seen this financial crisis creep into other economies around \nthe world, most notably, perhaps, Russia and Brazil. This crisis is not \njust about Asia, Russia or Latin America, however; it's about the U.S. \nas well.\n  In today's increasingly intertwined global economy, the U.S. has an \nimportant national interest in working to stabilize the economies of \nits trading partners around the world. It is the U.S. that ultimately \nstands to lose if other economies fail--economies that are markets for \nour products. Reductions in Asian purchasing power or Latin American \npurchasing power mean lower profits for U.S. companies operating in \nthose markets and fewer high-paying jobs in U.S. export industries.\n  East Asian nations, for example, are important trading partners for \nthe U.S. U.S. exports to East Asia accounted for 28 percent of all \nAmerican merchandise exports in 1996. This number far exceeds the 9.2 \npercent of exports that went to Mexico, and even the 21.4 percent that \nwent to Canada.\n  Brazil, Latin America's largest economy, is also an important market \nfor the U.S. Brazil is the U.S.' 11th-largest export market with $16 \nbillion in sales last year. Moreover, and perhaps more important, \nBrazil is one of the few major trading partners with whom the U.S. has \na positive balance of trade. U.S. companies' exports to Brazil grew 25% \nlast year and are now roughly five times the value of Russia's before \nRussia's crash.\n  I want to elaborate a little on the importance of the stability of \nthe Brazilian economy to the U.S. And in do doing, I think it is \nimportant to remember that the U.S. is not an economic island unto \nitself. We are truly part of an interdependent global economy.\n  Capital flows freely, without regard to geographical boundaries and \nto places we couldn't have imagined even 5 or 10 years ago. One of the \nplaces where a substantial amount of that capital has been flowing over \nthe past 5 years or so is Brazil. In fact, U.S. investments in Brazil \nnow exceed the U.S. investments in Mexico.\n  Largely as a result of the reforms adopted during the administration \nof President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, Brazil has emerged from its so-\ncalled ``Lost Decade'' of the eighties. During that decade, Brazil's \neconomy languished in inflation and stagnation. That inflation and \nstagnation continued into the mid-nineties, and reached as high as \n2,700 percent in 1994.\n  Since then, however, key infrastructure industries such as energy, \ntelecommunications, and ports have begun modernizing and expanding. \nMoreover, state monopolies in oil, electricity, and telecommunications \nhave ended, and many businesses have now been privatized. Such \nprivatization can only mean good things for U.S. companies seeking to \nexpand their markets.\n  As the Brazilian Finance Minister in 1993 and 1994, Mr. Cardoso, \nalong with other liberal economists, developed the ``Real Plan.'' This \nplan opened Brazil to foreign investment and pegged the Real--the \nBrazilian currency--to the U.S. dollar. This plan has been credited \nwith lowering inflation from its high in 1994 to single digits this \nyear.\n  Yet, since mid-August, the economic debacles in Asia and Russia have \npushed Brazil to the precipice of economic and financial collapse. The \nstakes for America and Americans are considerable. If the Brazilian \neconomy fails, the financial crisis now gripping large parts of the \nrest of the world will be on America's doorstep.\n  The huge Brazilian economy, the ninth largest in the world, is the \nbackbone of Latin America. Economists warn that if Brazil's economy \ncollapses, the economies of Argentina, Chile, and the rest of Latin \nAmerica will be in serious peril.\n  Almost twenty percent of our exports are purchased by Latin America \nand it is host to an increasing number of American-owned factories \nwhose sales and profits are important contributors to the balance \nsheets of corporate America. A sharp reduction in the flow of this \nincome, combined with the sharp reductions which have already occurred \nin Asia, would seriously imperil economic growth here in the U.S. As an \neconomist at Salomon Smith Barney stated, ``there is just no way we can \nallow Brazil to fail.''\n  The economic crises in Asia, Brazil and other parts of the world, are \npotentially particularly problematic for my home state of California. \nCalifornia is the world's seventh largest economy, it has a gross state \nproduct of more than $1 trillion, and is by far the nation's largest \nstate market. It exports more than any other state in the country; and \nthus, not surprisingly sensitive to the financial crises faced by our \ntrading partners.\n  The Asian financial crisis is illustrative of this point. Because of \nCalifornia's geographical proximity to Asia, and what had been Asia's \nrapidly expanding economies, a growing number of California's exports \nwere, and are, going to Asia.\n  Of California's top 10 export markets, 6 are Asian. Moreover, forty-\nfour percent of all California exports are to Asia and approximately \n725,000 California jobs are supported by exports to Asia. During the \nfirst quarter of 1998, however, California's exports to Japan decreased \nby 12 percent, exports to Singapore decreased by 14 percent, to \nIndonesia by almost 25 percent, and to South Korea by 40 percent.\n  Although Brazil ranked 17th among California's export markets in \n1997, Brazil's financial troubles do present added risks to \nCalifornia's ability to export goods and services. California's \nhigh technology companies have reportedly been building a presence in \nBrazil and a consumer class has emerged. Moreover, California's trade \nofficials, and many California exporters, have said they had begun to \nlook to the Latin American markets to offset the slowdown in Asia and \nhelp keep the state's exports growing--exports which are so vital to \nthe California economy.\n\n  Given this global economic interdependence, the question is--what can \nwe, as legislators, do to help, aid, or assist in getting these \ndistressed economies back on track?\n  While there are some things we cannot do, like dictate or direct that \ncountries follow economic practices and policies set forth by the U.S., \nthere are things we can do. One of the things we can do, and I believe \nwe must do, is provide technical and financial assistance to \neconomically distressed countries through our participation in the \nInternational Monetary Fund--the IMF.\n  Last September, while the Asian financial crisis was still unfolding, \nthe IMF Executive Board agreed on quota increases for its members. The \nrequest for U.S. commitments to the IMF consists of: (1) $14.5 billion \nfor our share of the increase in normal quota resources, and (2) $3.5 \nbillion for U.S. participation in the New Arrangements to Borrow, an \naddition to the Fund's emergency credit lines for use in systemic \nfinancial crises.\n  In late March, the Senate, with strong bi-partisan support, voted to \ninclude the Administration's full IMF funding request, of approximately \n$18 billion, in its 1998 supplemental appropriations bill. The House, \nhowever, refused to include this funding in its supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  Although the House did agree to provide the IMF $3.4 billion in \nfunding on September 17, that amount is far short of the $18 billion \nrequested by the Administration, approved by the Senate and needed to \nhelp curb the economic crisis which threatens several regions around \nthe globe. The House and Senate are now debating this important issue, \nand I support and encourage Chairman Stevens' steadfast insistence that \nthe House recede to the Senate on the issue of full IMF funding.\n\n[[Page S12019]]\n\n  The IMF is the world's largest lender of last resort and is designed \nto foster trade and economic growth by helping maintain stability in \nthe international monetary system. Countries join the Fund by agreeing \nto a capital subscription and abiding by rules set up in the Articles \nof Agreement.\n  The 182 member countries may borrow money from the IMF to finance \nshort-term balance of payment deficits and to help manage more serious \nlonger-term financial imbalances. In return, borrowing countries must \nadopt economic policies negotiated with IMF economists, and approved by \nthe Executive Board, designed to ensure the underlying problems which \ncaused the crisis are corrected.\n  These policies, or conditions, are market-oriented measures that vary \ndepending on the situation, but often focus on reducing government \nspending, implementing banking and financial industry reforms, and \ntaking often painful steps to control inflation. IMF loans to its \nmembers are repaid with interest. Although, the IMF has had to \nrestructure some of the outstanding loan balances of the poorest \ncountries, no country has ever defaulted on its IMF loan.\n  It is important to note that in addition to U.S. economic interests, \nU.S. national security interests are also at risk as a result of the \nAsian economic crisis, as well as the economic crises in Russia and in \nother parts of the world. Many of the countries affected by the crisis \nare key strategic allies.\n  The U.S. has 100,000 troops based in Asia, 37,000 on the Korean \nPeninsula alone. History has shown that economic distress and financial \ninstability can threaten political stability and security.\n  Mr. President, in closing I want to note my agreement with many of my \ncolleagues who believe the IMF needs to make some reforms. I do not \ndisagree. Chairman Greenspan said during his September 16 testimony \nbefore the House Banking Committee, ``I think that the IMF requires a \nfundamental review in all of its aspects, but not now, we need the \nstructure of the IMF and its funding procedures and its conditionality, \nbecause that's all we've got.''\n  I hope the House of Representatives will heed the words of Chairman \nGreenspan, and agree, as the Senate has already done, that it is in our \nnational economic interest and our national security interest to \nprovide full funding to the IMF.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12018-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING ``CHARACTER COUNTS!''\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nCarl Youngblom, a great American from my state, who unexpectedly passed \naway earlier this year.\n  Carl proudly served his nation as a Korean War veteran. He proudly \nserved his community as former president of the St. Peter Rotary \nInternational. And he proudly served disabled veterans as a past \nMinnesota Department Commander of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV).\n  In fact, I got to know Carl after he was elected DAV Department \nCommander in 1995. I can tell you from personal experience that he was \na staunch advocate for disabled veterans and their families, often \nurging us in Congress to do well for our veterans, and I deeply \nrespected him for that. According to his wife Val, he became such a \nstrong veterans advocate out of love for his older brother, whose life \nwas changed from being wounded in combat during World War II.\n  Carl also had a strong connection to agriculture, starting as a \nfamily farmer and then moving to a career in agriculture finance. He \nwas a fine athlete who loved to swim, cross country ski, and run. But \nperhaps most impressive was how his kindness touched people and how his \ncompassion helped build consensus during times of conflict. We will \nmiss him dearly.\n  Mr. President, I conclude by asking my colleagues to join me in \nexpressing to his loving wife Val and their children and grandchildren \nour nation's eternal gratitude for Carl Youngblom's significant and \nmyriad contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12019-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12019]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CLARIFICATION OF VOTE--AMENDMENT NO. 3719, AS AMENDED, AS MODIFIED\n\n Mr. THOMAS.

Mr. President, I rise today to call attention to \nthe celebration of World Food Day on October 16th. I also rise to \nrecognize the many successes achieved by the UN World Food Programme \n(WFP), the world's largest international food aid organization, over \nthe past 18 years.\n  The WFP provides humanitarian relief to the world's poorest and most \ndowntrodden people by distributing food to those individuals who are \nthe most vulnerable to malnutrition and famine, particularly women and \nchildren. Last year alone, the WFP fed over 52.9 million people, by \ntransporting food to needy and malnourished families in 84 countries. \nThe WFP also provides much needed assistance to the tens of millions of \nvictims world-wide who have suffered through natural disasters, such as \nearthquakes, severe floods and drought. Moreover, the WFP has committed \nitself to ensuring peace and stability around the world by providing \nfood to people in war-torn countries like Sudan and Rwanda. Finally, \nthe WFP uses donated food for development activities such as paying \nindividuals that replant forests in Ethiopia and providing nourishment \nto workers repairing dikes in Vietnam. These activities help developing \ncountries build strong infrastructures and promote economic stability.\n  With nowhere else to turn, the poorest of the world's poor have been \nable to find solace in the hard work and dedication of the WFP's many \nvolunteers and employees.\n  American citizens have a particular reason to be proud on World Food \nDay. The United States has committed itself to be a world leader in the \nglobal battle against hunger. The U.S. was a primary founder of the WFP \nand has consistently been the world's single largest donor of food to \nthe world's poor.\n  As World Food Day is celebrated this year, we can applaud the \nprogress the U.N. World Food Programme has achieved and the compassion \nthat has been shown. We all must be reminded, however, that substantial \nwork remains to be undertaken and completed. In recognition of this \nspecial day, I ask that we all carry with us the vision of a new day \nwhen abundant food is available to each and every human being and that \nwe renew our collective commitment to achieve that vision.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12019-4", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12019-S12020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REINVESTMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESTORATION ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to commend my \ncolleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, for her herculean efforts \nin developing this legislation. She has worked tirelessly with other \nSenators, the House, and numerous stakeholders, including industry \ngroups and environmental groups alike. The bill she introduces\n\n[[Page S12020]]\n\ntoday reflects her tremendous dedication to this issue.\n  I also applaud Senator Landrieu's efforts to shape this legislation \ninto a significant conservation initiative. Her legislation includes \ntwo titles devoted to environmental protection--title II for funding \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), and title III for funding \nnon-game species protection by the States, known as Teaming with \nWildlife. These worthwhile programs have not received the attention or \nfunding they deserve on their own, and the inclusion in this \nlegislation gives them an opportunity to fulfill their potential. In \nparticular, the LWCF was created in 1964 with the principle that \nrevenues from a resource extraction activity--offshore oil drilling--\nshould be reinvested in the acquisition and protection of other natural \nresources with lasting value. Senator Landrieu's bill remains true to \nthis principle.\n  S. 2566 is a major piece of legislation, with much promise. It \ndeserves careful consideration. I intend to give the bill this \nconsideration during recess. I intend to consult with different groups \nhere, and with constituents in my home state of Rhode Island. Some \ngroups have raised concerns that this bill will encourage offshore \ndrilling, despite the Senator's strong statement that this bill is \n``drilling-neutral.'' I would like to reach my own conclusion on this \nscore. Different interest groups have made suggestions to improve the \nprovisions in all three titles, and I would like to explore those as \nwell during recess.\n  Senator Landrieu has expressed a genuine openness to consider new \nideas, and a genuine willingness to incorporate good ideas into her \nlegislation. I look forward to working with my colleague from Louisiana \nduring the coming months on this initiative, and again, I \nwholeheartedly congratulate her on how far she has come \nalready.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12019-5", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12020]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     U.S. ROLE IN ERADICATING POLIO\n\n Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, there are fewer than 800 days left \nbefore we reach the goal of eliminating polio throughout the world by \nthe end of the year 2000. That victory will mark the second time in \nhistory we have been able to eradicate an infectious disease. The first \nwas the eradication of smallpox, a disease that claimed millions of \nlives through the centuries. As recently as the 1950's, smallpox was \nkilling over 2 million people each year, despite the fact that an \neffective vaccine for the disease had been in use since 1796. Smallpox \neradication began in 1967. The campaign required 11 years to complete \nand cost nearly $300 million--$200 million from countries with endemic \nsmallpox and an additional $100 million from international donors. The \nU.S. was the largest international contributor with a total investment \nof $32 million. And that investment has repaid itself many times over. \nBeyond the humanitarian benefits of eliminating this vicious killer, we \nhave enjoyed tremendous economic benefits. The U.S. alone has recouped \nthe equivalent of its entire investment every 26 days since the disease \nwas eradicated.\n  The polio effort began in 1988 when the World Health Assembly \nendorsed the program and set the year 2000 as the target date for \nglobal eradication. Thus far, the campaign has been a dramatic success \nstory. Today, four out of every five of the world's children receive \npolio vaccine. Over the past ten years, polio cases have been reduced \nby over 90 percent and today more than 150 nations report no polio. All \ncountries in the Western Hemisphere have been polio-free since 1991, \nand all countries in Europe and the Western Pacific Region--including \nChina, Vietnam and Cambodia--have been polio free for one or more \nyears.\n  In my view, the program's achievements are the result of a model \npublic-private partnership. Rotary International began working on \nimmunization programs in the early 1980's and when the World Health \nAssembly endorsed the polio eradication program in 1988, Rotary became \nthe primary private-sector partner in the campaign. We estimate that \nRotary International will have contributed $450 million by the end of \nthe year 2000--the largest private contribution to a public health \ninitiative in history.\n  In a combined effort with the health ministries in each country, \nRotary, UNICEF, WHO and CDC have mobilized thousands of volunteers to \nrecruit, educate, transport and vaccinate children in a mass campaign \nstrategy. The scope of the program is enormous. In 1997 alone, more \nthan 450 million children in 80 countries were vaccinated against polio \nthrough the use of mass campaigns. And the partners have enjoyed \nunparalleled success in densely populated areas where the risk of \ndisease has been high. During India's first campaign in 1996, more than \n87 million children were vaccinated by 100,000 volunteers over a three-\nday period.\n  The last frontier for the program is Africa, where the polio campaign \nfaces formidable challenges. Efforts there have been hindered by \npoverty, civil conflicts and logistical problems in vaccine delivery. \nEven with these barriers, the program has enjoyed significant success \nin many areas of the continent. National Immunization Days have been \nconducted in over 35 African countries and have put a real dent in the \nnumber of polio cases.\n  Experts in the field, including my wife Betty who participated in a \nmass campaign in West Africa earlier this year, have all returned with \nthe same message--We can win the war against polio and Africa can put \nus over the top by the year 2000, but only if we intensify our efforts \nin Africa over the next two years. This means more funding from all the \ndonors and more logistical support for programs that are conducted in \ncountries racked by civil conflict and supply shortages.\n  As was the case with smallpox, the rewards will far exceed the costs. \nThe U.S. alone will reap annual savings of over $230 million and \nworldwide savings will exceed $1.5 billion each year. More importantly, \nwe will have conquered a disease responsible for crippling millions of \nchildren over our history. Finally, we will have set the stage for our \nnext campaign--the eradication of measles. Regional efforts to \neliminate measles have already begun and an international effort is on \nthe horizon. Historically, measles has killed more children than any \nother infectious disease. Even today, it is responsible for one out of \nevery 10 deaths in children under age 5. Many leaders in the public \nhealth field believe that we should begin planning an international \nstrategy over the next two years so that resources can be easily \nshifted from the polio effort to a measles campaign once polio is \neradicated.\n  I would like to conclude by paraphrasing the testimony of several \nwitnesses at a recent Appropriations Committee hearing on measles and \npolio eradication. We live in a time when government and politicians \nare the targets of great criticism. At the same time, there are few \ninstances of social justice by groups other than government. No social \nclub, no church group, no other organization represents all of us. Only \ngovernment does that.\n  Our immunization successes in this country have resulted from \ngovernment at its best--government was an aim to protect every child \nindividually and society collectively. It is the product of politics at \nits best.\n  Likewise, while the U.S. effort to support smallpox eradication, \npolio eradication, child health and child immunization is a consequence \nof enlightened self interest, it also expresses our understanding, as \nAmericans, of a responsibility to the world and to the future. It is \nthe U.S. government at its very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12020-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12020-S12021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IOWA NORTHLAND REGIONAL COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY.

Mr. President, I rise today to make a few \nremarks about the distinguished service of United States veterans. As \nVeterans Day approaches, we look forward to honoring the men and women \nwho have served this country with bravery, honor, and valor. I am \nsubmitting, for my colleagues, a May 28, 1998 article from the Los \nAngeles Times written by Patty Andrews, one of the Andrews Sisters. The \nAndrews Sisters spent much of World War II entertaining the young men \nwho fought so courageously in Europe, the Pacific, Africa, and other \nparts of the world. In this stirring piece, Ms. Andrews details the \nservice and sacrifices of all of those who contributed to the war \neffort, and describes how she and her sisters helped to build morale \nand comforted the wounded.\n  The article follows:\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 25, 1998]\n\n           Bugle Boys of Company B Died To Keep America Free\n\n                           (By Patty Andrews)\n\n       My sisters and I probably met face to face with more \n     soldiers in World War II than any general or field marshal. \n     The Andrews Sisters entertained tens of thousands of GIs at \n     bases here and abroad throughout the war and I can still see \n     so many of their smiling American faces. I sometimes wonder \n     how many of those faces made it home safely and how many are \n     now just faint memories. I'll carry their memory for as long \n     as I live. But then what? With nothing to publicly \n     commemorate those GIs, their deeds will be forgotten.\n       The faces of the survivors are now creased and seasoned by \n     the years--but they still smile when they see me. And I see \n     them all the time, in airports and shopping malls. The \n     veterans of global war are living their autumn years happily, \n     oblivious to the fact that they are walking history.\n       We have a common bond. We were all soldiers in the greatest \n     war ever. And we share a knowing wink--if you weren't there \n     you'd never understand the terror of total war or \n     exhilaration of saving the world from evil incarnate. I guess \n     I remind the veterans that it all really happened, that it \n     wasn't some hazy memory, that they answered the call and \n     succeeded beyond all expectation. They won a victory so \n     complete that we hardly remember a time when America wasn't a \n     superpower or the most prosperous nation on Earth or one of \n     the few remaining democracies standing against a global gang \n     of dictators. Today we take it all for granted.\n       Those who died to make it possible for us to forget that \n     brutal era would no doubt be satisfied that their sacrifice \n     was worth it. But they were so young. The soldiers who were \n     in their late teens and early 20s. So young that the shows \n     had the flavor of a huge high school football game or a Boy \n     Scout jamboree. Nearly half a million of these brave kids \n     would never know if we won or lost the war or how 50 years of \n     peace and prosperity would transform their country. Their \n     faces will always be innocent and brave, but unknowing.\n       My sisters and I were innocent too, but not for long. We \n     cheered the boys as they left for war but we also welcomed \n     back the wounded and shattered. Those are some of the faces I \n     will never forget. In one San Francisco hospital ward we were \n     briefed about what we were about to see, and we were told not \n     to show too much emotion. Behind the doors of that dire ward \n     were young faces contorted with pain or frozen and mute. The \n     sight of these boys--no different than the thousands of \n     others we entertained except that they had been chewed up and \n     spat out by the maw of war--brought home to me the absolute \n     horror of war and the enormity of our debt to them.\n       In that frightful infirmary we talked, sang and tried to do \n     something--anything--to bring a moment of pleasure, maybe a \n     smile or a look of hope that life will somehow be better. I \n     tried but could not begin to match their contribution. None \n     of us can ever fully repay those boys who sacrificed their \n     youth so we could forget such horror existed. But we need to \n     try.\n       Today, before the memories fade and before the last veteran \n     dies, we need to enshrine their courage. We need a permanent \n     place to honor the generation that gave so much so long ago. \n     We need a memorial that matches their monumental sacrifice \n     and their towering devotion to freedom. In short, we need an \n     official World War II Memorial on the National Mall in \n     Washington. The site has already been selected--all we need \n     now is the will to build it.\n       Helping to build morale and comfort the wounded through our \n     music changed and fulfilled my life, as it did the lives of \n     my sisters, Laverne and Maxene. We were privileged to know so \n     many courageous men and women willing to give their lives for \n     freedom. It's ironic that because of their sacrifice, we can \n     use words like ``freedom'' and ``democracy'' today without \n     having to measure their cost. We must honor those brave young \n     people who paid the price.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12021-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12021]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING OMER O'NEIL\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM.

Mr. President, I rise to express my continued strong \ninterest in meaningful class action reform--and to announce that, \nalthough we do not have the time necessary to move legislation any \nfurther this year, class action reform remains one of my highest \npriorities. Although many class action lawsuits do result in \nsignificant and important benefits for class members and society, too \nmany class lawyers put their self-interest above the best interests of \ntheir clients--resulting in unfair and abusive settlements that \nshortchange class members while their lawyers line their pockets with \nhigh fees.\n  To address this growing problem, Senator Grassley and I introduced \nthe Class Action Fairness Act of 1998 (S. 2083). The bill is a moderate \napproach to weed out the worst abuses, while preserving the benefits of \nclass actions. It encourages closer scrutiny of class actions through \nseveral provisions. It requires that proposed class action settlements \nbe in plain, easily understandable English and be sent to state \nattorneys general, so they have an opportunity to weigh in with any \nobjections. It requires courts to determine what damages will actually \nbe paid to class members before awarding attorneys' fees, rather than \ncalculating fees based on overvalued estimates of meaningless coupon \nsettlements. And it moves more class actions to federal courts, which \ngenerally give closer scrutiny than state courts and can promote \nefficiency and avoid a collusive ``race to settlement'' by \nconsolidating overlapping cases.\n  These proposals have earned a broad range of support. Even Judge Paul \nNiemeyer, the Chair of the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on \nCivil Rules, who has studied class actions closely and testified before \nCongress on this issue, expressed his support for this ``modest'' \nmeasure, noting in particular that increasing federal jurisdiction over \nclass actions will be a positive ``meaningful step.''\n  This year, our bipartisan measure was reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. \nUnfortunately, as the term has winded down, we have been too busy with \nother pressing issues to give this proposal the full consideration it \ndeserves. Still, we already have made several revisions\n\n[[Page S12022]]\n\nto improve the bill and address concerns that have been raised, and in \nmy view any remaining concerns can be worked out.\n  So next year, class action reform will be one of my highest \npriorities. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that \nwe eliminate those abuses that too often give class actions a bad name.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12021-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12022]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR. STEVEN DeKOSKY\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, next month our nation acknowledges \nthe more than 4 million Americans who suffer from Alzheimer's disease \nand the 19 million who are their caregivers. National Alzheimer's month \nis a time to reflect on those who are afflicted as well as those who \nare dedicating their lives to eradicating this disease.\n  I bring to your attention one of those who is committed to creating a \nworld without Alzheimer's. His name is Dr. Steven DeKosky and since \n1990, he has been an the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School \nof Medicine where among other things, he directs the Alzheimer's \nDisease Research Center funded by the National Institute on Aging. Dr. \nDeKosky's accomplishments are enormous as reflected in his curriculum \nvitae, which is some 36 pages long. If I tried to list all of his \nachievements it would fill dozens of pages of the Congressional Record. \nIn the interests of the taxpayers, I'll mention only a few of Dr. \nDeKosky's contributions.\n  As a renowned Alzheimer researcher, clinician and teacher, Dr. \nDeKosky is dedicated to finding answers to the Alzheimer's puzzle. To \nthis end, he is active in basic and clinical research. His basic \nresearch is on the structural and neurochemical changes in human brains \nwith dementia. His clinical research focuses on four key areas. One is \nto find ways of diagnosing the disease more effectively and \ndifferentiating it from other related diseases. A second area involves \nneuroimaging, which helps to confirm other diagnostic techniques, but \nalso opens ``windows'' to the brain to enable scientists to understand \nthe disease better. A third area of study, and one that is offering \nvery exciting possibilities for treatment, is the assessment of genetic \nrisk factors in Alzheimer's. Finally, he is involved in clinical trials \nto assess new medications for Alzheimer's disease.\n  Dr. DeKosky is active in the American Academy of Neurology and the \nAmerican Neurological Association. The latter organization honored him \nwith its ``Presidential Award'' in 1988. He is listed in ``The Best \nDoctors in America.'' He serves on the editorial boards of the \n``Archives of Neurology'' and the ``Alzheimer Disease and Associated \nDisorders: An International Journal.'' He also received a Teacher \nInvestigator Development Award from the National Institute of \nNeurological Disorders and Stroke.\n  Despite his involvement in dozens of research projects and other \nacademic pursuits, Dr. DeKosky contributes vast amounts of time as a \nvolunteer to the Alzheimer cause. He currently chairs the national \nAlzheimer's Association's Medical and Scientific Advisory Council and \nis a member of the board of the Alzheimer's Association. He chairs the \nProfessional Advisory Board of the Greater Pittsburgh Chapter of the \nAlzheimer's Association and was a founding member of the Lexington-Blue \nGrass Chapter of the Alzheimer's Association.\n  Dr. DeKosky has a special gift as a communicator of science. Whether \nin the classroom or speaking to groups of family members in the \ncommunity, Dr. DeKosky has a knack for making the complex seem simple. \nHe expresses the enthusiasm and hope created by scientific research in \nAlzheimer's, which is offering promise to Americans of all ages that \ntheir future may not be blighted by this dread disease. And, he has a \nsense of humor and a healthy dose of humility, which allows him to \n``connect'' to those to whom he speaks.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is important to acknowledge the unsung \nheroes who are working tirelessly in laboratories and in the clinic to \nmake our world less disease-prone. Dr. Steven DeKosky is one of those \nexemplary citizens who through his daily efforts is bringing about a \nbetter tomorrow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12022-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12022-S12023]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \ngreat concern about the Year 2000 computer problem, and to urge that \nfunding be approved on an emergency basis to address this problem.\n  Mr. President, in less than 500 days, an unknown number of computers \naround the world will fail because they can't tell the difference \nbetween the year 1900 and the year 2000. Although this may seem like a \nminor problem that could be easily fixed, it is not. It's time \nconsuming, difficult, and expensive to address. And the implications of \nfailure are enormous.\n  We have known about the Year 2000 problem for some time, Mr. \nPresident, but many have failed to appreciate its severity. Throughout \nthe private and public sectors, top officials assumed that someone else \nwould find a solution. Or they simply did not appreciate the importance \nof making this problem a priority.\n  Fortunately, Mr. President, many in the private sector are now taking \nthis threat seriously. One Federal Reserve official speculated that \nprivate sector spending on the problem could exceed $50 billion. While \nmany small businesses are just beginning to face the problem, most \nmajor large businesses are acting aggressively. Banks, utilities, \nhospitals, factories, insurance companies, and railroads are scrambling \nto ensure that they will be ready. Many understand that this truly is \nan emergency, and they're treating it that way.\n  Still, I am afraid that most Americans still do not appreciate the \nseverity of the Y2K problem. And I would urge all those listening to \neducate themselves about it. Admittedly, it is very difficult for most \nof us to evaluate the risks. But many credible experts have discussed \nscenarios that are truly alarming.\n  Consider, for example, the impact of the Y2K problem on public \nutilities. Senators Bennett and Dodd, the co-chairs of the Senate \nSpecial Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem, have held a \nhearing on this, and I commend both of them for their leadership. Their \nCommittee surveyed major utilities and found that many are far from \nready for the year 2000. The Committee's work raises very serious \nquestions about the risks of major power outages throughout our \ncountry, and the impact of such outages on our financial and \ntelecommunications systems. Indeed, the essential infrastructure of our \nnation could be at risk.\n  Largely because of such threats, some economists have argued that the \nYear 2000 problem is likely to lead to a severe recession. Some see a \nparallel to the downturn of the 1970's when oil supplies were \ndisrupted. In fact, quick and reliable computing may be even more \nimportant to our economy than oil was two decades ago. Without reliable \ncomputer information, as without oil, production and distribution \nsystems could break down. And that could dramatically increase \nunemployment, interest rates and inflation, all at the same time.\n  Now, Mr. President, I'm not saying that this is bound to happen. \nExperts disagree about the likelihood of major economic and social \ndislocations. However, even if the odds of a significant breakdown are \nmodest, the potential enormity of the problem demands that we take it \nseriously.\n  I do know from my own experience that software problems can be \nterribly serious and difficult to address. Before I came to public \nlife, I was an executive in a computer services firm, a firm that has \nbeen quite successful. I can tell you that nothing is more vexing than \na seemingly insignificant software glitch that grinds an entire program \nto a halt. Fixing such a glitch can require laborious, line-by-line \nexamination of impenetrable computer code. Meanwhile, everything is \noften brought to a standstill.\n  While analysts may disagree about the scope of the Y2K problem, Mr. \nPresident, it does seem clear that some things will go wrong on January \n1, 2000. We just can't say exactly which, or how many. Compounding \nmatters, even if one system has had its Y2K problems fixed, it still \ncan be corrupted by interacting with other systems that are flawed. We \nhave a systemic problem--and it will only be solved if all of us work \ntogether.\n  What is the government's role in all this? Well, our first \nresponsibility is to put our own house in order.\n\n[[Page S12023]]\n\n  As the General Accounting Office has reported, Y2K could have a \ndevastating impact on the provision of public services. These include \nair traffic control, Social Security and Medicare payments, supervision \nof the financial system, monitoring of nuclear facilities, and a wide \nvariety of other services. And let's not forget the Nation's defense. \nWe are all proud of our modern military with its smart weapons and \ncomputerized battlefields. But a technology-dependent military is \nsubject to the same computer hazards as everyone else.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, many agencies are way behind schedule \nin fixing the Y2K problem. According to GAO, ``unless agency progress \nimproves dramatically, a substantial number of mission-critical systems \nwill not be compliant in time.''\n  So, Mr. President, this is truly an emergency, and it's critical that \nwe act as soon as possible. Unlike many problems we face in the \nCongress, this one can't be delayed or postponed. We can't set up a \ncommission. We can't put it off until the next Congress. On January 1, \n2000, the problem will hit, whether we like it or not. And we have to \ndo everything we can to prepare.\n  Mr. President, let me commend my colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and throughout the Senate, for approving emergency funding \nto address the Y2K problem. I wish we had done so earlier. \nUnfortunately, there are many Members in the House of Representatives \nwho strongly oppose treating this funding as an emergency. And they \nhave created serious obstacles to allocating the funding. I urge them \nto reconsider their opposition, and am hopeful they will.\n  Beyond increasing funding, Mr. President, there are other steps that \nthe Federal government must consider to address the Y2K problem. For \nexample, we need to reform laws that discourage businesses from sharing \nrelevant information with each other. We need to ensure that businesses \naccurately report on their compliance efforts to the SEC and investors. \nWe need to support small businesses' efforts to fix their computers. I \nhave actively supported these types of legislative initiatives. But I \nrecognize that they are not sufficient. We also need to communicate \nbetter with our constituents about the problem, so that all Americans \ncan prepare.\n  Mr. President, given differing views on the actual risks, the only \nwise thing is to prepare for the worst. When a hurricane approaches, we \nnever know exactly where it will hit, or how destructive it will be. \nBut that doesn't stop us from evacuating and boarding up our homes in \nexpectation of the worst case scenario. Sometimes, those preparations \nprove unnecessary. And, if the hurricane does hit, there will also be \ncleanup costs later. But the better one prepares, the more efficient, \nand less expensive, the cleanup will be. And the same is true for Y2K.\n  So, Mr. President, I would strongly urge this Congress to focus \nserious attention on Y2K, and to strongly support all funding needed to \nsolve the problem. This is an emergency, and the time to act is now. We \nshouldn't panic. But we must prepare.

Mr. President, with more that 4 million Americans \nsuffering from Alzheimer's disease at a cost to our society of more \nthan $100 billion annually, it is time we take a moment to reflect on \nthe work of those who are dedicating their energies to helping do \nsomething about this terrible disease.\n  One of those people is Ellen Berliner. Ms. Berliner, who lives in \nPittsburgh, Pennsylvania, took care of her husband with Alzheimer's \ndisease for 13 years. For those of us who have not been a caregiver for \nan Alzheimer patient, it is difficult to comprehend what the experience \nis like. It has been described as the ``36 hour day'' or the ``endless \nfuneral'' because the demands are greater and more stressful than what \nmost of us can deal with in a normal 24 hour day, and the losses and \nemotional strain are enormous. Ms. Berliner, like so many other \nAmericans, stepped up to the challenge of caregiving and performed \ncourageously out of love for her husband and her family.\n  But, Ms. Berliner didn't stop there. Drawing on her pain and \nstruggles as a caregiver, she decided to do something to help others. \nIn 1988, she helped create the Greater Pittsburgh chapter of the \nAlzheimer's Association and became its founding Board President. In the \npast ten years, she has contributed more than 16,000 hours of volunteer \nservice to the chapter and to the families in the greater Pittsburgh \narea. She has developed support groups and services to help families. \nShe has been active in advocacy to help improve the policies that \naffect the lives of families and people suffering from Alzheimer's. \nAnd, she has stuffed envelopes and made phone calls to help raise the \nnecessary funds to support the work of this important charity.\n  Ms. Berliner has a long history of community service. In 1974 she co-\nfounded the Women's Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh. The \ncenter, which provides a safe haven for battered women, was one of the \nfirst in the nation. For her work with battered women and for other \ncommunity services, Ms. Berliner was nominated for the Jefferson Award \nof the American Institute for Public Service in 1992. In 1996, Ms. \nBerliner received the ``New Person Award'' given by the Thomas Merton \nCenter for People Over 70. The award is given in appreciation of \nlifelong works for peace and social justice.\n  Mr. President, I bring Ms. Berliner to the attention of this body \nbecause I believe we should shine a light on the good works of our \ncitizens, heroic work really, that is done without personal gain and \nwith no desire for public recognition. Our nation has grown strong \nbecause of people like Ellen Berliner who use their own time and \nresources to make life a little better for the rest of us.\n  So, I say ``thank you'' to Ms. Ellen Berliner for helping the people \nof Pittsburgh deal with the devastation caused by Alzheimer's disease, \nand for being a\n\n[[Page S12024]]\n\nrole model to her peers and to future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12023-3", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BIG SKY AIRLINES TWENTIETH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \nsmall business in my state, Big Sky Airlines, on their 20th \nAnniversary.\n  Big Sky Airlines commenced scheduled passenger service on September \n11, 1978. The initial flight flew from Billings to Helena with \ncontinuing service to Kalispell. The aircraft was a Hadley-Paige \nJetstream with a seating capacity of 19.\n  Today, Big Sky operates a fleet of six nineteen-passenger Metro III \naircraft, with service to 12 cities in Montana and Spokane, Washington. \nThe company operates out of its hub in Billings and provides connecting \nopportunities from Eastern and Central Montana to it's markets in the \nwest. The Montana cities are Glasgow, Glendive, Miles City, Wolf Point \nand Sidney in the east. Havre and Lewistown in central Montana and \nGreat Falls, Helena, Missoula, Kalispell and Spokane in the west. All \nof the eastern and central Montana service is operated under the \nEssential Air Service subsidy contract with the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Big Sky Airlines has been through a lot in their 20 years of \nproviding service in Montana. They've had their good times and bad. \nHowever, through it all they continued to provide service to remote \nareas that would have been further isolated from the Nation's economic \ncenters without them. The Essential Air Service program is critical to \nthese communities. Without this service, these communities would be \nseriously hampered in their efforts to attract new business or even to \nretain those they now have, resulting in further strain on local \neconomies and loss of jobs.\n  In my visits to the state, I frequently fly on Big Sky Airlines. In \nour state, to many cities, it's the ONLY way to fly. I've had lots of \nexperiences, I could tell you about. However, I'd rather talk about the \nmany families I've seen reunited as the Big Sky plane lands in those \nrural communities.\n  I'd like to congratulate the Board of Big Sky Airlines and their \nchairman, Jon Marchi for their foresight and perseverance. I'd also \nlike to congratulate the officers of the company: Kim Champney, the \nPresident and CEO, and Craig Denney, the Executive Vice President and \nChief Operating officer. Kim has only been there a short time, but is \nmoving the company in exciting new directions. I've personally seen \nCraig load the luggage, check in the passengers and send the airplane \non it's way. He knows how to do every job in the company and do it \nwell.\n  I'd also like to congratulate John Rabenberg and the other members of \nthe Essential Air Service task force for the hard work they do in their \ncommunities for this program.\n  Big Sky Airlines currently employs 103 people throughout its system \n(all in Montana). And you can tell it's a good company to work for. \nWhether you are checking in at the counter, or watching the pilots get \nready to take-off, they are very customer service oriented. It's a \npleasure to fly with them, and Mr. President, it's a pleasure for me \ntoday to congratulate them on their 20th Anniversary and to wish them \nmany more years of flying the big sky of Montana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12024-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12024]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DOMESTIC VIOLENCE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to raise awareness of a \nstartlingly common problem occurring every 15 seconds across our \nnation--and that is the issue of domestic violence. October is Domestic \nViolence Awareness Month, and I would like to take this opportunity to \ndiscuss the devastating impact of domestic violence on individuals, \nfamilies and our communities.\n  Few people want to tell the dark secrets of their family. Though many \nkeep incidents of domestic violence secret, it is a sad part of our \nnational landscape. Through the efforts of medical researchers, law \nenforcement officers, advocates, and victims, more attention is now \nbeing paid. In the last two years alone, according to the National \nLibrary of Medicine, approximately 500 articles have been written on \ndomestic violence in prominent journals and periodicals.\n  Despite these efforts, many remain uncomfortable talking about \ndomestic violence. According to the Department of Justice Violence \nAgainst Women Office, domestic violence is a crime that is frequently \nunderreported to law enforcement authorities. Victims often live in \nfear and do not share their troubled secrets. They fear threats, \nadditional violence and more pain.\n  The U.S. Department of Justice estimates that 3 to 4 million women \nare battered each year by their husbands or boyfriends. Data published \nby the Commonwealth Fund shows that women are more often the victims of \ndomestic violence than victims of burglary, muggings or other physical \ncrimes combined. The National Crime Victimization Survey indicates that \nfrom 1991 to 1996, approximately half of female victims of domestic \nviolence were physically injured.\n  Unfortunately, only one in five of those injured victims sought \ntreatment at a medical facility. As a physician, I know that our health \ncare delivery systems can be critical links in identifying cases of \ndomestic violence. In a 1990 study published in the Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association, 22 to 35% of women treated in emergency \nrooms were there for injuries related to ongoing abuse. Health care \nproviders can have a significant impact in identifying such cases, and \nwe must give them the tools to help us address the problem.\n  Another sad truth is that domestic violence crosses all racial, \ngender, age and economic boundaries. Children, men and the elderly are \nalso victims. Child abuse is 15 times more likely to occur in families \nwhere domestic violence is present. In the late 1980's, reports of \nelder abuse increased by almost 20% nationally. With these staggering \nnumbers before us, it is apparent that domestic violence necessitates a \ncoordinated community response with partners at the local, state and \nfederal levels.\n  That's why I am particularly heartened by efforts in Tennessee to \naddress the issue. The Tennessee Task Force Against Domestic Violence \nis dedicated to ending violence in the lives of women and children \nthrough their network of coalitions and shelters. The Task Force has \npartnered with the Tennessee Medical Association to educate health care \nproviders. They also work closely with law enforcement authorities. My \nhome town of Nashville, for example, has the largest domestic violence \ndivision of any police department in the country. Working together with \nthe Task Force, the city's police department has seen an increase in \nthe number of calls from victims who now have more confidence in the \nsystem. Knoxville, Chattanooga and Memphis have similar efforts \nunderway. I am proud of my fellow Tennesseans for the example they are \nsetting and the models they are creating. They are sending a clear \nmessage that domestic violence is wrong and has no place in our \nsociety.\n  We are working to send a similar message at the federal level. I have \nauthored three bills which contain provisions to address domestic \nviolence. S. 1754, the ``Health Professions Education Partnerships Act \nof 1998,'' passed the Senate by unanimous consent in July. Among other \nthings, it requests that the Institute of Medicine examine and make \nrecommendations regarding the training needs of health professionals \nwith respect to detection and referral of victims. In S. 1722, the \n``Women's Health Research and Prevention Amendments of 1998,'' and in \nS. 2330, the ``Patients' Bill of Rights,'' we authorize federal funding \nfor community programs on domestic violence through the Family Violence \nPrevention and Services Act. I have recently joined my colleagues \nSenators Domenici and Stevens to cosponsor S. 2395, the ``Prescription \nfor Abuse Act,'' which will help health care providers to identify, \naddress and prevent domestic violence.\n  Domestic violence warrants our full and responsive consideration. I \nurge my colleagues to take time during October--Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month--to determine what more we can do to address this \nchallenge. Together we can send a clear message that domestic violence \nmust continue to be addressed comprehensively, creatively, and \ncompassionately.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12024-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12025-S12026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S12025]]\n                     SAFE AND SOUND COMMUNITIES ACT\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise to outline my proposal for \nreducing juvenile crime--the ``Safe and Sound Communities Act,'' which \nI will make available as a discussion draft today. In the past few \nyears, we have begun to make real advances in fighting juvenile crime. \nAnd in cities across the country, juvenile crime has started to fall. \nFor example, after Boston implemented a city-wide anti-crime plan, the \nnumber of juveniles murdered declined 80 percent, and in more than two \nyears not a single child was killed by a gun. Not one child. And in \nthree ``Weed & Seed'' neighborhoods in Milwaukee, violent felonies \ndropped 46 percent, gun crimes fell 46 percent, and crime overall was \ndown 21 percent. Now we need to build on what works, in order to \nprotect our children and to make our communities ``safe and sound.'' \nThis measure will be an important step in the right direction.\n  Indeed, we do not have to reinvent the wheel to reduce juvenile \ncrime. The lesson from Boston, Milwaukee and other cities is clear. \nThere is no one magic solution. But a number of steps, taken together, \ncan and will make a difference: put dangerous criminals behind bars; \nkeep guns out of the hands of juveniles; and give children after-school \nalternatives to gangs and drugs. That's what works in Boston and \nMilwaukee and the rest of America. And that's what this proposal is all \nabout. It builds on each of these three basic strategies and expands \nthem to more cities and more rural communities across the nation. Let \nme explain.\n\n\n                  Put Dangerous Criminals Behind Bars\n\n  First, this proposal makes it easier to lock up dangerous juveniles. \nWe can't even begin to stop violent kids unless we have police officers \non the street to catch them, and state and local prosecutors to try \nthem. So this measure extends the highly successful COPS program, which \nis due to expire in two years, through the year 2003. And it provides \n$100 million per year for state and local prosecutors to go after \njuvenile criminals.\n  Of course, we can't keep criminals off the streets unless we have a \nplace to send them. Unfortunately, although we provide states with \nhundreds of millions of dollars each year to build new prisons, most \nstates use all of these funds for adult prisons only. So this measure \nrequires states to set aside 10 percent of federal prison funding to \njuvenile prisons or alternative placements of delinquent children. This \ncommitment is consistent with the Senate-passed 1994 crime bill, which \nset the stage for spending billions of dollars on prisons through the \n1994 Crime Act.\n  This proposal also helps rural communities keep dangerous kids behind \nbars. Now, although the closest juvenile facility may be hundreds of \nmiles away, federal law prohibits rural police from locking up \njuveniles in adult jails for more than 24 hours. This means that state \nlaw enforcement officials either have to waste the time and resources \nto criss-cross the state even for initial court appearances, or simply \nlet dangerous teens go free. In my view, that's a no-win situation. \nThis measure gives rural police the flexibility they need by letting \nthem detain juveniles in adult jails for up to 72 hours.\n  And this measure will help lock up violent gun-toting kids--and the \npeople who illegally supply them with weapons. It builds on my 1994 \nYouth Handgun Safety Act by turning illegal possession of a handgun by \na minor into a felony. And the same goes for anyone who illegally sells \nhandguns to kids. Kids and handguns don't mix, and our law needs to \nmake clear that this is a serious crime.\n\n\n                 Keep Guns Out of the Hands of Children\n\n  Second, this proposal will help keep firearms out of the hands of \nyoung people. It promotes gun safety by requiring the sale of child \nsafety locks with every new handgun. Child safety locks can help save \nmany of the 500 children and teenagers killed each year in firearms \naccidents, and the 1,500 kids each year who use guns to commit suicide. \nJust as importantly, they can help prevent some of the 7,000 violent \njuvenile crimes committed every year with guns children took from their \nown homes.\n  It also helps identify who is supplying kids with guns, so we can put \nthem out of business and behind bars. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms has been working closely with cities like Milwaukee and \nBoston to trace guns used by young people back to the source. Using \nATF's national database, police and prosecutors can target illegal \nsuppliers of firearms and help stop the flow of firearms into our \ncommunities. This measure will expand the program to other cities and, \nwith the increased penalties outlined above, it will help cut down \nillegal gun trafficking.\n  In addition, this measure closes a loophole that allows violent young \noffenders to buy guns legally when they turn 18. Under current law, \nviolent adult offenders can't buy firearms, but violent juveniles can--\neven the kids convicted of the schoolyard killings in Jonesboro, \nArkansas--at least once they are released at age 18. This has to stop. \nSo this measure declares that all violent felons are disqualified from \nbuying firearms, regardless of whether they were 14 or 24, or a day \nshort of their 18th or 28th birthday, at the time of their offense.\n\n\n   Crime Prevention and After-School Alternatives to Gangs and Drugs\n\n  Third, a balanced approach also requires a significant investment in \ncrime prevention, so we can stop crime before it's too late. Even law \nenforcement officials agree that we need a bigger investment in \nprevention. For example, more than 400 police chiefs, sheriffs and \nprosecutors nationwide have endorsed a call for after-school programs \nfor all children. And in my home state of Wisconsin, 90 percent of \npolice chiefs and sheriffs surveyed agreed that we need to increase \nfederal prevention spending.\n  This proposal promotes prevention by concentrating funding in \nprograms that already have a record of success, like Weed & Seed, and \nthose that rely on proven strategies, like programs that give children \na safe place to go in the after-school hours between 3 and 8 p.m., when \njuvenile crime peaks.\n  For example, it expands the Weed & Seed program, a Republican program \nwhich combines aggressive enforcement and safe havens for at-risk kids. \nThe measure also gives more schools the resources necessary to stay \nopen after school, through expansion of the 21st Century Learning \nCenter program. It promotes innovative locally-tailored prevention \ninitiatives by reauthorizing and expanding the Title V At-Risk Children \nChallenge Grant program, which I authored. It builds on our support for \nthe valuable work of Boys & Girls Clubs, by extending that program and \nexpanding it to support other successful organizations like the YMCA. \nAnd it requires that at least 20 percent of the new juvenile crime \nfunds--namely the recently-initiated $500 million juvenile \naccountability block grant--be dedicated to prevention.\n  Of course, we shouldn't blindly invest in prevention programs, just \nbecause they sound good. Quality, not quantity, matters. That's why my \nmeasure cuts $1.6 billion in prevention programs authorized by the \nCrime Act--so we don't waste money on redundant programs which don't \nhave records of success or bipartisan support. And that's why my \nmeasure requires five to ten percent of all prevention funds to be set \naside for rigorous evaluations--so we can keep funding the programs \nthat work, and eliminate the programs that don't. We also reward cities \nthat adopt comprehensive anti-juvenile crime strategies, like Boston's \nand Milwaukee's--so prevention is part of a balanced, coordinated \noverall plan.\n  This combination of tough enforcement, reducing youth access to guns, \nand effective prevention will help stem juvenile crime. In addition, \nseveral other necessary reforms in this proposal will make a \ndifference. It strongly encourages states to share the records of \nviolent juvenile offenders, and provides the funding necessary for \nimproved record-keeping. The fact is that law enforcement officials \nneed full disclosure in order to make informed judgments about how to \ntreat--and whether to incarcerate--a child.\n  The measure also addresses the dangerous problem of school violence. \nIt increases school security by encouraging states to use COPS funding \nto place police officers on school grounds. It encourages the \ndevelopment of initiatives to prevent school violence. And because \nunderstanding the problem is essential to any comprehensive solution,\n\n[[Page S12026]]\n\nit requires better reporting of firearms-related incidents in public \nschools. Unfortunately, many states do not report guns seized on school \ngrounds.\n  Mr. President, the question about how to reduce juvenile crime is no \nlonger a mystery. We have a good idea about what works. The real \nquestion is this: When will we act? As the chances for a juvenile crime \nbill this year look increasingly slim, I recommend this framework as a \ngood starting point for next year. Let's build on what works so we can \nmake our communities safer and sounder places to live. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a summary of this proposal be printed in the Record.\n  The summary follows:\n\n       Summary of Sen. Herb Kohl's Safe and Sound Communities Act\n\n\n Title I: Increased Placement of Juveniles in Appropriate Correctional \n                               Facilities\n\n       States must dedicate 10 percent of all prison funding from \n     the 1994 Crime Act to juvenile facilities or alternative \n     placements for delinquent juveniles. Expands ability to \n     detain juveniles temporarily in rural adult jails by \n     permitting detention for up to 72 hours and ending \n     requirement of separate staff to oversee juveniles and \n     adults.\n\n\n              Title II: Reducing Youth Access to Firearms\n\n       Limits access of juveniles and juvenile offenders to \n     firearms. Requires the sale of child safety locks with all \n     handguns. Expands Department of the Treasury's youth crime \n     gun tracing program to identify more illegal gun traffickers \n     who are supplying guns to children. Increases jail time for \n     individuals who transfer handguns to juveniles and for \n     juveniles who illegally possess handguns. Prohibits the sale \n     of firearms to violent juvenile offenders after they become \n     eighteen years old.\n\n\n            Title III: Consolidation of Prevention Programs\n\n       Repeals over $1.6 billion in authorized prevention programs \n     from the 1994 Crime Act. Expands Weed & Seed to $200 million \n     per year (from $33.5 million in 1998), the Title V At-Risk \n     Children Challenge Grants to $200 million per year (from $20 \n     million), and the 21st Century Learning Centers to $200 \n     million per year (from $40 million), and extends Boys & Girls \n     Club funding for five more years, increasing funding to $75 \n     million per year (from $20 million) and expanding the program \n     to support other successful community organizations like the \n     YMCA. Consolidates several gang prevention programs into one \n     $25 million program. Rewards cities that adopt a \n     comprehensive anti-juvenile crime strategy based on the \n     Boston model. Sets aside five to ten percent of prevention \n     funding for evaluation, implementing the proposal of the DOJ-\n     sponsored University of Maryland report.\n\n\n    Title IV: Juvenile Crime Control and Accountability Block Grant\n\n       Promotes funding for prosecutors, improved-record keeping, \n     juvenile prisons, and prevention through $500 million block \n     grant. Qualifying states must trace all firearms recovered \n     from individuals under age 21 to identify illegal firearm \n     traffickers, and must share criminal records of all juvenile \n     violent offenders with other jurisdictions. $100 million of \n     this grant program must be dedicated to both prevention and \n     to hiring more prosecutors.\n\n\n                  Title V--School Violence Prevention\n\n       Expands role of police officers on school campuses through \n     COPS program. Encourages better reporting of incidents of \n     firearms violence in schools, including gun tracing to \n     identify suppliers of firearms recovered on school property. \n     Complements expansion of school violence prevention programs \n     in Title IV block grant.\n\n\n       Title VI--Extension of COPS and Juvenile Justice programs\n\n       Extends program to hire new community police officers. \n     Reauthorizes Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency \n     Prevention.\n\n\n       Title VII--Extension of Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund\n\n       Extends trust fund established by 1994 Crime Act to pay for \n     anti-crime programs with savings from reduction of federal \n     workforce.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12025-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE RUTH AND MAX ALPERIAN SCHECHTER DAY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. CHAFEE.

Today, its classrooms are filled with \nover 230 students, and it is one of the fastest growing Jewish \ninstitutions in Rhode Island.\n  The Ruth and Max Alperian Schechter Day School is a state accredited, \negalitarian, conservative Jewish Day School serving children from \nkindergarten through grade eight. In addition to having a fine \nreputation for providing its students with a well-rounded education, \nthe Alperian Schechter Day School also focuses on academic growth, \nethical values, and Jewish identity. Its academic programs are both \nrich and challenging in general and Judaic studies.\n  Recognizing that a partnership with parents is essential to the \neducation of our youngsters, the Alperian Schechter Day School \ncontinues to promote open communication with families. As a community \nof learners, the entire school body works together to create a \ncommunity of successful, well-rounded members while encouraging \ncontinued learning and increased participation in school activities.\n  In fact, students from the Alperian Schechter Day School continue to \nbuild on their education, even after graduating. As academic advisors \nwork with families and students to ensure future success, Alperian \nSchechter Day School graduates have gone on to attend a variety of \ncolleges and universities including, Yale University, Harvard \nUniversity, University of Rhode Island, Georgetown University, Rhode \nIsland School of Design, and many, many other fine institutions of \nhigher learning. In addition, students have had the opportunity to \nserve as interns in our nation's capital, build houses with Habitat for \nHumanity, and work with disabled children.\n  In closing, I want to congratulate the Ruth and Max Alperian \nSchechter Day School on its 20th Anniversary and hope for its continued \nsuccess in providing academic excellence to our youngsters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12026-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DETROIT ATHLETIC CLUB HONORS CHUCK DAVEY\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Mr. Charles Chuck'' \nDavey on the occasion of the Detroit Athletic Club's Fall Boxing \nClassic.\n  This year's honoree began his impressive boxing career while at \nMichigan State University. Remarkably, Chuck won his first NCAA \nChampionship at age 17, a collegiate record, and was the NCAA's only \nfour time boxing champion in four different weight classes. He also \nserved as Captain and was recognized as an Outstanding Boxer from 1947-\n1949. Deservedly, he is viewed to be the greatest collegiate boxer of \nall time.''\n  He was a member of the 1948 Olympic Team and is one of the finest \nprofessional boxers ever to come out of Detroit. From October 1949 to \nJanuary of 1953, Chuck went through 39 bouts without a loss, scoring 25 \nkayos, taking 12 decisions and participating in two draws.\n  When Chuck turned professional as a welterweight, Davey defeated \nchampions Rocky Graziano, Johnny Saxton, Carmen Bassilio and Ike \nWilliams. At Chicago stadium in 1953, before the largest ever paid \nindoor attendance in boxing history, Davey fought world champion Kid'' \nGavilan. Chuck proved to be a true sports hero.\n  Since retiring from boxing in 1955, he was a color broadcaster on \nWCAR with Bruce Martin for MSU football games. He also served as \nMichigan's Boxing Commissioner from 1965 to 1980 and was one of the \nfounders and the first President of the United States Boxing \nAssociation. In addition, he served four terms as Vice President of the \nWorld Boxing Association.\n  For his lifetime of accomplishments in the sport of boxing, he was \nelected to the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 1980 and just this year \nwas elected to the World Boxing Hall of Fame.\n  Throughout his life, Chuck has been a dedicated family man and \ngrandfather. He is married to Patricia and they are the proud parents \nof nine children and enjoy nineteen grandchildren.\n  I want to express my congratulations to Chuck Davey for his \nimpressive achievements both inside and outside of the ring. He is \ntruly an inspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12026-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12026-S12027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 POMC 8TH ANNUAL LOVE FOR LIFE BENEFIT\n\n   Mr. ABRAHAM.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Reform Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 202. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 \n     embodied a visionary concept--that a portion of the proceeds \n     from Outer Continental Shelf mineral leasing revenues and the \n     depletion of a nonrenewable natural resource should result in \n     a legacy of public places accessible for public recreation \n     and benefit from resources belonging to all people, of \n     all generations, and the enhancement of the most precious \n     and most renewable natural resource of any nation, healthy \n     and active citizens.\n       (2) The States and local governments were to occupy a \n     pivotal role in accomplishing the purposes of the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 and the Act originally \n     provided an equitable portion of funds to the States, and \n     through them, to local governments.\n       (3) However, because of competition for limited Federal \n     moneys and the need for an annual appropriation, this \n     original intention has been abandoned and, in recent years, \n     the States have not received an equitable proportion of \n     funds.\n       (4) Nonetheless, with population growth and urban sprawl, \n     the demand for recreation and conservation areas, at the \n     State and local level, including urban localities, remains a \n     high priority for our citizens.\n       (5) In addition to the demand at the State and local level, \n     there has been an increasing unmet need for Federal moneys to \n     be made available for Federal purposes, with lands identified \n     as important for Federal acquisition not being acquired for \n     several years due to insufficient funds.\n       (6) A new vision is called for--a vision that encompasses a \n     multilevel national network of parks, recreation and \n     conservation areas that reaches across the country to touch \n     all communities. National parks are not enough; the federal \n     government alone cannot accomplish this. A national vision, \n     backed by realistic national funding support, to stimulate \n     State, local and private sector, as well as Federal efforts, \n     is the only way to effectively address our ongoing outdoor \n     recreation and conservation needs.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this title is to provide a \n     secure source of funds available for Federal purposes \n     authorized by the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of \n     1965 and to revitalize and complement State, local and \n     private commitments envisioned in the Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund Act of 1965 and the Urban Park and \n     Recreation Recovery Act of 1978 by providing grants for \n     State, local and urban recreation and conservation needs.\n\n     SEC. 203.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds and declares that--\n       (1) a diverse array of species of fish and wildlife is of \n     significant value to the Nation for many reasons: aesthetic, \n     ecological, educational, cultural, recreational, economic, \n     and scientific;\n       (2) it should be the objective of the United States to \n     retain for present and future generations the opportunity to \n     observe, understand, and appreciate a wide variety of \n     wildlife;\n       (3) millions of citizens participate in outdoor recreation \n     through hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, all of \n     which have significant value to the citizens who engage in \n     these activities;\n       (4) providing sufficient and properly maintained wildlife \n     associated recreational opportunities is important to \n     enhancing public appreciation of a diversity of wildlife and \n     the habitats upon which they depend;\n       (5) lands and waters which contain species classified \n     neither as game nor identified as endangered or threatened \n     also can provide opportunities for wildlife associated \n     recreation and education such as hunting and fishing \n     permitted by applicable State or Federal law;\n       (6) hunters and anglers have for more than 60 years \n     willingly paid user fees in the form of Federal excise taxes \n     on hunting and fishing equipment to support wildlife \n     diversity and abundance, through enactment of the Federal Aid \n     in Wildlife Restoration Act (commonly referred to as the \n     Pittman-Robertson Act) and the Federal Aid in Sport Fish \n     Restoration Act (commonly referred to as the Dingell-Johnson/\n     Wallop-Breaux Act);\n       (7) State programs, adequately funded to conserve a broader \n     array of wildlife in an individual State and conducted in \n     coordination with Federal, State, tribal, and private \n     landowners and interested organizations, would continue to \n     serve as a vital link in a nationwide effort to restore game \n     and nongame wildlife, and the essential elements of such \n     programs should include conservation measures which manage \n     for a diverse variety of populations of wildlife; and\n       (8) It is proper for Congress to bolster and extend this \n     highly successful program to aid game and nongame wildlife in \n     supporting the health and diversity of habitat, as well as \n     providing funds for conservation education.\n\n     SEC. 303. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this title are--\n       (1) to extend financial and technical assistance to the \n     States under the Federal Aid to Wildlife Restoration Act for \n     the benefit of a diverse array of wildlife and associated \n     habitats, including species that are not hunted or fished, to \n     fulfill unmet needs of wildlife within the States while \n     recognizing the mandate of the States to conserve all \n     wildlife;\n       (2) to assure sound conservation policies through the \n     development, revision and implementation of wildlife \n     associated recreation and wildlife associated education and \n     wildlife conservation law enforcement;\n       (3) to encourage State fish and wildlife agencies to create \n     partnerships between the Federal Government, other State \n     agencies, wildlife conservation organizations, and outdoor \n     recreation and conservation interests through cooperative \n     planning and implementation of this title; and\n       (4) to encourage State fish and wildlife agencies to \n     provide for public involvement in the process of development \n     and implementation of a wildlife conservation and restoration \n     program.\n\n     SEC. 304.

Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (H.R. 1853) to amend the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational and Applied Technology Education Act, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The report will be stated.\n  The clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     1853), have agreed to recommend and do recommend to their \n     respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of October 8, 1998.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I will make a few comments on the \nvocational education bill at this time.\n  Today we are considering the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins \nVocational and Applied Technology Education Act.\n  This is one of the most important proposals we will consider in the \n105th Congress. In July, we passed the Workforce Investment Act. The \nreauthorization of vocational education is an important partner to the \nWorkforce Investment Act.\n  There are presently between 200,000 and 300,000 unfilled positions in \nthe technology field. The reason for the difficulty in filling these \npositions is not because of low unemployment numbers, but because of \nthe lack of skilled workers. Many of these jobs do not require four \nyears and plus of postsecondary education. They do require an excellent \nvocational education system and the ability to pursue further technical \neducation following high school education.\n\n[[Page S12035]]\n\n  One of the most fascinating facts to come out of the Senate Labor \nCommittee's hearings on vocational education, was that Malaysia has \nreplicated our Tech Prep model. Tech Prep was created in this country \nand we have many model Tech Prep programs, but not as many as we should \nhave. Malaysia realized Tech Prep was a key answer to improving their \nskilled workforce and they have put the resources behind it to make it \nvery successful.\n  The 1998 vocational education reauthorization strengthens the Tech \nPrep program by emphasizing the importance of the business community as \na partner with the education sector.\n  The United States is the most productive country in the world, but we \nare losing our edge to other industrialized nations such as Japan and \nGermany as well as other rapidly developing countries such as Taiwan, \nKorea, and China.\n  Over the past 25 years, the standard of living for those Americans \nwithout at least a four year postsecondary degree has plunged. In the \nnext decade, we are in danger of being surpassed as the world's \nforemost economic power if we don't begin to redefine our priorities at \nthe national, state, and local levels.\n  Our international competitors have been leaders in making the \nimportant connection between education and work.\n  Last year, a report released by the National Center for Research in \nVocational Education, a report which I requested as part of the 1990 \nvocational education reauthorization, highlighted the importance of a \ncohesive partnership between educators and employers. Employers are \nactive participants in the governance of work-related education and \ntraining in Australia, Great Britain, France, and Germany.\n  Another significant finding of the report was that European nations, \nsuch as the Netherlands and Denmark, are attempting to develop a \ntechnical education system that can serve as either a bridge to \nadditional vocational training or pursuing college level courses.\n  This reauthorization package emphasizes the important balance between \na strong academic background and a vocational and technical education \nsystem that reflects today's global economy.\n  The 1998 reauthorization also requires the states and local \ncommunities to set-up an accountability system which will give us a \nvisual picture of how states and local communities are implementing \nvocational and technical education programs. Most importantly, how \nthese programs are impacting vocational and technical education \nstudents.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues on the Senate Labor Committee and \nthe staff, especially the Congressional Research Staff and the \nlegislative counsel staff who have all put in countless hours on this \nbill which is an excellent foundation for the 21st century workforce.\n  I thank my colleagues on the Senate Labor Committee and the staff, \nespecially the Congressional Research staff and the legislative counsel \nstaff who all put in countless hours on this bill which is an excellent \nfoundation for the 21st century workforce. I also commend the members \nof my committee, certainly, but also the Members of the House. We are \nbringing this to a close just at the end of the session. For a long \nperiod of time, it looked like we would not be here, but we are. I \nthank Chairman Goodling, in particular, and Congressman Buck McKeon for \ntheir tremendous help in bringing this to fruition.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this reauthorization \nof the Vocational Education Act, the Carl Perkins Vocational and \nApplied Technology Education Amendments of 1998. This bill, along with \nthe Workforce Investment Act passed earlier this year, are important \nsteps to improve the quality of the nation's workforce. Well-educated \nand well-trained workers are essential for the nation's future. As \nstudents prepare to enter the workforce, they should have a variety of \nchoices, and this bill gives it to them.\n  It encourages more effective integration of academic skills and job \nskills. It helps school districts form partnerships with community \ncolleges, area technical schools, and businesses of all sizes to \ncombine quality academic instruction with real-world work experiences. \nThese partnerships will provide internships, apprenticeships, and \npractical job experience that will teach students about many difficult \naspects of the world of work.\n  It also encourages schools to use state-of-the-art techniques and \nequipment in teaching, so that students are offered challenging \ncourses, and so that graduates can continue their education or enter \nthe workforce better prepared for good careers.\n  States are also guaranteed a greater flexibility in providing funds \nto local schools to improve their vocational and technical education \nprograms.\n  The Perkins Act has had a highly positive effect on the quality of \nvocational education across the nation. Its goal is to encourage \ninnovation and ensure fairer opportunities for all students--especially \nthose who have historically been denied access to high-level careers, \nand have suffered the most from the inequities in the job market.\n  The bill also recognizes the importance of preparing students and \ntrainees for non-traditional employment. Supporting these underserved \npopulations is increasingly important if we are to meet the demands of \nthe 21st Century economy.\n  Finally, this legislation retains our commitment to the important \nrole of gender equity in vocational education. Gender equity issues \nmust continue to be part of every state's priority. Every student \nshould be convinced that good careers are not out of reach because of \nsuch discrimination. Vocational education must expand opportunities, \nnot restrict them.\n  Overall, this legislation enables the nation to move forward in all \nof these important ways. I urge the Senate to support it, and I'm \nconfident it will be effective in bringing us closer to the goals we \nshare for vocational education in the years ahead.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that all time be yielded back \non the conference report to accompany H.R. 1853, the vocational \neducation bill. I further ask that the conference report be agreed to, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to the conference report appear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The conference report was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12034-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12035-S12036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REDESIGNATING THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL POLICE HEADQUARTERS BUILDING \n            THE ``ENEY, CHESTNUT, GIBSON MEMORIAL BUILDING''\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4558, just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4558) to make technical amendments to clarify \n     the provision of benefits for noncitizens, and to improve the \n     provision of unemployment insurance, child support, and \n     supplemental security income benefits.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the bill now before the Senate contains \nseven technical amendments. Although each provision may seem minor, \nevery one serves a larger, more important purpose. Also, as I will \ndescribe, the legislation is time sensitive, which is why the Senate is \nconsidering this bill in an expedited manner. Let me also note that the \nbill has bipartisan support and passed the House on a voice vote on \nSeptember 23rd. Also, the small cost of the bill is fully paid for.\n  The first provision would ensure that every elderly or disabled \nnoncitizen dependent on SSI and Medicaid benefits when welfare reform \nwas enacted in August 1996 will remain eligible. The Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997 grandfathered most legal aliens receiving SSI. However, at \nthat time, a small number--about 22,000--received only a temporary \nextension, until September 30, 1998, pending a study of their legal \nstatus. That issue has been largely resolved, and this provision would \ncomplete the work of BBA.\n  The bill also makes a number of common sense changes that encourage \nwork and personal responsibility in several programs under the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  Finally, I would like to highlight an important humanitarian \nprovision in this legislation. Many members are undoubtedly aware of \nthe Make-A-Wish Foundation and similar organizations that help fulfill \nthe dreams of children with life-threatening or terminal illnesses. For \nexample, the child with cancer who gets a trip to Disney World. Yet, a \nsick child could lose SSI and Medicaid benefits if the cash value of \ntheir ``wish'' exceed current law income limits. This bill would fix \nthat problem.\n  I urge the support of all Members of this legislation.\n  Mr JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent the bill be considered read the \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4558) was deemed read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12036-2", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12036-S12043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CRIME IDENTIFICATION TECHNOLOGY ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, final passage of this bill--S. 2022, \ncomprising the Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998 and the \nNational Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act of 1998--is \ntruly a historic achievement. I want to thank my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, and in both Houses of Congress, for their hard work \non this legislation. S. 2022 is based on the principle that technology \nis the future of police work. It is the number one edge our law \nenforcement officers are going to have in the struggle against \ncriminals, well into the 21st century.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act (CETA) authorizes $1.25 \nbillion over the next five years in grants administered by the Office \nof Justice Programs (OJP) in the Department of Justice, with reliance \nupon the expertise of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), also in \nthe Department of Justice, to help every state to establish or upgrade \nits use of information and identification and forensics technologies \nacross the entire criminal justice system. Title II of the Act, the \nNational Criminal History Access and Child Protection Act, establishes \nan Interstate Compact which binds the Federal Bureau of Investigation \nand, upon approval by the state legislatures, the states to participate \nin the non-criminal justice access program of the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III) in accordance with the Compact and \nestablished system policies.\n  I would like, first, to address Title I of this legislation.\n\n\n             National Criminal History Improvement Program\n\n  In a certain sense, Title I of the Act, The Crime Identification \nTechnology Act, replaces the National Criminal History Improvement \nProgram (NCHIP) which expired at the end of fiscal year 1998. NCHIP \nmonies, totaling almost 200 million dollars, were provided to the \nstates by BJS and the Department of Justice and have been enormously \nsuccessful in helping states to enhance their automated criminal \nhistory records and to identify and develop other relevant information \nsystems for instantaneous firearms eligibility determinations. Because \nmore needs to be done and because it is important not to lose momentum \nin building a fast, comprehensive and reliable National Instant Check \nSystem for firearms eligibility, S. 2022 will permit the federal \ngovernment and the states to continue to build upon this important \nwork.\n\n\n                          Systems Integration\n\n  S. 2022, however, does much more. In particular, Title I provides for \nsystems integration, permitting all components of criminal justice (law \nenforcement, courts, correction and prosecution) to share information \nand communicate more effectively and on a real-time basis. \nRevolutionary improvements in information and identification and \ncommunications technologies have created opportunities and, indeed, \nresponsibilities, for all of our nation's criminal justice agencies to \nbuild integrated information and identification systems. This bill will \nprovide leadership and, in partnership with state and local \ngovernments, the resources necessary to build these important systems. \nS. 2022 will also support the courts and their use of information and \nidentification technology. The courts are a critical part of the \ncriminal justice information system. Not only are the courts a supplier \nof information on disposition, they are also an all-important consumer \nof information on arrest and conviction. The courts require state-of-\nthe-art, integrated information identification systems for both \nfunctions. Until now, the courts have lagged behind in their use of \ntechnology--and this bill will help them to catch up.\n\n\n                    Interstate Identification Index\n\n  S. 2022 addresses virtually every technology-based, information \nidentification and forensics need of state and local criminal justice \nagencies. Title I of S. 2022, for example, will support participation \nby all states in the Interstate Identification Index, which is the \ndecentralized federal system that permits state, local and federal \ncriminal justice agencies to exchange arrest and\n\n[[Page S12041]]\n\nconviction information on a reliable, national and real-time basis.\n\n\n                          IAFIS and NCIC 2000\n\n  S. 2022 will also help state and local agencies to take advantage of \ntwo important FBI initiatives which are nearing completion. The FBI's \nIntegrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) and the \nFBI's NCIC 2000 (National Criminal Information Center) will create a \nplatform for the FBI to use state-of-the-art identification and \ninformation and technology, both internally and to communicate with \nstate and local agencies. Obviously, state and local agencies must also \nbe able to upgrade their information identification technologies in a \nway that is compatible with the FBI's new systems if the FBI and the \nNation are to obtain full benefit from these FBI initiatives for which \nthe Congress has appropriated several hundred million dollars over the \nlast few years.\n\n\n                        Employment and Licensing\n\n  S. 2022 will also support faster, more complete and more reliable \nstate and local responses to employment and licensing background check \nrequests. Over the last decade, employers and non-criminal justice \ngovernment agencies have emerged as the largest group of consumers of \narrest and conviction record information for background checks for \nchild care workers, school bus drivers, private security guards and a \nhost of other individuals seeking employment and licensing in sensitive \npositions of trust. We simply must do a better job of providing \nappropriate arrest and conviction information on a fast and reliable \nbasis. S. 2022 will go a long way toward helping our state and local \nlaw enforcement agencies to achieve this capability.\n\n\n                       Aggregate Statistical Data\n\n  S. 2022 will also support statistical and research systems, which can \ntogether provide community-relevant information to support smarter \ndecisions and more cost efficient and effective administration of \ncriminal justice resources.\n\n\n                        Sex Offender Registries\n\n  S. 2022 will permit state and local criminal justice agencies to \ncontinue to build more useful and effective sexual offender \nidentification registration systems, as well as domestic violence \nidentification and information systems.\n\n\n                      Communications Technologies\n\n  S. 2022 will also help our criminal justice agencies to acquire and \nimplement communications systems which are compatible with neighboring \npolice systems, compatible with systems operated by other components of \nthe criminal justice system and compatible among federal, state and \nlocal criminal justice agencies. Every criminal justice agency should \nbe able to communicate with other criminal justice agencies in an \ninstantaneous and reliable way in order to respond to emergency \nsituations and to promote the routine and appropriate sharing of \ninformation.\n\n\n                               Forensics\n\n  Finally, S. 2022 provides a 20 percent set-aside for forensic science \nand Medical Examiner programs. New forensics technologies are creating \na truly remarkable potential to solve crimes that previously could not \nhave been solved and to convict offenders who previously could not have \nbeen convicted. Implementing and using this technology across the \nnation takes leadership and resources. S. 2022 will provide both. The \n20 percent set-aside applies to the amount actually funded under S. \n2022 and is not a requirement which is made mandatory for each state. \nIn other words, a state which does not wish to draw down 20 percent of \nits funding under this Act for forensic science and medical examiner \npurposes is not required to do so. We will be monitoring the states' \nuse of funding for forensic science and Medical Examiner purposes, with \nan eye to reexamining whether this kind of earmark is necessary and, if \nso, at what level.\n\n\n                             Overall Impact\n\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act does more than provide \nsupport for critical information, identification, communications and \nforensic technology applications. S. 2022 creates a vision and makes a \ncommitment. The Act envisions a criminal justice system in which all \nparts of the system--law enforcement, courts, prosecution and \ncorrection--use state-of-the-art, information, identification, \ncommunication and forensics technologies in a compatible and integrated \nmanner, so as to mount the most effective and cost efficient challenge \nyet to crime. The Act also represents a federal commitment that every \ncriminal justice agency in this country should have the resources, in \npartnership with state and local funding, to obtain and use state-of-\nthe-art technology in the war against crime.\n\n\n                          Matching Requirement\n\n  In this regard, the Act requires a 10 percent match to be borne by \nthe states. As a practical matter, we expect that the states will spend \nstate monies far in excess of 10 percent of the funding under this Act \nin the acquisition, implementation and use of crime fighting \ntechnologies. Because of this, it is expected that OJP will take into \naccount all relevant costs borne by the state, regardless of the nature \nor character of these costs, so long as they truly support the \napplication of technology for the administration of criminal justice. \nFurthermore, it is expected that OJP, working through the Bureau of \nJustice Statistics, will publish guidelines regarding the criteria for \nwaiving a match, which will assure that states or components of the \ncriminal justice system within a state which are deserving of a grant \nbut which cannot meet the match requirement, are not disadvantaged. It \nis further expected that the match will not apply to grants made \npursuant to Subparagraph (2)(B) of Subsection (d) which provides grants \nand funding for technical assistance, training, evaluations and other \nsupport for this technology initiative.\n\n\n                             BJS Expertise\n\n  Title I, while vesting grant administration authority in the Office \nof Justice Programs, directs the Office to rely principally upon the \nexpertise of BJS in administering the program. This is important \nbecause the structure of the grant program is modeled after the \nNational Criminal History Improvement Program, which was very \nsuccessfully administered by BJS. Under that program, every state was \nrequired to receive a grant. Moreover, while the program was \ndiscretionary, it was administered by BJS in a manner that has \npermitted the states wide discretion in the purposes for which NCHIP \ngrant monies were applied. A similar approach should be taken in the S. \n2022 grant program. The identification, information, communications and \nforensics programs which are identified in S. 2022 are purposefully \nbroad, so that each state can use grant monies for its own particular \ntechnology needs.\n  At the same time, the discretionary approach and requirements in the \nbill that each state develop a statewide strategy for information \nsharing, with an emphasis on the integration of all criminal justice \ncomponents, assures that the needs of all components of criminal \njustice, including the courts, are taken into account and assures that \nadequate planning and implementation strategies have been developed so \nthat the use of technology is compatible and integrated.\n  OJP's role is important because the Department of Justice administers \nseveral justice assistance programs which can be and are being used for \nimportant, criminal justice identification, information and \ncommunications purposes. None of these programs are repealed, and \nfunding should and will continue under these programs. Accordingly, \ncoordination is important and OJP is expected to provide that \ncoordination.\n\n\n                         Contributions to NICS\n\n  S. 2022 also requires, by way of assurances, that states assure the \nAttorney General that the state ``has the capability to contribute \npertinent information to the National Instant Criminal Background Check \nSystem.'' This language does not mean that states are required to \noperate their own Instant Check Systems or to otherwise be a ``point-\nof-contact'' or intermediary between licensed firearms dealers and the \nFBI's National Instant Background Check System. Rather, this assurance \nrequires that states are contributing criminal history information and, \nif practicable and required by the FBI, other pertinent information to \nthe national system. States which are participating in III or working \nactively toward participating in III are presumed to meet this \nassurance.\n\n[[Page S12042]]\n\n             Interstate Identification Index System Compact\n\n  Finally, Title II, the National Crime Prevention and Privacy Compact \nof 1998, establishes a uniform standard for the interstate and federal-\nstate exchange of criminal history records for non-criminal justice \npurposes. In addition, Title II permits each state to continue to \nenforce its own record dissemination laws within its own borders. The \nCompact facilitates the interstate and federal-state exchange of \ncriminal history information by clarifying the obligations and \nresponsibilities of participating parties, streamlining the processing \nof background search applications, and eliminating record maintenance \nduplication at federal and state levels. Finally, the Compact provides \na mechanism for establishing and enforcing uniform standards for record \naccuracy and for the confidentiality and privacy interests of record \nsubjects.\n  This is a landmark piece of legislation, and I thank my colleagues \nfor helping to move it toward enactment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate will pass \nthe Crime Identification Technology Act of 1998, S. 2022, sending it to \nthe President for his signature into law.\n  I am proud to join Senator DeWine in supporting our bipartisan \nlegislation to authorize comprehensive Department of Justice grants to \nevery state for criminal justice identification, information and \ncommunications technologies and systems. I applaud the Senator from \nOhio, Senator DeWine, for his leadership. I also commend the Chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee and the Democratic Leader for their strong \nsupport of the Crime Identification Technology Act.\n  I know from my experience in law enforcement in Vermont over the last \n30 years that access to quality, accurate information in a timely \nfashion is of vital importance. As we prepare to enter the 21st \nCentury, we must provide our state and local law enforcement officers \nwith the resources to develop the latest technological tools and \ncommunications systems to solve and prevent crime. I believe this bill \naccomplishes that goal.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act authorizes $250 million for \neach of the next five years in grants to states for crime information \nand identification systems. The Attorney General is directed to make \ngrants to each state to be used in conjunction with units of local \ngovernment, and other states, to use information and identification \ntechnologies and systems to upgrade criminal history and criminal \njustice record systems.\n  Grants made under our legislation may include programs to establish, \ndevelop, update or upgrade----\n  State, centralized, automated criminal history record information \nsystems, including arrest and disposition reporting;\n  Automated fingerprint identification systems that are compatible with \nthe Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) of \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation;\n  Finger imaging, live scan and other automated systems to digitize \nfingerprints and to communicate prints in a manner that is compatible \nwith systems operated by states and the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation;\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III);\n  Programs and systems to facilitate full participation in the \nInterstate Identification Index National Crime Prevention and Privacy \nCompact;\n  Systems to facilitate full participation in the National Instant \nCriminal Background Check System (NICS) for firearms eligibility \ndeterminations;\n  Integrated criminal justice information systems to manage and \ncommunicate criminal justice information among law enforcement, courts, \nprosecution, and corrections;\n  Non-criminal history record information systems relevant to firearms \neligibility determinations for availability and accessibility to the \nNICs;\n  Court-based criminal justice information systems to promote reporting \nof dispositions to central state repositories and to the FBI and to \npromote the compatibility with, and integration of, court systems with \nother criminal justice information systems;\n  Ballistics identification programs that are compatible and integrated \nwith the ballistics programs of the National Integrated Ballistics \nNetwork (NIBN);\n  Information, identification and communications programs for forensic \npurposes;\n  DNA programs for forensic and identification purposes; Sexual \noffender identification and registration systems; Domestic violence \noffender identification and information systems;\n  Programs for fingerprint-supported background checks for non-criminal \njustice purposes including youth service employees and volunteers and \nother individuals in positions of trust, if authorized by federal or \nstate law and administered by a government agency;\n  Criminal justice information systems with a capacity to provide \nstatistical and research products including incident-based reporting \nsystems and uniform crime reports;\n  Online and other state-of-the-art communications technologies and \nprograms; and\n  Multi-agency, multi-jurisdictional communications systems to share \nroutine and emergency information among federal, state and local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  Let me just give a couple of examples from my home State of Vermont \nthat illustrate how our comprehensive legislation will aid state and \nlocal law enforcement agencies across the country.\n  The future of law enforcement must focus on working together to \nharness the power of today's information age to prevent crime and catch \ncriminals. One way to work together is for State and local law \nenforcement agencies to band together to create efficiencies of scale. \nFor example, together with New Hampshire and Maine, the State of \nVermont has pooled its resources together to build a tri-State IAFIS \nsystem to identify fingerprints. Our bipartisan legislation would \nfoster these partnerships by allowing groups of States to apply \ntogether for grants.\n  Another challenge for law enforcement agencies across the country is \ncommunication difficulties between Federal, State, and local law \nenforcement officials. In a recent report, the Department of Justice's \nNational Institute of Justice concluded that law enforcement agencies \nthroughout the Nation lack adequate communications systems to respond \nto crimes that cross State and local jurisdictions.\n  A 1997 incident along the Vermont and New Hampshire border \nunderscored this problem. During a cross border shooting spree that \nleft four people dead including two New Hampshire State Troopers, \nVermont and New Hampshire officers were forced to park two police \ncruisers next to one another to coordinate activities between Federal, \nState, and local law enforcement officers because the two States' \npolice radios could not communicate with one another.\n  The Vermont Department of Public Safety, the Vermont U.S. Attorney's \nOffice and others have reacted to these communication problems by \ndeveloping the Northern Lights proposal. This project will allow the \nnorthern borders States of Vermont, New York, New Hampshire, and Maine \nto integrate their law enforcement communications systems to better \ncoordinate interdiction efforts and share intelligence data seamlessly.\n  Our legislation would provide grants for the development of \nintegrated Federal, State, and local law enforcement communications \nsystems to foster cutting edge efforts like the Northern Lights \nproject.\n  In addition, our bipartisan legislation will help each of our States \nmeet its obligations under national anti-crime initiatives. For \ninstance, the FBI will soon bring online NCIC 2000 and IAFIS which will \nrequire States to update their criminal justice systems for the country \nto benefit. States are also being asked to participate in several other \nnational programs such as sexual offender registries, national domestic \nviolence legislation, Brady Act, and National Child Protection Act.\n  Currently, there are no comprehensive programs to support these \nnational crime-fighting systems. Our legislation will fill this void by \nhelping each State meet its obligations under these Federal laws.\n  The Crime Identification Technology Act provides a helping hand \nwithout the heavy hand of a top-down, Washington-knows-best approach. \nUnfortunately, some in Congress have pushed legislation mandating \nminute detail\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\nchanges that States must make in their laws to qualify for Federal \nfunds. Our bill rejects this approach. Instead, we provide the States \nwith Federal support to improve their criminal justice identification, \ninformation and communication systems without prescriping new Federal \nmandates.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased we are passing, as title II of this \nbill, the Federal-State ``III'' Compact for exchange of criminal \nhistory records for noncriminal justice purposes. This Compact is the \nproduct of a decade-long effort by federal and state law enforcement \nofficials to establish a legal framework for the exchange of criminal \nhistory records for authorized noncriminal justice purposes, such as \nsecurity clearances, employment or licensing background checks.\n  Since 1924, the FBI has collected and maintained duplicate state and \nlocal fingerprint cards, along with arrest and disposition records. \nToday, the FBI has over 200 million fingerprint cards in its system. \nThese FBI records are accessible to authorized government entities for \nboth criminal and authorized noncriminal justice purposes.\n  Maintaining duplicate files at the FBI is costly and leads to \ninaccuracies in the criminal history records, since follow-up \ndisposition information from the States is often incomplete. Such a \nlarge central database of routinely incomplete criminal history records \nraises significant privacy concerns.\n  In addition, the FBI releases these records for noncriminal justice \npurposes (as authorized by Federal law), to State agencies upon \nrequest, even if the State from which the records originated or the \nreceiving State more narrowly restricts the dissemination of such \nrecords for noncriminal justice purposes.\n  The Compact is an effort to get the FBI out of the business of \nholding a duplicate copy of every State and local criminal history \nrecord, and instead to keep those records at the State level. Once \nfully implemented, the FBI will only need to hold the Interstate \nIdentification Index (III), consisting of the national fingerprint file \nand a pointer index to direct the requestor to the correct State \nrecords repository. The Compact would eliminate the necessity for \nduplicate records at the FBI for those States participating in the \nCompact.\n  Eventually, when all the States become full participants in the \nCompact, the FBI's centralized files of state offender records will be \ndiscontinued and users of such records will obtain those records from \nthe appropriate State's central repository (or from the FBI if the \noffender has a Federal record).\n  The Compact would establish both a framework for this cooperative \nexchange of criminal history records for noncriminal justice purposes, \nand create a Compact Council with representatives from the FBI and the \nStates to monitor system operations and issue necessary rules and \nprocedures for the integrity and accuracy of the records and compliance \nwith privacy standards. Importantly, this Compact would not in any way \nexpand or diminish noncriminal justice purposes for which criminal \nhistory records may be used under existing State or Federal law.\n  Overall, I believe that the Compact would increase the accuracy, \ncompleteness and privacy protection for criminal history records.\n  In addition, the Compact would result in important cost savings from \nestablishing a decentralized system. Under the system envisioned by the \nCompact, the FBI would hold only an ``index and pointer'' to the \nrecords maintained at the originating State. The FBI would no longer \nhave to maintain duplicate State records. Moreover, States would no \nlonger have the burden and costs of submitting arrest fingerprints and \ncharge/disposition data to the FBI for all arrests. Instead, the State \nwould only have to submit to the FBI the fingerprints and textual \nidentification data for a person's first arrest.\n  With this system, criminal history records would be more up-to-date, \nor complete, because a decentralized system will keep the records \ncloser to their point of origin in State repositories, eliminating the \nneed for the States to keep sending updated disposition information to \nthe FBI. To ensure further accuracy, the Compact would require requests \nfor criminal history checks for noncriminal justice purposes to be \nsubmitted with fingerprints or some other form of positive \nidentification, to avoid mistaken release of records.\n  Furthermore, under the Compact, the newly-created Council must \nestablish procedures to require that the most current records are \nrequested and that when a new need arises, a new record check is \nconducted.\n  Significantly, the newly-created Council must establish privacy \nenhancing procedures to ensure that requested criminal history records \nare only used by authorized officials for authorized purposes. \nFurthermore, the Compact makes clear that only the FBI and authorized \nrepresentatives from the State repository may have direct access to the \nFBI index.\n  The Council must also ensure that only legally appropriate \ninformation is released and, specifically, that record entries that may \nnot be used for noncriminal justice purposes are deleted from the \nresponse.\n  Thus, while the Compact would require the release of arrest records \nto a requesting State, the Compact would also ensure that if \ndisposition records are available that the complete record be released. \nAlso, the Compact would require States receiving records under the \nCompact to ensure that the records are disseminated in compliance with \nthe authorized uses in that State. Consequently, under the Compact, a \nState that receives arrest-only information would have to give effect \nto disposition-only policies in that State and not release that \ninformation for noncriminal justice purposes. Thus, in my view, the \nimpact of the Compact for the privacy and accuracy of the records would \nbe positive.\n  I am pleased to have joined with Senators Hatch and DeWine to make a \nnumber of refinements to the Compact as transmitted by to us by the \nAdministration. Specifically, we have worked to clarify that (1) the \nwork of the Council includes establishing standards to protect the \nprivacy of the records; (2) sealed criminal history records are not \ncovered or subject to release for noncriminal justice purposes under \nthe Compact; (3) the meetings of the Council are open to the public, \nand (4) the Council's decisions, rules and procedures are available for \npublic inspection and copying and published in the Federal Register.\n  Commissioner Walton of the Vermont Department of Public Safety \nsupports this Compact. He hopes that passage of the Compact will \nencourage Vermont to become a full participant in III for both criminal \nand noncriminal justice purposes, so that Vermont can ``reap the \nbenefits of cost savings and improved data quality.'' The Compact is \nalso strongly supported by the FBI and SEARCH.\n  We all have an interest in making sure that the criminal history \nrecords maintained by our law enforcement agencies at the local, State \nand Federal levels, are complete, accurate and accessible only to \nauthorized personnel for legally authorized purposes. This Compact is a \nsignificant step in the process of achieving that goal.\n  I know that the Justice Department, under Attorney General Reno's \nleadership, has made it a priority to modernize and automate criminal \nhistory records. Our legislation will continue that leadership by \nproviding each State with the necessary resources to continue to make \nimportant efforts to bring their criminal justice systems up to date.\n  Mr. President, the Crime Identification Technology Act will ensure \nthat each State has the resources to capture the power of emerging \ninformation, communications and record-keeping technologies to serve \nand protect all of our citizens.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate agree to the \namendment of the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar 476, S. Res. 207.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 207) commemorating the 20th \n     anniversary of the founding of the Vietnam Veterans of \n     America.\n\n\n[[Page S12044]]\n\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I was proud to submit S. Res. 207 on \nApril 2nd of this year, and I am very pleased to mark its adoption \ntonight.\n  Tonight's action by the Senate is but one small step to redress the \nvery reason why the founders of the Vietnam Veterans of America (VVA) \nfelt compelled to take action 20 years ago. In 1978, Vietnam Veterans \nwere suffering under the wave of anti-Vietnam sentiment that had swept \nthe nation. Little recognition was given to their sacrifices during the \nwar. And in fact, there was even a great deal of official denial about \nthe extent of the price that had been paid by these veterans, both \nphysical and emotional. For instance, it would be years before Post-\nTraumatic Stress Disorder was a recognized condition for many veterans \nand before the Federal Government admitted that our use of Agent Orange \nhad left a terrible legacy of continued suffering for our veterans. The \nfounders of the VVA felt that they needed an organization to speak \ndirectly to those needs. The outpouring of enthusiasm from the veterans \nthemselves demonstrated the depth of these feelings.\n  I am also very proud that Chapter One was founded in my home town of \nRutland, Vermont. Vermonters have maintained a prominent voice in the \norganization, and are active in defining its future direction.\n  The VVA is not focused just on the three decades behind us. It \ncontinues to look to the large challenges ahead both for veterans as a \ngroup and Vietnam Veterans in particular. Just as the Vietnam Veterans \nMemorial is a permanent reminder of the sacrifices of the past, the VVA \nwill be a continual voice for pragmatism and commitment to the needs of \nthe veteran.\n  I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be \nagreed to, a motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and a \nstatement of explanation appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 207) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 207\n\n       Whereas the year 1998 marks the 20th anniversary of the \n     founding of the Vietnam Veterans of America;\n       Whereas the history of the Vietnam Veterans of America \n     organization is a story of America's gradual recognition of \n     the tremendous sacrifices of its Vietnam-era veterans and \n     their families;\n       Whereas the Vietnam Veterans of America is dedicated to \n     serving its membership through advocacy for its membership;\n       Whereas the Vietnam Veterans of America provides public and \n     member awareness of critical issues affecting Vietnam-era \n     veterans and their families;\n       Whereas the local grassroots efforts of Vietnam Veterans of \n     America chapters like Chapter One in Rutland, Vermont, which \n     was founded 18 years ago in April 1980, have greatly \n     contributed to the quality of lives of veterans in our \n     Nation's communities;\n       Whereas the Vietnam Veterans of America promotes its \n     principles through volunteerism, professional advocacy, and \n     claims work; and\n       Whereas the future of the Vietnam Veterans of America \n     relies not only on its past accomplishments, but on future \n     accomplishments of its membership that will ensure the \n     Vietnam Veterans of America remains a leader among veterans \n     advocacy organizations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 20th anniversary of the founding of \n     the Vietnam Veterans of America and commends it for its \n     advancement of veterans rights which set the standard for \n     other veterans organizations around the country;\n       (2) asks all Americans to join in the celebration of the \n     20th birthday of the Vietnam Veterans of America and 20 years \n     of advocacy for Vietnam veterans; and\n       (3) encourages the Vietnam Veterans of America to continue \n     into the next millennium to represent and promote the goals \n     of its organization in the veterans community and on Capitol \n     Hill, and to continue organizing to keep its national \n     membership of 51,000 members and 500 chapters strong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12043-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12044]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TORTURE VICTIMS RELIEF ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Research Investment \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. GENERAL FINDINGS REGARDING FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN \n                   RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Value of Research and Development.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the value of research \n     and development to the United States:\n       (1) Federal investment in research has resulted in the \n     development of technology that saved lives in the United \n     States and around the world.\n       (2) Research and development investment across all Federal \n     agencies has been effective in creating technology that has \n     enhanced the American quality of life.\n       (3) The Federal investment in research and development \n     conducted or underwritten by both military and civilian \n     agencies has produced benefits that have been felt in both \n     the private and public sector.\n       (4) Discoveries across the spectrum of scientific inquiry \n     have the potential to raise the standard of living and the \n     quality of life for all Americans.\n       (5) Science, engineering, and technology play a critical \n     role in shaping the modern world.\n       (6) Studies show that about half of all United States post-\n     World War II economic growth is a direct result of technical \n     innovation; and science, engineering, and technology \n     contribute to the creation of new goods and services, new \n     jobs and new capital.\n       (7) Technical innovation is the principal driving force \n     behind the long-term economic growth and increased standards \n     of living of the world's modern industrial societies. Other \n     nations are well aware of the pivotal role of science, \n     engineering, and technology, and they are seeking to exploit \n     it wherever possible to advance their own global \n     competitiveness.\n       (8) Federal programs for investment in research, which lead \n     to technological innovation and result in economic growth, \n     should be structured to address current funding disparities \n     and develop enhanced capability in States and regions that \n     currently underparticipate in the national science and \n     technology enterprise.\n       (b) Status of the Federal Investment.--The Congress makes \n     the following findings with respect to the status of the \n     Federal Investment in research and development activities:\n       (1) Federal investment of approximately 13 to 14 percent of \n     the Federal discretionary budget in research and development \n     over the past 11 years has resulted in a doubling of the \n     nominal amount of Federal funding.\n       (2) Fiscal realities now challenge Congress to steer the \n     Federal government's role in science, engineering, and \n     technology in a manner that ensures a prudent use of limited \n     public resources. There is both a long-term problem--\n     addressing the ever-increasing level of mandatory spending--\n     and a near-term challenge--apportioning a dwindling amount of \n     discretionary funding to an increasing range of targets in \n     science, engineering, and technology. This confluence of \n     increased national dependency on technology, increased \n     targets of opportunity, and decreased fiscal flexibility has \n     created a problem of national urgency. Many indicators show \n     that more funding for science, engineering, and technology is \n     needed but, even with increased funding, priorities must be \n     established among different programs. The United States \n     cannot afford the luxury of fully funding all deserving \n     programs.\n       (3) Current projections of Federal research funding show a \n     downward trend.\n\n     SEC. 3. ADDITIONAL FINDINGS REGARDING THE LINK BETWEEN THE \n                   RESEARCH PROCESS AND USEFUL TECHNOLOGY.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Flow of science, engineering, and technology.--The \n     process of science, engineering, and technology involves many \n     steps. The present Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology structure reinforces the increasingly artificial \n     distinctions between basic and applied activities. The result \n     too often is a set of discrete programs that each support a \n     narrow phase of research or development and are not \n     coordinated with one another. The government should maximize \n     its investment by encouraging the progression of science, \n     engineering, and technology from the earliest stages of \n     research up to a pre-commercialization stage, through funding \n     agencies and vehicles appropriate for each stage. This \n     creates a flow of technology, subject to merit review at \n     each stage, so that promising technology is not lost in a \n     bureaucratic maze.\n       (2) Excellence in the american research infrastructure.--\n     Federal investment in science, engineering, and technology \n     programs must foster a close relationship between research \n     and education. Investment in research at the university level \n     creates more than simply world-class research. It creates \n     world-class researchers as well. The Federal strategy must \n     continue to reflect this commitment to a strong \n     geographically-diverse research infrastructure. Furthermore, \n     the United States must find ways to extend the excellence of \n     its university system to primary and secondary educational \n     institutions and to better utilize the community college \n     system to prepare many students for vocational opportunities \n     in an increasingly technical workplace.\n       (3) Commitment to a broad range of research initiatives.--\n     An increasingly common theme in many recent technical \n     breakthroughs has been the importance of revolutionary \n     innovations that were sparked by overlapping of research \n     disciplines. The United States must continue to encourage \n     this trend by providing and encouraging opportunities for \n     interdisciplinary projects that foster collaboration among \n     fields of research.\n       (4) Partnerships among industry, universities, and federal \n     laboratories.--Each of these contributors to the national \n     science and technology delivery system has special talents \n     and abilities that complement the others. In addition, each \n     has a central mission that must provide their focus and each \n     has limited resources. The nation's investment in science, \n     engineering, and technology can be optimized by seeking \n     opportunities for leveraging the resources and talents of \n     these three major players through partnerships that do not \n     distort the missions of each partner. For that reason, \n     Federal dollars are wisely spent forming such partnerships.\n\n     SEC. 4. MAINTENANCE OF FEDERAL RESEARCH EFFORT; GUIDING \n                   PRINCIPLES.\n\n       (a) Maintaining United States Leadership in Science, \n     Engineering, and Technology.--It is imperative for the United \n     States to nurture its superb resources in science, \n     engineering, and technology carefully in order to maintain \n     its own globally competitive position.\n       (b) Guiding Principles.--Federal research and development \n     programs should be conducted in accordance with the following \n     guiding principles:\n       (1) Good science.--Federal science, engineering, and \n     technology programs include both knowledge-driven science \n     together with its applications, and mission-driven, science-\n     based requirements. In general, both types of programs must \n     be focused, peer- and merit-reviewed, and not unnecessarily \n     duplicative, although the details of these attributes must \n     vary with different program objectives.\n       (2) Fiscal accountability.--The Congress must exercise \n     oversight to ensure that programs funded with scarce Federal \n     dollars are well managed. The United States cannot tolerate \n     waste of money through inefficient management techniques, \n     whether by government agencies, by contractors, or by \n     Congress itself. Fiscal resources would be better utilized if \n     program and project funding levels were predictable across \n     several years to enable better project planning; a benefit of \n     such predictability would be that agencies and Congress can \n     better exercise oversight responsibilities through \n     comparisons of a project's and program's progress against \n     carefully planned milestones.\n       (3) Program effectiveness.--The United States needs to make \n     sure that government programs achieve their goals. As the \n     Congress crafts science, engineering, and technology \n     legislation, it must include a process for gauging program \n     effectiveness, selecting criteria based on sound scientific \n     judgment and avoiding unnecessary bureaucracy. The Congress \n     should also avoid the trap of measuring the effectiveness of \n     a broad science, engineering, and technology program by \n     passing judgment on individual projects. Lastly, the Congress \n     must recognize that a negative result in a well-conceived and \n     executed project or program may still be critically important \n     to the funding agency.\n       (4) Criteria for government funding.--Program selection for \n     Federal funding should continue to reflect the nation's 2 \n     traditional research and development priorities: (A) basic, \n     scientific, and technological research that represents \n     investments in the nation's long-term future scientific and \n     technological capacity, for which government has \n     traditionally served as the principle resource; and (B) \n     mission research investments, that is, investments in \n     research that derive from necessary public functions, such as \n     defense, health, education, environmental protection, and \n     raising the standard of living, which may include pre-\n     commercial, pre-competitive engineering research and \n     technology development. Additionally, government funding \n     should not compete with or displace the short-term, market-\n     driven, and typically more specific nature of private-sector \n     funding. Government funding should be restricted to pre-\n     competitive activities, leaving competitive activities solely \n     for the private sector. As a rule, the government\n\n[[Page S12053]]\n\n     should not invest in commercial technology that is in the \n     product development stage, very close to the broad commercial \n     marketplace, except to meet a specific agency goal. When the \n     government provides funding for any science, engineering, and \n     technology investment program, it must take reasonable steps \n     to ensure that the potential benefits derived from the \n     program will accrue broadly.\n\n     SEC. 5. POLICY STATEMENT.\n\n       (a) Policy.--This Act is intended--\n       (1) to encourage, as an overall goal, the doubling of the \n     annual authorized amount of Federal funding for basic \n     scientific, medical, and pre-competitive engineering research \n     over the 12-year period following the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (2) to invest in the future of the United States and the \n     people of the United States by expanding the research \n     activities referred to in paragraph (1);\n       (3) to enhance the quality of life for all people of the \n     United States;\n       (4) to guarantee the leadership of the United States in \n     science, engineering, medicine, and technology; and\n       (5) to ensure that the opportunity and the support for \n     undertaking good science is widely available throughout the \n     States by supporting a geographically-diverse research and \n     development enterprise.\n       (b) Agencies Covered.--The agencies intended to be covered \n     to the extent that they are engaged in science, engineering, \n     and technology activities for basic scientific, medical, or \n     pre-competitive engineering research by this Act are--\n       (1) the National Institutes of Health, within the \n     Department of Health and Human Services;\n       (2) the National Science Foundation;\n       (3) the National Institute for Standards and Technology, \n     within the Department of Commerce;\n       (4) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;\n       (5) the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \n     within the Department of Commerce;\n       (6) the Centers for Disease Control, within the Department \n     of Health and Human Services;\n       (7) the Department of Energy (to the extent that it is not \n     engaged in defense-related activities);\n       (8) the Department of Agriculture;\n       (9) the Department of Transportation;\n       (10) the Department of the Interior;\n       (11) the Department of Veterans Affairs;\n       (12) the Smithsonian Institution;\n       (13) the Department of Education; and\n       (14) the Environmental Protection Agency.\n       (c) Current Investment.--The investment in civilian \n     research and development efforts for fiscal year 1998 is 2.1 \n     percent of the overall Federal budget.\n       (d) Damage to Research Infrastructure.--A continued trend \n     of funding appropriations equal to or lower than current \n     budgetary levels will lead to permanent damage to the United \n     States research infrastructure. This could threaten American \n     dominance of high-technology industrial leadership.\n       (e) Increase Funding.--In order to maintain and enhance the \n     economic strength of the United States in the world market, \n     funding levels for fundamental, scientific, and pre-\n     competitive engineering research should be increased to equal \n     approximately 2.6 percent of the total annual budget.\n       (f) Future Fiscal Year Allocations.--\n       (1) Goals.--The long-term strategy for research and \n     development funding under this section would be achieved by a \n     steady 2.5 percent annual increase above the rate of \n     inflation throughout a 12-year period.\n       (2) Inflation assumption.--The authorizations contained in \n     paragraph (3) assume that the rate of inflation for each year \n     will be 3 percent.\n       (3) Authorization.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     for civilian research and development in the agencies listed \n     in subsection (b)--\n       (A) $37,720,000,000 for fiscal year 1999;\n       (B) $39,790,000,000 for fiscal year 2000;\n       (C) $41,980,000,000 for fiscal year 2001;\n       (D) $42,290,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       (E) $46,720,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       (F) $49,290,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       (G) $52,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2005;\n       (H) $54,870,000,000 for fiscal year 2006;\n       (I) $57,880,000,000 for fiscal year 2007;\n       (J) $61,070,000,000 for fiscal year 2008;\n       (K) $64,420,000,000 for fiscal year 2009; and\n       (L) $67,970,000,000 for fiscal year 2010.\n       (g) Conformance With Budgetary Caps.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, no funds may be made available under \n     this Act in a manner that does not conform with the \n     discretionary spending caps provided in the most recently \n     adopted concurrent resolution on the budget or threatens the \n     economic stability of the annual budget.\n       (h) Balanced Research Portfolio.--Because of the \n     interdependent nature of the scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, the aggregate funding levels authorized by the \n     section assume that the Federal research portfolio will be \n     well-balanced among the various scientific and engineering \n     disciplines, and geographically dispersed throughout the \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 6. PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL BUDGET REQUEST.\n\n       The President of the United States shall, in coordination \n     with the President's annual budget request, include a report \n     that parallels Congress' commitment to support Federally-\n     funded research and development by providing--\n       (1) a detailed summary of the total level of funding for \n     research and development programs throughout all civilian \n     agencies;\n       (2) a focused strategy that reflects the funding \n     projections of this Act for each future fiscal year until \n     2010, including specific targets for each agency that funds \n     civilian research and development;\n       (3) an analysis which details funding levels across Federal \n     agencies by methodology of funding, including grant \n     agreements, procurement contracts, and cooperative agreements \n     (within the meaning given those terms in chapter 63 of title \n     31, United States Code); and\n       (4) specific proposals for infrastructure development and \n     research and development capacity building in States with \n     less concentrated research and development resources in order \n     to create a nationwide research and development community.\n\n     SEC. 7. COMPREHENSIVE ACCOUNTABILITY STUDY FOR FEDERALLY-\n                   FUNDED RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Director of the Office of Science and \n     Technology Policy, in consultation with the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget, shall enter into agreement \n     with the National Academy of Sciences for the Academy to \n     conduct a comprehensive study to develop methods for \n     evaluating Federally-funded research and development \n     programs. This study shall--\n       (1) recommend processes to determine an acceptable level of \n     success for Federally-funded research and development \n     programs by--\n       (A) describing the research process in the various \n     scientific and engineering disciplines;\n       (B) describing in the different sciences what measures and \n     what criteria each community uses to evaluate the success or \n     failure of a program, and on what time scales these measures \n     are considered reliable--both for exploratory long-range work \n     and for short-range goals; and\n       (C) recommending how these measures may be adapted for use \n     by the Federal government to evaluate Federally-funded \n     research and development programs;\n       (2) assess the extent to which agencies incorporate \n     independent merit-based review into the formulation of the \n     strategic plans of funding agencies and if the quantity or \n     quality of this type of input is unsatisfactory;\n       (3) recommend mechanisms for identifying Federally-funded \n     research and development programs which are unsuccessful or \n     unproductive;\n       (4) evaluate the extent to which independent, merit-based \n     evaluation of Federally-funded research and development \n     programs and projects achieves the goal of eliminating \n     unsuccessful or unproductive programs and projects; and\n       (5) investigate and report on the validity of using \n     quantitative performance goals for aspects of programs which \n     relate to administrative management of the program and for \n     which such goals would be appropriate, including aspects \n     related to--\n       (A) administrative burden on contractors and recipients of \n     financial assistance awards;\n       (B) administrative burdens on external participants in \n     independent, merit-based evaluations;\n       (C) cost and schedule control for construction projects \n     funded by the program;\n       (D) the ratio of overhead costs of the program relative to \n     the amounts expended through the program for equipment and \n     direct funding of research; and\n       (E) the timeliness of program responses to requests for \n     funding, participation, or equipment use.\n       (6) examine the extent to which program selection for \n     Federal funding across all agencies exemplifies our nation's \n     historical research and development priorities--\n       (A) basic, scientific, and technological research in the \n     long-term future scientific and technological capacity of the \n     nation; and\n       (B) mission research derived from a high-priority public \n     function.\n       (b) Alternative Forms for Performance Goals.--Not later \n     than 6 months after transmitting the report under subsection \n     (a) to Congress, the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget, after public notice, public comment, and approval by \n     the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy \n     and in consultation with the National Science and Technology \n     Council shall promulgate one or more alternative forms for \n     performance goals under section 1115(b)(10)(B) of title 31, \n     United States Code, based on the recommendations of the study \n     under subsection (a) of this section. The head of each agency \n     containing a program activity that is a research and \n     development program may apply an alternative form promulgated \n     under this section for a performance goal to such a program \n     activity without further authorization by the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget.\n       (c) Strategic Plans.--Not later than one year after \n     promulgation of the alternative performance goals in \n     subsection (b) of this section, the head of each agency \n     carrying out research and development activities, upon \n     updating or revising a strategic plan under subsection 306(b) \n     of title 5, United States Code, shall describe the current \n     and future use of methods for determining an acceptable level \n     of success as recommended by the study under subsection (a).\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of \n     the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n       (2) Program activity.-- The term ``program activity'' has \n     the meaning given that term by section 1115(f)(6) of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (3) Independent merit-based evaluation.--The term \n     ``independent merit-based evaluation'' means review of the \n     scientific or technical quality of research or development, \n     conducted by experts who are chosen for their knowledge of \n     scientific and technical fields relevant to the evaluation \n     and who--\n       (A) in the case of the review of a program activity, do not \n     derive long-term support from the program activity; or\n       (B) in the case of the review of a project proposal, are \n     not seeking funds in competition with the proposal.\n\n[[Page S12054]]\n\n       (e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out the study required by \n     subsection (a) $600,000 for the 18-month period beginning \n     October 1, 1998.\n\n     SEC. 8. EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT PROGRAM FOR \n                   FEDERALLY-FUNDED RESEARCH.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 11 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end thereof the following:\n\n     ``Sec.  1120.

Mr. President, I'm pleased to see the Federal Research \nInvestment Act presented for approval to the Senate. This bill, S. \n2217, is one that I've supported through-out its history, because it \naddresses the health of our nation's science and technology base.\n  Our science and technology base is vital to the nation's future. Any \nnumber of studies have confirmed its importance. As one excellent \nexample, the National Innovation Summit, organized by MIT with the \nCouncil on Competitiveness, confirmed that the integrity of that base \nis one of the cornerstones to our future economic prosperity. At that \nSummit, many of the nation's top CEOs emphasized that the nation's \nclimate for innovation is a major determinant of our ability to \nmaintain and advance our high standard of living and strong economy.\n  Advanced technologies are responsible for driving half of our \neconomic growth since World War II, and that growth has developed our \neconomy into the envy of the world. We need to continually refresh our \nstock of new products and processes that enable good jobs for our \ncitizens in the face of increasing global challenges to all our \nprincipal industries.\n  The Federal Research Investment Act continues the goal first \nexpressed in S. 1305, that I co-sponsored with Senators Gramm, \nLieberman, and Bingaman, to double the nation's investment in science \nand technology. Among other improvements, S. 2217 proposes a more \nrealistic time scale for achieving this expanded support.\n  This doubling must be accomplished within a balanced budget that \navoids deficits, thus a longer period is a better choice. That balanced \nbudget is essential, it enables the economic health that is fundamental \nto our ability to really use advanced technologies.\n  The new bill continues to emphasizes a broad range of research \ntargets, from fundamental and frontier exploration, through pre-\ncompetitive engineering research. This emphasis on a spectrum of \nresearch maturity is absolutely critical. The nation is not well served \nby a focus on so-called ``basic'' research that can open new fields, \nbut then leave those fields wanting for resources to develop these new \nideas to a pre-competitive stage applicable to future commercial \nproducts and processes.\n  The new bill addresses a spectrum of research fields with its \nemphasis on expanding S funding in many agencies. We need technical \nadvances in many fields simultaneously. In more and more cases, the \nbest new ideas are not flowing from explorations in a single narrow \nfield, but instead are coming from inter-disciplinary studies that \nbring experts from diverse fields together for fruitful collaboration. \nThis is especially evident in medical and health fields, where \ncombinations of medical science with many other specialities are \ncritical to the latest health care advances.\n  This new bill has additional features that weren't part of the \nearlier one. It proposes to utilize the National Academy of Science in \ndeveloping approaches to evaluation of program and project performance. \nThis should lead to better understanding of how GPRA goals and \nscientific programs can be best coordinated. The new role for the \nNational Academy can help define criteria to guide decisions on \ncontinued and future funding. The bill also sets up procedures to use \nthese evaluations to terminate federal programs that are not performing \nat acceptable levels.\n  The new bill incorporates a set of well-developed principles for \nfederal funding of science and technology. These principles were \ndeveloped by the Senate Science and Technology Caucus. Those \nprinciples, when carefully applied, can lead to better choices among \nthe many opportunities for federal S funding. The new bill also \nincorporates recommendations for independent merit-based review of \nfederal S programs, which should further strengthen them.\n  Many aspects of the Federal Research Investment Act support and \ncompliment key points in the new study released by Representative Vern \nEhlers just recently. His study, ``Unlocking our Future,'' will serve \nas an important focal point for continuing discussions on the critical \ngoal of strengthening our nation's science and technology base. I've \ncertainly appreciated interactions with Representative Ehlers as he \ndeveloped his study and as S. 2217 was developed.\n  The new Federal Research Investment Act builds and improves on the \ngoals of the previous bill. With S. 2217, we will build stronger \nfederal Science and Technology programs that will underpin our nation's \nability to compete effectively in the global marketplace of the 21st \ncentury.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be considered read the \nthird time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed at this point \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2217), as amended, was considered read the third time, \nand passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12052-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12054-S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MUHAMMAD ALI BOXING REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of calendar 705, S. 2238.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n\n       A bill (S. 2238) to reform unfair and anticompetitive \n     practices in the professional boxing industry.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill, \nwhich had been reported from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting \nclause and inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Professional boxing differs from other major, \n     interstate professional sports industries in the United \n     States in that it operates without any private sector \n     association, league, or centralized industry organization to \n     establish uniform and appropriate business practices and \n     ethical standards. This has led to repeated occurrences of \n     disreputable and coercive business practices in the boxing \n     industry, to the detriment of professional boxers nationwide.\n       (2) Professional boxers are vulnerable to exploitative \n     business practices engaged in by certain promoters and \n     sanctioning bodies which dominate the sport. Boxers do not \n     have an established representative group to advocate for \n     their interests and rights in the industry.\n       (3) State officials are the proper regulators of \n     professional boxing events, and must protect the\n\n[[Page S12055]]\n\n     welfare of professional boxers and serve the public interest \n     by closely supervising boxing activity in their jurisdiction. \n     State boxing commissions do not currently receive adequate \n     information to determine whether boxers competing in their \n     jurisdiction are being subjected to contract terms and \n     business practices which may be violative of State \n     regulations, or are onerous and confiscatory.\n       (4) Promoters who engage in illegal, coercive, or unethical \n     business practices can take advantage of the lack of \n     equitable business standards in the sport by holding boxing \n     events in states with weaker regulatory oversight.\n       (5) The sanctioning organizations which have proliferated \n     in the boxing industry have not established credible and \n     objective criteria to rate professional boxers, and operate \n     with virtually no industry or public oversight. Their ratings \n     are susceptible to manipulation, have deprived boxers of fair \n     opportunities for advancement, and have undermined public \n     confidence in the integrity of the sport.\n       (6) Open competition in the professional boxing industry \n     has been significantly interfered with by restrictive and \n     anti-competitive business practices of certain promoters and \n     sanctioning bodies, to the detriment of the athletes and the \n     ticket-buying public. Common practices of promoters and \n     sanctioning organizations represent restraints of interstate \n     trade in the United States.\n       (7) It is necessary and appropriate to establish national \n     contracting reforms to protect professional boxers and \n     prevent exploitative business practices, and to require \n     enhanced financial disclosures to State athletic commissions \n     to improve the public oversight of the sport.\n       (8) Whereas the Congress seeks to improve the integrity and \n     ensure fair practices of the professional boxing industry on \n     a nationwide basis, it deems it appropriate to name this \n     reform in honor of Muhammad Ali, whose career achievements \n     and personal contributions to the sport, and positive impact \n     on our society, are unsurpassed in the history of boxing.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4284) to authorize the government of India to \n     establish a memorial to honor Mahatma Gandhi in the District \n     of Columbia.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, last year I joined the distinguished senior \nSenator from New York, Mr. Moynihan, in introducing a bill to authorize \nthe placement of a memorial to Mohandas K.--Mahatma--Gandhi, on Federal \nland in the District of Columbia in the vicinity of the Indian Embassy. \nA similar bill was introduced in the House of Representatives.\n  I am pleased to report that the House unanimously passed their \nversion of this bill on September 15 and it now rests here in the \nSenate awaiting our action. It is my hope that the Senate will pass \nthis bill and it is for this reason that I rise today.\n  The proposed memorial will comply with the Commemorative Works Act \nand will be placed at no cost to the U.S. government; the Indian \ngovernment will be responsible for the construction and maintenance of \nthe memorial. In addition, the National Capital Memorial Commission and \nthe National Park Service have designated and approved the site.\n  At midnight on August 15, 1947, 400 million people received their \nindependence and an institution in world history came to an end. This \nis the date that India became a free nation, and the mighty British \nempire, in effect, ceased to exist. One man more than any other is \ncredited with bringing this profound change to the world. Dressed in \nwhite homespun cloth, with only a handful of worldly possessions, \nMohandas Gandhi--known as Mahatma, or ``Great Soul''--showed the world \nthat dedication to principles, and belief in reconciliation, can \nprevail over otherwise insurmountable odds. Best known for his civil \ndisobedience characterized by nonviolence and passive resistance, \nMahatma Gandhi is revered by millions throughout the world for his \ndedication to personal freedom, justice, and human rights.\n  Gandhi is not only the father of modern India, but a leader whose \nimpact changed the world forever. Gandhi influenced great champions of \nfreedom throughout the world including Lech Walesa of Poland, the Dalai \nLama of Tibet and Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma. Albert Einstein said of \nGandhi, ``Generations to come will scarcely believe that such a one as \nthis walked the earth in flesh and blood.'' Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr., said of Gandhi's importance to the world, ``We may ignore Gandhi \nat our own risk.'' And Gandhi himself had strong ties to the United \nStates. He acknowledged being influenced in his own thinking by Henry \nDavid Thoreau, as well as by the U.S. Constitution.\n  Mr. President, the story of India's recent history is the story of \npeople struggling for freedom--and this struggle is universal. Gandhi \nhas made us all richer in our freedom through his life's work and \nsacrifice. The right thing for this body to do is to support the Indian \ngovernment's efforts to erect this memorial; it will be a gift to the \nAmerican people symbolic of the greater gift\n\n[[Page S12062]]\n\nwe received more than fifty years ago from Mahatma Gandhi.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the United States Congress acts to \nauthorize the placement of a statute of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi--\nMahatma Gandi--on Federal land across the street from the Indian \nembassy in Washington D.C. Such a tribute to Mahatma Gandhi, often \ncalled the father of the Indian nation, would serve as a fitting \ntribute to Indian democracy which has survived--in fact, thrived--\ndespite enormous challenges. It will stand as a symbol of the growing \nstrength of the bonds between our two countries.\n  The Government of India has offered a statute of Gandhi as a gift to \nthe United States. In order to place it on Federal land, an act of \nCongress is required. This bill will fulfill just that purpose, and I \nthank the Senator from Florida, Mr. Mack and the Senator from Maryland, \nMr. Sarbanes for joining me in this endeavor.\n  It is particularly appropriate that a statute of Mahatma Gandhi be \nselected as a symbol of our ties. The effects of Gandhi's non-violent \nactions and the philosophy that guided him, were not limited to his \ncountry, or his time. Perhaps less known is that Gandhi drew \ninspiration from an American. While in South Africa, Gandhi read \nThoreau's essay ``Civil Disobedience,'' which confirmed his view that \nan honest man is duty-bound to violate unjust laws. He took this view \nhome with him, and in the end the British raj gave way to an \nindependent Republic of India. Then Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \nrepatriated the idea, and so began the great American civil rights \nmovement of this century.\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. has written of the singular influence \nGandhi's message of non-violent resistance had on him when he first \nlearned of it while studying at Crozier Theological seminary in \nPhiladelphia. He would later describe Gandhi's influence on him in, \n``Stride Toward Freedom'':\n\n       As I read I became deeply fascinated by [Gandhi's] \n     philosphy of non-violent resistance . . . as I delved deeper \n     into the philosophy of Gandhi, my skepticism concerning the \n     power of love gradually diminished, and I came to see its \n     potency in the area of social reform . . . prior to reading \n     Gandhi, I had concluded that the love ethics of Jesus were \n     only effective in individual relationships . . . but after \n     reading Gandhi, I saw how utterly mistaken I was.\n       . . . It was in this Gandhian emphasis on love and non-\n     violence that I discovered the method for social reform that \n     I had been seeking for so many months . . . I came to feel \n     that this was the only morally and practically sound method \n     open to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom . . . \n     this principle became the guiding light of our movement. \n     Christ furnished the spirit and motivation and Gandhi \n     furnished the method.\n\n  Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. believed that Gandhi's philosophy of non-\nviolent resistance was the ``guiding light'' of the American civil \nrights movement. As Dr. King explained, ``Gandhi furnished the \nmessage.'' A statue of Gandhi, given as a gift from the Government of \nIndia, on a small plot of Federal land along Massachusetts Avenue in \nfront of the Indian embassy, will stand not only as a tribute to the \nshared values of the two largest democracies in the world, but will \nalso pay tribute to the lasting influence of Gandhian thought on the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread the third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed at \nthis point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

COMMERCIALIZATION OF SPACE STATION.\n\n       (a) Policy.--The Congress declares that a priority goal of \n     constructing the International Space Station is the economic \n     development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further \n     declares that free and competitive markets create the most \n     efficient conditions for promoting economic development, and \n     should therefore govern the economic development of Earth \n     orbital space. The Congress further declares that the use of \n     free market principles in operating, servicing, allocating \n     the use of, and adding capabilities to the Space Station, and \n     the resulting fullest possible engagement of commercial \n     providers and participation of commercial users, will reduce \n     Space Station operational costs for all partners and the \n     Federal Government's share of the United States burden to \n     fund operations.\n       (b) Reports.--(1) The Administrator shall deliver to the \n     Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate, within 90 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, a study that identifies and examines--\n       (A) the opportunities for commercial providers to play a \n     role in International Space Station activities, including \n     operation, use, servicing, and augmentation;\n       (B) the potential cost savings to be derived from \n     commercial providers playing a role in each of these \n     activities;\n       (C) which of the opportunities described in subparagraph \n     (A) the Administrator plans to make available to commercial \n     providers in fiscal years 1999 and 2000;\n       (D) the specific policies and initiatives the Administrator \n     is advancing to encourage and facilitate these commercial \n     opportunities; and\n       (E) the revenues and cost reimbursements to the Federal \n     Government from commercial users of the Space Station.\n       (2) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on \n     Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within \n     180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, an \n     independently-conducted market study that examines and \n     evaluates potential industry interest in providing commercial \n     goods and services for the operation, servicing, and \n     augmentation of the International Space Station, and in the \n     commercial use of the International Space Station. This study \n     shall also include updates to the cost savings and revenue \n     estimates made in the study described in paragraph (1) based \n     on the external market assessment.\n       (3) The Administrator shall deliver to the Congress, no \n     later than the submission of the President's annual budget \n     request for fiscal year 2000, a report detailing how many \n     proposals (whether solicited or not) the National Aeronautics \n     and Space Administration received during calendar years 1997 \n     and 1998 regarding commercial operation, servicing, \n     utilization, or augmentation of the International Space \n     Station, broken down by each of these four categories, and \n     specifying how many agreements the National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration has entered into in response to these \n     proposals, also broken down by these four categories.\n       (4) Each of the studies and reports required by paragraphs \n     (1), (2), and (3) shall include consideration of the \n     potential role of State governments as brokers in promoting \n     commercial participation in the International Space Station \n     program.\n\n     SEC. 102.

SHUTTLE PRIVATIZATION.\n\n       (a) Policy and Preparation.--The Administrator shall \n     prepare for an orderly transition from the Federal operation, \n     or Federal management of contracted operation, of space \n     transportation systems to the Federal purchase of commercial \n     space transportation services for all nonemergency space \n     transportation requirements for transportation to and from \n     Earth orbit, including human, cargo, and mixed payloads. In \n     those preparations, the Administrator shall take into account \n     the need for short-term economies, as well as the goal of \n     restoring the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's \n     research focus and its mandate to promote the fullest \n     possible commercial use of space. As part of those \n     preparations, the Administrator shall plan for the potential \n     privatization of the Space Shuttle program. Such plan shall \n     keep safety and cost effectiveness as high priorities. \n     Nothing in this section shall prohibit the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration from studying, \n     designing, developing, or funding upgrades or modifications \n     essential to the safe and economical operation of the Space \n     Shuttle fleet.\n       (b) Feasibility Study.--The Administrator shall conduct a \n     study of the feasibility of implementing the recommendation \n     of the Independent Shuttle Management Review Team that the \n     National Aeronautics and Space Administration transition \n     toward the privatization of the Space Shuttle. The study \n     shall identify, discuss, and, where possible, present options \n     for resolving, the major policy and legal issues that must be \n     addressed before the Space Shuttle is privatized, including--\n       (1) whether the Federal Government or the Space Shuttle \n     contractor should own the Space Shuttle orbiters and ground \n     facilities;\n       (2) whether the Federal Government should indemnify the \n     contractor for any third party liability arising from Space \n     Shuttle operations, and, if so, under what terms and \n     conditions;\n       (3) whether payloads other than National Aeronautics and \n     Space Administration payloads should be allowed to be \n     launched on the Space Shuttle, how missions will be \n     prioritized, and who will decide which mission flies and \n     when;\n       (4) whether commercial payloads should be allowed to be \n     launched on the Space Shuttle and whether any classes of \n     payloads should be made ineligible for launch consideration;\n       (5) whether National Aeronautics and Space Administration \n     and other Federal Government payloads should have priority \n     over non-Federal payloads in the Space Shuttle launch \n     assignments, and what policies should be developed to \n     prioritize among payloads generally;\n       (6) whether the public interest requires that certain Space \n     Shuttle functions continue to be performed by the Federal \n     Government; and\n       (7) how much cost savings, if any, will be generated by \n     privatization of the Space Shuttle.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--Within 60 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration shall complete the study required under \n     subsection (b) and shall submit a report on the study to the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Science of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n     SEC. 205. USE OF EXCESS INTERCONTINENTAL BALLISTIC MISSILES.\n\n       (a) In general.--The Federal Government shall not--\n       (1) convert any missile described in subsection (c) to a \n     space transportation vehicle configuration; or\n       (2) transfer ownership of any such missile to another \n     person, except as provided in subsection (b).\n       (b) Authorized Federal Uses.--(1) A missile described in \n     subsection (c) may be converted for use as a space \n     transportation vehicle by the Federal Government if, except \n     as provided in paragraph (2) and at least 30 days before such \n     conversion, the agency seeking to use the missile as a space \n     transportation vehicle transmits to the Committee on National \n     Security and the Committee on Science of the House of \n     Representatives, and to the Committee on Armed Services and \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate, a certification that the use of such missile--\n       (A) would result in cost savings to the Federal Government \n     when compared to the cost of acquiring space transportation \n     services from United States commercial providers;\n       (B) meets all mission requirements of the agency, including \n     performance, schedule, and risk requirements;\n       (C) is consistent with international obligations of the \n     United States; and\n       (D) is approved by the Secretary of Defense or his \n     designee.\n       (2) The requirement under paragraph (1) that the \n     certification described in that paragraph must be transmitted \n     at least 30 days before conversion of the missile shall not \n     apply if the Secretary of Defense determines that compliance \n     with that requirement would be inconsistent with meeting \n     immediate national security requirements.\n       (c) Missiles Referred to.-- The missiles referred to in \n     this section are missiles owned by the United States that--\n       (1) were formerly used by the Department of Defense for \n     national defense purposes as intercontinental ballistic \n     missiles; and\n       (2) have been declared excess to United States national \n     defense needs and are in compliance with international \n     obligations of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 206.

Senator Coats has a substitute amendment at the desk, \nand I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), for Mr. Coats, Mr. \n     Lieberman, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Kerrey, Ms. Landrieu and Mr. \n     McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 3795.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Charter School \nExpansion Act, and I commend Senator Coats for his leadership in \nbringing it before the Senate. The legislation builds on the current \nCharter School Program to ensure that these schools are given the \ngreater flexibility that they have been promised, and to reaffirm that \nthey must be accountable to the same high standards that we expect of \nall public schools.\n  In recent years, in response to the widespread movement to improve \nthe quality of education in the nation's public schools, the innovative \nidea of charter schools began to develop broad bi-partisan support. \nEducators and community leaders took active parts in designing new \nschools that would receive public funds, like traditional public \nschools, but that would be free of many local regulations, and would \nalso be held accountable for achieving the goals of their charter.\n  States have the primary role in defining the role of charter \nschools--34 states have now passed enabling legislation, and they vary \nwidely in their applications of this innovative idea. The Charter \nSchool Expansion Act continues to use Federal start-up grants as an \nincentive for local communities to design charter schools that provide \nsignificant options for parents within the public school system. The \nAct encourages the sharing of ideas and practices between charter \nschools and other public schools, so that schools benefit from the best \nlessons of each.\n  The pending legislation strengthens the accountability provisions for \ncharter schools by giving funding preferences to states that review and \nevaluate the performance of their charter schools at least once every \nfive years. Charter schools must continue to be open to all students. \nPresident Clinton has set a goal of having 3,000 charter schools in \noperation nationwide by the year 2002.\n  The Department of Education is conducting an ongoing study of charter \nschool and the degree to which they are successful in improving student \nachievement. The results of that study will be very important in \nguiding the future of these schools.\n  The Charter School Expansion Act is an essential part of our overall \neffort to improve public schools, and I urge the Senate to approve it. \nWe must continue to do all we can to ensure that all public schools get \nthe support they need to provide every child a good education.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill appear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3795) was agreed to.\n  The bill (H.R. 2616), as amended, was passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12069-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "08", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12069-S12073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              NEOTROPICAL MIGRATORY BIRD CONSERVATION ACT\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) birds constitute one of the most widely recognized \n     and appreciated components of North American wildlife;\n       (B) approximately 25,000,000 Americans travel to observe \n     birds; and\n       (C) more than 60,000,000 adult Americans watch and feed \n     birds at home;\n       (2) birds--\n       (A) are key indicators of environmental health;\n       (B) play important roles in plant pollination and seed \n     dispersal;\n       (C) serve as critical links in the food web; and\n       (D) maintain the health of the environment.\n       (3)(A) healthy bird populations provide important economic \n     benefits, such as control of noxious insects on agricultural \n     crops, thereby preventing hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     economic losses each year to farming and timber interests; \n     and\n       (B) more than $20,000,000,000 is spent in the United States \n     each year on watching and feeding birds;\n       (4)(A) despite their irreplaceable value, many North \n     American bird species, once considered common, are in \n     decline;\n       (B) 90 North American bird species are listed as endangered \n     or threatened in the United States;\n       (C) another 124 North American bird species are of high \n     conservation concern; and\n       (D) Mexico's Secretariat of Environment, Natural Resources \n     and Fisheries lists approximately 390 bird species as being \n     endangered, threatened, vulnerable, or rare;\n       (5)(A) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the \n     United States, approximately 500 migrate among nations;\n       (B) the large majority of those species, the neotropical \n     migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean; and\n       (C) neotropical migrants in particular have received much \n     attention because of their population declines;\n       (6)(A) the primary reason for the declines is habitat loss \n     and degradation (including pollution and contamination);\n       (B) because neotropical migrants range across numerous \n     international borders each year, their conservation requires \n     that safeguards be established at both ends of the migration \n     routes, as well as at critical stopover areas along the way; \n     and\n       (C) establishing such safeguards necessitates the joint \n     commitment and effort of all nations that support those \n     species, as well as all levels of society; [and]\n       (7)(A)numerous initiatives exist to conserve migratory \n     birds, including Partners in Flight, the Western Hemisphere \n     Shorebird Reserve Network, the North American Waterfowl \n     Management Plan, and monitoring action plans and conservation \n     plans for water birds, marsh birds, and raptors; and\n       (B) those initiatives can be significantly strengthened and \n     enhanced by coordination of their efforts to protect habitat \n     shared by migratory birds; and\n       [(7)] (8) this Act constitutes an effort on the part of the \n     United States to adopt appropriate measures for the \n     protection of migratory birds in collaboration with--\n       (A) neighboring nations that are parties to the Convention \n     Respecting Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the \n     Western Hemisphere, done at the Pan American \n     Union, Washington, October 12, 1940 (56 Stat. 1354); [and]\n       (B) States, conservation organizations, corporations and \n     business interests, and other private entities[.] ; and\n\n[[Page S12070]]\n\n       (C) other initiatives to conserve migratory birds \n     throughout the Americas, by serving as a link among those \n     initiatives.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to assist in the conservation of neotropical migratory \n     birds by supporting neotropical migratory bird conservation \n     programs in [Latin America and the Caribbean] Latin America, \n     the Caribbean, and the United States with a focus on \n     reversing habitat loss and degradation;\n       (2) to promote partnerships between Federal, State, and \n     nongovernmental entities in the United States in the \n     conservation of neotropical migratory birds;\n       (3) to foster active governmental and nongovernmental \n     participation in neotropical migratory bird conservation by \n     cooperating countries throughout Latin America and the \n     Caribbean;\n       (4) to promote circumstances under which the conservation \n     of neotropical migratory birds in Latin America and the \n     Caribbean may be carried out [entirely] by local entities;\n       (5) to provide financial resources for projects that \n     support neotropical migratory bird conservation; and\n       (6) to promote the effective conservation of neotropical \n     migratory birds in the Western Hemisphere through \n     collaboration at all levels of society.\n\n     SEC. 4.

I ask unanimous consent the committee amendments be \nwithdrawn. Senator Chafee has a substitute at the desk, and I ask for \nits consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont (Mr. Jeffords), for Mr. Chafee, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3796.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 1970, the Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of \n1998, introduced by Senator Abraham. I am also pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this legislation. The bill would establish a program to \nprovide financial assistance for projects to promote the conservation \nof neotropical migratory birds in the United States, Latin America and \nthe Caribbean.\n  Each autumn, some 5 billion birds from 500 species migrate between \ntheir breeding grounds in North America and tropical habitats in the \nCaribbean, Central and South America. These neotropical migrants--or \nNew World tropical migrants--are birds that migrate between the \nbiogeographic region stretching across Mexico, Central America, much of \nthe Caribbean, and the northern part of South America.\n  The natural challenges facing these migratory birds are profound. \nThese challenges have been exacerbated by human-induced impacts, \nparticularly the continuing loss of habitat in the Caribbean and Latin \nAmerica. As a result, populations of migratory birds have declined \ngenerally in recent years.\n  While there are numerous efforts underway to protect these species \nand their habitat, they generally focus on specific groups of migratory \nbirds or specific regions in the Americas. There is a need for a more \ncomprehensive program to address the varied and significant threats \nfacing the numerous species of migratory birds across their range.\n  Frequently there is little, if any, coordination among the existing \nprograms, nor is there any one program that serves as a link among \nthem. A broader, more holistic approach would bolster existing \nconservation efforts and programs, fill the gaps between these \nprograms, and promote new initiatives.\n  S. 1970 encompasses this new approach. Today, I am offering an \namendment in the nature of a substitute to the bill. This amendment \nmakes numerous changes to the bill as approved by the EPW Committee. \nThese changes have been incorporated based on very constructive, \nbipartisan negotiations with the sponsors of the bill, the House \nResources Committee, the Administration, and the EPW Committee.\n  One major change between this amendment and the reported bill relates \nto the advisory group. Formation of the group is now discretionary on \nthe part of the Secretary. I urge, however, that the Secretary convene \na group to assist in implementing the legislation. The success of this \ninitiative will depend on close collaboration with public and private \norganizations involved in the conservation of migratory birds.\n  Another significant change applies to the funding levels. While the \nFederal share remains no more than 33 percent, the non-Federal share \nhas been changed so that for projects in the U.S., the non-Federal \nshare must be paid in cash, while in projects outside the U.S., the \nnon-Federal share may be entirely in-kind contributions. This change is \nintended to create an incentive, and provide flexibility, for \nundertaking projects outside the United States. To complement this \nchange, the substitute amendment eliminates the limitation that no more \nthan 70 percent of appropriated funds may be used for projects outside \nthe United States.\n\n  Other changes include a clarification of the purposes section, \ninclusion of a definitions section, and changes to the section \nenumerating duties of the Secretary, given the elimination of the \nadvisory committee. In addition, several changes were made to reflect a \ndesire that projects be developed with the support of the relevant \nwildlife management authorities of the country. This change recognizes \nthe need to collaborate conservation efforts among both public and \nprivate sectors, and at local and national levels.\n  I believe that this amendment greatly improves the bill, and I am \nvery pleased with the legislation. I urge my colleagues to support, and \nurge its speedy enactment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, the Senate today will pass compromise \nlegislation worked out between the House and Senate, and between \nCongress and the President, regarding migratory birds.\n  I thank Senator Daschle, who is an original cosponsor of this \nlegislation, along with Senator Chafee, for their support and \nassistance in formulating legislation which I have been told the \nPresident will sign.\n  Mr. President, the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird Conservation Act of \n1998'' is designed to protect over 90 endangered species of bird \nspending certain seasons in the United States and the rest of the year \nin other nations of the Western Hemisphere. In doing so, it will \nprotect the environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic \nbenefits these birds provide to the United States and to the Western \nHemisphere as a whole.\n  Every year approximately 25 million Americans travel to observe \nbirds, and 60 million American adults watch and feed birds at home.\n  Bird-watching is a source of great pleasure to many Americans, as \nwell as a source of important revenue to states, like my own state of \nMichigan, which attract tourists to their scenes of natural beauty. \nBird-watching and feeding generates fully $20 billion every year in \nrevenue across America.\n  Healthy bird populations also prevent hundreds of millions of dollars \nin economic losses each year to farming and timber interests. They help \ncontrol insect populations, thereby preventing crop failures and \ninfestations.\n  Despite the enormous benefits we derive from our bird populations, \nmany of them are struggling to survive. Ninety species are listed as \nendangered or threatened in the United States. Another 124 species are \nof high conservation concern. The primary reason for these declines is \nthe degradation and loss of bird habitat.\n  What makes this all the more troubling is that efforts in the United \nStates to protect these birds' habitats can be of only limited utility.\n  Among bird watchers' favorites, many neotropical birds are endangered \nor of high conservation concern.\n  And several of the most popular neotropical species, including \nbluebirds, robins, goldfinches, and orioles, migrate to and from the \nCaribbean and Latin America.\n  Because neotropical migratory birds range across a number of \ninternational borders every year, we must work to establish safeguards \nat both ends of their migration routes, as well as at critical stopover \nareas along their way. Only in this way can conservation efforts prove \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. President, this is the motivation behind the ``Neotropical \nMigratory Bird Conservation Act.'' This legislation will protect bird \nhabitats across international boundaries by establishing partnerships \nbetween the business community, nongovernmental organizations and \nforeign nations.\n  By teaming businesses with international organizations concerned to \nprotect the environment we can combine capital with know-how. By \npartnering these entities with local organizations in countries where \nbird habitat is endangered we can see to it that local people receive \nthe training they need to preserve this habitat and maintain this \ncritical natural resource.\n  This act establishes an account with $8 million appropriated from the \ntreasury, to be supplemented by donations from private or public \nsources, to help establish programs in the U.S. Latin America and the \nCaribbean.\n  These programs will manage and conserve neotropical migratory bird \npopulations.\n\n[[Page S12072]]\n\n  Those eligible to participate will include national and international \ngovernmental and nongovernmental organizations and business interests, \nas well as U.S. government entities.\n  This act was formulated with the understanding that the key to \nenvironmental success is cooperation among nongovernmental \norganizations. Thus the federal share of each project's cost will never \nexceed 33 percent. In order to foster support in communities here and \nabroad, the nonfederal share for projects may be in cash or inkind \ncontributions.\n  The approach taken by this legislation is different from all-too many \nexisting programs. It is proactive, and it avoids a crisis management \napproach. I am convinced that it will prove significantly more cost \neffective than current programs.\n  In addition, Mr. President, this legislation will bring needed \nattention and expertise to areas now receiving relatively little \nattention in the area of environmental degradation.\n  By establishing partnerships between business, government and \nnongovernmental organizations both here and abroad we can greatly \nenhance the protection of migratory bird habitat throughout our \nhemisphere.\n  Mr. President, this bill is a major step forward for us, and I think \nit will be seen as one of the key environmental measures passed by this \nCongress. I thank my colleagues for the support of this legislation \nthat I have received.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed \nto, the bill be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill \nappear in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3796) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1970), as amended, was agreed to.\n\n                                S. 1970\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Neotropical Migratory Bird \n     Conservation Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) of the nearly 800 bird species known to occur in the \n     United States, approximately 500 migrate among countries, and \n     the large majority of those species, the neotropical \n     migrants, winter in Latin America and the Caribbean;\n       (2) neotropical migratory bird species provide invaluable \n     environmental, economic, recreational, and aesthetic benefits \n     to the United States, as well as to the Western Hemisphere;\n       (3)(A) many neotropical migratory bird populations, once \n     considered common, are in decline, and some have declined to \n     the point that their long-term survival in the wild is in \n     jeopardy; and\n       (B) the primary reason for the decline in the populations \n     of those species is habitat loss and degradation (including \n     pollution and contamination) across the species' range; and\n       (4)(A) because neotropical migratory birds range across \n     numerous international borders each year, their conservation \n     requires the commitment and effort of all countries along \n     their migration routes; and\n       (B) although numerous initiatives exist to conserve \n     migratory birds and their habitat, those initiatives can be \n     significantly strengthened and enhanced by increased \n     coordination.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Senator Chafee has two amendments at the desk and I ask \nfor their consideration en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for Mr. Chafee, \n     proposes amendments numbered 3798 and 3799, en bloc.\n\n  (The text of the amendments is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today the Senate will consider S. 2131, \nthe Water Resources Development Act of 1998. This measure, similar to \nwater resources legislation enacted in 1986, 1988, 19990, 1992, and \n1996, is comprised of water resources project and study authorizations \nand policy modifications for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil \nWorks program.\n  S. 2131 was introduced on June 4 of this year and was reported by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee to the full Senate on August 25, \n1998.\n  Since that time, additional project and policy requests have been \npresented to the Committee. Some have come from our Senate colleagues--\nothers have come from the administration. We have carefully reviewed \neach such request and include those that are consistent with the \nCommittee's criteria in the manager's amendment being considered along \nwith S. 2131 today. Mr. President, let me take a few moments here to \ndiscuss these criteria--that is--the criteria used by the Committee to \njudge project authorization requests.\n  On November 17, 1986, President Reagan signed into law the Water \nResources Development Act of 1986. Importantly, the 1986 Act marked an \nend to the 16-year deadlock between Congress and the Executive branch \nregarding authorization of the Army Corps Civil Works program.\n  In addition to authorizing numerous projects, the 1986 Act resolved \nlongstanding disputes relating to cost-sharing between the Army Corps \nand non-federal sponsors, waterway user fees, environmental \nrequirements and, importantly, the types of projects in which federal \ninvolvement is appropriate and warranted.\n  The criteria used to develop the legislation before us are consistent \nwith the reforms and procedures established in the landmark Water \nResources Development Act of 1986.\n  Is a project for flood control, navigation or some other purpose \ncost-shared in a manner consistent with the 1986 Act?\n  Have all of the requisite reports and studies on economic, \nengineering and environmental feasibility been completed for a project?\n  Is a project consistent with the traditional and appropriate mission \nof the Army Corps?\n  Should the Federal Government be involved?\n  These, Mr. President, are the fundamental questions that we have \napplied to each and every project included here for authorization.\n  This legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Army to construct \nsome 36 projects for flood control, navigation, and environmental \nrestoration. The bill also modifies 43 existing Army Corps projects and \nauthorizes 29 project studies. In total, this bill and the manager's \namendment authorizes an estimated Federal cost of $2.3 billion.\n  Mr. President, this legislation includes other project-specific and \ngeneral provisions related to Army Corps operations, as I mentioned at \nthe outset. Among them are two provisions sought by Senator Bond and \nothers to enhance the environment along the Missouri and Mississippi \nRivers. We have also included a modified version of the \nadministration's so-called Challenge 21 initiative to encourage more \nnon-structural flood control and environmental projects. In addition, \nwe are recommending that the cost-sharing formula be changed for \nmaintenance of future shoreline protection projects.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is vitally important for countless \nstates and communities across the country. For economic and life-safety \nreasons, we must maintain our harbors, ports and inland waterways, our \nflood control levees and shorelines, and the environment. I strongly \nurge adoption of the underlying bill and manager's amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the adoption of S. \n2131, the Water Resources Development Act of 1998. This legislation is \nour usual biennial authorization for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. \nIt includes authority to construct projects for navigation, flood \ncontrol, hurricane and storm damage reduction, emergency streambank and \nshore protection, water supply storage, recreation and ecosystem \nrestoration and protection. These projects range from harbor\n\n[[Page S12084]]\n\nimprovements in Nome, Alaska, to shore protection at Little Duval \nIsland in Florida.\n  Since this historic Water Resources Development Act of 1986, when \nproject cost-sharing was established, the Corps of Engineers has \nestablished a successful working relationship with the local sponsors \nof these projects. This partnership has proven to be beneficial for all \ninvolved, and we have continued it in this bill. This important \nprinciple, combined with technical soundness, environmental \nacceptability and economic justification guided the selection of \nprojects in this legislation.\n  The legislation also contains several changes to the Corps' program. \nIt established new continuing authorities program that would allow the \nCorps of Engineers to undertake nonstructural flood control projects. \nIt changes the periodic beach renourishment cost-share from the current \n65 percent Federal, 35 percent non-Federal, to 50 percent Federal, 50 \npercent non-Federal. And it allows the Corps to use recreation fees \ncollected above the current baseline to remain at the park where they \nwere collected to be used for maintenance.\n  The legislation contains 2 provisions that are very important to my \nState of Montana. One provision would allow the Corps of Engineers to \nprovided needed emergency streambank stabilization in Billings, \nMontana. Another provision directs the Secretary of the Army, in \ncooperation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. \nGeological Survey, the Natural Resource Conservation Service, the State \nof Montana and all local interests to conduct a comprehensive study of \nthe cumulative impacts of activities on the Yellowstone River. This \nstudy will give us a better understanding of how the natural flow and \nthe man-made structures can best protect the river and its habitat.\n  I thank Senators Chafee and Warner and all members who worked with \nus.\n  I urge the passage of this bill and swift consideration by the House \nin order to enact this legislation in the Congress.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the distinguished \nmanagers of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1998 have \nagreed to incorporate into the managers' package several provisions \nwhich I have proposed. These cover Michigan projects, Great Lakes Basin \nmatters, and contaminated sediments. I am hopeful that the House will \nexpedite passage of this important matter before concluding legislative \nbusiness this session.\n  There are several specific items in the managers' package that will \nbenefit Michigan. They include an Army Corps of Engineers' feasibility \nstudy of improvements to the Detroit River waterfront between the Belle \nIsle Bridge and the Ambassador Bridge, as part of the ongoing \nrevitalization of that area. The Corps will also prepare studies for \nflood control projects in St. Clair Shores and along the Saginaw River \nin Bay City to see what types of structures will be necessary to \nprotect shorelines and property. Similarly, the Corps will consider \nreconstruction of the Hamilton Dam flood control project. And, lastly, \nthe Corps will review its denial of the city of Charlevoix's request \nfor reimbursement of construction costs that it incurred in building a \nnew revetment connection to the Federal navigation project at \nCharlevoix Harbor.\n  Mr. President, I would like to bring my colleagues' attention to my \nproposal, now in the amended bill, that the Great Lakes Basin program \nbe named the ``John Glenn Great Lakes Basin program.'' This is a small \ntribute to our colleague for the hard work that he has done to promote \nand protect the Great Lakes Basin region. As Democratic Co-Chairman of \nthe Senate Great Lakes Task Force and as a former Chairman and now \nRanking Member of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, he has \nlong advocated common sense and efficiency in government. He has sought \nto coordinate Federal research, regulatory, and conservation activities \nin the Great Lakes region for many years in areas as diverse as \nshipping and wildlife restoration. The provisions in the ``John Glenn \nGreat Lakes Basin program'' are intended to echo his fine work and \nenhance coordination in Corps' programs in the region and in Federal \nactivities relating to diversion and consumption of Great Lakes Basin \nwaters. The specifics of the program, including a special study on the \nwestern Lake Erie watershed, are as follows:\n  Strategic Plans. The Army Corps of Engineers is directed to develop a \nframework for their activities in the Great Lakes basin to be updated \nbiennially. Many Army Corps of Engineers divisions have developed and \nuse such strategic plans. Development of such a strategic plan for the \nGreat Lakes Basin has never been more important than at present, given \nthe potential implications of the restructuring plans for the Great \nLakes and Ohio River Division.\n  Great Lakes Biohydrological Information. The Army Corps of Engineers \nis directed to inventory existing information relevant to the Great \nLakes biohydrological system and sustainable water use management. The \nCorps is then to report the results of this inventory, including \nrecommendations on ways to improve the information base, to Congress, \nthe International Joint Commission and the eight Great Lakes states. \nThe report will consider and update Congress on the status of the \nissues and the recommendations described in two IJC reports regarding \ndiversion and consumptive uses of Great Lakes waters and Lake levels. \nThis information will be crucial in ongoing debate regarding the \ncontinued attempts to export or divert Great Lakes surface and ground \nwater out of the Basin.\n  Great Lakes Recreational Boating. The amendment directs the Army \nCorps of Engineers to submit to Congress a report based on existing \ninformation detailing the economic benefits of recreational boating in \nthe Great Lakes Basin. As many of my colleagues may know, despite \nCongress' repeated objections, consecutive Administrations have \nunwisely sought to limit the Corps' role in dredging so-called \nrecreational harbors. Clearly, these harbors' value should and can be \nrecognized in the cost-benefit analysis conducted in making dredging \ndecisions.\n  Water Use Activities and Policies. The amendment would allow the \nSecretary to provide technical assistance to the Great Lakes States to \ndevelop interstate guidelines to improve the consistency and efficiency \nof State-level water use activities and policies in the Great Lakes \nBasin.\n  Sea Lamprey Control Barriers. The amendment clarifies that the Army \nCorps of Engineers may use Section 1135 funds to construct sea lamprey \nbarriers at any site in the Great Lakes. As my colleagues may know, the \ninvasive sea lamprey species was introduced into the Great Lakes \nthrough construction of the Welland Canal, making control of the \nlamprey clearly a Federal responsibility. Sea lamprey barriers are \namong the most cost-effective methods available for the control of \nlamprey in the Great Lakes and use of Corps expertise, especially in \nconjunction with existing projects, helps to make this management tool \nas effective and efficient as possible.\n  Study on Western Lake Erie watershed. This regional study for the \nwestern basin of Lake Erie is a pilot project for efforts in the region \nto understand the synergistic relationships within a natural watershed \nand the interplay of human economic, agricultural and commercial \ndevelopment with environmental quality objectives.\n  Mr. President, once again, I'd like to recognize Senator Glenn for \nhis dedication and devotion to the Great Lakes region, even when it \nmight have caused him some political difficulties at home. He was a \nstaunch supporter of the Great Lakes Water Quality Initiative, which \ncame under great attack from various places around the Lakes. Senator \nGlenn happened to have some of the most vociferous opponents in his \nstate, but that never stopped him from advocating for uniform water \nquality criteria across the Basin. All of us in the Great Lakes will \nalways be indebted to him for his support on that measure. By the way, \nmy colleagues might be interested to know that implementation of the \nGreat Lakes Initiative is proceeding nicely in all eight Great Lakes \nStates.\n  Mr. President, the managers have incorporated another very important \nmatter which I have been pressing them and Federal agencies on for some\n\n[[Page S12085]]\n\ntime. The subject is aquatic contaminated sediments and they are a \npotential threat to public and environmental health across the country. \nEPA has begun to document this problem in the National Inventory of \nContaminated Sediments released earlier this year. That inventory \nidentifies 96 areas of probable concern which Congress and the public \nshould be concerned about and which require appropriate remedial \nactions.\n\n  The provisions which I requested will require the Army Corps of \nEngineers and the Environmental Protection Agency to finally activate \nthe National Contaminated Sediment Task Force that was mandated by the \nWater Resources Development Act of 1992. I am hopeful that convening \nthis Task Force will encourage the Federal agencies to work together to \ncombat this problem and create greater public awareness of the need to \naddress contaminated sediments. And, the Task Force will be required to \nreport to Congress on Federal actions to clean up contaminated \nsediments around the country. The Assistant Secretary of the Army for \nCivil Works has assured me by letter that the Army will support the \nconvening of the Task Force.\n  As the managers may know, WRDA 92 required the creation of a Task \nForce to advise EPA and the Corps in implementation of the National \nContaminated Sediment Assessment and Management Act, to review and \ncomment on specific issues, including the extent and seriousness of the \nproblem and research and development priorities, and to make \nrecommendations on prevention and source control. WRDA 92 required the \nTask Force to report to Congress with findings and recommendations \nwithin two years of enactment of that Act. Though some time has \nelapsed, the Task Force's responsibility to comply with that reporting \nrequirement and other statutory responsibilities has not. I fully \nexpect to see that the Task Force complies with its statutory \nrequirements under WRDA 92 and this Act and will be working to make \nthat happen. I will be doing whatever I can to help the Task Force \nprovide Congress with useful advice on contaminated sediment management \nin advance of reauthorization of Superfund, the Clean Water Act, RCRA \nand other pertinent laws.\n  Mr. President, contaminated sediments can pose a serious and \ndemonstrable risk to human health and the environment. Persistent, \nbioaccumulative toxic substances in contaminated sediment can poison \nthe food chain, making fish and shellfish unsafe for humans and \nwildlife to eat. Potential costs to society include long term health \neffects such as cancer and children's neurological and IQ impairment. \nContamination of sediments can also interfere with recreational uses \nand increase the costs of and time needed for navigational dredging and \nsubsequent disposal of dredged material.\n  Since enactment of the Great Lakes Critical Program Act of 1990, and \nthe National Contaminated Sediment Assessment and Management Act of \n1992, the Nation has gained considerable experience and understanding \nabout sediment contamination. As I have mentioned, the report on the \nIncidence and Severity of Sediment Contamination in Surface Waters of \nthe United States, required under section 503 of the National \nContaminated Sediment Assessment and Management Act of 1992, identified \n96 areas of probable concern where contaminated sediments pose \npotential risks to fish and wildlife, and to people who eat fish from \nthem\n  The Assessment and Remediation of Contaminated Sediments (ARCS) \nprogram under the Clean Water Act, and subsequent studies, have \ndemonstrated that there are some effective tools for determining the \nextent and magnitude of sediment contamination, for assessing risk and \nmodeling the changes that would result from remedial action, and for \ninvolving the public in solutions. Prompt response after discovery of \nsediment contamination can prevent subsequent spread through storm \nevents and minimize environmental impacts and response costs.\n  Unfortunately, the resources of the Federal Government have not been \nbrought to bear on these problems in a well coordinated fashion. That \nis the principle reason for pursuing the convening of the Task Force. \nBut, we also need a better understanding of the quantities and sources \nof sediment contamination, to prevent subsequent recontamination and \nminimize the recurrence of these costs and impacts, and to get a handle \non the extent of the public health threat. To that end, my provision \nrequires the Task Force to document in a report the status of remedial \naction on contaminated sediments around the country, including a \ndescription of the authorities used in cleanup, the nature and sources \nof sediment contamination, the methods for determining the need for \ncleanup, the fate of dredged materials, and barriers to swift \nremediation.\n  The response to releases of contaminated sediments should reflect the \nrisk associated with the contamination, and remedies should reflect the \nbeneficial reuse of contaminants. To respond to the serious \nenvironmental risks that can be posed by contaminated sediment sites, \nthe Federal Government should use funding and enforcement authorities \nof existing programs to help remediate these sites.\n  Last year, the National Research Council's Committee on Contaminated \nMarine Sediment published a report on Contaminated Sediments in Ports \nand Waterways: Cleanup Strategies and Technologies. That report \nhighlights the problems with the existing regulatory framework for \naddressing sediment contamination. While the EPA has put out a \n``Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy'', the regulatory issues \nraised by the NAS clearly go beyond the scope of the authority of any \nsingle agency.\n  It is likely that the Clean Water Act, Superfund, and the next \nbiennial Water Resources Development Act will all be under \nconsideration in the next Congress. Prompt development of an \ninteragency strategy that addresses the problems identified by the \nsurvey and the regulatory and technological issues raised by NAS could \nmake a substantial contribution to helping inform decisionmakers on \nappropriate legislative changes. It is important that the agencies and \nthe Task Force pay close attention to the analysis and recommendations \nin the 1997 NAS report.\n  The NAS report clearly sets out the problems posed by the existing \nstatutory and regulatory framework. It is also clear on the stakes \ninvolved, observing that: ``The presence of contaminated sediments \nposes a barrier to essential waterway maintenance and construction in \nmany ports, which support approximately 95 percent of U.S. foreign \ntrade.''\n  NAS identifies the ``complex and sometimes inconsistent regulatory \nframework'' as one of the key challenges in managing contaminated \nsediment, observing that ``at least six comprehensive acts of Congress, \nwith responsibilities spread over seven Federal agencies, govern \nsediment remediation or dredging operations in settings that range from \nthe open ocean to the freshwater reaches of estuaries and wetlands.'' \nMany of the applicable authorities were not originally designed to \naddress contaminated sediments, and questions of risk and costs are not \nconsidered in a consistent way across the statutes.\n  The NAS also observes that\n\n       . . . current laws and regulations affecting contaminated \n     sediments can impede efforts to implement the best management \n     practices and achieve efficient, risk-based, and cost-\n     effective solutions. This is a shortcoming of the governing \n     statutes, not a criticism of regulatory agencies charged with \n     implementing them. The timeliness of decision making is also \n     an issue, given that it typically takes years to implement \n     solutions to contaminated sediments problems. In the \n     committee's case histories, the delay between the discovery \n     of a problem and the implementation of a solution ranged from \n     approximately 3 to 15 years.\n\n       However, there are no risk-based cleanup standards for \n     underwater sediments. Insufficient attention to risks, costs, \n     and benefits impedes efforts to reach technically sound \n     decisions and mange sediments cost-effectively. Similar \n     inattention to risk is evident in the permitting processes \n     for sediment disposal.\n\n  NAS concludes that\n\n       In the committee's view, cost-effective management of \n     contaminated marine sediments will require a multifaceted \n     campaign as well as a willingness to innovate.\n\n  The Task Force is set up to involve different agencies and levels of \ngovernment, including States that have pioneered innovative approaches \nfor intergovernmental collaboration.\n  The NAS report did not actually make specific recommendations for \nstatutory language changes. That would be the function of the Task\n\n[[Page S12086]]\n\nForce and would require the participation and input of the affected \nFederal agencies on the Task Force and the representatives on the Task \nForce from the States, public interest groups with a demonstrated \ninterest in the matter, and from the ports, agriculture or \nmanufacturing sectors. Also, the existence and advice of the Task Force \nshould help eliminate Congress' perennial need to deal with \ncontaminated sediments in minute detail for individual watersheds.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear that convening the Task Force \nshould not provide an excuse for delay or more inaction. The NAS has \nalready spoken against delay. The report observes that: . . . there is \nno reason to delay urgent projects in anticipation of new technological \nsolutions; decision makers should continue to try to make incremental \nimprovements in the overall management process,. . .'' and that, ``The \nneed to meet these challenges [posed by contaminated sediment \nmanagement] is urgent.''\n  I appreciate my colleagues assistance in incorporating this and the \nother matters I have discussed into the managers' amendment to S. 2131. \nI look forward to working with them to get these important provisions \nsigned into law.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of S. 2131, the Water \nResources Development Act of 1998, and the Committee amendment, which \nprovide for the development and improvement of our Nation's water \nresources infrastructure. This legislation authorizes water resource \nprojects of vital importance to our nation's and our states' economy \nand maritime industry as well as our environment.\n  I am particularly pleased that the measure includes a number of \nprovisions for which I have fought to ensure the future health of the \nPort of Baltimore and of Maryland's environment.\n  First the bill authorizes nearly $28 million for needed improvements \nto Baltimore Harbor Anchorages and Channels. Many of the existing \nanchorages and branch channels within Baltimore Harbor were built in \nthe first half of this century and are no longer deep enough, wide \nenough or long enough to accommodate the vessels now calling on the \nPort of Baltimore. Many of the larger ships must now anchor some 25 \nmiles south of Baltimore in naturally deep water, resulting in delays \nand increased costs to the shipping industry. Also, the narrow widths \nof some of the branch channels result in additional time for the pilots \nto maneuver safely to and from their docking berths. In June 1998 the \nChief of Engineers approved a report which recommended a number of \nimprovements including: 1) widening and deepening Federal anchorages 3 \nand 4; 2) widening and providing flared corners for state-owned East \nDundalk, Seagirt, Connecting and West Dundalk branch Channels; 3) \ndredging a new branch channel at South Locust Point; and 4) dredging a \nturning basin at the head of the Fort McHenry Channel. The report \nidentified the project as ``technically sound, economically justified \nand environmentally and socially acceptable.'' This project has been a \ntop priority of mine, of the Maryland Port Administration and of the \nshipping community for many years and I am delighted that this \nlegislation will enable us to move forward with this important project.\n  Second, the legislation directs the Corps of Engineers to make \ncritically needed safety improvements to the Tolchester Channel in the \nChesapeake Bay. The Tolchester Channel is a vital link in the Baltimore \nPort system. It was authorized in the River and Harbor Act of 1958 and \naligned to take advantage of the naturally deep water in the Chesapeake \nBay, along Maryland's Eastern Shore. This alignment, which is shaped \nlike an ``S,'' has posed a serious navigation problem and safety risks \nfor vessels. Ships must change course five times within three miles, \noften beginning a new turn, sometimes in the opposite direction, before \ncompleting a first turn. With vessels nearly 1,000 feet in length, it \nis difficult to safely navigate the channel, particularly in poor \nweather conditions. The U.S. Coast Guard and the Maryland Pilots \nAssociation have expressed serious concerns over the safety of the area \nand have long recommended straightening of the channel due to the \ngrounding and ``near misses'' which have occurred in the area. The cost \nfor straightening the Tolchester ``S-turn'' is estimated at $12.6 \nmillion with $1.3 million coming from non-federal sources. This \nauthorization enables the Corps to proceed expeditiously with these \nimprovements and address the serious concerns of those who must \nnavigate the treacherous channel.\n  Mr. President, the Port of Baltimore is one of the great ports of the \nworld and one of Maryland's most important economic assets. The Port \ngenerates $2 billion in annual economic activity, provides for an \nestimated 62,000 jobs, and over $500 million a year in State and local \ntax revenues and customs receipts. These two projects will help assure \nthe continued vitality of the Port of Baltimore into the 21st Century.\n  In addition to port development and improvement projects, the measure \ncontains a provision which will help significantly to enhance \nMaryland's environment and quality of life and help achieve the goals \nand vision of the Potomac American Heritage River designation.\n  It authorizes $15 million for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to \nmodify the existing flood protection project at Cumberland, Maryland to \nrestore features of the historic Chesapeake and Ohio Canal adversely \naffected by construction and operation of the project. Mr. President, \nthe C Canal is widely regarded as the Nation's finest relic of \nAmerica's canal building era. It was begun in 1828 as a transportation \nroute between commercial centers in the East and frontier resources of \nthe West. It reached Cumberland in 1850 and continued operating until \n1924 when it succumbed to floods and financial failure. In the early \n1950's, a section of the Canal and turning basin at its Cumberland \nterminus was filled in by the Corps of Engineers during construction of \na local flood protection project. Portions of the Canal were proclaimed \na national monument in 1961 and it was officially established as a \nnational historical park in 1971. Justice Douglas described the park \n``. . . not yet marred by the roar of wheels and the sound of horns . . \n. The stretch of 185 miles of country from Washington to Cumberland, \nMaryland, is one of the most fascinating and picturesque in the \nNation.''\n  The National Park Service, as part of its General Management Plan for \nthe Park, has long sought to rebuild and re-water the Canal at its \nCumberland terminus. The NPS entered into a Memorandum of Agreement \n(MOA) with the Corps to undertake a study of the feasibility of \nreconstructing the last 2200 feet of the canal to the terminus, through \nand adjacent to the Corps' flood protection project. The Corps \ncompleted this study in July 1995 and determined that ``it is feasible \nto re-water the canal successfully; the canal and flood protection \nlevee can co-exist on the site without compromising the flood \nprotection for the City of Cumberland; re-construction and partial \noperation of the locks is feasible; and, based on the as-built \ninformation available, underground utility impacts can be mitigated at \nreasonable cost to allow construction of the canal and turning basin in \nbasically the same alignment and configuration as the original canal.'' \nA subsequent Rewatering Design Analysis estimated the total project \ncost at $15 million. This authorization will enable the Corps to \nproceed with restoring a 1.1 mile stretch of the C Canal and \nrevitalize the area as a major hub for tourism and economic \ndevelopment.\n  I want to compliment the distinguished Chairmen of the Committee and \nthe Subcommittee, Senators Chafee and Warner, and the ranking member, \nSenator Baucus, for their leadership in crafting this legislation and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n\n\n                   Savannah Harbor Deepening Project\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I rise to request that the Chairman of \nthe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee help me to clarify \nthe intent of the Savannah Harbor Expansion Project authorization that \nappears in Section 102 of the 1998 Water Resources Development \nAuthorization Act. It is my understanding that this legislation \nauthorizes a project to deepen the Savannah River channel to a depth of \nup to 48 feet subject to a favorable report by the Chief of Engineers \nand a favorable recommendation of the Secretary by December 31, 1998.\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. The senior Senator from Georgia is correct.\n\n[[Page S12087]]\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding as well, that \nboth the Chief of Engineer's Tier I Environmental Impact Statement and \nFeasibility Report provide for the establishment of a stakeholders' \nevaluation group which will have early and consistent involvement in \nthe project, and as part of the process, the EIS requires the \ndevelopment of a mitigation plan to fully and adequately address \npredicted and potential adverse impacts on, among other things, the \nSavannah National Wildlife Refuge; striped base population; short-nose \nsturgeon; salt water and fresh water wetlands; chloride levels; \ndissolved oxygen levels; erosion; and historical resources. Is that \ncorrect?\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is my further understanding that \nbefore this project is carried out, the Secretary, in consultation with \naffected Federal and non-Federal entities, must develop a mitigation \nplan addressing adverse project impacts and that the plan must be \nimplemented in advance of or concurrent with project construction and \nmust ensure that the project cost estimates are sufficient to address \nall potential mitigation alternatives. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. That is correct.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Chairman for his assistance and look \nforward to working with him on this important matter.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Would the Chairman yield for two additional questions on \nthis project?\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. I would be happy to answer any questions the Senator may \nhave.\n  Mr. CLELAND. It is my understanding that the authorization language \nprovides that neither the Secretary nor the Georgia Ports Authority \nwill proceed with the design or construction of the project until the \nrespective department heads concur on an appropriate implementation \nplan and mitigation plan. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. That is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Any funds to be appropriated by Congress for the project \nmust be allocated in a manner that ensures that project impacts are \nfully and adequately mitigated and are otherwise consistent with the \nmitigation plan developed by the Secretary and the stakeholder \nevaluation group. Is that correct?\n  Mr. CHAFFEE. That is correct.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to clarify \nthese understandings.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the amendments be agreed \nto en bloc, the committee substitute be agreed to, the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3798 and 3799) were agreed to.\n  The committee substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2131), as amended, was passed.\n  [The bill was not available for printing.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to \nthe consideration of Calendar No. 519, S. 361.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 361) to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1994 \n     to prohibit the sale, import and export of products labeled \n     as containing endangered species, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nbill, which had been reported from the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works, with an amendment to strike all after the enacting clause \nand inserting in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rhinoceros and Tiger \n     Conservation Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the populations of all but 1 species of rhinoceros, and \n     the tiger, have significantly declined in recent years and \n     continue to decline;\n       (2) these species of rhinoceros and tiger are listed as \n     endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and listed on Appendix I of the \n     Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n     Wild Fauna and Flora, signed on March 3, 1973 (27 UST 1087; \n     TIAS 8249) (referred to in this Act as ``CITES'');\n       (3) the Parties to CITES have adopted several resolutions--\n       (A) relating to the conservation of tigers (Conf. 9.13 \n     (Rev.)) and rhinoceroses (Conf. 9.14), urging Parties to \n     CITES to implement legislation to reduce illegal trade in \n     parts and products of the species; and\n       (B) relating to trade in readily recognizable parts and \n     products of the species (Conf. 9.6), and trade in traditional \n     medicines (Conf. 10.19), recommending that Parties ensure \n     that their legislation controls trade in those parts and \n     derivatives, and in medicines purporting to contain them;\n       (4) a primary cause of the decline in the populations of \n     tiger and most rhinoceros species is the poaching of the \n     species for use of their parts and products in traditional \n     medicines;\n       (5) there are insufficient legal mechanisms enabling the \n     United States Fish and Wildlife Service to interdict products \n     that are labeled as containing substances derived from \n     rhinoceros or tiger species and prosecute the merchandisers \n     for sale or display of those products; and\n       (6) legislation is required to ensure that--\n       (A) products containing rhinoceros parts or tiger parts are \n     prohibited from importation into, or exportation from, the \n     United States; and\n       (B) efforts are made to educate persons regarding \n     alternatives for traditional medicine products, the \n     illegality of products containing rhinoceros parts and tiger \n     parts, and the need to conserve rhinoceros and tiger species \n     generally.\n\n     SEC. 3.

The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords], for Mr. Chafee, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 3797.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 5, line 23, insert ``or advertised'' after \n     ``labeled''.\n       On page 6, line 4, insert ``, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing,'' after ``containing''.\n       On page 6, line 9, insert ``, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing,'' after ``containing''.\n       On page 7, line 20, insert ``OR ADVERTISED'' after \n     ``LABELED''.\n       On page 8, line 2, insert ``OR ADVERTISED'' after \n     ``LABELED''.\n       On page 10, line 17, insert ``or advertised'' after \n     ``labeled''.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering S. 361, sponsored by Senator Jeffords and approved by the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works on July 22, 1998. Rhinos and \ntigers are some of the most critically endangered species on the \nplanet. Fewer than 7,500 tigers survive in the world today, and of the \neight subspecies that have been identified, three are extinct. Another \nsubspecies in South China is on the brink of extinction, with a \npopulation of about 20 animals.\n  Rhinos number between 11,000 and 13,500, with two species in Africa \nand three in Asia. Two of the Asian species themselves are on the verge \nof extinction, with the Javan rhino having less than 100 individuals, \nand the Sumatran rhino having less than 500.\n  The reason for the recent decline of rhinos and tigers, and the \nprimary immediate threat to their survival is the same--poaching. The \nreason for the poaching itself is also the same--parts of both rhinos \nand tigers are used in traditional Asian medicines.\n  In 1994, Congress passed the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act to \nhelp conserve rhinos and tigers. The Act established the ``Rhinoceros \nand Tiger Conservation Fund'' to receive funds appropriated by \nCongress, as well as donations, to fund conservation projects. Since \nits enactment, Congress has appropriated $1 million for the program, \nfunding 40 projects in 10 range countries in Africa and Asia.\n  Despite this program and recent efforts by the Parties to CITES, \ntrade of traditional Asian medicine containing rhino and tiger parts \ncontinues to be high, particularly in Asia and the United States. \nNeither the ESA not CITES allow for the interdiction of products that \nare labeled or advertised as containing substances derived from rhinos \nor tigers, without evidence that the products in fact contain these \nsubstances. Such evidence, at best, would be extremely difficult, \nexpensive, and time-consuming to acquire, and at worst, would be \nimpossible to acquire.\n  The bill amends the Rhinoceros and Tiger Conservation Act to address \nthis problem. It prohibits products that contain, or are labeled or \nadvertised as containing, rhino and tiger parts, in an effort to reduce \nthe supply and demand of those products in the United States. It \nrequires a public outreach program in the United States to complement \nthe prohibitions. Lastly, it reauthorizes the Rhinoceros and Tiger \nConservation Act through 2002.\n  As a related matter, I would like to note that even as Congress \nreaffirms and strengthens the laws for the conservation of rhinos and \ntigers, funding for implementation of these laws is woefully \ninadequate. This year--the Year of the Tiger--the Administration \nrequested only $400,000 for implementing the Rhinoceros and Tiger \nConservation Act. The Act is authorized to be appropriated up to $10 \nmillion annually. I strongly urge the Administration, for FY 2000, to \nrequest funding commensurate with the dire situation facing rhinos, and \nparticularly tigers, in the wild. I also would like to note that the \nAct allows for donations to be made to the Rhinoceros and Tiger \nConservation Fund, and I urge both corporations and individuals to make \ndonations to this Fund.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for considering this bill, and I urge \nthe House to approve it expeditiously, so that it can then be signed by \nthe President. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to, the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be considered read a third \ntime and passed, the amendment to the title be agreed to, and the \ntitle, as amended, be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 3797) was agreed to.\n  The committee substitute, as amended, was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 361), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rhinoceros and Tiger \n     Conservation Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the populations of all but 1 species of rhinoceros, and \n     the tiger, have significantly declined in recent years and \n     continue to decline;\n       (2) these species of rhinoceros and tiger are listed as \n     endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) and listed on Appendix I of the \n     Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of \n     Wild Fauna and Flora, signed on March 3, 1973 (27 UST 1087; \n     TIAS 8249) (referred to in this Act as ``CITES'');\n       (3) the Parties to CITES have adopted several resolutions--\n       (A) relating to the conservation of tigers (Conf. 9.13 \n     (Rev.)) and rhinoceroses (Conf. 9.14), urging Parties to \n     CITES to implement legislation to reduce illegal trade in \n     parts and products of the species; and\n       (B) relating to trade in readily recognizable parts and \n     products of the species (Conf. 9.6), and trade in traditional \n     medicines (Conf. 10.19), recommending that Parties ensure \n     that their legislation controls trade in those parts and \n     derivatives, and in medicines purporting to contain them;\n       (4) a primary cause of the decline in the populations of \n     tiger and most rhinoceros species is the poaching of the \n     species for use of their parts and products in traditional \n     medicines;\n       (5) there are insufficient legal mechanisms enabling the \n     United States Fish and Wildlife Service to interdict products \n     that are labeled or advertised as containing substances \n     derived from rhinoceros or tiger species and prosecute the \n     merchandisers for sale or display of those products; and\n       (6) legislation is required to ensure that--\n       (A) products containing, or labeled or advertised as \n     containing, rhinoceros parts or tiger parts are prohibited \n     from importation into, or exportation from, the United \n     States; and\n       (B) efforts are made to educate persons regarding \n     alternatives for traditional medicine products, the \n     illegality of products containing, or labeled or advertised \n     as containing, rhinoceros parts and tiger parts, and the need \n     to conserve rhinoceros and tiger species generally.\n\n     SEC. 3.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4293 which was received from the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4293) to establish a cultural training program \n     for disadvantaged individuals to assist the Irish peace \n     process.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on May 22, 1998, the people of Northern \nIreland and the Republic of Ireland courageously voted to make a break \nwith the tragic violence of their past by expressing their support for \nthe April 10 Peace Accords.\n  The time is right for the U.S. to step in and show support for the \nchanges in Ireland. We have a unique opportunity to participate in the \nbuilding of an everlasting peace with the Northern Ireland Visa for \nPeace and Reconciliation Act.\n  Northern Ireland will undergo massive changes as it progresses beyond \nits violent past to a calm, more peaceful future. These changes require \neconomic opportunities and a workforce that can rebuild a beautiful \ncountry.\n  The U.S. can offer training and job skills. More importantly, when \nthey return home, they will be prepared to provide the crucial skill-\nbase needed to attract private investment to their local economies.\n  This past July, Senator Torricelli and I introduced S. 2269 set up \nfor the same purpose. After much negotiation, we now have before us a \nbipartisan effort to show support for peace--the Irish Peace Process \nCultural and Training Program Act of 1998.\n  This bill will provide 4,000 visas a year for three years allowing \nyoung people from Ireland to live in the United States for up to 36 \nmonths--gaining experience working and living in a peaceful, \nmulticultural society.\n  The bill establishes a program that will expose individuals from \ndisadvantaged areas of Ireland to business and social life of other \ncommunities and train individuals for job skills for which there are \nopportunities in Ireland. That translates into a low-cost, low-risk, \nhigh return investment in peace in Northern Ireland.\n  This bill will provide opportunities for residents of Ireland to have \nan experience that they can bring home with them to cultivate their \neconomy and culture as the region enters into a new and promising era. \nThat is why it is called the Northern Ireland Visa for Peace and \nReconciliation Act. And I hope we call it law very soon. I believe some \ncall it INNISFAILE, Island of Destiny.\n  I want to congratulate Congressman Walsh and so many others for their \nvision and persistence in getting this bill passed and I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be considered \nread a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4293) was passed.\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/10/08/senate-section/article/S12089-1", "month": "10", "year": "1998"}]
