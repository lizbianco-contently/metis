Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, it is \nmy hope that the Senate will be able to make a great deal of progress \nthis week. We have a number of votes that already have been agreed to \nand we have several bills that we may be able to consider before the \nweek is out.\n  Today it had been my understanding that we would be able to begin \nconsideration of S. 830, the Food and Drug Administration reform bill. \nI understand that there would be an objection to proceeding to that \nmeasure at this time. I certainly regret that. I don't understand why \nthat is the case. I had been told on Friday that, after a lot of \nlaborious negotiations, agreement had been reached.\n  Certainly we need to pass this legislation. There are very few \norganizations in this city that are more in need of reform than the FDA \nwhich, for years, has been bureaucratic; it has been dilatory; it has \ndelayed access for the American people to medical procedures that \nclearly should have been approved earlier, that are available in other \ncountries, including Great Britain; they delayed approval of drugs that \ncould mean a great deal of comfort to Americans. At the same time, they \nhave been over trying to push into other areas where they really have \nno business. So, to say the least, I have a very low regard for the \nFDA, and they are long overdue for reform.\n  This legislation has been pending in the Senate both last year and \nthis year. The chairman of the committee of education and labor has \nreported that bill out. Negotiations have been underway with a number \nof Senators, including Senator Mack, Senator Frist, Senator Kennedy, \nand I presume Senator Durbin, and I thought that all had come to \nresolution. But it appears now that we will not be able to go forward \nwith it at this time. But we will continue to look for an opportunity \nto get that done this week.\n\n  As all Senators are aware, this is the last week of legislative \nbusiness prior to the August adjournment for our State work periods. \nThere are a number of important issues that will be considered this \nweek, including the conference reports on the budget, Balanced Budget \nAct of 1997, and the Tax Relief Act. I get a lot of inquiries about \nthat, will we do it or not? Have we reached an agreement with the \nadministration or not?\n  Negotiations continue; they continued throughout the weekend. There \nwere communications on Friday, meetings on Saturday, a number of \ncommunications back and forth between the Congress and the \nadministration all through the day yesterday, all the way up until \nabout 9:15 or 9:30 last night, and there are negotiations underway now \nwith the exchange of paperwork as to exactly what these issues may \nmean. Some of them are pretty complicated, in terms of the formulas \nthat will be used--how do you define a benefits package where the \nStates and the Governors and the legislators have the maximum \nflexibility in providing the services for the needs of the children in \ntheir respective States? But I would have to say, I think we are very \nclose. I continue to be relatively optimistic.\n  I must say, this agreement on both the spending bill and the tax \nrelief\n\n[[Page S8162]]\n\npackage is worth having. I hope we will continue to try to come to a \nconclusion today, if at all possible.\n  We will be completing work also this week on the Commerce, State, \nJustice appropriations bill as well as the Department of Transportation \nappropriations bill.\n  Previous agreement was entered into also last week to complete action \non S. 39, the tuna-dolphin bill, early this week. So we expect that \nsometime in the next 2 days we will have a 30-minute time for debate \nand possibly a recorded vote, but a vote of some sort on the compromise \nthat was worked out on that issue last Friday.\n  At 5 p.m. this afternoon, the Senate will begin consideration of the \nTransportation appropriations bill. We hope to get most of the work \ndone on that appropriations bill tonight, done tonight. There will be \nno rollcall votes today.\n  Tomorrow morning the Senate will be scheduled to have a series of \nvotes, or we were scheduled to have a series of votes with debate \nbeginning at 8:30 and votes occurring, I believe, beginning at 9:30, on \nthe Commerce, State, Justice appropriations bill, but we understand \nthat there is a memorial service for Justice Brennan that will be held \non Tuesday morning, so it may be necessary to delay these votes and, as \nalways, Members will be notified exactly when that will be. There will \nbe some stacked votes, I don't know right now whether it's 2, 3, or 4, \nwith relation to Commerce, State, Justice. But it will be later in the \nmorning or in the early afternoon, so we can accommodate Senators who \nwould like to attend the memorial service. Then we can complete action \non the bill.\n  I had hoped we would have agreement on the spending and on the tax \nrelief bill early enough that we could actually get started on it on \nTuesday morning. It looks like we will not be able to do that, but we \nstill want to get the final votes on the State, Justice, Commerce \nappropriations bill as soon as we can and be prepared to move swiftly \nto the budget agreements once they are reached.\n\n  I thank all Senators for their cooperation. I know this will be, \nagain, a hectic week. But I believe we can complete 2 more \nappropriations bills which will put us at 10, leaving only 3 that we \nwould have to work on when we return in September. That is an \nincredible pace, and I am very pleased with the cooperation that we \nhave had in getting that done. I hope we can continue that. We also, \nagain, hope to complete action on two or three other bills; most \nimportant, the budget agreements. When that is completed, of course, we \nwould then have an opportunity to turn to the Executive Calendar also.\n  Mr. President, I would like to hear from the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont as to what is the state of negotiations regarding the Food \nand Drug Administration reform package. I know he has worked very hard \non it. We hope to get that done this week. I would be glad to hear his \nimpressions of how we are going to do that.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would be happy to enlighten the body \nas to where we stand. It is my understanding we have an agreement. \nHowever, it appears an objection will be raised if we try to move \nforward at this time. So, I would just alert everyone that I believe we \nhave an agreement and that we will be able to move forward this week.\n  There are, as is always the case when you go to bring a measure \nforward, people who decide suddenly they want to be involved in the \nprocess. We will try to accommodate them. I know there are several \nMembers who are out of the country right now and will be back later \ntoday. So, I don't intend to call up the FDA Act at this time, but I \nwill, with the indulgence of the President, move forward, I suppose as \nin morning business, and discuss where we are on the bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8161-5", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to say at the outset that I \nhave the highest respect for the Senator from Vermont. The Senator has \ndone a great deal of work on one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation which we will consider during the course of this Congress. \nAlthough I am not a member of his committee, I have an abiding interest \nin the Food and Drug Administration. For 12 years in the House I was a \nmember of the subcommittee which funded the Food and Drug \nAdministration. I was called on many times to get involved in issues \nrelated to this important agency.\n  It is an extraordinary agency. By Federal standards it is tiny. About \n$1 billion each year out of our $1.6 trillion budget is spent on the \nbudget of the Food and Drug Administration. Yet every one of us, every \nAmerican family, depends on the Food and Drug Administration. Many of \nthe products which we take for granted are reviewed by them for safety \nso that our families can use them and feel confident that the product \nis safe for that use. Thus, when there have been efforts to reform the \nFood and Drug Administration, I have been very attentive. Some people \nare looking to reform the Food and Drug Administration for selfish \nreasons. Others are looking to reform the Food and Drug Administration \nfor the right reasons. I believe the Senator from Vermont falls in the \nlatter category. I believe he is trying to reform the FDA for the right \nreasons.\n  He and I may have a few differences of opinion, I think very few, and \nI hope that we have a chance, when this bill comes to the floor, to \nactually address them and perhaps, in the quiet of an off-the-floor \nconversation, we may come to an agreement on each of these items that I \nwould like to discuss. But I salute him for the hard work which he has \ndone in a bipartisan fashion to bring this matter to the floor.\n  It is my understanding, perhaps the Senator from Vermont could \nenlighten us, that the bill itself was not ready for consideration, was \nactually in draft form for Members' offices to read, until this \nweekend. And, if that is the case, although I would like to see us move \non it this week, I'm sure we would all like at least a few moments to \ngo through it and to reflect on the different changes that are proposed \nand the impact that they would have on this important agency.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. The bill itself has been ready for about a month and \nhas been under examination for a month. In order to be able to proceed \nmost efficiently and effectively in the amendment process, we have been \nworking with Members--and you have asked us to do so today--to take \ninto consideration possible changes in the bill. We had many requests \nof that nature over the past month, and we have accommodated, to my \nknowledge, every one of those requests and have been and are ready to \nproceed, with the understanding that certain amendments would be \noffered. Some of those amendments would be accepted and some of those \nwould be disagreed with.\n  But we are under the exigencies of time here. This is such an \nimportant bill. We started negotiations, the Senate did, last year, \nunder Senator Kassebaum. The bill was voted out of the committee by a \nvery substantial vote. However, there were strong objections raised to \nit and problems with the House. So we started again this year with the \nbill and we have been working for several months, now, ironing out \nthese difficulties and problems.\n  It was my understanding we had a consensus. That is why we are here \non the floor this afternoon. On the other hand, now we understand that \nsome others have reasons that they would like to participate. We have \nno problem with that. The problem is not ours, in the sense of the \ncommittee. The problem is time on the floor. We have just 1 week left \nbefore we go into recess in order to accomplish the major bills, the \nreconciliation and budget matters, and we will have only a limited \namount of time. So, for us to proceed and get this finished by the end \nof the week, which is important, it is going to take agreement by those \nwho now want to participate in order to have a timely process where we \ncan bring this to conclusion.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague--I know he will cooperate\n\n[[Page S8163]]\n\nwith us so that this very important piece of legislation can get passed \nout. The House is waiting to move until we move. Also connected with it \nis the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, PDUFA, which is very important \nto get passed because that expires at the end of September. So we must \nmove ahead. I thank the Senator for giving his time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Vermont will continue to yield for \nthe purpose of a question, then it is my understanding we will not \nproceed to the bill itself today, that we will wait?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I am not proceeding to the bill at this time. I am \nhopeful and wait patiently with great expectations that at some point \nafter having discussed with you and perhaps communicated with the \nminority leader that we will be able to move forward with the bill in a \nway that will utilize the time today effectively so that we can \ncomplete this bill by the end of the week. But I do not intend to call \nit up at this particular moment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Vermont and pledge my \ncooperation to consider any amendments which might be necessary to be \ndebated on the floor in a timely manner, sensitive to the limited time \nwe have this week. He is correct, that if we do not move on this user \nfee question, it will expire and create great problems and \ncomplications at this important agency. We don't want that to happen. I \nshare with him the belief that we can and should move this bill forward \nthis week, and I look forward to working with him.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Anne Marie \nMurphy of my staff be accorded the privilege of the floor for the \nduration of debate, when it starts, on S. 830, the Food and Drug \nAdministration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Sean \nDonohue and Chris Loso, fellows with the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources, be permitted the privilege of the floor during all Senate \nconsideration of S. 830, the Food and Drug Modernization and \nAccountability Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, as we have just discussed, I am going to \nproceed so that my colleagues and those interested in this legislation \ncan better understand the nature of this legislation and the importance \nof it, and, hopefully, later in the day, we will be able to proceed in \nan orderly manner through the amendment process.\n  The legislation is to modernize the Food and Drug Administration, and \nwe authorize the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, which will, upon \nenactment, streamline the FDA's regulatory procedures. This \nmodernization will help the agency review medical devices and drugs \nmore expeditiously and will let the American public have access sooner \nto newer, safer and more effective therapeutic products.\n  I am disappointed that some of my Democratic colleagues are not \ndesirous of proceeding at this time, but I will do my best to \naccommodate them and also to move forward on this bill. I am especially \nchagrined, given the months of bipartisan negotiating that has led to \nthis bill. Each major provision--all of the drugs and medical device \nprovisions of this measure--represents long-sought agreements with the \nminority and with the FDA itself. I do not understand this continued \ndelay.\n  In particular, Senator Kennedy has played a key role in reaching this \nagreement, and I wish to applaud his willingness and tenacity in \nworking through several difficult issues to reach a consensus on this \nlegislation.\n  In addition, Secretary Shalala and the FDA itself has worked \ndiligently to reach reasonable, sensible agreements. This is a good, \nbipartisan measure that represents moderate yet real reform. It has \nbeen agreed to by the minority and the administration.\n  There is no reason for further delay, and I am going forward today \nwith the expectation that before the end of the day, we will be moving \nforward on this bill.\n  On June 11, prior to the committee markup of S. 830, I received a \nletter from Secretary Shalala outlining the Department's key concerns. \nThis was sometime ago. In her letter, the Secretary stated:\n\n       I am concerned that the inclusion of nonconsensus issues in \n     the committee's bill will result in a protracted and \n     contentious debate.\n\n  Before and since our committee markup, we have worked hard to achieve \na consensus bill. The measure before us today accomplishes that goal. \nBipartisan staff and Members have worked diligently with the agency to \naddress each of the significant nonconsensus provisions raised by the \nSecretary.\n  In her letter, Secretary Shalala expressed her feeling that the \nlegislation would lower the review standard for marketing approval. Key \nchanges have been made to the substitute to address these concerns. \nWith respect to the number of clinical investigations required for \napproval, changes were made to assure that there is not a presumption \nof less than the two well-controlled and adequate investigations, while \nguarding against the rote requirement of two studies.\n  We made it very clear you don't have to do two, although it is quite \nacceptable for you to do two, but you shouldn't look at it as being \nrequired. It is not necessary.\n  The measure clarifies that substantial evidence may, when the \nSecretary determines that such data and evidence are sufficient to \nestablish effectiveness, consist of data with one adequate and well-\ncontrolled clinical investigation and confirmatory evidence.\n  Concerns were raised also about allowing distribution of experimental \ntherapies without adequate safeguards to assure patient safety or \ncompletion of research on efficacy. Changes to accommodate those \nconcerns were made. They are in the substitute. We tighten the \ndefinition of who may provide unapproved therapies and gave FDA more \ncontrol over the expanded access process.\n  Other changes will ensure that use of products outside of clinical \ntrials will not interfere with adequate enrollment of patients in those \ntrials and also give the FDA authority to terminate expanded access if \npatient safeguard protections are not met. The provision allowing \nmanufacturers to charge for products covered under the expedited access \nprovision was deleted also.\n  In mid-June, the Secretary argued that S. 830 would allow health \nclaims for food and economic claims for drugs and biologic products \nwithout adequate scientific proof. In response, Senator Gregg agreed to \nchanges that would allow the FDA 120 days to review a health claim and \nprovide the agency with the authority to prevent the claim from being \nused in the marketplace by issuing an interim final regulation.\n  In addition, the provision allowing pharmaceutical manufacturers to \ndistribute economic information was modified to clarify that the \ninformation must be based on competent and reliable scientific evidence \nand limited the scope to claims directly related to an indication for \nwhich the drug was approved.\n  This bill was further changed to accommodate the Secretary's \nopposition to the provision that would allow third-party review for \ndevices.\n  Products now excluded from third-party review include Class III \nproducts. These are products that are implantable for more than 1 year, \nthose that are life sustaining or life supporting, and also products \nthat are of substantial importance in the prevention of impairment to \nhuman health.\n  In addition, a provision advocated by Senator Harkin has been \nincorporated that clarifies the statutory right of the FDA to review \nrecords related to compensation agreements between accredited reviewers \nand device sponsors.\n  I want to point out that we have been working hard with Members, the \nSecretary, and others who brought problems to us, and we believe we \nhave all of those taken care of, but we understand now we will have to \ndo some more work today.\n  Finally, the Secretary was concerned about provisions that she felt \nwould burden the agency with extensive new regulatory requirements that \nwould detract resources from critical agency\n\n[[Page S8164]]\n\nfunctions without commensurate enhancement of the public health. This \nlegislation now gives FDA new powers to make enforcement activity more \nefficient, adds important new patient benefits and protections, and \nmakes the review process more efficient.\n  First, we give FDA new powers and clarify existing authority, \nincluding mandatory foreign facility registration, seizure authority \nfor certain imported goods, and a presumption of interstate commerce \nfor FDA-regulated products. Those are all important changes to help \nclarify the powers of the FDA.\n  Second, to assist patients with finding out about promising new \nclinical trials, we established a clinical trials database registry, \naccessed by an 800 number. Patients will also benefit from a new \nrequirement that companies report annually on their compliance with \nagreements to conduct postapproval studies on drugs. This was an \nimportant provision that we added, working with Senator Kennedy.\n  Third, FDA's burden will be eased by provisions to make the review \nprocess more collaborative. Collaborative reviews will improve the \nquality of applications for new products and reduce the length of time \nand effort required to review products. We also expressly allow FDA to \naccess expertise at other science-based agencies and contract with \nexperts to help with product reviews. This is very important to bring \nabout more efficient and effective utilization of resources.\n  Lastly, by expanding the third-party review pilot program for medical \ndevices, we build on an important tool for the agency to use in \nmanaging an increasing workload in an era of declining Federal \nresources.\n  In closing, I echo another part of Secretary Shalala's June 11 \nletter:\n\n       I want to commend you and the members of the committee on \n     both sides of the aisle on the progress we have made together \n     to develop a package of sensible, consensus reform provisions \n     that are ready for consideration with reauthorization of the \n     Prescription Drug User Fee Act. . . a protracted and \n     contentious debate . . . would not serve our mutual goal of \n     timely reauthorization of PDUFA and passage of constructive, \n     consensus bipartisan FDA reform.\n\n  I can't tell you how pleased I am that we have been able to work with \nthe Secretary and come to this point now where we have few--I don't \nbelieve we have any disagreements--with the Secretary. Although we have \nsome further matters we may have to discuss.\n  From the beginning of this process, all of the stakeholders have been \ncommitted to producing a consensus measure, and we have accomplished \nthat goal. There is agreement on this bill, and I urge my Democratic \ncolleagues to allow this important measure to move forward.\n  Before yielding the floor, I would like to commend the members of the \ncommittee. I have never worked with a group that has worked as hard as \nthe members of my committee have to bring about a consensus. This has \nbeen night-and-day work for weeks. We have some outstanding Members on \nboth sides of the aisle that have done outstanding work to bring us to \nthis point. I could name them all, and I will eventually as we go \nforward, but I know standing and ready to go is one of those who has \nbeen of invaluable service to this committee. That is Senator Frist. \nWith his knowledge as a physician, his intelligence and ability to \ncommunicate in a way that brings about consensus, we have moved forward \non some incredibly important goals for being able to assist our doctors \nin their pursuance of good health for all of us.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of a bill \nwhich I am very hopeful will be considered shortly, and that is the \nFood and Drug Administration Modernization and Accountability Act of \n1997. I came to the floor expecting, as we all had anticipated, that \nthis bill would be considered today in the bipartisan spirit that has, \nin many ways, been reflected by working together over the past 2 years \non a bill that will modernize the FDA, will strengthen the FDA and \nwill, what I guess I care most about, improve patient care for the \nthousands, for the hundreds of thousands of people who will benefit \nfrom having speedier access to effective drugs, to effective therapies, \nto effective devices.\n  I am very excited about the bill, yet I am very disappointed now that \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle have presented a situation \nwhere this bill cannot be considered today.\n  I am hopeful that over the course of today we will be able to reach \nsome sort of agreement. I had thought we had reached that agreement, \nbut obviously we have not, much to my disappointment and, I think, to \nthe detriment of the United States and all those people who could \nbenefit from having a strengthened FDA.\n  A comment was made earlier that the bill has not really been \nconsidered by a number of people. Again, that is a bit disappointing. \nThe bill before us today really represents over 2 years of work \nconducted in committee and with people off of the committee that we \njust heard our distinguished chairman mention--2 years of work with one \nobjective; that is, to modernize the Food and Drug Administration. I do \nwant to emphasize the bipartisanship in committee, in the Human \nResources Committee.\n  This bill was considered, was marked up, and the bill, with a 14 to 4 \nvote, passed out of committee to be taken to the floor. Throughout this \nprocess, our distinguished chairman, who we just heard from on the \nfloor, has worked with the minority staff, with the minority Senators \nas well as the majority. Both Senator Jeffords and the majority, and \nSenator Kennedy and the minority on the committee have negotiated in \ngood faith to move forward.\n  During the months--and really this has gone on for months, in effect, \nfor 2 years as we debated and discussed a very similar bill--but during \nthe months leading up to committee passage--again, it has gone through \nthe committee with a vote of 14 to 4--and continuing up to today, there \nhave been a series of meetings between the FDA, between industry, \nbetween the administration and the committee staff, all gathered \ntogether in a bipartisan spirit, legislative and executive branch, \nworking together to clarify provisions, to outline and to resolve those \nconcerns between the various parties. And with a bill that is this \nmajor, that will impact every single American both in the current \ngeneration and in the next generation, it takes that working together, \nnegotiating across the table, listening to everybody's concerns.\n  I am delighted--up at least, I thought, until 15 or 20 minutes ago--\nthat those provisions had been discussed, that the debate had been \noutlined with negotiations and compromise carried out to where we have \na very strong bill that will benefit all Americans.\n  The chairman of the committee, through which this passed again with a \nstrong bipartisan vote, pointed out the importance of passing FDA \nreform over the next 6 to 7 days, or I guess the remaining 5 days now, \nwhen he referred to the expiring authorization of what is called PDUFA. \nThis is favored.\n  The reauthorization, which is expiring--the authorization is \nexpiring--the reauthorization is supported by the FDA, it is supported \nby the U.S. Congress, it is supported by the administration, and it is \nsupported by industry. This law has been a great success. It must and \nwill be extended for another 5 years. It is an integral part of the FDA \nreform and modernization bill that I hope will be introduced this week.\n  If in some way this aspect of the bill is blocked, despite the fact \nthat both sides--that all sides--want it to move forward, there is the \npotential that as many as 600 FDA reviewers that are employed because \nof PDUFA, which speeds up, which accelerates the approval process to \nget drugs out to the American people, could be at jeopardy. That must \nbe addressed this week. Furthermore, patients awaiting the drugs that \nwill be approved at an expedited rate of PDUFA will wait and wait and \nwait if this is not continued.\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. President, at this juncture, I ask unanimous consent that \nprivileges of floor be granted to a member of my staff, Dr. Clyde \nEvans, during the period between now and 3 p.m., Monday July 28.\n\n[[Page S8165]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I would like to speak to a specific aspect \nof the bill that reflects, I think, the bipartisan spirit, the working \ntogether to the benefit of individual patients or future patients, to \nthe benefit of children today, of hard-working men and women across \nthis country. It has to do with the whole topic of dissemination of \nscientific medical information. This aspect of the Food and Drug \nAdministration Modernization and Accountability Act of 1997 is a very \nimportant one, but one that has been contentious in many ways and in \nmany people's minds has been the most contentious part of the FDA bill.\n  It all stems back to legislation that was introduced by my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, Mr. Mack, and myself 2 years ago. \nIt focuses on the fundamental aspect which is so important to the \npractice of medicine today, to the delivery of care today, and that is \nto allow a free flow of good, accurate information that can be used to \nbenefit people who need health care and health care services. It \nfocuses on the dissemination of scientific medical peer-reviewed \ninformation to physicians and other health care providers.\n  As I said, this is an important aspect of the bill which I hope will \nbe introduced. It will result in more scientific information on uses of \nFDA-approved drugs in an off-label or extra-label manner. Again, these \nare products that have already been approved by the FDA, but they are \nused very commonly in fields such as pediatric medicine, the practice \nof delivering care to children today while they are in the hospital, \nused very commonly in the treatment of cancer therapy. As much as 90 \npercent of all of the uses of drugs in oncology or the treatment of \ncancer are used in what is called an off-label or extra-label manner.\n  These provisions, which are a part of the underlying bill, represent \na lot of hard work, as was implied by the distinguished chairman, a lot \nof bipartisan support which has been demonstrated especially over the \nlast 2 months but really over the last 6 months.\n  Specifically, I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, Senator Mack, who I mentioned, Senator Dodd, Senator Wyden and \nSenator Boxer, all of whom have remained throughout committed to this \nissue and have demonstrated real leadership in their bipartisan working \ntogether to come up with a piece of legislation that will be to the \nbenefit of all Americans. I, too, want to express my appreciation to \nSecretary Shalala for her willingness to work, along with Senator \nKennedy, on what had been considered, as I mentioned, one of the most \ncontentious issues initially of FDA reform. Now we have a bipartisan \nconsensus agreement among all parties in this body with the FDA and \nwith the administration.\n  The information dissemination provisions do represent a compromise, a \nbalanced compromise, but they really ultimately respect the importance \nof physicians receiving up-to-date, independently derived scientific \ninformation, as well, at the same time to pursue, when possible, \ngetting those prescribed uses ultimately approved on the label by the \nFDA. Thus, we have to address the dissemination of information. But \nwhat we have come to by these very careful, balanced negotiations is \nthis linkage to actually improving and reforming the supplemental \napplication process. The goal among almost all of us is to get as many \nof these uses today on the label.\n  Now, what does off-label mean? Off-label scares people. As a \nphysician, as someone in my thoracic oncology practice, as someone who \nroutinely every week treated cancer patients, I have some \nresponsibility to define for my colleagues what off-label means. Off-\nlabel scares people. Is it somebody going in some secret closet and \npulling out a medicine and using it? No, it is not. That is why extra-\nlabel is probably a better term. But right now off-label is something \nthat we in the medical profession understand is used routinely in the \npediatric population and, as mentioned earlier, for inpatient \nhospitalization. Probably 50 percent of all pediatric drugs prescribed \nare off-label. So it is not a term to be scared of or to fear.\n  In off-label use, it is simply the use of a drug which has been \napproved by the Food and Drug Administration in a way that has not yet \nspecifically been indicated on the label. It might be using that drug \nin a combination with other drugs for an intended benefit. It might be \na different dosage of that drug. It really comes down to the standpoint \nthat the halflife of medical knowledge is moving quickly. We all know \nthat.\n  We know how fast science is moving, how fast medical information is \nchanging. That change is skyrocketing and accelerating over time. \nClearly, you have an FDA which, and appropriately to some extent, has \nto be very careful, has to rely on large clinical trials, and has not \nbeen as good historically in the past as we would like for it to be in \nterms of approving over time. That FDA cannot approve every single use \nof every single drug in the field of health and science which is moving \nat skyrocketing speed, accelerating speed.\n  An example, aspirin, has been used off-label for years to prevent \nheart attacks. People generally know today taking a baby aspirin today \nor an aspirin every other day is effective in preventing heart attacks \nin certain populations. But right now, if you read on the label, there \nare certain limitations as to the use of aspirin. It is not specified \nthat aspirin can be used prophylactically to prevent heart attacks \ntoday.\n  Another example which reflects the importance of off-label or extra-\nlabel use in a world where science is moving very quickly is that of \nthe use of tetracycline. When I was in medical school, even 10 years \nago, the whole theory of ulcer disease was based on a component of \nacid. Acid clearly plays a very important role, but what we did not \nknow--in fact when I first heard it myself when I was a resident, I \nsaid, ``No way; impossible.'' But what was figured out is that \nantibiotics can help cure ulcers because the etiology of ulcer disease, \nof certain types of ulcer disease, is based on a bacterium.\n  Well, we know that today. Yet tetracycline and the use of \ntetracycline, a very common antibiotic which is used for many other \nreasons, does not have an on-label use for the treatment of ulcers. Yet \nthere are thousands of people right now taking tetracycline to treat \ntheir ulcer disease--that is an extra- label use, an off-label use--\nunder the law, of course. With 90 percent of my oncology patients using \noff-label-use drugs, with 50 percent of my pediatric patients using \noff-label drugs, with tetracycline, physicians are allowed legally, of \ncourse, to use and prescribe drugs for off-label uses.\n\n  In addition to being a thoracic oncologist--and I will have to add \nthat I was codirector of the thoracic, which is chest, oncology cancer \ntreatment; and lung cancer is the No. 1 cause of cancer death in women \ntoday--that for the medical treatment of thoracic cancers, of lung \ncancer, well over 95 percent of the treatment is off-label today.\n  In my field of heart and lung transplant surgery, many of my patients \nare alive today, of the hundreds of patients whom I have transplanted, \nbecause of the off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs. Then, in my \nroutine heart surgery practice, where I have put hundreds of mechanical \nvalves in patients over the last several years, there is another great \nadvantage of off-label drugs.\n  About 40 years ago, the first mechanical heart valves were put in to \nreplace defective valves scarred by rheumatic heart disease. These \nmechanical valves are replaced routinely. This started in the early \n1960's, about 40 years ago. But it was not until March 31, 1994, just 3 \nyears ago, that the off-label use of Coumadin, the blood thinner which \nall these patients are on and have been on for the last 35 years, that \nit was ultimately approved for on-label use, according to FDA.\n  It has been clear in the literature and among my colleagues that \nCoumadin, this blood thinner, is not only important, but lifesaving for \nthose who have received medical valves. So dissemination of information \nis important. It is important for physicians to be able to have the \nlatest information, to have the free flow of information. Why? In order \nto best treat, using the latest techniques and the most effective \ntherapy, the patients who come through their door that they treat in \nthe hospital. Dissemination of information,\n\n[[Page S8166]]\n\nwith appropriate balance and disclosure, will allow sharing of this \ntype of information with physicians and with other people who can take \nadvantage of it.\n  Let me just close with one further explanation about why it is \nimportant. We are talking about this information going to people who \nare trained to consider this information. Right now, there are barriers \nthere, which means if I were a physician practicing in rural Tennessee, \nI am not likely to be going to Vanderbilt or the local academic health \ncenter and participating in conferences every week. If I am in rural \nTennessee, where do I get my information? I get it from what I learned \nin medical school, but there is a problem with that because we already \nsaid the half-life of medical knowledge is shorter and shorter, with \nthe great discoveries that we have today. I am most likely to read \nmedical journals. Yes, there are many, many journals that it is \nimportant for me to read to keep in touch with. I could search the \nInternet. But to be honest with you, your typical physician is so busy \ntoday delivering care, it is very unlikely that they are going to sit \ndown at a computer terminal in rural Tennessee and go to the Internet \nand get information.\n  In fact, last year, in testimony before the Labor Committee, Dr. \nLindberg at the National Library of Medicine testified before the \ncommittee, and explained how vast this literature is out there. He was \ntalking about MEDLINE, which is the primary medical database that is \nused, in which all of the peer-reviewed journals are placed on this \ncomputerized data base. He explained the challenge that physicians have \ntoday in the following way:\n\n       MEDLINE contains more than 8 million articles from 1966 to \n     the present. It grows by some 400,000 records annually. If a \n     conscientious doctor were to read two medical articles before \n     retiring every night, he would have fallen 550 years behind \n     in his reading at the end of the first year.\n\n  Now, in medicine, where one's health and one's life is in the hands \nof the physician, I don't see how people can argue about free and \nappropriate dissemination of information to best benefit that patient, \nto take care of you as an individual. Yet, there are barriers there. \nWe, probably unintentionally, over time, have created barriers that now \nwe need to take down, to allow the appropriate and balanced \ndissemination of information to be to the benefit of that physician who \nis going to be seeing my colleagues, their children and their spouses \nin the future. More information, I feel, is better, as long as it's \nbalanced, peer-reviewed, and safeguards are built in to make sure that \nit is not used for promotion.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor soon. This is an issue that I \nreally want to just underscore this day because it represents \nbipartisanship, working together with the distinguished colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle. It started from a bill that was introduced in \nthe Senate by the Senator from Florida [Mr. Mack], and myself. It has \nbeen greatly improved. How? By sitting around the table with the \nadministration, with the FDA, with colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to the point that we, when we pass the overall bill, will be able \nto improve the health care of individuals across this country.\n  I feel this is one of the most important aspects of this bill. Again, \nI call on my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to come together so \nthat we can bring up the underlying bill and pass it to the benefit of \nall Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to join today \nin bipartisan support for this important piece of legislation. In doing \nso, I want to commend Chairman Jeffords, in particular, and Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, because this bill, in my view, meets the \ncentral test for good FDA reform legislation. An FDA reform bill ought \nto keep the critical safety mission for the Food and Drug \nAdministration, while at the same time encouraging innovation--\ninnovation that is going to produce new therapies and save lives. This \nbill meets that twin test.\n  This bill is a result of, as several of our colleagues have noted, \nmuch debate and an extraordinary effort to build consensus. I am proud \nto have played some part in that effort as a Member of both the House \nof Representatives and the U.S. Senate, having introduced, more than 2 \nyears ago, H.R. 1472, the FDA Modernization Act, which contains several \nof the key ingredients of the legislation before us today.\n  Mr. President, from the time we get up in the morning until the time \nwe go to bed at night, we live, work, eat, and drink in a world of \nproducts that are affected by decisions made at the Food and Drug \nAdministration. Perhaps no other Federal agency has such a broad impact \nin the daily lives of average Americans.\n  Food handling and commercial preparation often occurs under the \nagency's scrutiny. Over-the-counter drugs and nutritional supplements, \nfrom vitamins to aspirin, are also certified by the agency.\n  Life-saving drugs for treatment of cancer, autoimmune deficiency, and \nother dreaded diseases, are held to its rigorous approval standards.\n  Medical devices ranging from the very simple to the complex, from \ntongue depressors to computerized diagnostic equipment, all have to \nmeet quality standards at the FDA.\n  These products that are overseen by the FDA are woven deeply into the \nfabric of our daily lives, and the agency's twin missions of certifying \ntheir safety and effectiveness is supported by the vast majority of \nAmericans.\n  Yet, balancing those missions against the time and expense required \nby companies to navigate the FDA approval system has often been \ndifficult and controversial. In the last Congress, radical \ntransformation of the agency, even ending the agency as we know it and \nreplacing it with a panel of private sector, expert entrepreneurs, \nbecame a goal of some.\n  At the very least, reforming the Food and Drug Administration at the \nbeginning of the last Congress looked to be an exercise fraught with \npartisan political turmoil, and destined for ongoing gridlock.\n  But while there was focus on the extreme ends of the argument--those \nfolks arguing for no changes against Members demanding wholesale \ndismemberment of the agency--a broad, bipartisan group of Members of \nCongress developed.\n  With the help of Vice President Gore's Reinventing Government \nProgram, Members of Congress from both political parties developed \npractical, bipartisan solutions to the critical management issues that \nthe FDA approval process presents.\n  I sought to mobilize this bipartisan movement with H.R. 1472, \nintroduced in June 1995. Some in my party thought I had gone too far, \ntoo fast. But I am gratified that many of the elements of this \nlegislation, strengthened in this legislation, are going to be \nconsidered by the Senate.\n  These include, first, a streamlining of approval systems for \nbiotechnology product manufacturing. It is clear that the rules for \nbiotechnology, so central to health care progress, have not kept up \nwith the times. This legislation will allow biotechnology to move into \nthe 21st century with a realistic framework of regulation.\n  The bill allows approval of important new breakthrough drugs on the \nbasis of a single, clinically valid trial.\n  It creates a collaborative mechanism allowing applicants to confer \nconstructively with the FDA at critical points in the approval process.\n  It sets reasonable, but strict, timeframes for the approval of \ndecisionmaking.\n  It reduces the paperwork and reporting burden now facing so many \nsmall entrepreneurs when they make minor changes in the manufacturing \nprocess.\n  It establishes provisions for allowing third-party review of \napplications at the discretion of the Secretary.\n  It allows manufacturers to distribute scientifically valid \ninformation on uses for approved drugs and devices, which have not yet \nbeen certified by the Food and Drug Administration.\n  Each of those areas, Mr. President, was in the legislation that I \nintroduced more than 2 years ago, and with the bipartisan efforts that \nhave been made in this bill, each of them has been strengthened. I am \nespecially pleased that Senators Mack, Frist, Dodd, Boxer, Kennedy, and \nI could offer the provisions of this legislation relating\n\n[[Page S8167]]\n\nto the dissemination of information on off-label uses of approved \nproducts.\n  This provision will allow manufacturers to distribute scientifically \nand clinically valid information on such uses following a review by the \nFood and Drug Administration, including a decision that I proposed more \nthan 2 years ago, which may require additional balancing material to be \nadded to the packet.\n  Here is why that is important. Manufacturers with an approved drug \nfor ovarian cancer may have important, but not yet conclusive, \ninformation from new trials that their drug also may reduce brain or \nbreast cancers. That data, while perhaps not yet of a grade to meet \nsupplemental labeling approval, may be critically important for an end-\nstage breast cancer patient whose doctor has exhausted all other \ntreatments.\n  That doctor and that doctor's patient have the absolute right to that \ninformation. It is time for this policy of censorship at the Food and \nDrug Administration to end. I believe that, with the legislation that \nwill come before the Senate, it will be possible for health care \nproviders to get this critical information and do it in a way that \nprotects the safety of all of our citizens.\n  This legislation is going to save lives, not sacrifice them. It is \ngoing to mean that more doctors and their patients will have meaningful \naccess to life-saving information about drugs that treat dread diseases \nlike HIV and cancer.\n  It will mean that biologic products will have a swifter passage \nthrough an approval process which no longer will require unnecessarily \ndifficult demands with regard to the size of a startup manufacturing \nprocess.\n  It will mean that breakthrough drugs that offer relief or cures for \ndeadly diseases, for which there is no approved therapy, are going to \nget to the market earlier on the basis of a specially expedited \napproval system.\n\n  Mr. President, legislation, indeed laws, are only words on paper. Mr. \nPresident, we must also have a new FDA Commissioner who is committed to \nthe changes in S. 830, just as committed to those changes as former \nCommissioner David Kessler was committed to the war on teenage smoking.\n  This bill goes a long way to making sure that the Food and Drug \nAdministration is prepared to meet the challenges of the 21st century. \nBut we also need to make sure that at the FDA, at that agency, there is \na new commitment at every level to carry out these changes.\n  I believe that it is possible to keep the mission of the Food and \nDrug Administration--that all-critical safety mission, a mission that \nAmericans rely on literally from the time they get up in the morning \nuntil the time they go to bed at night--while still ensuring that there \nare opportunities for innovation in the development of cures for dread \ndiseases.\n  Mr. President, I also want to conclude by thanking a member of my \nstaff, Mr. Steve Jenning. For several years now, he has toiled on many \nof these provisions with Members of Congress on both the House side and \nthe Senate side, to help bring about this legislation. He has, in my \nview, done yeoman work, and I want to make sure that the Senate knows \nabout his efforts. I know my colleagues in the House are very much \naware of him.\n  So we all look forward, on a bipartisan basis, to seeing S. 830 come \nto the floor. It is a bill that is going to make a difference in terms \nof saving lives. The Senate needs to pass it and needs to pass it this \nweek.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, first of all, I want to thank the \nSenator from Oregon for his support and for his very effective \npresentation. I know there are so many of us here who want to work \ntogether. In fact, just about everybody does. That is why it is of such \nconcern to me that we now find ourselves in a position where we can't \nproceed. I know of the Senator's immense assistance in helping us in \nthis matter, and I appreciate what he has said.\n  Mr. President, I think it would be wise at this point, while we are \nbiding time in the hopes of being able to move forward, to answer the \nquestions that many people have: Why are we here? What is the big deal? \nWhat is so important? Why are we anxious to get moving and to get this \npiece of legislation passed?\n  I would like to go through some of the problems that we have right \nnow with the FDA because it is our lives and our health that are at \nstake here. The time delays that occur because of the various problems \nat the FDA that we are trying to correct mean that new therapies that \nwould be essential to your life and health, proceed so slowly that \nmany, many people are deprived of the hopes and dreams we all have of a \ngood health and a good life.\n  Let me provide some examples. By law, FDA is required to review and \nact on applications for approval on drugs within 180 days. Now, that \n180 days was not just pulled out of the air. That was looking at the \nnormal processes you would be able to do it in 180 days. According to \nFDA's own budget justification for fiscal year 1998, it takes the \nagency an average of 12 months longer than the statute allows to \ncomplete this process. It takes, on average, a year and a half for a \nprocess that should take 6 months.\n  Since the 1960's to the 1990's, complete clinical trials, that is, \nthe time required by FDA to show for efficacy of drugs, has increased \nfrom 2.5 to nearly 7 years. Between 1990 and 1995, the FDA average \napproval time, that is, the time after the clinical trials have been \ncompleted, was about 2.3 years.\n  Today, only 1 in 5,000 potential new medicines is ever approved by \nthe FDA. According to a recently published study, from the beginning of \nthe process to the end, it takes an average of 15 years and costs in \nthe range of $500 million to bring a new drug to market.\n  Why does this process take so long? Before FDA even gets involved in \nthe process, innovators spend an average of 6\\1/2\\ years in early \nresearch and preclinical testing in the laboratory and with animal \nstudies. Long before human tests begin, a summary of all the \npreclinical results is submitted to the FDA. This document, known as \nthe investigational new drug application, or IND, contains information \non chemistry, manufacturing data, pharmacological test results, safety \ntesting results and a plan for clinical testing in people.\n  If the FDA judges the potential benefits to humans to outweigh the \nrisks involved, the stage is set for three phases of clinical trials to \nbegin. Taken together, the three phases of clinical trials in human \npopulations average about an additional 6 years.\n  Phase I clinical trials focus on safety. During about a 1-year \nperiod, very low doses of compound are administered to small groups of \nhealthy volunteers. Gradually, they are increased to determine how the \nbodies react to the different levels.\n  Phase II clinical trials last about 2 years; that is, 2 additional \nyears. They involve 100 and 300 patient volunteers, and focus on the \ncompounds effectiveness. These are blinded trials that are held in \nhospitals around the country where they compare the innovator compound \nwith a so called placebo--that is the control group is not given \nanything. The effect of the innovator drug is compared with effect on \nthose who received the placebo. Three out of four prospective drugs \ndrop out of the picture as a result of the data collected during these \nphase II trials.\n  Phase III trials involve one or more clinical trials where \nresearchers aim to confirm the results of earlier tests in a larger \npopulation. Phase III lasts from 2 to 5 years and can involve between \n3,000 and 150,000 patients in hundreds of hospitals and medical \ncenters. These tests provide researchers with a huge database of \ninformation on the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate to satisfy \nFDA's regulatory requirements.\n  The amount of data required to file for the next new phase, new drug \napplication, or NDA, is staggering. The application for new drugs \ntypically runs to hundreds of thousands of pages in length. For \nexample, in 1994, the NDA for a groundbreaking arthritis medication \ncontained more than 1,000 volumes of documentation that weighed 3 tons. \nIt included data from clinical tests in roughly 10,000 patients, some \nof whom had been taking new medication 5 years.\n  During the NDA review process--which can last an additional 2\\1/2\\ \nyears, Government officials have extensive\n\n[[Page S8168]]\n\ncontact with the company. They visit the research facilities and talk \nto the doctors and scientists involved in the research. In addition, \nFDA officials visit and approve the manufacturing facilities and review \nand approve all the labeling, packaging and marketing that will \naccompany the product.\n  Well, that is good and we want the FDA to be thorough, but things can \nbe done more efficiently and more effectively. If we cannot reduce \nthese times based on the consensus agreements in this bill--then a lot \nof people will lose the timely availability and the utilization of \nthese breakthroughs.\n\n  What does this reducing of overall time mean for Americans? If we can \nreduce this overall time, it means quicker access to safe and effective \nlifesaving drugs.\n  I want to point out that the FDA, when it reviewed priority \napplications, has been able to make breakthroughs in AIDS and elsewhere \nby just being more efficient.\n  Also, for instance, to give you an example of review process delay, \nover 12 million type-2 diabetics had to wait almost 2 years for a new \nmachine to be approved. Almost 2 million American women with breast \ncancer had to wait almost 2 years in excess of what should have been \nrequired for this review process.\n  So when that you have that kind of delay, you know you have to have \nreform, and that is why we are here. Some may argue that the long \nperiod of review and approval time is the price we pay for ensuring \ndrug safety and efficacy. But that long delay does not hold true for \nall drugs. We know the FDA can significantly reduce its approval times \nbecause it has already done it. We have, for instance, with respect to \nthe AIDS therapies, the so-called protease inhibiters that were \napproved in a matter of months. FDA can do more to ensure that they \nreceive timely attention, and S. 830 will help FDA do so for all \npromising therapies. FDA is aware of this, and that is why they have \nbeen working to help simplify the law, simplify the process, simplify \nthe procedures, so that we can get these drugs to market on time \nwithout in any way infringing upon the necessity to protect the health \nof our people.\n  So as we proceed, I will review these issues in a more definitive \nmanner. But as we await removal of an objection to proceed, I just \nwanted to remind people that there are real, valid, deep concerns that \nwe are facing here. Our goal is to make sure the health of our Nation \ncan improve and that people will be able to have access to the \ninnovative therapies that will benefit their lives.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Again, I would like to commend the chairman of the Labor \nand Human Resources Committee for the outstanding work he has done in \nshepherding through the committee and now, hopefully, later today bring \nto the floor an act which will modernize and strengthen the FDA and \nwill be to the real benefit of all Americans to make sure that health \ncare services are given in an expeditious way to the American people.\n  As I mentioned in my earlier comments in the Chamber, a central \naspect of health care today is the dissemination of information to \nphysicians, to health care providers so that both will know, understand \nand have access to and be able to use appropriately that information to \nserve their patients, the so-called off-label or extra-label provisions \nI introduced this morning, and I want to share once again my delight in \nthe fact that in a bipartisan way, working with Senators Kennedy, \nWyden, Boxer, Mack, myself, and the distinguished chairman, we have \ncome together and worked with the administration and the FDA to address \nthis very important issue of dissemination of information.\n  As I mentioned, off-label uses are really prominent in health care \ntoday. The American Medical Association estimates the off-label or \nextra-label use of drugs that have already been approved by the FDA to \nbe in the range of 40 percent to 60 percent of all prescriptions. Of \nall prescriptions written today, 40 to 60 percent are estimated by the \nAmerican Medical Association to be off-label, and there have been very \nfew problems associated with this off-label appropriate use. In \ntreating hospitalized children, it has been estimated that over 70 \npercent of the drugs are prescribed to be off-label, and that can vary \nanywhere from 60 to as high as 90 percent, and for diseases such as \ncancer the figure can be as high as 90 percent.\n  As a lung cancer surgeon--I mentioned earlier the treatment of lung \ncancer today--the medical treatment of lung cancer involves well over \n80, more in the range of 90, percent of all medical treatment being \noff-label. And that is that the drugs already approved by the FDA are \nused either in a dosage or in a combination with other drugs that have \nnot yet been approved or studied through the FDA process. That can be \nimproved in lots of ways and that is part of the underlying bill, to \nstrengthen the FDA by making the approval process more efficient. \nPeople ask me frequently, why aren't all uses of drugs, if they are \nreally effective, if they are really valuable, if they really improve \npatient care, why aren't they on the label?\n\n  A goal of all of us, I think, is to get as many on the label as \npossible. But in answering that question, I first cite the American \nMedical Association's Council on Scientific Affairs, which met this \nspring to consider all of these issues and to make recommendations \nregarding information dissemination and what we call the supplemental \napproval process; that is, a drug has been approved for a specific \nindication at a specific dose and if it is discovered through medical \nscience that a different dose or another medication is in order, why \ncan't you get that in a supplemental way on the label. The AMA's \nCouncil on Scientific Affairs, in explaining why there are currently so \nmany medically accepted, commonly used, unlabeled uses of FDA-approved \ndrugs, states:\n\n       The simple answer is that FDA-approved labeling does not \n     necessarily reflect current medical practice.\n\n  In their comments, they go on to explain that manufacturers may not \nseek FDA approval for all useful indications for a whole range, a whole \nhost of reasons, including:\n\n       The expense of regulatory compliance may be greater than \n     the eventual revenues expected--e.g. if patent protection for \n     the drug product has expired or if the patient population \n     protected by the new use is very small.\n\n  The point is, if you have a drug in your pharmaceutical company and \nyou know it is good, yet it will benefit very few people in a \npopulation and you know it is going to cost you millions and millions \nof dollars and years and years of trying to put through these clinical \ntrials, what incentive do you have when the benefit is to such a few \nnumber of patients out there? Thus, we need to lower that barrier, make \nthe supplemental approval process for these extra-label or off-label \nuses easier, lower that barrier.\n  Patent protection. Once a manufacturer has invested a lot of money \nand time in clinical trials and meeting the regulatory requirements of \nthe Food and Drug Administration, they are protected for a period of \ntime through the patent, but once the patent expires, what then is \ntheir incentive to go out and get this off-label use put on the label \nwhen they have to go through so many hoops, through what all of us know \nis an inefficient process today?\n  The good news is that the underlying bill addresses the supplemental \nprocess. It links off-label use or dissemination of information about \noff-label use to a future application.\n  Now, the supplemental process--and what I am even more excited or \nequally excited about is it makes that supplemental process more \nefficient, with more incentives for the manufacturers to seek what is \ncalled a supplemental new drug application.\n  Going back to the AMA's Council on Scientific Affairs, they say:\n\n       A sponsor also may not seek FDA approval because of \n     difficulties in conducting controlled clinical trials. ([For \n     example,] for ethical reasons, or due to the inability to \n     recruit patients).\n\n  ``Finally,'' and again I am quoting them:\n\n       . . . even when a sponsor does elect to seek approval for a \n     new indication, the regulatory approval process for the \n     required [Supplemental New Drug Application] is expensive and \n     may proceed very slowly.\n\n  In fact, they continue to explain a little bit later, that the past \nreview\n\n[[Page S8169]]\n\nperformance for SNDA's, Supplemental New Drug Applications, is\n\n       . . . unexpected because the SNDA should be much simpler to \n     review than the original [New Drug Application], and suggests \n     the FDA gave much lower priority to reviews of SNDAs.\n\n  The point is, we need to improve the underlying supplemental new drug \napplication process and this bill does that as well. I am very hopeful \nthat this bill can be brought to the floor because you can see the \nnumber of good things that are in this bill that will speed and make \nmore efficient the overall approval process with safeguards built in \nthat will protect the American people from dangerous drugs, the \nunnecessary side effects of drugs or devices.\n  The underlying bill, again pointing to the real advantages of getting \nthis bill to the floor, includes additional incentives for \nmanufacturers to seek supplemental labeling, including added \nexclusivity for those seeking pediatric labeling. Again, encouraging--\nand we know, if you look back historically, we as a nation have not \ndone very well, in terms of aiming labeling for the pediatric \npopulation, a place where these drugs are so critical, are so crucial \nfor our children, my children, your children. We need to do better \nthere and this bill addresses that.\n  Also, the underlying bill requires that the FDA publish performance \nstandards for the prompt review of supplemental applications. It \nrequires the FDA issue final guidance to clarify the requirements and \nfacilitate the submission of data to support the approval of the \nsupplemental application. And it requires the FDA to designate someone \nin each FDA center who will be responsible for encouraging review of \nsupplemental applications and who will work with sponsors to facilitate \nthe development of--and to gather the data to support--these \nsupplemental new drug applications. Moreover, the Secretary, as \nspecified in the bill, will foster a collaboration between the Food and \nDrug Administration and the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, and \nthe professional medical societies and the professional scientific \nsocieties, and others to identify published and unpublished studies \nthat could support a SNDA, a supplemental new drug application. The \npoint is to improve that communication, that working together. Finally, \nin the bill, the Secretary is required to encourage sponsors to submit \nSNDA's or conduct further research based on all of these studies.\n  Again, this drives home the point that the underlying value of this \nbill dictates that it be brought forward to the floor, that it be \ndebated, that it ultimately be passed and taken to the American \npeople--all of these provisions which I cited--to improve the FDA's \ncommitment to the SNDA process, to improve the agency's communication \nwith manufacturers regarding the requirements for SNDA's, and the \nrequirements that in most cases the manufacturers submit approved \nclinical trial protocols and commit to filing a SNDA before \ndisseminating scientific information about off-label uses--all will \nimprove the number of supplemental indications pursued by \nmanufacturers.\n  To be certain of the impact of all of these provisions, the \ndissemination provisions sunset after a completion of a study by the \nInstitute of Medicine to review the scientific issues presented by this \nparticular section, including whether the information provided to \nhealth care practitioners by both the manufacturer and by the Secretary \nis useful, the quality of such information, and the impact of \ndissemination of information on research in the area of new uses, \nindications, or dosages. Again, special emphasis in the bill is placed \non rare diseases and is placed on pediatric indications.\n  Indeed, limiting information dissemination to off-label uses \nundergoing the research necessary to get it on label has been a real \nsubject of negotiation and compromise in this bipartisan discussion \nwith the FDA and the administration and representatives from Congress. \nHowever, the point is that we have done that. It is now ready to be \nbrought to the floor, to be talked about among all of our colleagues if \nthey so wish. Those negotiations and those compromises have been \ncarried out. It is time now to bring that to the floor. We have worked \nto accommodate many other concerns of our fellow colleagues in the U.S. \nSenate, concerns among the FDA and other organizations. The provisions \noutlined in the amendment have changed a great deal from the original \nbill that was proposed by Senator Mack and myself during the 104th \nCongress, and it makes it a better bill, a stronger bill, one that I \nthink will benefit all Americans.\n  In general, in the bill, manufacturers will be allowed to share peer-\nreviewed medical journal articles and medical textbooks about off-label \nuses with health care practitioners only if they have made that \ncommitment to file for a supplemental new drug application within 6 \nmonths, or if the manufacturer submits the clinical trial protocol and \nthe schedule for collecting the information for this new drug \napplication, this supplemental new drug application. If those criteria \nare met, manufacturers will be allowed to share peer-reviewed medical \njournal articles and medical textbooks.\n\n  I have to comment on peer review because it is important. That means \nthe types of materials that are submitted, that a manufacturer may \nsubmit to a physician--remember the physician already has 4 years of \nmedical school, several years of residency, is trained to at least read \nthat peer-reviewed article. If that peer-reviewed article is sent, that \ndissemination of information will facilitate, I believe, the overall \ncare of patients--broadly.\n  In addition, the FDA will review whatever proposed information is to \nbe sent out by a manufacturer to a physician. They will have 60 days to \nreview that peer-reviewed article or that chapter out of a textbook. \nThe manufacturer--and it is spelled out in the bill--must list the use, \nthe indications--the indication, or the dosage provisions that are not \non the label. The manufacturer must also disclose any financial \ninterest. The manufacturer must also submit a bibliography of previous \narticles on the drug or the device. And, then, after all that \nsubmission, if the Secretary determines that more information is \nneeded, she may require the manufacturer to disseminate other \ninformation in order to present an objective view. In other words, we \nare not allowing manufacturers to send out articles which have any sort \nof bias or conflict of interest. These are peer-reviewed articles with \nsafeguards built in to make sure that there is not an undue bias.\n  The safeguards against abuse also ensure that the information is \naccurate; it is unbiased when it is presented to that practitioner. \nManufacturers must inform the Secretary of any new developments about \nthe off-label use, whether those developments are positive or whether \nthey are negative. And, in turn, the Secretary may require that new \ninformation be disseminated to health care practitioners who previously \nreceived information on a new use. This really should go a long way to \nensure that health care practitioner--the person who is in rural \nTennessee--is fully informed, with peer-reviewed articles, cleared of \nany conflicts of interest, with the FDA having had 60 days to make sure \nthat balance is there.\n  There are a number of benefits to this amendment. Patients will gain \nfrom better and safer health care because their physician will be more \nknowledgeable about potential treatments. That is the most important \nthing for a physician. Again, as I am in this body I want to keep \ncoming back, again and again, to what is important to physicians and to \nour health care system. It is simply one thing and that is the patient; \nthat the patient has access to the very best health care, the very best \ndevice to treat their cancer, to treat their underlying heart disease, \nto provide the patient with the very best possible care.\n  There will be a number of charges, and there have been in the past, \nabout this freedom of information, allowing dissemination of extra-\nlabel information. One is--and we heard it last year and we built into \nthe process, I think, very strong provisions to prevent this--but \ncritics would say if you allow people to use drugs and devices off-\nlabel--remember, that's the standard of care right now--but if you \nallow information to be disseminated by a manufacturer, then what \nincentive does that manufacturer have to go out and jump the hurdles of \na SNDA, the supplemental new drug application process?\n\n[[Page S8170]]\n\n  Pharmaceutical companies are going to be committed to completing a \nSNDA in this bill. They have a greater incentive to continue research \nand clinical trials on their projects. The additional benefits of \nreceiving approval for new indications include product reimbursement. \nFrequently you are not reimbursed for a medicine unless it is FDA \napproved. The incentive to get that approval is there if we have an \nappropriate barrier. Another is less product liability. Many people \nbelieve if it is on the label and you use that drug, that gives you \nsome protection from product liability and therefore these \nmanufacturers have an incentive to get that supplemental new drug \napplication approved. Also, active promotion of the product for the new \nuse.\n  I also heard in the debate last year before the committee this whole \nidea of what peer review is. It is misunderstood by people broadly, but \nthe concept of peer review is that I, as an investigator, submit my \ndata and my studies to the experts in the world who are not \nnecessarily--who are not, in fact--at my institution, not a part of my \nresearch team. They are objective. There is no conflict of interest. \nThey review the study, they review the protocol, they review how the \nstudy was carried out, and decide is this good science or is this bad \nscience. And that is what peer review is. Typically, journals that are \npeer-reviewed have objective boards that look at this data and either \nput on their stamp of approval--they don't necessarily have to agree \nwith everything, but they have to say it is good science and the study \nwas conducted in an ethical and peer-reviewed manner.\n\n  So peer review is important. We have worked, again in a bipartisan \nway, in this bill, with the American Medical Association's Council on \nScientific Affairs to agree on the definition of a quality peer-\nreviewed journal article in order to ensure that high scientific \nstandards are guaranteed; if a manufacturer sends out an article, it \nhas been peer reviewed. And we spell out in the bill that manufacturers \nwill only be allowed to send out peer-reviewed articles from medical \njournals listed in the NIH, the National Institutes of Health, National \nLibrary of Medicine's Index Medicus. These medical journals must have \nan independent editorial board, they must use experts in the subject of \nthe article, and must have a publicly stated conflict of interest \npolicy. Again, building in, as much as possible, the concept of \neducated scientifically objective peer review.\n  Last, manufacturers will not be allowed to advertise the product. \nThey will not be allowed to make oral presentations. They will not be \nallowed to send free samples to health care practitioners. In other \nwords, sending a health care practitioner, a physician, an \nindependently derived, scientifically significant peer-reviewed journal \narticle is not promotion. As a physician, I know, reading a peer-\nreviewed article--you see a lot of peer-reviewed articles--does not \nnecessarily change my prescribing habits. As a physician, I am trained \nthrough medical school and residency and my years of practice to \nassimilate that information, reject what I don't agree with or what I \ndon't think is good science and use, if I think it is in the best \ninterests of my patient, what is suggested.\n  In closing, let me simply say that I am disappointed that an \nobjection has been made to bringing to the floor the large bill that \nwill strengthen the FDA. It is important that we do so. It is important \nthat we extend PDUFA, which is the approval process supported by the \nprivate sector, working hand in hand with the public sector, which has \nbeen of such huge benefit to patients. We should do so because we will \nbe able to get better, improved therapies for the treatment of cancer, \npediatric diseases, blood-borne diseases, to the American people in a \nmore expeditious way, and that translates into saving lives.\n  We need to bring this bill to the floor now. We have bipartisan \nsupport. We have debated it. It was approved in a bipartisan way \nthrough the Labor and Human Resources Committee. If we do so, we will \nbe doing a great service to the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I, again, want to thank Doctor --Senator \nFrist who is a cosponsor of this bill and has lent his incredible \nexpertise to this effort. I especially thank him for his leadership, \nwith Senators Mack, Boxer, and Wyden, for their work in solving the \noff-labeling provision. Their collaboration shows the broad base of \nsupport this provision now has. Off-labeling was one of the most \ncontentious provisions in the last Congress. To come up with a solution \nof that issue is a tremendous step forward. I want to talk a little \nbit, before I wind things up here, about the broad base of support we \nhave.\n  Senator DeWine, for instance, joined with Senator Dodd in offering \nimportant amendments to establish incentives for the conduct of \nresearch into pediatric uses of existing and new drugs.\n  Senator Hutchinson had an amendment to establish a national framework \nfor pharmacy compounding with respect to State regulations which \nallowed us to move forward on another very contentious and important \nissue.\n  I also want to praise and thank Senator Mikulski for being a \ncosponsor of this legislation, and the importance of her help on PDUFA, \nof which she was a primary sponsor. We all benefit from Senator \nMikulski's determination to bring FDA into the 21st century, not just \nfor the benefit of her own constituents, but for all of us.\n  I also would like to point out that we had contributions by Senator \nDodd in the area of patient databases. He worked very closely with \nSenator Snowe and Senator Feinstein. We are grateful for their \nleadership in these areas. Senator Dodd has been a tremendous asset in \nhelping to enact broad-based reform this year. He has been of steady, \ncontinual assistance to us.\n  Also, the tremendous difficulties that we had with third-party review \nprovisions during the last Congress have undergone substantial revision \nsince it was first debated. Senator Coats in particular has shown \nincredible leadership on this issue. This was a very difficult area and \nSenator Coats has been magnanimous in his willingness to spend many \nhours in bringing about consensus. I certainly appreciate his work.\n  Senator Wellstone's contributions to the area of reforming medical \ndevice reviews shows the breadth of the philosophical collaboration we \nhad on these issues. Senator Wellstone introduced his own legislation \nto reform the medical devices approval process and many of his \nprovisions are included in this bill.\n  Also, of course, Senator Kennedy has been of incredible help, as he \nhas been on so many issues. He has worked hard and I thank him for the \nnumber of hours that he and his staff put into this bill to make sure \nwe arrived at a consensus.\n  I also thank Senator Gregg for working so hard on radio-\npharmaceuticals, on streamlining the process for reviewing health \nclaims based on Federal research, and on establishing uniformity in \nover-the-counter drugs and cosmetics. The latter issue--cosmetic \nuniformity--is still giving us some trouble.\n  But Senator Gregg has just been incredibly hard-working and effective \nwith this bill in handling four different issues.\n  Also, the two amendments that Senator Harkin had on the third-party \nreview for medical devices and also his work in other areas has been a \nvery great help and a demonstration of the broad philosophical support \nthat we have and how we are working together to bring about a \nconsensus, hopefully, before the end of the day on the remaining \nissues.\n  Mr. President, before I cease, I would like to take care of a couple \nof housekeeping matters here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8162-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8170-S8171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PROVIDING FOR THE USE OF THE CATAFALQUE\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Madam President, this week the United States Trade \nRepresentative will conduct a set of talks on China's accession to the \nWorld Trade Organization. Their results will have a great effect on our \ntrade policy for years to come. So this afternoon I want to take a few \nminutes to discuss the reason these talks are important, the state of \nUnited States-China trade, and a strategy that can help improve the \nsituation.\n  The reason these talks are important is simple. China is a big \nmarket, a big exporter, and a country with which we have a large and \ndifficult trade agenda. By virtue of population, only India equals \nChina as a potential export market. And China's economic growth, at \nnearly 10 percent a year throughout this decade, is unmatched in the \nworld.\n  Much of this growth has come from trade. Twenty years ago, China \nbarely participated in world trade. It is now the world's sixth largest \ntrader and is now our third largest source of imports after Canada and \nJapan. If you count Hong Kong together with China, the figures are even \nmore impressive.\n  But our American export performance to China is very poor. The \nCommerce Department reports $11.7 billion in goods exported in 1995, \n$12 billion in 1996, and on track for the same level this year. Adding \nexports of services, the total is about $2 billion larger, but the \ntrends are no better.\n  By contrast, our exports to the rest of the world have grown by 18 \npercent since 1995. So despite China's size, despite China's economic \ngrowth, our export performance is weak and China's importance as an \nexport market relative to other countries is rapidly declining.\n  We should be doing much better than this. There are two reasons for \nour weak performance. The first is that many of our own policies appear \ndesigned to cut our exports to China. And the second, larger problem, \nis Chinese protectionism.\n  We will start with the first point. Because while bringing down trade \nbarriers takes a lot of work and hard negotiations, we can fix our own \nmistakes pretty easily. And let me offer three examples.\n  First, we bar trade promotion programs like the Trade Development \nAgency, OPIC, and sometimes the Eximbank from operating in China. The \nSenate took a good step forward by passing my amendment last week \nshowing the Asian Environmental Partnership to work in China, but we \nhave a very, very long way to go.\n  We refuse to sell nuclear powerplants to China. This is foolish \nenough when we see that France and Japan are pushing nuclear powerplant \nexports in our absence. And it is almost surreal when you consider that \nwe are actually giving nuclear powerplants to North Korea.\n  We have an antiproliferation law that embargoes electronics exports \nif China sells missiles. That is, if China misbehaves, we sanction \nourselves. This will not work. If we are serious about reducing the \ntrade deficit, if we want a trade policy that creates jobs in America, \nwe cannot routinely prevent ourselves from exporting.\n  That is part of the solution, but not the whole solution. Because \nwhile fixing our mistakes are important, structural economic issues and \nChinese trade barriers do much more to cut our exports.\n  To date, we have used our own domestic trade law to solve our \nproblems, section 301 and Special 301, to bring down trade barriers, \nthe antidumping and countervailing duty laws to fight dumping and \nsubsidies. This policy won some results, and if necessary we should \ncontinue using it into the future. But it is a slow and frustrating \npolicy which addresses individual, specific problems rather than the \nfull spectrum of trade barriers. We need a more comprehensive approach. \nAnd we have it in China's application to enter the World Trade \nOrganization.\n  WTO rules address most of our China trade problems, from tariffs and \nquotas\n\n[[Page S8172]]\n\nto subsidies and distribution. If China accepts these rules, our trade \nfuture may be much brighter than the present. So I regard these \ndiscussions in Geneva as critically important and view China's entry to \nthe WTO on commercially acceptable grounds as very much in our national \ninterest.\n  But these talks come with risks. If we sign a bad agreement, whatever \nwe miss will stay there a long time. In that case, we should never \nexpect much from the China market. And we would set a dangerous \nprecedent for other reforming communist countries from Russia to \nUkraine to Vietnam which hope to enter the WTO.\n  To this point, China has not made acceptable offers. And if they will \nnot do it this week, we need to be patient. We need to hold out for a \ngood deal. And a good deal basically means four things.\n  First, it means market access. Today, Chinese tariffs rise to 120 \npercent for cars and 80 percent on beef. They must go down, way down. \nWe need much less restrictive quotas, abolition of unscientific \nbarriers to agricultural products, like the unfounded claims about \n``TCK smut'' on our wheat, an end to unpublished quotas and \nregulations, no more unfair inspection rules, and an open market for \nservices.\n  Second, we need an agreement by China to accept basic standards of \ntrading behavior. Trade regulations must be the same in every port and \nprovince all across China. Intellectual property must be protected and \ntechnology transfer requirements outlawed. Restrictions on national \ntreatment must go. The government must abandon policies requiring \ninvestors to export all or part of their product rather than selling it \nto the Chinese. And restrictions on trading rights must end.\n  Third, there are subsidies. We need clear and visible separation \nbetween ministries, officials, and public taxes on the one hand and \nprivate business on the other. And we need to preserve our safeguards \nagainst export subsidies and dumping. Our antidumping law has special \nrules that calculate dumping from noncompetitive economies. This is the \nright policy, given the present state of economic reform in China, and \nwe need to keep it in place.\n\n  Fourth, results and enforcement. China, as a large partially reformed \neconomy, presents questions the GATT and WTO have never encountered. So \nwe ought to have some benchmarks to measure success, including \nobjective measures of Chinese imports, and a prearranged system of \nconsultation if we see things going wrong. And when problems arise, if \nthey do, we must be ready to enforce our rights.\n  Of course, a good WTO accession works in both directions. And that \nbrings me to the third part of a better China trade strategy.\n  As GATT and WTO members, we have always, as Americans, accepted one \nbasic commitment; that is, MFN for all members, permanently and without \nconditions. If China agrees to a good WTO deal, the Chinese have the \nright to expect us to fulfill this commitment to them. It is good \npolicy on the merits. It is also the fair and honorable thing to do.\n  The right trade policy toward China is clear. We must end \nrestrictions on export promotion. We should bring down China's trade \nbarriers through a fair WTO accession agreement, if we can, and through \nlaws like Section 301, if China is not ready to make a good offer. When \nChina does make a good offer, we should live up to our own \nresponsibilities by making MFN status permanent. It can begin this \nweek.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for as much time as I consume as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8171-4", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8172-S8173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is Monday today, and somewhere deep \nin the bowels of this Capitol building, the budget people are meeting \nto finalize a budget agreement in something called the reconciliation \nbill, which deals with both spending and taxes. These are the \nbudgeteers, the people that come from the Budget Committees, and they \nwork on the budget; they know the budget. They deal in almost a foreign \nlanguage, speaking to each other in a language that most Americans \nwould not understand. Somewhere down in the recesses of this building, \nthey are now meeting, finalizing two reconciliation bills--one on \nspending and one proposing tax cuts.\n  The issue that brings me to the floor today for a moment will also \nbring me to the floor tomorrow morning on an amendment that I have \noffered. It deals with something that most Americans will not \nrecognize; it is called the universal service fund. Somewhere in this \nroom, where these budgeteers are working, they have a hole in their \nbudget plan. In other words, it doesn't quite add up. So when something \ndoesn't quite add up, what do you do? Well, in this case you get a \ndifferent adding machine. You can actually build an adding machine that \nadds it up the way you want. So they plug this hole with a plug number, \nand the plug number they use in their budget hole is called the \nuniversal service fund. I want to describe what it is and why what they \nare doing is fundamentally wrong and will lead us down the wrong path \nand cause a great deal of trouble for a lot of Americans.\n  We have something called the universal service fund in this country \nbecause we wanted to provide telephone service to all Americans at an \naffordable price. How do we do that? Well, it costs a substantial \namount of money to provide telephone service for a very small town \nbecause you have to have the same infrastructure, and you have to \nspread the costs over very few telephones. I come from a town of 300 \npeople, so I know what that is about. It is much different than the \ncost of providing a telephone in a city like New York, where you have \nliterally hundreds of thousands, or millions of telephones, and you \nspread the fixed costs over millions of telephone instruments.\n\n  So we decided in this country we would offset the cost of telephone \nservices for those very high cost areas, where it might otherwise cost \npeople $50, $100, $200 a month to have a telephone. We would offset the \ncost to make it affordable for everybody by charging everybody a little \nbit that goes into a universal service fund, and that is used to drive \ndown the telephone costs in the very small areas.\n  Why did we decide that was important as a country? Because the \npresence of every telephone makes every other telephone more valuable. \nIf the folks in the big cities could never call people in small towns \nbecause the people in small towns found that telephone cost was too \nexpensive and therefore they didn't have a telephone, the system would \nnot work, would it? That is why we have the fund.\n  A year and a half ago the Congress passed the Telecommunications Act. \nIt was the first time in nearly 60 years that Congress had reformulated \nthe laws on telecommunications. The Congress also changed the universal \nservice fund some. Now, this is not money that comes into the \nGovernment or goes out of the Government. It is a fund that is \nestablished that is administered and set up privately, or on a quasi-\nprivate basis at least.\n  What we have today is a new budget deal that is being put together in \nwhich the budgeteers are taking the universal service fund money--some \nof it--and bringing it into the Federal budget and then spending it out \nagain and using it to manipulate their numbers to plug a $2 to $4 \nbillion hole that will show up sometime in the year 2002.\n  If this sounds like foreign language to most Americans, I can \nunderstand that. But it won't sound like foreign language if the \nmanipulation and misuse of the universal service fund means that, in \nthe longer term, people in small areas, in small towns and rural areas, \nend up paying much higher monthly telephone bills because of it.\n  There is no excuse, no excuse at all, for people who are now \nnegotiating today on this budget deal to be talking about manipulating \nor misusing the universal service fund. It doesn't belong to the \nFederal Government,\n\n[[Page S8173]]\n\ndoesn't come into the Federal Treasury, and is not to be used or \nmisused by the people who are putting this budget deal together.\n  Now, I raised this issue last week, and it doesn't mean a thing, \napparently. You know, there are some people who apparently just can't \nhear. I think the budgeteers are in a soundproof room and don't hear. \nThe Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, has raised objections to \nthis. Senator McCain has raised objections to it. Senator Hollings has \nraised objections to it. I have raised objections to it. Others on the \nfloor of the Senate have raised objections. It doesn't seem to mean a \nthing. They just do their thing in this room. And the White House is \nnegotiating with the Republican leadership in Congress. That is why the \ndeal is being struck. Somehow there will be some immaculate conception \nannounced from some room here in the Capitol in the coming hours, maybe \nlater today, tomorrow, or Wednesday. There is no chance to get into \nthat deal and pull something out that is as egregious a mistake or an \nabuse as this is, because then we will only have a certain number of \nhours, and we will be able to vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the construct \nof this deal.\n  The reason I came to the floor is to say that if there are people who \nare putting this together and if they are in fact listening, listen \ncarefully and listen closely: You are doing the wrong thing. You are \nmaking a mistake. This money doesn't belong to you. This money ought \nnot to be used to plug a hole in the budget. If you are going to add \nsomething up, add it up honestly. If you come up short, find an honest \nway to cover the shortfall. Do not misuse or manipulate the universal \nservice fund.\n\n  I saw on television once a program by a fellow named David \nCopperfield, a great illusionist, and he provided marvelous \nentertainment, creating these wonderful illusions for his television \naudience. Most people, like me, understood it was a trick. The \nwonderment was, how did they do that trick? I don't understand it. But \nwith respect to illusions performed by Mr. Copperfield, I suppose \neverybody understands it's trickery.\n  Why don't we understand in Congress when we create an illusion like \nthis in the budget, it is also trickery, and trickery doesn't belong in \nthese budget agreements. It doesn't belong here, and they ought not \nbring to it the floor, using the universal service fund--or I should \nsay misusing those funds.\n  We will vote on that tomorrow. I offered an amendment last week, \nwhich is scheduled for decision in the morning. We will, if we are not \ntoo late, send a message to the budgeteers: Do not do this. It is the \nwrong thing.\n  I said on Thursday that I recall at a motel in Minneapolis near the \nairport, they had a little sign where the manager parked. It was near \nthe front door, so I suppose everybody wanted to park there. It said, \n``manager's parking space.'' Then below it, it said, ``don't even think \nabout parking here.'' I thought, wow, I bet no one thinks about parking \nthere. That is what this Congress ought to say to the people \nnegotiating these deals: Don't even think about doing something like \nthis. It is not the right thing to do. It misuses funds that are not \nyours. Don't even think about it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8172-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8173-S8174]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FAST-TRACK TRADE AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, because the Senate has very little \nbusiness today, I wanted to come to the floor to talk about the \nuniversal service fund issue. But because we don't have much else to \ndo, I need to unburden myself on a couple of other issues.\n  This deals with a subject discussed by my colleague from Montana, \nSenator Baucus, on the issue of trade. He was discussing one small \nissue with respect to China and the WTO. I want to talk about another \nissue that is going to be the subject of substantial debate in the \nmonth of September. When we get back from the August recess, which \nCongress will take, we are told that the administration will request \nfrom this Congress something called fast-track authority for trade \nnegotiations.\n  Fast-track authority, again, is a term that doesn't mean much, \nperhaps, to most. Everything with fast seems to me to connote something \nthat is kind of interesting. There is fast food, fast talk, fast track. \nIt all kind of connotes doing something unusual, not taking time to \nprepare. Fast track means that somebody can go negotiate a trade \nagreement someplace, bring it back to Congress, and once they bring it \nto Congress nobody in Congress has the right to offer amendments. That \nis fast track. To me that is undemocratic. But it is called fast track.\n\n  We have negotiated several trade agreements under fast track. All of \nthem have been abysmal failures, terrible failures. We were told that \nwe should grant fast track authority once again so our trade \nnegotiators can go abroad and negotiate new trade agreements with other \ncountries.\n  Let me review for just a moment what this has gotten us, and why I \nand some others in this Chamber intend in September to come and \naggressively oppose both the President and those in this Chamber who \nwant to extend fast-track trade authority. We asked for fast-track \ntrade authority for negotiating a trade agreement with Mexico, our \nneighbor to the south. Do you know that just before we negotiated a \ntrade agreement with Mexico under fast track that we had a trade \nsurplus with Mexico? In other words, our trade balance was to our \nfavor--not much, but a trade surplus. So we negotiated a trade \nagreement with Mexico.\n  Guess what happens? Now we have an enormous trade deficit with \nMexico. What has happened to American jobs? They go to Mexico.\n  Do you know that we import more cars from Mexico into the United \nStates of America than the United States exports to all of the rest of \nthe world? Think of that. We import more cars from Mexico to our \ncountry than we export to the rest of the world. We were told that if \nwe would just do this trade deal with Mexico, all it would mean is that \nthe products of low-skilled labor would come into this country from \nMexico but certainly not high-skilled labor.\n  What comes from Mexico? Cars, car parts, electronics--exactly the \nopposite kinds of products given the assurances that we were given when \nthe deal was done with Mexico. I didn't support the North American \nFree-Trade Agreement--this so-called free-trade agreement with Mexico. \nThey attached a free-trade handle to this agreement. That is another \nname thing--free trade; free lunch. There is no free lunch. The fact is \nthere is nothing free about free trade.\n  You would think our trade negotiators ought to be able to go out and \nnegotiate a trade agreement that we would win from time to time. Why is \nit that our trade negotiators seem to lose every trade agreement that \nthey enter into?\n  Then there is Canada. We had a free-trade agreement with Canada. Now \nthe trade deficit with Canada has gotten much worse. We have a peculiar \nand difficult circumstance with our Canadian border up in the North \nDakota area with the flood of unfairly subsidized Canadian grain coming \nsouth across our border.\n  How about Japan or China? We have massive trade deficits every single \nyear with these countries. And the trade deficit doesn't diminish. It \ndoesn't get smaller. It doesn't improve. These trade deficits are \nabiding deficits every single year.\n  What does it mean to our country when you have a long-term trade \ndeficit? With China it has gone from $10 million up to $40 billion in a \ndozen years. As a result, our country has become a cash cow for China's \nhard currency needs. It is fundamentally unfair to our workers in our \ncountry, and it is unfair to our factories and our producers in our \ncountry.\n  People say, ``Well, but those of you who do not like these trade \nagreements, you just do not understand. You do not have the breadth and \nthe ability to see across the horizon. You do not see the world view \nhere.'' What we do see is this country's interests.\n  I am all for expanding our trade. I am all for fair trade. But I will \nbe darned if we ought to stand in this country for a trade \nrelationship--the one we have with Japan, the one we have with China, \nthe one we have with Mexico, or Canada for that matter, and others--\nthat allows our producers and our workers to be put in a position where \nthey cannot compete against unfair trade.\n  We cannot and should not have to compete in any circumstance with any\n\n[[Page S8174]]\n\ncountry that produces a product using 14-year-old kids working 14 hours \na day, being paid 14 cents an hour, and then ships their product to \nToledo, Fargo, Denver, and San Francisco. Then we are told, ``You \ncompete with that, America. You compete with that.'' We shouldn't have \nto compete with that.\n  When we put people in our factories, we have a child labor law. When \nwe put people in our factories, we have a minimum wage. When our people \nwork in our factories, we have air pollution laws against polluting air \nand against polluting water.\n  Then a producer says to us, ``Well, that is fine if you want to do \nthat. If you want to protect children, pay a decent wage and protect \nyour air and water, we will go elsewhere. We will produce elsewhere. We \nwill produce in China, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Mexico. We will \nproduce elsewhere where we are not nearly as encumbered by the niceties \nof production such as child labor laws or minimum wages.'' We shouldn't \nhave to put up with that.\n  The point I am making is this: Those who come to us in September and \nsay, ``Give us fast-track trade authority so we can go out and \nnegotiate new trade agreements,'' ought to understand that some of us \nbelieve that you ought to correct the old trade agreements you have \nfirst. You ought to correct the problems that are causing massive \ndeficits with Mexico, massive trade deficits with China, and massive \ndeficits with Japan.\n  I am not saying that we want to close our markets to them. Instead we \nneed to be saying to them, ``When you want to buy things, then you buy \nfrom us.'' We say to China, ``If you have a $40 billion trade deficit \nwith us, when you want to buy airplanes, you buy them from us. When you \nwant to buy wheat, you come shop in this country.''\n  Instead, China shops around the world for wheat. When it needs \nairplanes, it says to one major American airplane company, ``By the \nway, we would like to buy your airplanes, but we want you to \nmanufacture them in China.''\n  That doesn't work. It is not fair trade. It is not the way the trade \nsystem ought to work.\n  Those of us who feel that way in September are going to be here on \nthe floor saying fast-track trade authority ought not be extended. What \nwe ought to do to the extent that we have the energy is to fix the \ntrade problems that now exist--yes, in NAFTA, in GATT, and in bilateral \ntrade relationships with Japan and China and others. That is the job we \nshould be doing. Congress has the responsibility to insist the \nadministration does it, and Congress itself needs to be involved in \ndoing it.\n  I know what will happen when we do that in September when the \nadministration asks for fast-track authority and some of us stand up \nand say, ``Wait a second; we wonder whether this is in the interests of \nour country.'' We will have people immediately jump up and say, ``Yes, \nyou people are against free trade. You are a bunch of xenophobic, \nisolationist stooges who simply don't understand this world now is a \nsmaller world. We from day to day and minute to minute have trade \nrelationships with each other all around the globe, and you don't \nunderstand that. You never have gotten it, and you don't get it now.'' \nWe hear those discussions virtually always when we raise the question \nof trade.\n  On the other hand, I think maybe those who view us in such a cavalier \nway will have to deal with the insistence of some of us that we finally \nmust as a country insist on fair trade relationships. Perhaps they will \nbegin to understand these abiding and long-term trade deficits. \nIncidentally, the largest trade deficits in the history of our country \nare occurring now. We currently have the largest merchandise trade \ndeficits in our history. Maybe they will come to understand that these \ntrade deficits will retard this country's long-term economic growth and \nhurt this country and we must do something about them.\n  There is great anxiety in this Chamber--and has been for a long \nwhile--about the budget deficit. We have made enormous progress in \nreducing that budget deficit. But there has not been a whisper in this \nChamber about suggesting we do something about the largest trade \ndeficit in American history. That trade deficit relates to jobs, \neconomic opportunities, and the future of this country as well. It is \nlong past the time when we do something about it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8173-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8174-S8175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEDICARE WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I would like to make comments on one \nadditional subject today, a subject that many of us are working on in \nboth the Republican and Democratic caucuses, and one that is also very \nimportant to our country.\n  The inspector general about a week and a half ago in Health and Human \nServices released a report on the Medicare Program, and indicated to us \nin Congress and to the American people that they felt that as much as \n$17 billion to $23 billion a year is essentially wasted in the area of \nMedicare, for a range of reasons and a range of areas--waste, fraud, \nand abuse. They describe bills that were inappropriate, bills that were \nerroneous, services billed for that were never provided, and some \nfraud.\n  The reason that is an important report is that it follows on the \nheels of the Government Accounting Office, the inspector for the \nCongress, the GAO, which also had indicated that it felt somewhere in \nthe neighborhood of $20 billion to $23 billion a year is wasted in the \narea of Medicare. By ``wasted,'' I mean waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  A good number of people have tried to tackle this subject at one time \nor another and with some limited success.\n  The American people would look at Medicare and probably conclude that \nit was a very important program. I happen to be a supporter of \nMedicare. I think it was a very important program for this country to \ndevelop.\n  Prior to the 1960's, when this country developed the Medicare \nProgram, far fewer than half of the American senior citizen population \nhad any health insurance at all--and that was for obvious reasons. \nThere are not insurance companies formed in this country to run around \nseeing if they can provide unlimited insurance to people who are \nreaching an age of retirement and where they are going to need more and \nmore health care in older age. It is not the way insurance companies \nmake money. Insurance companies search for that healthy 25-year-old who \nis not going to need any health care and sign them up to pay health \ninsurance premiums. All of us know that. That is where insurance \ncompanies make money. Do you know of an insurance company that says, \n``Our mission in life is to make a profit by searching out old folks \nand seeing if we can provide insurance to old folks''? I don't think \nso. That is not the way it works. In order to have health insurance for \npeople at any age, they would have to charge so much that most people \ncouldn't afford it. The result was that in 1955, 1960, 1962 fewer than \nhalf of America's senior citizens had any health care coverage at all.\n  We passed Medicare and made certain that the fear of reaching \nretirement age and not having health care coverage would be gone \nforever. Medicare guaranteed those citizens who reached that age--age \n65--that they were going to have health insurance coverage. And it has \nbeen a marvelous program in many ways. After health care was provided \nfor senior citizens in the early 1960's in the Medicare Program, 99 \npercent of the senior citizens in this country have coverage for health \ncare--99 percent. That is a remarkable success.\n  Something else has happened in this intervening period, and it is \nalso called success. People are living longer and living better. \nMedical breakthroughs extend life in a very significant way. One-\nhundred years ago at the turn of this century, if you were alive, you \nwere expected on average to live to be 48 years of age. One century \nlater, you have a reasonable expectancy to live to be 78 years of age--\nfrom 48 to 78 in one century. That is progress. These days, on average, \nyou live to 77 or 78 years of age. You have a bad knee, replace the \nknee; a bad hip, replace the hip; cataracts, get surgery, and you can \nsee again. Plug up your heart muscle for over 50 or 60 years, open the \nchest and unplug the heart muscle with open-heart surgery. I have been \nto meetings where people have stood up at a meeting and said, ``You \nknow, I have a new knee. I have a new hip. I had cataract surgery and \nhad some blockages removed with heart surgery,'' and then said, ``and \nwe are sick of the Government spending money.''\n\n[[Page S8175]]\n\n  Well, all of that cost money in Medicare. It is remarkable. It is \nbreathtaking. It is wonderful that people live longer and medical \nbreakthroughs allow them the opportunity to walk when they couldn't \nhave previously walked and see when they couldn't have seen--and to do \nother things that give them a better life. But it is also very costly. \nIt has costs with expanded Medicare payments, and all of us must \nunderstand that.\n  This program has grown largely because of success. The life span \nincreases with breakthroughs in medical care. All of that spells more \nmoney in Medicare. We understand that. I think the American people \naccept that as a success story, except no one will believe it is a \nsuccess story to have a program that has up to $20 billion a year of \nwaste in the program. When the American people hear the stories that \nfor a bottle of saline solution that you can go down to the drug store \nand buy for $1.03 and Medicare pays $7.90 for it, they have a right to \nsay, ``What on Earth is going on here?'' Medicare will pay $211 for a \nhome diabetes monitor used by diabetics to test their blood sugar \nlevels. You can buy the same one not for $211 but for $39 at the local \nstore; or the gauze pad that Medicare paid $2.33 for that you can buy \nfor 23 cents. The American people have every right to say, ``What on \nEarth is going on? If you can't run a program, get a crowd in here that \ncan run a program.'' Or, ``If the Congress can't pass the laws to make \nsure it is run the right way, then get somebody else to pass the laws \nto make sure it is run the right way.''\n  We ought to aggressively pursue fraud. When we see people committing \nfraud in Medicare, we ought to send them to jail, arrest them and \nprosecute them, and say, ``You commit fraud against the American \npeople, your address is going to be your jail cell to the end of your \nterm.'' When we see overbilling and overcharges, when we see \nadministration that is not competent, we need to take action.\n  The inspector general report of a week and a half ago sends another \nwarning to this Congress that we must take action to prevent this kind \nof Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Mr. President, $20 billion a year is outrageous. If we are going to \ncontinue the support that is necessary for a Medicare Program that is \nimportant for this country, this Congress has to take action and take \naction soon.\n  There are some remedies in the reconciliation bill that will come to \nthe floor this week but not enough. We must do much, much more. I know \nthere are Republicans and Democrats in this Congress anxious to work \ntogether on this problem to hopefully prevent there from ever again \nbeing another GAO report or inspector general report that provides this \nkind of awful news about a Federal program that is so important to so \nmany Americans.\n  Madam President, with that I conclude my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have just returned from my home State \nand I can certify that the issue of a balanced budget act and tax \nrelief is on the minds of a lot of Americans. Everywhere I went, \nwhether it was stepping out for lunch or meeting with various groups, \nsomebody would come up and say: Get this done. Hold firm. Stay the \ncourse.\n  America wants this to happen. America wants a balanced budget act to \npass and be signed by the President. It will be the first one in nearly \n30 years. That is hard to believe, that we have so abused our financial \nhealth that this will be the first balanced budget we will be passing \nin 30 years. And they want the tax relief. I don't think I have met a \ncitizen that didn't, in some way, start calculating, like the young \ncounty commissioner I met who is a farmer and a full-time county \ncommissioner, and he has two children. He said, ``If that measure \npasses, that's going to save my family $1,000, $500 per child.'' Or the \nelderly couple who are concerned about maybe selling their home and \nrelocating, who are concerned about the capital gains tax that \ncurrently rests against that property. Or the family that talked about \nthe onerous nature of death taxes in America, the kinds of decisions \nand pressures it puts on small businesses and family farms. They really \ndo want this done. I hope, as I said last week, the President will set \naside the partisan nature of this issue, and trying to one-up somebody \nelse, and just get it done.\n  I was reading in today's Washington Post, it says:\n\n       Congressional Republican leaders said last night they were \n     on the verge of a final budget and tax agreement with the \n     White House after making a major concession on the proposed \n     $500-per-child family tax credit and dropping their \n     insistence on ``indexing'' a reduction in the capital gains \n     tax.\n\n  Or, in the New York Times, Monday, July 28:\n\n       Budget Deal Down To ``Small Issues,'' Gingrich Declares. \n     Spokesman for President Says Assessment Is Premature--\n     Meetings Continue.\n\n  This is something that both the leaders of our House and Senate and \nPresident should really come forward on, get it done, and make a \nstatement that we have, in a bipartisan way, produced major policy. I \nwould revisit, once again, the fact that if the leadership of both \nparties in the Senate, the leadership of the Finance Committee, both \nparties, the leadership of the Budget Committee, both parties, if they \nall could find a balanced budget act and a tax relief act on which they \ncould agree, it ought to send a pretty powerful message to the \nPresident and his administration. Remember that 73 Members of the \nSenate, a majority of both parties' conferences, voted for the Balanced \nBudget Act, and 80 of them voted for the Tax Relief Act.\n  I don't know what more proof you could have that these proposals are\n\n[[Page S8176]]\n\nwell-founded, evenly distributed, and essentially fair. Perfect? No. \nThat's not possible in this environment. But anything that can get that \nkind of support of the leadership, as I said, of both parties, that is \na powerful statement and I hope the President would take note of it.\n  I would like to take just a few minutes and put these two major \npieces of legislation in context. I think it would explain why \nsomewhere between 60 and 75 percent of the American public wants this \nto happen. Let's just go back to the beginning of this decade, 1990. In \n1990, under the Bush administration, a historically high tax increase \nwas passed in August 1990. In round numbers, about $250 billion of new \ntax burden were put on American workers and their families. A lot of \npeople feel that had much to do with President Bush being defeated in \nthe following election, in 1992. I think there were a lot of issues \ninvolved, but many feel that was the turning point.\n  On top of that, his opponent, soon-to-be-President Clinton, was \ncampaigning across the country that he was going to lower taxes, \npointing to that tax increase of 1990. ``The middle class needs a \nbreak,'' he said. He was elected in 1992 and came to Washington as the \nnew President. However, before he had moved into the White House, he \nhad discarded that promise, and, by August 1993, in his first year in \noffice, instead of lowering taxes on the middle class, he raised them. \nHe raised taxes to an all-time--in an all-time historical--in the size \nof the tax increases, it was even larger than the previous one which \noccurred in the Bush administration. It was over $250 billion. So, \nbetween 1990 and 1993, the American workers and their families suddenly \nwere carrying a half a trillion in new taxes, and they were paying the \nhighest tax levels they had ever paid.\n  It is little wonder there is so much anxiety in middle America and \ntheir families. Even with the economy in reasonably good shape, the \nenthusiasm is less than wondrous. I decided about 2-years ago to take a \nlook at that family. That family in Georgia, and I think this would be \ntrue in most of our States, earned about $40,000 a year in gross \nincome. Typically, both parents work today, as you know. And when \nPresident Clinton came to Washington, they were only keeping about 53 \npercent of their paychecks. After they paid for State taxes, local \ntaxes, and Federal taxes, cost of Government and their share of higher \ninterest rates because of a $5.4 trillion national debt, they were \nkeeping 53 cents on the dollar. Unfortunately, today they are only \nkeeping 47 cents on the dollar. The decline in their disposable income \nmarches on.\n\n  These families, in my view, have been pressed to the wall, and we \nhave made it exceedingly difficult for these families to do what we \nhave always depended on the American family to do, that is, educate, \nhouse, provide for health, transportation, get the country up in the \nmorning and off to work and school, and prepare their families and \nchildren for stewardship when it is their time to lead. In a situation \nwhere they are paying more in taxes than housing, education, and food \ncombined, we have a problem in America. If the forefathers were here \nand could see what we have been confiscating and taking out of the \nchecking accounts, and taking away from those who earned their income, \nthey would be stunned. They would think this was a violation of the \nessential premises upon which the Nation was founded, which included \neconomic freedom.\n  Let me put this in another context. My mother and father, born in \n1912 and 1916, kept 80 percent of their lifetime paychecks to do the \nthings I mentioned a moment ago: raise the family--me and my sister--\neducate, house, provide for health and prepare for stewardship. My \nsister is 10 years younger than I. She will keep about 50 percent of \nher lifetime paycheck, and her daughter, my niece, who has just begun \nher career under the current scheme of things, will only keep about a \nthird of her lifetime paychecks.\n  My niece is not going to be free, by the American definition I \nunderstand, if 70-plus percent of her paycheck is going somewhere else \nand she is left with a third of the money she earns to do her job in \nlife. Her options have been severely constrained from those of her \ngrandmother and grandfather. Those options that my dad and my mom had \nare the very things that made America what it is.\n  My dad began his career as a coal truck driver. Had he been born in \nthe sphere of the Soviet bloc, I am convinced he would have died a coal \ntruck driver. But, instead, he lived a life of entrepreneurial spirit \nand dreams and visions, creating businesses and jobs, the very things \nthat economic freedom have done for our country. The genesis of all \nAmerican glory is our freedom, and one of the cornerstones of that \nfreedom is economic freedom, economic choices that families and workers \nin America can make that families and workers in many countries around \nthe world could not.\n  Which brings me to the point I am trying to make about the importance \nof this tax relief proposal. Keep in mind what I said a moment ago. In \n1990, $250 billion in new taxes were laid on the backs of American \nworkers and families. In 1993, though promised tax relief, they got \nanother $250 billion in taxes. So we now have, in 3 years, a half a \ntrillion in new taxes. This proposal we are talking about is really \nonly a first step. The net tax relief is $85 billion and you have to \nstand that against the $500 billion new tax burden.\n  It really only represents relief of about 20, 25 percent of the taxes \nthat have been put on the backs of these people in the last 36 months.\n  In the last Congress, the new Republican majority tried to refund the \nPresident's tax increase. We sent the President a tax relief package, \nabout $245 billion, but he vetoed it. So he kept that tax burden in \nplace and on the back of every worker and every working family.\n  We have been through another election. We had a President who said \nthe era of big Government is over. We had a Republican majority in the \nSenate and the House committed to reining in the size of Government, \ncommitted to balancing our budgets, committed to lowering taxes and, \nfinally, the convergence of these two agree to a minimalist--what this \nis--a minimalist tax relief. But nevertheless, it is moving in the \nright direction. It is moving in the right direction, and it will be \nsignificant to millions of American families. I hope that it is but the \nfirst step and that a healthier economy would produce yet a new \nopportunity to lower the tax burden.\n  From my perspective, a worker in America ought to, at a minimum--at a \nminimum--keep two-thirds of their paycheck. Just two-thirds. It ought \nto be more. Getting to a position where they can keep two-thirds is a \nherculean task. They are currently keeping 47 to 50. On an average \nbasis, that means this Congress, this President ought to be working to \nkeep $8,000 per year--$8,000 per year--in the checking account of every \naverage family across America.\n  Just think what those families could do with that resource in the \ncontext of education, health insurance, housing, recreation, savings. \nAmerican families don't save anything. They can't save for the rainy \nday. They can't save for education upfront. They are having a hard time \nsaving for retirement.\n  What can you save, Mr. President, after the Government has marched \nthrough your checking account and walked off with over half of it? Talk \nabout freedom. I sort of look at it this way. If somebody marches \nthrough my checking account and takes over half of what I earn, they--\nit--has more to do with my life than I do. In family after family \nacross our land, that is what is happening today, and that is why this \ntax relief proposal is on target and correct, and the President needs \nto come forward, meet, as is being endeavored here of the leadership of \nthe Congress trying to meet him halfway--just like what happened \nbetween the Democrat and Republican leadership here in the Senate --and \nget this done. Get this done for those average checking accounts and \nstart finding a way to get that $8,000 back into the average checking \naccount of the average working family across our country.\n  There is one feature in the Senate proposal that we sent across to \nthe House. We added it in the debate here. As you know, the President \nhas called for $35 billion of the tax relief should be in tax \nadvantages that occur against tuition and higher education and tax \ncredits that occur for families who\n\n[[Page S8177]]\n\nhave students in higher education. That is a huge piece of the $85 \nbillion, I might add. He and his colleagues are arguing that this tax \nrelief for families that have students in higher education is the most \nimportant component of it, in his mind.\n  There are some critics of that. I can support that, because it at \nleast is leaving those dollars in the checking accounts of those \nfamilies. I personally believe it should be broader based. I think if a \nfamily wants that tax relief to buy a new home, if a family wants that \ntax relief to deal with other problems--health--they ought to have the \noption. It ought not to be just tax relief only if you are a family \nthat has a child confronting the cost of higher education. That is \nfine, too, but it ought to have been broader. But in the series of \ncompromises with the President, we will probably come very close to \nhonoring his request.\n  In my view, while cost of higher education is critical, the problem \nin American education is in grades 1 through 12. It is at the \nelementary level. It is in high school. Look at the data. Somewhere \nbetween 50 and 60 percent of the students coming to college this \nSeptember will not be able to read proficiently.\n  Look at the comparison of our reading skills, our math skills, our \nscience skills against the other industrialized nations. And I am \ntalking about the students that are coming out of our elementary and \nsecondary schools getting ready for college, and we don't look very \nwell. Everybody knows it. We are at the bottom of the list time and \ntime again. One through 10, we will be 10.\n  So I think the President's proposal was weak on the failure to \naddress issues at the elementary level, and I offered an amendment, \nalong with our colleagues, which said that the savings accounts that \nwere created also for higher education, in the version that came from \nthe Senate Finance Committee, said you could take after-tax dollars, up \nto $2,000, and put them in a savings account and the buildup would be \ntax-free.\n  So when you took it out to pay for costs of higher education, you \nwould not pay taxes on the interest that had accrued. That is a good \nidea. But my amendment took it down to grade one and said you could use \nthe buildup to pay for costs associated with elementary and high \nschool. We said you could take it out for home schooling. We said you \ncould take it out for transportation. We said that you could take it \nout for computers or tutoring. We said you could take it out for \ntuition. If you, the family, decided that you wanted your child to go \nto some other type of school, you could use these funds to help pay for \nthat.\n\n  If you put the maximum contribution in, by the time the child was \nready for first grade, you would have $15,000 in that account to help \ndeal with decisions that were important to that family regarding \neducation at the elementary level and high school level.\n  Mr. President, the administration has voiced concerns about this, and \nthey are beyond me. What would be the logic of denying a family the \nopportunity to have this savings account and to draw on it for \ncomputers, home schooling, tutoring, transportation, or tuition? I find \nit most difficult to understand how we could object to that at the \nelementary and high school level.\n  Do we not have confidence in these parents that they can make \ndecisions about how to improve the situation for their children at the \nlevel of education that is certifiably the most troubling in America, \nthat is producing data that has every American across our land worried \nand bothered, that we are not competing at this level with students of \nthe industrialized nations around the world? Why wouldn't we want to \nfocus, why wouldn't we allow that tax credit to go into a savings \naccount once it has been put in place, which you could also add to this \nsavings account?\n  Mr. President, as I said, there have been objections raised regarding \nthis very simple and, I think, straightforward and clean proposal. I am \npleased to say that as of the hour of 4:30 on Monday, July 28, after a \nseries of conferences, first between the Senate and the House to come \nto a congressional agreement, which has been done and that is \nimportant--the House and Senate have met and concurred and they have \nagreed that this position shaped by the Senate should be in the \ncongressional proposal, and it is. I thank the conferees, and I thank \nthe Speaker, in particular, for fighting to keep this proposal in the \nmix.\n  So we are now down to a point that the only opposition to this \nconcept would be the President, who would be, I guess, saying it's not \na good idea for families to be able to have savings accounts that \naccrue resources that would allow families to make prudent decisions \nabout how to help students, their children, confront the one arena in \nAmerican education that is so troubling, that is having so much \ndifficulty, that is sending youngsters to college who are having \ntrouble with the basic skills of reading and writing and arithmetic. \nThe ABC's, the things that every student who is going to be successful \nin college, who is going to be successful in their career must know. We \nare not getting that job done. This is but a small step in allowing \nthis kind of opportunity or this one more option, one more ability to \ndeal with this troubling arena in American education.\n  So I am very hopeful, and I call on the President and his \nadministration to agree to the education IRA to be used for a child's \neducation, grades 1 through 12, and leave this in the tax relief \npackage that we hope will ultimately be done and hopefully done this \nweek.\n  What a great message to send America as it enters into the final \nmonth of the vacation summer to begin the aggressive era of the fall to \nsay, ``We, the Congress and the President, came together and have \nsecured a balanced budget the first time in 3 decades, and we, Congress \nand the President, have obtained a tax relief act first in a decade and \na half.'' It would be a powerful message to send to our country and the \nworld at this time.\n\n  I have a little bit more to say about that, but I see that we have \nbeen joined by the distinguished Senator from Washington. And I yield \nas much time as the Senator requires to comment on these subjects of \nbalanced budgets and taxes.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we here in the Congress and the White \nHouse seem at this point to be on the verge of an agreement which will \npay two magnificent dividends to the American people.\n  The first is the promise of a balanced budget, not just one time, not \njust on a touch-and-go basis, but perhaps with a sufficient number of \nreforms on spending policies so that we can reasonably expect a \nbalanced budget for a considerable period of time in the future.\n  Even the promise of that balanced budget, Mr. President, a promise \nmade 2 years ago by the first Republican Congress, has been largely \nresponsible for interest rates, on average, to be 1\\1/2\\ percentage \npoints lower than they were when that Congress came into being. For a \nmiddle-class family with an $80,000 mortgage and $15,000 automobile \nloan, that means $100 more a month for the family to use or to save or \nto spend on its own rather than on interest payments.\n  Beyond that, Mr. President, it means that the United States will have \nsubstantially ended the practice of spending money that it did not have \nyear after year after year, borrowing that money and sending the bill \nto our children and to our grandchildren.\n  The second wonderful dividend which we seem about to present to the \nAmerican people is tax relief. Just 4 years ago, perhaps to the month, \nwe were here debating--and on this side of the aisle opposing \nunsuccessfully--what turned out to be the largest tax increase, \nmeasured in dollars, in the history of the United States.\n  Today, that debate, that idea is buried, if not forgotten. And we \nhave changed the entire direction of the debate here from how much more \ncan we spend and how much more can we tax to how can we limit the \nspending habits of the Government of the United States and what kind of \ndividend in the form of tax relief can we return to the American \npeople.\n  We now talk about tax relief rather than about tax increases. The \ndebate over what kind of tax relief, Mr. President, has obscured the \nprofound nature\n\n[[Page S8178]]\n\nof the change in this debate. It is all too easy to forget that it has \nonly been for the last 2 years that we have seriously been debating tax \nrelief. My friend and colleague from Georgia just pointed out, quite \naccurately, that this will be the first tax relief for the American \npeople in more than a decade and a half.\n  Mr. President, many may say that this tax relief proposal is modest. \nAnd modest it is. It is perhaps one-third as large as the 1993 tax \nincrease. And so it is only a first step, at least as far as we here on \nthis side of the aisle are concerned. But there will be very real tax \nrelief for hard-working, middle-class citizens of the United States, \nfamilies with children, very real tax relief from the burden of capital \ngains taxation, a form of tax relief which will certainly increase \nsavings and investment and career opportunities for Americans today and \nfor future generations of America as well, with tax relief in the field \nof estate taxation, a particularly vicious form of taxation that \npenalizes success, breaks up small businesses, requires farms to be \nsold and undercuts some of the most important bases upon which a \nsuccessful American economy has been built.\n  No, Mr. President, since we began this campaign, this crusade with \nthe new Republican Congress just a little bit more than 2 years ago, \ninterest rates have declined, real hourly wages are moving up after 2 \nyears of decline at the beginning of the first Clinton administration, \nmillions of new jobs are in existence, unemployment is as low as it has \nbeen in decades.\n  Mr. President, it is appropriate to say that we are on the verge of \nsuccess because we have been able to work together. We have listened to \nthe demand that the American people made by their votes less than a \nyear ago that a Republican Congress work with a Democratic President in \norder to see to it the budget was balanced and tax relief was made \navailable to the American people.\n  We, on this side of the aisle, are delighted at our success in \nchanging the nature of the debate from how much more Government shall \nwe have and how much more shall we pay for it, to how can we discipline \nthe Government's demand for money and how can we provide tax relief for \nthe American people.\n  One success, however, Mr. President, I submit, has a real opportunity \nto lead to another. And so I trust that this quiet Monday will lead to \na challenging week, and that by the end of the week a promise made more \nthan 2 years ago on a balanced budget and tax relief for the American \npeople will have been fulfilled.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nhis comments regarding these important topics.\n  At this time I yield up to 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  And let me thank the Senator from Georgia for bringing us to the \nfloor this afternoon to discuss what hopefully by the end of this week \nwill be a bit of history. And I believe it will be the right kind of \nhistory, written by the House and the Senate and the White House, that \ndeals with significant tax relief for the American taxpayer and some \nvery major budget reform.\n  I have had the privilege of now serving in the Senate a good number \nof years and also in the U.S. House. And since the early 1980s, I \nbecame an outspoken advocate for a balanced budget. I watched as our \ndebt and deficit grew, becoming increasingly alarmed that somehow we \nwould pass on to our children and their children a legacy of debt that \nwould be almost insurmountable, that could cripple the economy of this \ncountry and lead us down a road to economic deterioration and a second- \nor third-rate Nation.\n  Because of concern, shared by many here in the Congress, and by a \ngrowing number of American taxpayers, throughout the decade of the \n1980s and into the early 1990s, we continued that drumbeat to where it \nis without question a majority sentiment among the American people \ntoday, such an overwhelming majority sentiment that in 1994 they \nchanged the character of the U.S. Congress, and they significantly \naltered the attitude of a President who came to town not to balance the \nbudget and not to give tax relief but to be able to do quite the \nopposite, to increase the Federal dominance over the American \ncharacter, to raise taxes, and to continue a liberal Democratic legacy \nof an ever-increasingly larger Government taking an ever-increasingly \nlarger chunk of the American worker's paycheck. Thanks to Americans, \nthanks to Republicans, thanks to conservatives, that message got \naltered.\n  Throughout the last several weeks, because of a budget proposal and a \ntax proposal put together by the Republican leadership and this \nPresident, voted on with the substantial bipartisan support of the U.S. \nSenate, the White House, the Finance Committees, the Budget Committees, \nalong with the leadership, have been in internal negotiations to bring \nthat about, again, reducing the overall size of Government, moving us \ntoward a balanced budget, and for the first time in 16 years giving tax \nrelief to the American people.\n  That agreement is not at hand yet, but we are told that that could \nwell become the case this week. And I hope it is. I hope it gives to \nthe American working family the kind of relief they deserve during a \nperiod when they are being taxed at the highest rate ever, that it \ngives to the American investor an opportunity to change the character \nof his or her investment to create even more jobs, to keep the economy \neven stronger than it is today for a longer and a more sustained period \nof time and that says to the less fortunate in our country, you too \nwill benefit, you too will benefit by being able to keep more of your \nhard-earned dollars. And it says to those who are concerned about \neducation, you can put a little more away to provide for that day when \nyou will want to help your children gain a higher level of education so \nthey can advance themselves in our society.\n  All of that is historic. We may, while serving here on a day-to-day, \nyear-to-year basis, lose that perspective, but I do not think the \nAmerican people will, because we are saying to them, we heard you, we \nheard you loudly and clearly. And while a marathon race is not won by a \nsingle lap around the track, or the Super Bowl is not won by a single \nvictory at the beginning of the season, this is in itself a victory, a \nsignificant victory in that long march away from an ever-larger \nGovernment that takes more and more away from the average taxpayer, \nboth in his or her earnings and in his or her freedoms.\n  So I hope that the work that has gone on the last 2 weeks, in fact, \nbears fruit. I am excited about the opportunity to debate these issues \non the floor of the Senate this week and to vote by week's end on a \nhistoric budget package that continues to bring us toward a balanced \nbudget and a historic tax package that offers tax relief to the average \ntaxpayer again for the second time in 16 years.\n  So let me again thank the Senator from Georgia for his continued \nleadership on this issue, coming to the floor day after day to inform \nthe American people about what we are about and what we are striving to \nachieve, oftentimes behind closed doors because of the nature of the \nkind of negotiations that have gone on, but must require ultimately in \nthe end to be made public. So let me thank my colleague from Georgia.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the Senator from Idaho for the contributions \nhe has made, not only here today but throughout this Congress, with \nregard to balancing budgets and tax relief.\n  At this time I yield to the distinguished Senator from Texas for up \nto 10 minutes on the subject of the balanced budget and tax relief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for \nwanting to talk about this very important issue, because, as we speak \non the\n\n[[Page S8179]]\n\nfloor here today, I hope that the negotiations are about to come to an \nend and we will give the American family the first tax break they have \nhad in 16 years.\n  I think it is an incredible thing to say that we haven't had a real \ntax cut in this country for 16 years. As hard-working Americans have \ntried to improve their quality of life, it just seems like their \nexpenses have gone up so much that we now find that the spouses are \nworking more, sometimes just to pay taxes. That is not what we want in \nthis country. We want spouses to have the option of staying home, if \nthey want to, and not make them work because they can't make ends meet. \nIf we are going to continue the American dream of increasing our \nquality of life with each generation, we are going to have to pare \nGovernment down, balance the budget, make sure that people are not \npaying any more taxes than we have to have to run a Government.\n  I think the time has come for us to take a leadership role. In fact, \nthat is what Congress is trying to do. We came into power in this \nCongress, starting after the elections of 1994, with very clear goals: \nto make Government smaller; to let people keep more of the money they \nearn; to stop talking about money in Washington as if it belongs to us, \nbut to understand that, no, it belongs to the people who work so hard \nto earn it, and let's let people have that money back to spend the way \nthey would like to, rather than the way people in Washington dictate. \nThese are the things that we came in to do.\n  We are very close. I hope we will be able to close this loop by the \nend of this week so that the people of America will be able to feel \nthat they have more of the money they earn in their pocketbooks, rather \nthan writing a check to the IRS in Washington.\n  Fifty years ago--just 50 years ago--Americans sent 2 cents of every \ndollar to Washington. Today, they send 25 cents of every dollar they \nearn to Washington, and that is just the Washington part. If you add \ntheir State and local taxes on top of that, most Americans pay 40 \npercent of what they earn; 40 cents of every dollar goes to the \nGovernment.\n  Now, Mr. President, I think that is wrong. I think that means \nGovernment is too big, and I think the time has come to do something \nabout it. I hope the President will agree with us, agree with the \nleadership that Congress is providing on this issue and has been \nproviding for the last 3 years, to try to correct the inequity in our \ntax laws.\n  The bill that we have passed in Congress, which we hope the President \nwill sign, will give tax relief to Americans who are paying income \ntaxes; if they have children, a $500 per child tax credit--not \ndeduction, but credit. That is something that they will get right off \nthe top--$500 per child. If you have two children, you would get $1,000 \nright off the top. That is going to cut most people's taxes in this \ncountry by a lot.\n  When I have asked my constituents in newspaper articles what they \nwould like to see changed, No. 1 is death tax reform. Most people don't \nthink that death taxes are American, because the American dream is \nthat, if you work hard, you should be able to pass what you have \naccumulated on to your children to give them a little bit better start. \nThat is the American dream. Why should people be taxed on money they \nhave accumulated and already paid taxes on? Why should they be taxed \nagain when they pass what they have worked so hard for to their \nchildren?\n  The worst thing is when their children have to sell part of the \nfamily farm, or all of it, just to pay inheritance taxes. That is not \nright, Mr. President, and we are trying to change that. In the \nagreement we are trying to get with the President, we would raise that \ninheritance tax credit to $1 million. We are going to try to keep \npeople from having to sell assets that are not readily salable, because \nwhen you tell people that family farm is worth $500,000 or $1 million, \nbut they can't earn enough to feed their family or to make life better \nfor their family, it is very hard to tell them that they have inherited \n$1 million when it is land that is really unproductive. So we are \ntrying to raise that, so that you will not have to sell equipment in a \nsmall business or a family farm that you could not possibly sell on the \nopen market for $1 million.\n\n  So we are going to try to make a dent in that death tax. We are going \nto try to make it easier for people to sell their homes, which is most \npeople's biggest asset, without having to pay the huge taxes that they \nnow do. We are going to try to cut the capital gains tax to 20 percent.\n  Today, 41 percent of American families own stock. They own stock in a \npension plan or a mutual fund. That is how they are investing for their \nretirement security. We want people to be able to have a capital gains \ntax cut so that if they need to sell a stock, they will not have to pay \na 28-percent tax rate on the capital gain. In fact, more than 83 \npercent of capital gains are reported by households with less than \n$100,000 in income; 56 percent of capital gains are reported by \nfamilies with less than $50,000 in income; nearly one-third of capital \ngains are reported by senior citizens. This will help the senior \ncitizens, particularly those that are having a hard time getting by. If \nthat senior citizen could sell their home or sell their stock without \nbeing penalized so heavily, it would give them a little bit better \nquality of life.\n  We are trying to give more help to people who want to save for their \nretirement futures with individual retirement accounts. A lot of people \nsay an individual retirement account is not really a retirement plan. \nBut I want to just give you one example, because I worked very hard for \nhomemakers to be able to set aside $2,000 a year for their retirement \nsecurity, and they can do that now. They are able to set aside $2,000 a \nyear, just as those who work outside the home. I want people to know \nthat if a couple starts, at the age of 25, setting aside $2,000 a year \nper person, by the time they are 65, they will have over $1 million in \ntheir retirement nest egg. That is a retirement plan. If a couple can \njust save $2,000 a year per person, starting at the age of 25, they can \nhave $1 million for their retirement security. That is another reason \nthat we want to do away with that death tax, because we want middle-\nincome people to be able to save enough for real retirement security \nand not have it taxed away when they die, so that their children will \nnot be able to have that little bit extra.\n  Our bill will even make IRA's better because it will make them \ndeductible in most instances, and it will make it easier for people to \nset aside this $2,000 a year. So if we can do that, if we can have a \nbetter savings rate in this country, if we can make people more secure \nin their retirement, if we can give a capital gains tax cut and a death \ntax cut and $500 per child tax credit, not only will we have kept our \npromise to the American people, but we will have provided, for middle-\nincome Americans who are working so hard to do better for their \nchildren, an opportunity in which they can say, yes, I can see the \ndifference, I can see this tax relief. That is what we are working for \nin this Congress.\n  I hope the President will not stop us from giving tax relief to hard-\nworking, middle-income Americans, because if he does, he will be making \na great mistake for the prosperity of our country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas for \noutlining the various important aspects of this proposed tax relief. At \nthis point, I turn to my colleague from Michigan and yield him--how \nmuch time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has just over 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I yield the remainder of that time to the \ndistinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I may not use all of that time. I thank \nthe Senator from Georgia. This is not the first time in which he has \ncome to the floor and led a special order to discuss these issues that \nare now before us, which we hope will be resolved this week. I think it \nshould be noted that, for the better part of the last 3 years, it has \nbeen with the leadership of the Senator from Georgia and the Senator \nfrom Texas who just spoke. Others have spoken today from the leadership \non the Republican side, which has been advancing the cause of tax \nrelief for the working families of our country.\n\n  As we come into the final stages of these negotiations, we are very \noptimistic that we will be able to realize\n\n[[Page S8180]]\n\nthe objective that many of us came here to achieve: to finally bring an \nend to higher taxes in Washington and begin, finally, to roll back some \nof those taxes on the American people.\n  In recent years, the percentage of the Nation's income, our gross \ndomestic product, consumed by Washington in the form of taxes has gone \nup and up and up. Indeed, today the percentage is virtually as high as \nit has ever been in the history of this country--as high as it was \nduring World War II, as high as during Vietnam, as high as during the \nDepression, and as high as it has been during any of the sort of crises \nthat you might expect to produce record levels of taxation. Today, in \nthe absence of such crises, we nonetheless have had a tax rate reach 21 \npercent above the Nation's income.\n  So, Mr. President, the Republican efforts to reduce the tax burden \nare timely, they are needed, and they are on target. As the Senator \nfrom Texas just indicated, whether it is the spousal IRA or the family \ntax credit of $500 per child or the growth incentives to create jobs \nand opportunities, such as reducing the capital gains tax rate, the \nRepublican tax plan that was passed in this Chamber by a 80-18 vote \naddresses the concerns of America's taxpayers in a targeted way that \nwill produce both a chance for working families to keep more of what \nthey earn and be able to do more for themselves, on the one hand, and \nan opportunity for those who create jobs and opportunities to create \nmore such jobs, higher paying jobs, and more opportunities as we move \ninto the next century.\n  So for all of those reasons, we are optimistic that our 3-year-long \neffort is about to pay dividends and that, by the end of this week, \nwith a little bit more effort, we can bring this tax cut to the \nAmerican people.\n  To all of those who have been in the leadership of this effort, I \noffer my thanks because, a few years ago, I don't think anybody in my \nconstituency in Michigan would have expected they would see their taxes \ngo down. This week, we have the best chance in decades--literally, 15 \nyears--to see that occur. So I want to thank and congratulate the \nleaders on our side who have kept the pressure on. I hope that, by the \nend of the week, we will achieve our goals, and I hope we will go one \nstep further and prevent any extraneous revenues generated by these tax \ncuts from being used for anything but more tax cuts or to reduce the \nnational deficit.\n  We just saw, as the budget negotiations began, that the revenues to \nthe Federal Government were exceeding that which had been projected by \nthe budgeteers in recent years. We were bringing in over $225 billion \nbeyond what had been projected just a few months ago. Well, I think the \nsame is going to happen as a result of the tax cuts included in this \nbudget resolution and in the tax bill we pass.\n  Mr. President, I think it is imperative that any additional revenues \nraised beyond that which we expect here in Washington ought to go back \nto the American people, either in the form of reducing the deficit or \nmore tax cuts for the working families. If we do that, then we can make \nthis tax bill extra special, Mr. President, by truly making it a long-\nterm tax reduction plan for the American people.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on our hour \nof control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All of the Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In that case, Mr. President, I yield the floor and \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY.

Under the previous order, the hour of 5 p.m. \nhaving come and gone, the Senate will now proceed to the consideration \nof S. 1048, which the clerk will please report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1048) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nlist of individuals be given full floor privileges during the \nconsideration of S. 1048: Wally Burnett, Joyce Rose, Reid Cavnar, \nGeorge McDonald, Kathy Casey, Peter Rogoff, Michael Brennan, Liz \nO'Donoghue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nlist also be given floor privileges during consideration of S. 1048: \nTom Young, Alan Brown, Carole Geagley, and Mitch Warren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I am pleased this evening to present the \nfiscal year 1998 Department of Transportation and related agencies \nappropriations bill. The subcommittee's allocation was $12.157 billion \nin nondefense discretionary budget authority, and $36.893 billion in \nnondefense discretionary outlays.\n  The bill I am presenting today, along with my colleague from New \nJersey, Senator Lautenberg, is within those allocations and is \nconsistent with our determination to achieve a balanced budget. This \nbill will also contribute to a safer and more efficient transportation \nsystem in this country and therefore contribute to economic growth and \na better quality of life for all Americans.\n  This bill provides $30.1 billion for investment in infrastructure \nthat the public uses, that is, highways, transit, airports, and \nrailroads. That represents an 8 percent increase over the \nadministration's request.\n  The bill includes a Federal-aid highway obligation limitation of \n$21.8 billion for investment in our Nation's highways. This is a record \nhigh level. And $1.63 billion above the President's amended budget \nrequest. The actual distribution of that obligation authority among the \nStates will depend on reauthorization of ISTEA, also known as the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991, which has \nprovided authorization of our Federal surface transportation programs \nfor the past 6 years and which, as the Presiding Officer knows, expires \nat the end of this fiscal year.\n  This increase of almost $3 billion over the obligation limitation in \nplace for this year will almost certainly mean more Federal highway \nspending for each of our States. I want to illustrate for Senators what \nthis increase might mean for them even though I must caution my \ncolleagues this evening that no one can predict now how highway funds \nwill be distributed among the States next year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this table comparing State-by-State \ndistribution of highway obligation authority in the current fiscal year \nto the distribution of the highway obligation authority in our bill for \nthe fiscal year 1998, assuming the same apportionments of contract \nauthority among the States as this year, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION--ACTUAL FY 1997 OBLIGATION LIMITATION &    \n                                     ESTIMATED FY 1998 OBLIGATION LIMITATION                                    \n                                            [In thousands of dollars]                                           \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                     Est.

be distributed.                       \n\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. If our limitation becomes law by the end of September, \nthe States will be apportioned an average of 18 percent more--18 \npercent more--highway obligation limitation for 1998 than they were \napportioned at the beginning of last fiscal year. That is some \nimprovement in the money.\n  In addition, we have included $300 million for Appalachian \nDevelopment Highway System investment consistent with existing \nauthorization. The Federal Government made a commitment to improve \nthese highways which run through economically undeveloped areas in 13 \nof our States, and our bill helps to keep that commitment. This \ninvestment will pay off not only in economic development in areas that \nare in much need of it but also in lives saved since these highways in \nmountainous areas are often high-accident locations in our country.\n  As most Senators know, Federal investment in airport development has \nbeen declining in recent years, and the administration proposed a \nfurther cut for the coming year. Our committee could not agree with \nthat proposal at a time when air travel is increasingly in demand and \nair safety is uppermost in the minds of travelers. We have included \n$1.7 billion for the airport improvement program.\n  Transit formula and discretionary accounts, including funding for \nWashington Metrorail construction, all of which are for capital \ninvestment in our bill, are funded at $4.56 billion, $311 million above \nfiscal year 1997.\n  The bill provides $273 million for continued improvements on Amtrak's \nNortheast corridor between Washington and Boston. For other Amtrak \ncapital expenditures, the bill makes a contingent appropriation, Mr. \nPresident, of $641 million to be funded from the intercity passenger \nrail fund, which would be established by S. 949, the Revenue \nReconciliation Act of 1997. The Amtrak capital appropriation in this \nbill will be triggered when a final reconciliation bill including the \npassenger rail fund is enacted into law and the transportation \nsubcommittee's 602(b) allocation is adjusted upward to cover the \nadditional appropriation.\n  Safety was a top priority as we developed this bill. It provides \n$5.376 billion for the FAA operations account, including funds for an \nincrease of 235 aviation safety inspectors and 500 additional air \ntraffic controllers. Our appropriations for FAA operations is 99.8 \npercent of the administration's request. The committee was able to fund \nthe FAA's operation account at this level without imposing $300 million \nin new user fee taxes proposed in the administration's request.\n  The toll of deaths and injuries on our highways, we believe, is too \nhigh and our bill addresses that. It funds the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration Program at $333.5 million. That is a $33 million \nincrease above the fiscal year 1997 enacted levels and slightly higher \nthan the administration's request.\n  This bill provides $50.7 million for the National Transportation \nSafety Board, 8 percent above the President's request, to support the \nNTSB's investigatory mission and to expedite the development of safety \nrecommendations.\n  The Coast Guard, as you know, Mr. President, also plays a critical \nrole in the safe operation of our Nation's waterways. Its operations \nfunding of $2.73 billion as provided in this bill is an increase of \n$112 million above fiscal year 1997. This level is consistent with the \nadministration's request for operating expenses and will continue \ncongressional support for a streamlined Coast Guard.\n  Coast Guard funding includes an increase of $53 million for antidrug \nactivities, which are coordinated by the Office of National Drug \nControl Policy. The committee has provided the Commandant of the Coast \nGuard the discretion and the flexibility to manage this funding but has \nencouraged the Department to look at these activities as areas that \nwould benefit from the development of performance measures.\n  The bill funds the Coast Guard's capital program at $412 million, an \nincrease of $33 million above the administration's request. This \nprovides the Coast Guard with the equipment, ships, and aircraft to \ncomplete their multiple missions. The Coast Guard's capital needs, \nespecially for replacing aging vessels and facilities, will increase \ndramatically in the years ahead and the committee's recommendation \nfocuses on those acquisition programs that can be accelerated now to \nprovide room in the outyears to replace these assets.\n  I note for the benefit of the Senators from States that depend on the \nSaint Lawrence Seaway, that this bill assumes enactment of the \nadministration's proposal to convert the Saint Lawrence Seaway \nDevelopment Corporation to a performance-based organization and to move \nits financing from appropriated funds to an automatic annual \nperformance-based payment. No funds are included in this bill for the \nSeaway Corporation, but if the legislative proposal fails, we will \nensure in conference that the Seaway Corporation is funded.\n  The Senate has taken the lead in past years in promoting management \nreform at the Department of Transportation, especially at FAA. This \nbill continues that direction by refraining from micromanagement of the \nDepartment, even as we look for improved results. The committee report, \nfor example, offers guidance to the Secretary of Transportation on \nimproving on DOT's draft strategic plan which is required by the \nGovernment Performance and Results Act. It also avoids artificial caps \non the efforts of the Department to act in a more businesslike way, but \nit directs the DOT Inspector General to study whether in fact DOT's new \nentrepreneurial service organization is provided cost-competitive, \nhigh-quality service.\n  But, even as we addressed infrastructure investment and safety in \nthis bill, we have been very mindful of the priorities that Senators \nhad for this bill. We receive more than 900 requests for projects and \nprovisions to be included in this bill. We have reviewed those requests \nvery closely and accommodated them to the extent that we could. In some \ncases, available funding was not sufficient to fund all requests, and \nwe had to make some tough choices. But we have tried to be as fair as \npossible to all Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  Many Senators wanted funds for highway projects of special interest \nto them in their States. This year, ISTEA reauthorization is providing \na vehicle for special project funding, especially in the House where \nthere is very active consideration of such funding. But I want to \nassure my colleagues this evening that I believe the Congress has at \nleast as legitimate a role in designating funding for specific highway \nprojects as it does in designating new transit projects that will be \nfunded. I intend to review the situation after enactment of ISTEA \nreauthorization legislation and to work with my Senate and my House \ncolleagues in the year\n\n[[Page S8182]]\n\nahead to ensure that we have an opportunity to designate funding for \nhighway projects of special interest to our States and to our \ncommunities.\n  I am proud, overall, of what we have been able to accomplish in this \nbill. It will benefit all Americans as it helps to improve \ntransportation services in this country so that the economy and \npersonal mobility are better served. I commend my colleague, the \nranking Democrat on the committee and the former chairman on this \ncommittee, Senator Lautenberg, for all the hard work he has put in in \nthis effort.\n  At this time I yield to the ranking member, Senator Lautenberg.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I want to say thank you to my \ncolleague from Alabama, the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation of Appropriations, for the manner in which we have been \nable to work together to resolve problems on this bill. I support the \nleadership he has provided in getting us to this point where we are \nable to present the Transportation and related agencies appropriations \nbill for fiscal 1998. This bill was reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee just this past Tuesday, a week ago.\n  I don't believe that we give sufficient importance to our investment \nin transportation infrastructure in this country. There is hardly a \nState, that I am aware of as I talk to my colleagues, that is satisfied \nwith its ability to deal with congestion, its ability to move people \nand goods from place-to-place efficiently. But I will say this. In view \nof the sparseness of budget dollars, this bill went quite well. It is \nthe culmination of a very long and arduous effort to reestablish \ntransportation as a priority in our Federal budget.\n\n  As the senior Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, I, along with \nSenator Domenici and several other members, spent a great deal of time \nand energy trying to ensure that transportation would be treated as we \nlike to see it, as a priority under the budget resolution. That is \nwhere it all starts, the allocation of funds in the budget resolution \nto the various functions of Government.\n  Transportation was not one of the priorities that the administration \nbrought to the table. It was a congressional priority. The Congress \ndecided we needed more money for transportation, and we have succeeded \nin getting it. We are interested in a balanced transportation network. \nI think the bill now before the Senate does exactly that.\n  Our efforts on the budget resolution are well reflected in the \nsizable funding increases contained in this bill for critical \ntransportation infrastructure programs. I want to thank the chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Senator Stevens for the funding \nallocation he granted to this subcommittee. He is serving as chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee for the first time this year and he is \ndoing an excellent job. He and Senator Byrd, the ranking Democrat, \nworked hard to grant the Transportation Subcommittee an allocation that \nwas consistent with the priority that was placed on transportation when \nwe did the budget resolution.\n  Mr. President, this bill has gone through a steady series of \nimprovements as it moved through the process. In the view of this \nSenator, the bill that was presented to the subcommittee on July 15 \njust did not go far enough in reflecting the needs of all \ntransportation modes as well as the needs of all regions of the \ncountry. The bill had very sizable increases for important national \nprograms such as the Federal-aid highway obligation ceiling and airport \ngrants. However, the bill also provided a freeze on formula funding for \nmass transit and included insufficient funding for Amtrak's operating \nsubsidy. This funding shortfall in Amtrak could have rapidly brought \nabout the bankruptcy of the railroad very early in the coming fiscal \nyear.\n  There are very few countries that have, frankly, as insufficient \nintercity rail service as does the United States. When you look at the \nmajor developed countries of the world other than the United States, \nall of them, without a doubt, whether it be Japan's bullet train or the \nFrench TGV or trains in Germany or other parts of the world that zip \nalong at 180 miles an hour--all of them depend on sizeable operating \nsubsidies from the government.\n  I am not sure, nor is the chairman, whether everybody would want to \nget to Washington in an hour and a half from New York, but we at least \nought to make it possible. We could certainly do that and save time \nwaiting at airports. But we must continue to invest, in Amtrak to make \nthat happen. They have new equipment ordered that will accelerate the \npace at which passengers can go from Boston to Washington.\n  But we needed the cooperation of the chairman, Senator Shelby, and we \nwere able to work together to boost Amtrak's operating subsidy by $154 \nmillion above the level originally presented to the subcommittee. The \nfunding level now stands at the level that was requested by the \nadministration. We were also able to provide an additional $200 million \nin transit formula grants at full committee markup so the percentage \nboost for transit formula assistance would begin to approach the \npercentage increases provide for highway formula assistance and for \nairport grants.\n  What we are saying with these important adjustments is that we salute \na balanced transportation system in this country that includes \nhighways, includes aviation, includes rail, includes all of the modes \nof mass transit so we can have the kind of efficiency in our \ntransportation system that we need.\n  These adjustments in the bill were made through careful negotiations \nbetween Chairman Shelby and myself. They were made without the need for \na rollcall vote in either the subcommittee or the full committee. That \nfact is indicative of the cooperation and fair-minded spirit that the \nchairman has brought to this bill.\n\n  With these changes now included in the transportation funding bill, I \nam pleased to recommend this bill to the entire Senate. It is a \nbalanced bill that provides desperately needed funds to our States and \ncommunities to address the crushing problem of congestion in our cities \nand towns. As a matter of fact, in our region they are about to \ncelebrate the initiation of another technological improvement in the \ncollection of tolls. Some people do not support the rapid collection of \ntolls. They want to hang onto their money as long as possible. But the \nchoice, Mr. President, is to sit in traffic for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, \nor a half hour at the toll gate. I drove, on Sunday, through one of \nwhat they call the easy pass tollgates. I want to tell you, it was a \npleasure. They had a little thing on the windshield and when we got to \nthe gate, up went the gate, down went my $4. But the fact of the matter \nis, it does improve the way we move ahead.\n  That is the kind of improvements that we need. We have to continue to \npresent technological innovation to improve the way our highways, our \nairports, and our railroads function.\n  So, I think it is fair to say that this funding will accelerate our \nefforts to address improvements in our transportation infrastructure, \nwhich is deteriorating faster, frankly, than we can replace it. The \nbill will also provide critically needed funding, as you heard from the \nchairman, to maintain safety in all our transportation modes. I want to \npoint out, there is still one significant hole in this bill, and that \nis the funding for Amtrak's capital account. Those are the investments \nnecessary to build the infrastructure, buy the equipment, update the \nrail signals, to upgrade the trackage that we have down there. We need \nmore investment in the capital account so that we can operate more \nefficiently.\n  The bill does not include any funding for Amtrak's capital needs \nbecause we believe the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, \nis currently seeking to provide for these needs through the \nreconciliation process. I know the chairman and I have a commitment \nthat this is going to be taking place. I would only point out Senator \nShelby's decision not to put any more capital funding in this bill was \nbecause he, as I said earlier, believed that Senator Roth was going to \ntake care of it in the finance package. I hope that that ultimately \ngets to be the case, because that would provide Amtrak with a stable \nsource of funding to address their capital needs over a period of \nseveral years, get that railroad up to the level that it ought to be in \na country as great as ours.\n  Last, Mr. President, I commend my colleague and friend, Senator \nShelby,\n\n[[Page S8183]]\n\nfor his excellent work in his first year as chairman of this \nsubcommittee. He quickly gained a great deal of knowledge about how the \ncommittee functions.\n  I offered to take over the chairmanship temporarily to show him how, \nbut he said, no, he would take care of it. We worked together, with our \nfine staff--the names of whom Senator Shelby mentioned--to get it done.\n  When it comes to the distribution of funds for the Member-specific \nprojects, those projects they put forward as being critical in nature \nto their States, Senator Shelby has been fairminded in his allocation \nof funds. He sought to accommodate Members' priorities to the best of \nthe subcommittee's ability, and he has continued to operate that way.\n  I must say, I tip my hat to the fact that he is determined and has \nshown in this first chairmanship year that he can deal in a bipartisan \nfashion, and everybody got along. We occasionally had to face up to \nsome tough discussions, but we always did it in an amicable way and we \ngot a good bill.\n  That has been the tradition with the Transportation Subcommittee, and \nthat is do it in a bipartisan way. The American people don't want to \nsee us bickering. They want to see us getting things done. They want to \nsee us function as we are supposed to function. Disagree, if you will, \nmake the points you have to make, but get the job done. I think it is \nfair to say that the Appropriations Committee, on which both of us have \nsat for some time, is maintaining almost a revolutionary pace in terms \nof getting the job done this year, and I am proud to be part of it and \nproud to work with my colleagues on the committee.\n  With that, Mr. President, I hope we can move this bill with \nexpediency. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1022\n\n               (Purpose: To direct a transit fare study)\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I send to the desk an amendment offered on \nbehalf of the Senators from New York, Senator D'Amato and Senator \nMoynihan, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for Mr. D'Amato, for \n     himself and Mr. Moynihan, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1022.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Out of the funds made available under this Act to the New \n     York Metropolitan Transportation Authority through the \n     Federal Transit Administration, the New York Metropolitan \n     Transportation Authority shall perform a study to ascertain \n     the costs and benefits of instituting an integrated fare \n     system for commuters who use both the Metro North Railroad or \n     the Long Island Rail Road and New York City subway or bus \n     systems. This study shall examine creative proposals for \n     improving the flow of passengers between city transit systems \n     and commuter rail systems, including free transfers, \n     discounts, congestion-pricing, and other positive \n     inducements. The study also must include estimates of \n     potential benefits to the environment, to energy conservation \n     and to revenue enhancement through increased commuter rail \n     and transit ridership, as well as other tangible benefits. A \n     report describing the results of this study shall be \n     submitted to the Senate Appropriations Committee within 45 \n     days of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I see the distinguished manager of the \nlegislation, Senator Shelby, here. And I would like to take this \nopportunity to engage in a brief colloquy with the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I will be glad to comply.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I want to start off, Mr. President, by saying to Senator \nShelby that I am very pleased that this legislation has come to the \nSenate floor. I would like to take this opportunity to briefly discuss \na project of great importance to my home State of Rhode Island.\n  Included within S. 1048 is $10 million for the Rhode Island freight \nrail development project commonly known as the Third Track. I would \nlike to express my gratitude to the subcommittee chairman, the manager \nof the bill, Senator Shelby, who has agreed to include this funding in \nhis subcommittee's bill. And I see the distinguished ranking member of \nthe committee, and I would also like to express my thanks to him \nlikewise for support of this legislation.\n  Earlier this year Senator Shelby was kind enough to take time to \nlisten to Rhode Island's Governor, Lincoln Almond, Senator Reed from \nRhode Island, and myself as we outlined the benefits of the Third Track \nproject. And, Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nsay that Senator Reed has been very interested and very supportive of \nall efforts in connection with this Third Track.\n  The Third Track is a $120 million project that will upgrade 22 miles \nof rail line between Quonset Point-Davisville, and Central Falls, RI. \nIt is needed to accommodate two impending changes that are occurring on \nthis rail line: First, the increased passenger rail traffic and more \npassenger trains that will result from Amtrak's New Haven-Boston \nelectrification project--that is the first problem that has arisen--\nand, secondly, the larger freight cars that will operate along the \nline.\n  The Third Track represents a tremendous potential for economic growth \nand job creation in Rhode Island. It plays a vital role in the State's \ndevelopment of the Quonset-Davisville Industrial Park and making that \ninto a premier commerce park and international cargo point.\n  Mr. President, let us take a brief look at recent developments \nassociated with this Third Track. In just the past year, some 19 new \ntenants and four others have expanded their operations and have \ninvested over $16 million and brought 500 new jobs to the Quonset-\nDavisville Industrial Park.\n  It is conservatively estimated that development of the port and of \nthe park will yield in excess of 15,000 good-paying jobs to Rhode \nIsland. The Third Track is a key element in what is not surprisingly \none of our State's most promising economic development projects.\n  To date, Congress has appropriated $13 million for the Third Track. \nAnother $42 million is budgeted over the next 4 years, including the \n$10 million within the bill before the Senate today.\n  Rhode Island's voters, on their part, in order to fulfill the State's \n50-50 funding matching requirement, passed a bond referendum last \nNovember allocating $50 million to this Third Track. I might say, Mr. \nPresident, a $50 million bond issue is a substantial one for our small \nState of little fewer than a million people.\n  The Third Track represents great hope for economic growth in Rhode \nIsland at a time when our manufacturing job base continues to erode.\n  I again thank Chairman Shelby for his support and also thank the \ndistinguished ranking member of the committee, Senator Lautenberg, for \nhis support, and urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. SHELBY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I would like to respond to that.\n  First of all, I want to acknowledge the work of the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Rhode Island, Senator Chafee, in bringing to my \nattention--and also to Senator Lautenberg's attention--the needs of his \nState in dealing with this economic development project.\n  I did have the opportunity, at Senator Chafee's request, to meet with \nSenator Chafee, the Governor, and the junior Senator, Senator Reed, \nregarding this project. I also met with Senator Chafee on numerous \noccasions as we talked about, ``Would funding for this project be \nincluded in the bill?'' I assured him that it would, and for a good \nreason.\n  This is a sound project for the people of Rhode Island. We \ninvestigated it on\n\n[[Page S8184]]\n\nthe committee and found that it makes a lot of sense. And as Senator \nChafee has pointed out, the people of Rhode Island are also putting up \na lot of money through a bond issue of $50 million. And $50 million is \na lot of money for a State of around 1 million. And I want to \nacknowledge his work in this regard and say that we are pleased that we \nhave been successful in identifying resources for this project. And I \nbelieve it is going to be very, very positive for the State of Rhode \nIsland.\n  I look forward to working with the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland in the future.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased also, Mr. President, to support this \nproject. And I have reviewed the plans several times over these last \ncouple of years. It increases the ability of that port to function and \nto expedite the movement of freight from the port into the main line \nsystem. Otherwise, there are some problems with heights and of the cars \nthat can pass underneath the bridges, so it needs some work. And we \nhope that Rhode Island will get this completed.\n  We all know that essential to our economic development is the \ncapacity to get people and goods to and from the business opportunities \nthat either exist or want to be developed. So this one sounds like a \npretty good idea.\n  Senator Shelby said it. He said we have heard from Senator Chafee \nperiodically, regularly. We have heard from the Governor of the State \nwho, if I remember, is about 6' 4'', something of that nature. They \nmade sure they brought him in. We got the message, Mr. President. \nSenator Reed was also involved. So it is a unified delegation. And they \nare working hard to get it done. And we want to help wherever we can.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Again, I do want to thank the two distinguished managers \nof the legislation, the bill. The chairman of the subcommittee, Senator \nShelby, has been very, very helpful, and as I indicated, very \nresponsive. And we are very appreciative. And likewise, Senator \nLautenberg, as mentioned, we have--I have to be careful in my use of \nwords. I was going to say ``pestered'' him, but we have implored him or \nspent a good deal of time pointing out the virtues of this project. And \nthe way they both have responded makes us very grateful.\n  And I say to Senator Shelby, I want to thank you for your kind \nremarks and the work you have done on this, and Senator Lautenberg \nlikewise.\n  So, if nobody else seeks the floor----\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, if I could add a few more comments to the \nremarks made by the distinguished Senator from Rhode Island. The \nSenator from Rhode Island is a distinguished veteran of the Senate. He \nhas been here and has made his presence felt. He chairs a very \nimportant committee in the Senate--the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. I have had the privilege and the pleasure of working with \nhim on a number of issues both on and off this committee. I can tell \nyou, he has been the catalyst for the money for Rhode Island here in \nthe Senate. Let us set the record straight. Thank you.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we can't let this opportunity go \nwithout saying that we know that the Senator from Rhode Island is very \nmuch engaged in discussions of ISTEA. And New Jersey likes ISTEA.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Absolutely.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We like it in the summer and we like it in the \nwinter. We want to help the State of Rhode Island, the important State \nthat it is despite its tiny size. My State is only a wisp larger, and \nwe have about eight times the number of people. But we know that the \ngood Senator from Rhode Island will remember Alabama and New Jersey and \nhow we all work together to get things done. Thank you.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is getting more and more expensive. \nSo if nobody else seeks the floor at this time, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nTransportation appropriations bill and to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations subcommittee, Senator \nShelby, about the ability of the State of Maine to use funding from \nthis legislation to conduct a National Environmental Protection Act \nstudy for improving the travel corridor from Houlton to Fort Kent, ME.\n  Under S. 1048, as approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee, \nthe State of Maine is expected to receive a much-needed increase of \nalmost $17 million for vital highway programs. This will bring the \ntotal for the next fiscal year to approximately $105 million. This \nadditional funding--the $17 million--will enable the Maine Department \nof Transportation to fund a number of high-priority transportation \nprojects, including the NEPA study, which will help my State \ntremendously.\n  I want to commend both the chairman and the ranking minority member \nof the subcommittee for their hard work and leadership in ensuring that \nsignificant transportation funding increases are available, at a time \nwhen setting priorities for scarce tax dollars has never been more \nchallenging. For large rural States like my home State of Maine, the \nfunding in this legislation provides the money necessary to build, \nrepair, maintain, and improve our roads, which are absolutely essential \nto expanding our economy and to providing our citizens with better job \nopportunities into the 21st century.\n  In fact, in Maine, studies have shown that approximately 80 percent \nof all economic development has occurred within 10 miles of our \ninterstate highway. Consequently, it is not surprising that economic \nactivity in central and northern Aroostook County, where I am from, \nwhich is not served by the Interstate Highway System, has lagged far \nbehind those areas of the State with access to the four-lane \ninterstate.\n  Earlier this year, the State of Maine completed an initial \nfeasibility study that evaluated several different options for \nimproving the travel corridor between Houlton and Fort Kent, a distance \nof roughly 125 miles. The initial study was funded by Congress with an \nappropriation of $800,000 about 3 years ago.\n  Now, the State is prepared to take the next step in this process, \nwhich is to conduct a NEPA study on the various options. This study \nwill, among other things, analyze the traffic demand for preliminary \ndesign engineering, assess the noise and air quality impact, develop \nand review alternatives within the corridor, update the construction \ncost analysis, and prepare an environmental impact statement.\n  The need for this funding, Mr. President, is crystal clear. Upgrading \nthe transportation infrastructure in Aroostook County, the largest \ncounty in my State, is essential to strengthening its economy. For \nexample, in order to compete effectively, Aroostook County potato \nfarmers and lumber industries need to improve their ability to \ntransport goods efficiently from northern Maine to their markets.\n  Upgrading the transportation system will also spur new economic \ndevelopment and business investment. The tourism industry, particularly \nsnowmobiling, has absolutely exploded in recent years. But if it is to \ncontinue to grow, this promising industry needs an improved road system \nto bring more snowmobilers to Aroostook County.\n  Similarly, the people of Aroostook County are moving forward in their \nefforts to redevelop the site of the former Loring Air Force Base in \nLimestone, ME. An enhanced highway system is absolutely vital to their \nability to attract new economic investment that can best utilize the \nbase's outstanding facilities and help to replace the thousands of jobs \nthat were lost when the base closed.\n  Proceeding with this additional study at this time will help us \ndetermine how best to improve the travel corridor, and it ultimately \nwill make it easier for northern Maine to compete for new business \ninvestments, to find\n\n[[Page S8185]]\n\nnew market opportunities for agricultural, manufactured, and timber-\nrelated products, and to produce increased tourism opportunities, as \nwell.\n\n  I just want to take this opportunity to confirm with the chairman of \nthe subcommittee my understanding that the State of Maine, which has \nincluded this project as part of its 20-year statewide transportation \nplan, can use a portion of the roughly $17 million in higher Federal \nhighway funding from this legislation to pursue and conduct the NEPA \nstudy.\n  Mr. President, at this point, I will yield the floor to the chairman \nof the subcommittee so that he may respond to my inquiry.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, Senator Collins has been in touch with our \nsubcommittee throughout the year as we prepared the 1998 Transportation \nappropriation bill. She has talked to us more than once. In particular, \nthe Senator from Maine has made clear that securing available sources \nof funding for the NEPA study is a very high priority for her and the \npeople in the northern part of her State of Maine. The Senator has also \nbeen a strong supporter of higher funding in fiscal year 1998 to meet \nother necessary transportation priorities on behalf of the State of \nMaine as well.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to confirm the inquiry \nof the Senator and to reiterate that the State of Maine is clearly able \nto use highway funds provided in this act, subject to ISTEA \nreauthorization, to conduct a NEPA study. I believe that the Senator \nfrom Maine has made a compelling case for moving ahead with this study \nand, in fact, I believe that the NEPA study would be a good use of a \nportion of Maine's highway funding.\n  Mr. President, Senator Collins has made it very clear to the \nsubcommittee how important improving the travel corridor in northern \nMaine is, and I share her view that this NEPA study would be a very \nhigh priority for funding in 1998.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his assurances \nand express my gratitude and thanks to him and his staff for their \nassistance in this matter.\n  I also want to again applaud his efforts to ensure that we have \nadequate funding for our transportation infrastructure, which is so \nvital to this Nation's prosperity.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nbe the only first-degree amendments in order to S. 1048 other than the \npending amendments, and that they be subject to relevant second-degree \namendments. I send the list to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  The list is as follows:\n\n       Bob Smith: Section 127 of title 23.\n       Hollings: Relevant.\n       Hollings: Relevant.\n       Graham: Transit.\n       Daschle/Johnson: Relevant.\n\n\n                            managers package\n\n       Shelby amendment.\n       Lautenberg amendment.\n       Durbin: Relevant.\n       Graham/Levin Sense-of-Senate: Relevant.\n       Byrd: Relevant.\n       Stevens: Relevant.\n       Kerrey: Relevant.\n       Boxer: Railroad.\n       Chafee: Relevant.\n       Chafee: Relevant.\n       Warner: Relevant.\n       Warner: Relevant.\n       Specter: Relevant.\n       Enzi: Relevant.\n       Enzi: Relevant.\n       Mack: ISTEA reauthorization.\n       Abraham: Relevant.\n       D'Amato: Relevant.\n       Frist: Relevant.\n       Gorton: Relevant.\n       Bond: Relevant.\n       Brownback: Relevant.\n       Moseley-Braun: Motorcycle helmets.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I further ask that when all of the above \namendments have been disposed of, S. 1048 be advanced to third reading \nand the Senate immediately turn to H.R. 2169, the House companion bill, \nall after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1048, as \namended, be inserted, H.R. 2169 be immediately advanced to third \nreading, and the Senate proceed to vote on passage, all without further \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Finally, I ask that following the vote on passage of the \ntransportation appropriations bill, the Senate insist on its \namendments, request a conference with the House, the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate, and S. 1048 \nbe placed back on the calendar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate resume consideration of S. 1048 immediately following the \nstacked votes at 2:15 on Tuesday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. For the information of all Senators, the managers intend \nto remain in session until all amendments are offered and debated with \nrespect to the Transportation bill. Therefore, Members should expect \nfinal disposition of the Transportations appropriations bill on \nWednesday morning.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I may say to my colleague, the \nchairman, I will just take the floor for a couple minutes and say that \nwe have now been here 2 hours. It was the understanding when we left \nlast week that the Transportation Subcommittee's bill would be up this \nevening with an opportunity to offer amendments and consider the \nbusiness of the bill. We have had hardly a response.\n  I do not have to lecture my colleagues, certainly, but this is the \nlast week before we adjourn for August and get home to do the things we \nhave to do with our constituents. I hope we can help move the process \nalong. We ask our colleagues to join in to get the business of the \npeople done, to get those amendments up here as quickly as we can \ntomorrow.\n  We intend--and I discussed this with Senator Shelby--to be here long \nenough to get the work done, but we cannot do it unless people offer \ntheir amendments and take advantage of the opportunity to make those \nsuggestions that they think improve the bill.\n  So I send out this plea, Mr. President, probably to those who are \njust turning off their TV sets around the Capitol and say that we hope \nyou will remember the bill will be open again tomorrow after the votes \nwhich are now listed and that we can get to work on passing the \nappropriations bill for 1998, one that we can send over to the House \nand get a conference on. We are moving along at a very good pace with \nour appropriations bills for next year, and we ought to continue to \nhelp that pace, get done, and let the people across the country know \nthe appropriate investments are going to be made in the things that are \nincluded in this bill.\n  With that simple admonition, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8180-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.

As such, the United States seeks to discourage \nall other governments and international agencies from assisting the \nefforts of the Cuban Government to maintain or complete the Juragua \nPlant or to advance nuclear research at the Pedro Pi facility.\n  United States funds would be made available to the IAEA to \ndiscontinue, dismantle, or conduct safety inspections of nuclear \nfacilities and related materials in Cuba, or to inspect or undertake \nsimilar activities designed to prevent the development of nuclear \nweapons by Cuba.\n  The withholding of funds from the IAEA would be obviated if: Cuba \nratifies the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons or the \nTreaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America \n(Tlatelolco); negotiates full-scope safeguards of the IAEA within two \nyears of ratifying; and adopts internationally accepted nuclear safety \nstandards.\n  The legislation also requests reports on the activities of the IAEA \nin Cuba.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1074. A bill to amend title IV of the Social Security Act to \nreform child support enforcement procedures; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  S. 1075. A bill to provide for demonstration projects to establish or \nimprove a system of assured minimum child support payments; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n                       CHILD SUPPORT LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I'm introducing two pieces of \nlegislation intended to address the ongoing and utter failure of our \nNation's child support efforts.\n  Last week, the General Accounting Office released a long-awaited \nreport on efforts to collect child support throughout the country. It \npaints a picture of a broken child support system:\n  One where four out of five parents legally required to pay child \nsupport simply ignore court orders to do so; one where nearly three in \nfour custodial parents--and their children--who receive no child \nsupport live in poverty (as of 1991); and one where a staggering $34 \nbillion in child support payments remain uncollected.\n  The current system of child support is not just a failure by the \nStates to collect money. It's a nationwide failure to care for \nAmerica's children.\n  Imagine what parents could do for their kids with these billions in \nunpaid child support obligations. Currently, Congress and the President \nare engaged in a heated debate over how to provide health insurance to \nthe 10\\1/2\\ million kids who don't currently have it. We might not be \nhaving that debate if the child support system was working.\n  Imagine how much better parents could prepare their children to get \nthe right start in life. With each passing day, we are learning about \nhow incredibly important the first years, months, even days of life are \nto a child's future well-being. Most importantly, they need what money \ncan't buy: Love, affection, and attention--preferably by two parents \nrather than one. But they also need wholesome food, a clean and safe \nneighborhood, child care that nurtures rather than warehouses, and \nearly learning that stretches young minds. Yet, nearly two in three--64 \npercent--of children under the age of 6 who live only with their \nmothers live in poverty.\n  For two decades, the Federal Government has tried to help States \ncrack down on deadbeat parents. For two decades they have, by and \nlarge, failed to get the job done. It's time now to try a different \napproach.\n\n  In 1975, we established the child support enforcement program, which \npaid the majority of the administrative and operating costs incurred by \nStates in enforcing child support rules.\n  In 1980, we passed legislation to help States pay to computerize \nchild support orders.\n  In 1988, we passed a law requiring States to establish computer \nregistries, and committed $2.6 billion to the effort.\n  We set a deadline of 1995 for implementation and certification of \nthose registries. But only a handful of States met that deadline.\n  So in 1995, we extended the deadline 2 years, to October 1, 1997. \nYet, at this moment, only 15 States have met the requirements of \ncertification. And GAO predicts many will not meet them by October 1--a \nresult of mismanagement, interagency squabbles, and a failure to \naccurately assess the cost and complexity of computerizing child \nsupport enforcement.\n  Note that Connecticut at the moment is conditionally certified. \nThat's a nice way of saying that it's close to meeting the requirements \nof certification, but not there yet. And while there has been some \nimprovement in enforcement efforts, overall our State's performance is \nweak by any standard. Some $663 million in child support obligations \nremain unpaid and uncollected. The child support payment rate in our \nState--the percentage of payments that are on time and in full--is only \n16 percent. That's below the national average.\n  My legislation will do several things.\n  First, and most importantly, it will federalize the child support \nsystem. It will make paying child support as much of an obligation as \npaying taxes. Instead of 50 or more entities struggling to create a \ncoherent system of collection, we'll have one collector: the IRS. \nPeople may not like the IRS--but that's partly because it gets the job \ndone. This bill creates a new child support enforcement division within \nthe IRS, and allows the IRS to use its normal tax collection methods to \ncollect child support. My legislation would also allow the use of \nFederal courts to enforce child support orders--which will immensely \nhelp track deadbeat parents across State lines. And it preserves the \nrole of States in determining paternity and establishing child support \norders in the first place.\n  Second, this legislation tries a new approach to help States do a \nbetter job in child support enforcement. It's an approach that a number \nof States have tried with considerable success. It's called child \nsupport assurance. The bill I introduce today would provide \ndemonstration grants to three, four, or five States. Those States would \nin turn guarantee child support payments each month to children and \ncustodial parents. When this approach was tried in New York, a number \nof positive developments occurred. First, children got the support they \nneeded. Second, welfare payments dropped. Third, New York could devote \nmore resources to enforcing child support orders because it had to \nworry less about caring for parents and kids who weren't receiving \nchild support payments. Overall, New York saved $10 for every $1 it \ninvested in this program.\n  Last week's GAO report demonstrates that it's time for our Nation to \ntake a new approach in efforts to enforce child support obligations. \nThis legislation can work. And now is the time to try it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that these bills be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1074\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) an increasing number of children are raised in families \n     with only one parent present, usually the mother, and these \n     families are 5 times as likely to be poor as 2-parent \n     families;\n       (2) the failure of noncustodial parents to pay their fair \n     share of child support is a major contributor to poverty \n     among single-parent families;\n       (3) in 1990, there was a $33,700,000,000 gap between the \n     amount of child support that was received and the amount that \n     could have been collected;\n       (4) in 1991, the aggregate child support income deficit was \n     $5,800,000,000;\n       (5) as of spring 1992, only 54 percent, or 6,200,000, of \n     custodial parents received awards of child support, and of \n     the 6,200,000 custodial parents awarded child support, \n     5,300,000 were supposed to receive child support payments in \n     1991;\n       (6) of the custodial parents described in paragraph (5), \n     approximately \\1/2\\ of the parents due child support received \n     full payment and the remaining \\1/2\\ were divided equally \n     between those receiving partial payment (24 percent) and \n     those receiving nothing (25 percent);\n       (7) as a result of the situation described in paragraphs \n     (5) and (6), increasing numbers of families are turning to \n     the child support program established under part D of title \n     IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 651 et seq.) for \n     assistance, accounting for an over 40 percent increase in the \n     caseload under that program during the 1991 to 1995 period;\n       (8) during the 1991 to 1995 period, the percentage of cases \n     under the title IV-D child support program in which a \n     collection was made declined from 19.3 percent to 18.9 \n     percent;\n       (9) the Internal Revenue Service has improved its \n     performance in making collections in cases referred to it by \n     the title IV-D child support program, moving from \n     successfully intercepting Federal income tax refunds in \n     992,000 cases in 1992 to successfully intercepting Federal \n     income tax refunds in 1,200,000 cases in 1996;\n       (10) in cases under the title IV-D child support program in \n     which a collection is made, approximately \\1/3\\ of such cases \n     are cases where some or all of the collection is a result of \n     a Federal tax refund intercept;\n       (11) in 1995, the average amount collected for families in \n     which the Internal Revenue Service made a collection through \n     the Federal tax refund intercept method was $827 for families \n     receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children and $847 \n     for other families; and\n       (12) State-by-State child support guidelines have resulted \n     in orders that vary significantly from State to State, \n     resulting in low awards and inequities for children.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to--\n       (1) provide for the review of various State child support \n     guidelines to determine how custodial parents and children \n     are served by such guidelines;\n       (2) increase the economic security of children, improve the \n     enforcement of child support awards through a more \n     centralized, efficient system; and\n       (3) improve the enforcement of child support orders by \n     placing responsibility for enforcement in the Internal \n     Revenue Service.\n         TITLE I--NATIONAL CHILD SUPPORT GUIDELINES COMMISSION\n\n     SEC. 101.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Increasingly, children are raised in families with only \n     1 parent present, usually the mother, and these single-parent \n     families are 5 times as likely to be poor as 2-parent \n     families.\n       (2) The failure of noncustodial parents to pay their fair \n     share of child support is a significant contributor to \n     poverty among single-parent families.\n       (3) In 1990, there was a $33,700,000,000 gap between the \n     amount of child support that was received and the amount that \n     could have been collected.\n       (4) In 1991, the aggregate child support income deficit was \n     $5,800,000,000.\n       (5) As of spring 1992, only 54 percent, or 6,200,000, of \n     custodial parents received awards of child support. Of the \n     6,200,000 custodial parents awarded child support, 5,300,000 \n     were supposed to receive child support payments in 1991. \n     Approximately \\1/2\\ of the parents due child support received \n     full payment; the remaining \\1/2\\ were divided equally \n     between those receiving partial payment (24 percent) and \n     those receiving nothing (25 percent).\n       (6) Custodial parents who are poor are much more likely to \n     receive no child support. Of the 3,700,000 custodial parents \n     who were poor in 1991, over \\3/4\\ received no child support. \n     Only 34 percent of poor custodial parents had child support \n     awards and were supposed to receive child support payments in \n     1991. Of those parents, only 40 percent received full \n     payment, 29 percent received partial payment, and 32 percent \n     received nothing.\n       (7) The percentage of poor women who were awarded child \n     support in 1991, 39 percent, was significantly lower than the \n     65 percent award rate for nonpoor women.\n       (8) Families fare better with child support than without \n     that support. In 1991, 43 percent of custodial parents who \n     did not have child support orders were poor.\n       (9) In 1991, the average total money income of custodial \n     parents receiving child support due was 21 percent higher \n     than that received by parents who did not receive child \n     support due and was 45 percent higher than that received by \n     custodial parents with no child support award at all.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to enable \n     participating States to establish child support assurance \n     systems in order to improve the economic circumstances of \n     children who do not receive a minimum level of child support \n     in a given month from the noncustodial parents of such \n     children, to strengthen the establishment and enforcement of \n     child support awards, and to promote work by custodial and \n     noncustodial parents.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide relief to certain aliens who would \notherwise be subject to removal from the United States; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             the immigration reform transition act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I join my friends Senator Graham and \nSenator Kennedy in introducing a bill which would ease the transition \ninto implementation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 [IIRAIRA] for certain Central American \nimmigrants. This legislation, which has been requested by President \nClinton, is designed to ensure that those immigrants who were in the \nadministrative pipeline at the time IIRAIRA took effect will have their \ncases decided under the set of rules in place before enactment of \nIIRAIRA. This legislation will by no means grant amnesty to anyone; it \nwill ensure that each individual will have their application for \nsuspension of deportation given full and fair consideration.\n  This legislation is a matter of freedom, justice, human rights and \nfundamental fairness. During consideration of IIRAIRA, I maintained \nthat those immigrants who were already in this country should not have \nthe rules changed on them midstream. Many Central American immigrants \nhave planted deep roots in the United States and are valued members of \ntheir communities. They should be free from the fear of deportation \nwithout a full consideration of their request for suspension of that \ndeportation under the set of rules in place at the time that they \napplied.\n  Ten years ago, in the mountains of Nicaragua, I spoke to thousands of \nyoung men who were fighting for freedom. I told them then that we would \nnot forget them, and I tell them now that we will not forget them.\n  I urge the Senate's expedient consideration and passage of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I am honored to join my colleague \nand friend Senator Connie Mack in introducing the Immigration Reform \nTransition Act of 1997.\n  This is a bipartisan, humane solution to concerns that were raised by \nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of \n1996.\n  Thousands of families, hard-working, law-abiding, taxpaying \nindividuals who had followed every rule and regulation up to the \npassage of the immigration bill last year now live in fear of \ndeportation.\n  Working together, and working swiftly, Congress has the opportunity \nto correct this injustice.\n  The families that we are helping came to our Nation in the 1980's. \nOur own Government encouraged them to flee the Communist regimes and \ncivil unrest of Central America at that time.\n  Our Nation's foreign policy gave them a safe haven; our Immigration \nService allowed for their work authorization and they settled in to our \nAmerican society.\n  Ten or fifteen years later, these families have homes here. They have \nU.S. citizen children. They have jobs; they pay taxes, and they make \ntremendous contributions to our local communities.\n  The Illegal Immigration and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 \nseverely restricted the avenues of relief that were traditionally \navailable to aliens who have resided in the United States on a long-\nterm basis.\n  Then, on February 20 of this year, the Board of Immigration Appeals \ninterpreted a section of the immigration bill as applying, in all \nessence, retroactively.\n  Forty thousand Nicaraguans in Miami alone who, under the old law, \nwould have qualified for suspension of deportation, would now be \ndeportable because of Board's decision.\n  Families would be torn apart. Close-knit communities would evaporate. \nBusinesses would suffer. In my heart, I don't believe this was the \nintent of Congress when the immigration bill was passed last year.\n  Janet Reno made an important step toward fairness and justice on July \n11, when she agreed to review the Board of Immigration Appeal's \ndecision. I supported her action, and appreciate her help in finding a \nhumane and reasonable solution to these concerns.\n  In her July 11 press release, the Attorney General informed Congress \nthat legislative action would be necessary to fully resolve this \nspecific issue.\n  I am pleased to work with her, and my Senate colleagues, today to \ntake the first step in accomplishing our legislative goal.\n  This legislation is crafted very narrowly. It recognizes the special \ncircumstances in which Nicaraguans, and other Central Americans, came \nto the United States during a specific period of time--when they were \nfleeing the unrest created by the Communist governments of the era.\n  It allows this specific group of individuals and families to complete \nthe process that they may have started 10 or 15 years ago--and \nimportantly--to complete the process under the same set of rules that \nthey started with.\n\n[[Page S8191]]\n\n  Critics may say that we are undoing the immigration bill of last \nyear. We are not. The 4000-per-year cap on suspensions of deportation \nis still intact, we are just not applying it to this specific group of \nindividuals.\n  The stronger standards to qualify or suspension of deportation still \nremain current law. We are just allowing this group to go through the \nprocess without changing the rules in midstream.\n  Also important: this is not an amnesty bill. Each request will be \ndecided on a case by case basis. If someone has been of bad moral \ncharacter, they will not qualify. If someone has not been here the \nrequired amount of time, they will not qualify.\n  We are saying that those who played by the rules will have a fair \nopportunity to have their case heard by an immigration judge.\n  I welcome comments from the broader community on this legislation, \nand look forward to the opportunity to work with the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee and Immigration Subcommittee to ensure its future success.\n  I ask my Senate colleagues to join with me today in this bipartisan \neffort to ensure fairness to hard working families.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Mack \nand Senator Graham in introducing the Immigration Reform Transition Act \nof 1997 proposed by President Clinton.\n  Without this legislation, thousands of Central American refugee \nfamilies who fled death squads and persecution in their native lands \nwould be forced to return. Republican and Democratic administrations \nalike promised them repeatedly that they will get their day in court to \nmake their claims before an immigration judge to remain in the United \nStates.\n  But last year's immigration law turned its back on that commitment \nand closed the door on these families. This legislation reinstates the \npromise and guarantees these families the day in court they deserve.\n  Virtually all of these families fled to the United States in the \n1980's from El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Guatemala. Many were targeted by \ndeath squads and faced persecution at the hands of rogue militias. They \ncame to America to seek safe haven and freedom for themselves and their \nchildren.\n  The Reagan administration, the Bush administration, and the Clinton \nadministration assured them that they could apply to remain permanently \nin the United States under our immigration laws. If they have lived \nhere for at least 7 years and are of good moral character, and if a \nreturn to Central America will be an unusual hardship, they are allowed \nto remain.\n  Last year's immigration law eliminated this opportunity for these \nfamilies by changing the standard for humanitarian relief.\n  President Clinton has promised to find a fair and reasonable solution \nfor these families, and the administration will use its authority to \nhelp as many of them as possible. But Congress must do its part too, by \nenacting this corrective legislation.\n  These families are law-abiding, taxpaying members of communities in \nall parts of America. Their children have grown up here. In fact, many \nof their children were born here and are U.S. citizens by birth. They \ndeserve this chance.\n  Mr. President, it is my hope not only that we can move on this \nlegislation--and move quickly--but also that certain issues can be \naddressed as the Senate considers it. In particular, I believe that the \nlimitations on judicial review contained in the administration's bill \nare both unnecessary and unwise. There are already substantial \nlimitations on judicial review contained in last year's immigration law \nthat would also apply in this instance. We should not add to them in \nthis legislation. Instead, we should ensure that, if mistakes are made, \nthe courts can correct them.\n  Again, I commend the administration for this important initiative and \nam pleased to join Senator Mack and Senator Graham in cosponsoring the \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 1077. A bill to amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n        the indian gaming regulatory act amendments act of 1997\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator \nInouye, is sponsoring the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act Amendments Act \nof 1997. I want to associate myself with Senator Inouye's, remarks \nregarding this legislation and the issue of Indian gaming. I commend \nSenator Inouye for his outstanding leadership over the years on this \ncomplex issue. This legislation is intended to stimulate discussion in \nthe Congress and among the tribes on this important issue.\n  The bill I am introducing today would provide for a major overhaul of \nthe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988. It will provide for minimum \nFederal standards in the regulation and licensing of class II and class \nIII gaming as well as all of the contractors, suppliers, and industries \nassociated with such gaming. This will be accomplished through the \nFederal Indian Gaming Regulator Commission which will be funded through \nassessments on Indian gaming revenues and fees imposed on license \napplicants. The bill also provides a new process for the negotiation of \nclass III compacts which authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to \nnegotiate compacts with Indian tribes in those instances where a State \nchooses not to participate in compact negotiations or where an Indian \ntribe and a State cannot reach an agreement on a compact. This process \nis consistent with recent Federal court decisions.\n  In addition, the bill is consistent with the 1987 decision of the \nU.S. Supreme Court in the case of California versus Cabazon Band of \nMission Indians in that it neither expands nor further restricts the \nscope of Indian gaming. The laws of each State would continue to be the \nbasis for determining what gaming activities may be available to an \nIndian tribe located in that State.\n  Since the enactment of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act in 1988, \nthere has been a dramatic increase in the amount of gaming activity \namong the Indian tribes. Indian gaming is now estimated to yield gross \nrevenues of about $6 billion per year and net revenues are estimated at \n$750 million. There are about 160 class II bingo and card games in \noperation and over 145 tribal/State compacts governing class III gaming \nin 2 States. Indian gaming comprises about 3 percent of all gaming in \nthe United States. Gaming activities operated by State governments \ncomprises about 36 percent of all gaming, and the private sector \naccounts for the balance of the gaming activity in the Nation.\n  Indian gaming has become the largest source of economic activity for \nsome Indian tribes. Annual revenues derived from Indian agricultural \nresources have been estimated at $550 million and have historically \nbeen the leading source of income for Indian tribes and individuals. \nAnnual revenues from oil, gas, and minerals are about $230 million and \nIndian forestry revenue are estimated at $61 million. Gaming revenues \nnow equal or exceed all of the revenues derived from Indian natural \nresources. In addition, Indian gaming has generated tens of thousands \nof new jobs for Indians and non-Indians. On many reservations, gaming \nhas meant the end of unemployment rates of 90 to 100 percent and the \nbeginning of an era of full employment.\n\n  Under the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988, Indian tribes are \nrequired to expend the profits from gaming activities to fund tribal \ngovernment operations or programs and to promote tribal economic \ndevelopment. Profits may only be distributed directly to the members of \nan Indian tribe under a plan which has been approved by the Secretary \nof the Interior. Only a few such plans have been approved. Virtually \nall of the proceeds from Indian gaming activities are used to fund the \nsocial services, education, and health needs of the Indian tribes. \nSchools, health facilities, roads and other vital infrastructure are \nbeing built by the Indian tribes with the proceeds from Indian gaming.\n  In the years before enactment of the 1988 act, and even since its \nenactment, we have heard concerns about the possibility of organized \ncriminal elements penetrating Indian gaming. Both the Department of \nJustice and the FBI have repeatedly testified before the Committee on \nIndian Affairs and have indicated that there is not any substantial \ncriminal activity of any kind\n\n[[Page S8192]]\n\nassociated with Indian gaming. Some of our colleagues have suggested \nthat no one would know if there is criminal activity because not enough \npeople are looking for it. I believe that this point of view overlooks \nthe fact the act provides for a very substantial regulatory and law \nenforcement role by the States and Indian tribes in class III gaming \nand by the Federal Government in class II gaming. The record clearly \nshows that in the few instances of known criminal activity in class III \ngaming, the Indian tribes have discovered the activity and have sought \nFederal assistance in law enforcement.\n  Nevertheless, the record before the Committee on Indian Affairs also \nshows that the absence of minimum Federal standards for the regulation \nand licensing of Indian gaming has allowed a void to develop which will \nbecome more and more attractive to criminal elements as Indian gaming \ncontinues to generate increased revenues. The legislation I am \nintroducing today provides for the development of strict minimum \nFederal standards based on the recommendations of Federal, State and \ntribal officials. While Indian tribes or States, or both, will continue \nto exercise primary regulatory authority, their regulatory standards \nmust meet or exceed the minimum Federal standards. In the event that \nthe Federal Indian Gaming Regulatory determines that the minimum \nFederal standards are not being met, then the Commission may directly \nregulate the gaming activity until such time as Federal standards are \nmet. In addition, the Commission is vested with authority to issue and \nrevoke licenses as well as to impose civil fines, close Indian gaming \nfacilities or seek enforcement of the act through the Federal courts.\n  One of the areas which has caused the greatest controversy under the \ncurrent law relates to what has come to be known as the scope of \ngaming. A related issue is the refusal of some States to enter into \nnegotiations for a class III compact and their assertion of sovereign \nimmunity under the 11th amendment to the Constitution when an Indian \ntribe seeks judicial relief as provided by the act. The bill I am \nintroducing incorporates the explicit standards of the Cabazon decision \nto guide all parties in determining the permissible gaming activities \nunder the laws of any State. State laws will continue to govern this \nissue. I have not proposed the preemption of the gaming laws of any \nState. In most States, the issue of scope of gaming has now been \nsettled through negotiation or litigation. In a few States this issue \nremains unresolved, but appears headed toward resolution by the courts.\n  In the course of our work on the gaming issue in the two previous \nCongresses, Senators Campbell, Inouye and I advanced various formal and \ninformal proposals for Federal legislation to resolve the scope of \ngaming issue. In addition, proposals were developed by State and Tribal \nofficials. However, we were never able to develop a consensus on any \none proposal. While the Committee on Indian Affairs remains open to \nsuggestions on this issue, it is apparent that obtaining a consensus \nmay not be possible. This may be an area of the law best left to \nresolution through the courts.\n  Mr. President, I am sure that we may find many ways to improve this \nlegislation as it moves through the Senate. However, I believe that it \nprovides a good foundation for our further consideration of this \nimportant issue. This legislation is essentially the same as the bill \nthat was reported favorably for the Committee on Indian Affairs during \nthe last Congress by a vote of 14 to 2. I want to emphasize that this \nbill is intended to stimulate discussion. I am looking forward to \nhearing from all interested parties with regard to their constructive \nsuggestions for ways to improve the bill and move it forward. I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1077\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator John McCain, as a co-sponsor of legislation to amend \nthe Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988.\n  It is my understanding that this measure is substantially identical \nin most respects to the bill, S. 487, that was reported by the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs in the last session of the Congress.\n   Mr. President, over the years, in our various capacities as Members, \nchairman, and vice chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator \nMcCain and I have worked together on the complex and challenging issues \nwhich have typically loomed large on the horizons of Indian gaming.\n  We have learned, from sometimes bitter experience, that in this \narena, one most definitely cannot satisfy even some of the people some \nof the time--but we have continued to explore a range of solutions that \nmight hold the potential for finding acceptance amongst the relevant \nparties in interest.\n   Mr. President, it is my hope that in the days ahead, the chairman of \nthe Indian Affairs Committee and I will be able to introduce a measure \nto amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that will build upon this \ninitiative, and the work that the Indian Affairs Committee has been \nengaged in--over the last 7 months.\n  We are in the process of updating some of the provisions of the 1988 \nact--as well as identifying areas that may require a whole new \napproach.\n  In the interim, of this we can be certain--there will be much \ndiscussion and a renewed round of debate on the merits of the measure \nthat is being introduced today--but I commend my colleague for his \ncontinuing commitment to Indian country, and his efforts to address \nsome of the more challenging issues of our times.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Abraham, Mr. \n        Akaka, Mr. Allard, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Bond, Mr. \n        Breaux, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Coats, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Craig, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Dodd, Mr. \n        Dorgan, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Faircloth, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Ford, \n        Mr. Glenn, Mr. Graham, Mr. Grams, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Hagel, Mr. \n        Hatch, Mr. Helms, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Kempthorne, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \n        Mack, Mr. McCain, Ms. Moseley-Braun, Mr. Murkowski, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Reid, Mr. Roth, Mr. Santorum, Mr. Smith of Oregon, \n        Ms. Snowe, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. Thurmond):\n  S.J. Res. 36. A joint resolution to confer status as an honorary \nveteran of the United States Armed Forces on Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n[[Page S8202]]\n\n LEGISLATION TO CONFER STATUS AS AN HONORARY VETERAN OF THE U.S. ARMED \n                   FORCES TO LESLIE TOWNES (BOB) HOPE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, it is with a particular sense of \nprivilege that I introduce legislation today to confer the status of \nhonorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces to Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope. \nIf any person in this country merits such an unprecedented honor--and \nMr. President, it is my understanding that no person has ever before \nbeen conferred the status of honorary veteran--surely, it is Bob Hope.\n  Bob Hope's contributions to this Nation--and, particularly, to its \nsoldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen--are well known to all of our \ncitizens. Less well known to many is the fact that Bob Hope is a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen, having emigrated to this country from England \nwhen Bob was just a boy. I am the son of a naturalized American--an \nimmigrant who walked across Europe with barely a ruble in his pocket so \nthat he could make his way to this country. So I know first hand that a \nperson of humble origins can scale the heights of this country. Few, \nthough, have scaled the heights that Bob Hope has scaled.\n  When I say Bob Hope has scaled the heights, I am not referring to his \nsuccess as an actor, a comedian, or businessman--though his success in \nall three areas has been considerable. When I say Bob Hope has scaled \nthe heights, I am thinking of his place in the hearts of his adopted \ncountrymen.\n  Who in this country is more beloved by a broader spectrum of his \nfellow citizens than Bob Hope--people of all ages, races, religions, \nand beliefs? Perhaps, none more than Bob Hope. For the past 50 years, \nthis country's fighting men and women could count on Bob Hope to lift \ntheir spirits and morale when they faced the prospect of making the \nultimate sacrifice. In World War II, in Korea, in Vietnam and, most \nrecently, in the Persian Gulf, Bob Hope and his troupe were there to \nentertain the troops. More importantly, they were there to remind our \nfighting men and women that they were not forgotten, that their \nsuffering was appreciated. Bob Hope was always with the troops--\nespecially during the holidays--enduring hardship, and often \nsignificant physical danger, so that he might encourage those facing \ngreater hardship and danger. Three generations of veterans will never \nforget how much he cared.\n  Those three generations of veterans wonder how they might properly \nrecognize Bob Hope. He is already a recipient of the Nation's highest \ncivilian decorations, the Congressional Gold Medal and the Presidential \nMedal of Freedom. President Carter hosted a White House reception in \nhonor of his 75th birthday. President Clinton bestowed upon him the \nMedal of the Arts. He has received more than 50 honorary doctorates, \nand innumerable awards from civic, social, and veterans organizations. \nBut Bob Hope cannot say that he is a veteran--in my mind, one of the \nmost honorable appellations one can carry. This legislation will remedy \nthat.\n  I ask that all of my colleagues join me in supporting legislation to \ndesignate Bob Hope an honorary veteran. And I thank the former \nCommandant of the U.S. Marine Corps and the current president of the \nUSO, Gen. Carl Mundy, for spearheading this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the joint resolution was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 36\n\n       Whereas the United States has never before conferred status \n     as an honorary veteran of the United States Armed Forces on \n     an individual, and such status is and should remain an \n     extraordinary honor not lightly conferred nor frequently \n     granted;\n       Whereas the lifetime of accomplishments and service of \n     Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope on behalf of United States military \n     servicemembers fully justifies the conferring of such status;\n       Whereas Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope is himself not a veteran, \n     having attempted to enlist in the Armed Forces to serve his \n     country during World War II, but being informed that the \n     greatest service he could provide the Nation was as a \n     civilian entertainer for the troops;\n       Whereas during World War II, the Korean Conflict, the \n     Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War and throughout the Cold \n     War, Bob Hope traveled to visit and entertain millions of \n     United States servicemembers in numerous countries, on ships \n     at sea, and in combat zones ashore;\n       Whereas Bob Hope has been awarded the Congressional Gold \n     Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Distinguished \n     Service Medal of each of the branches of the Armed Forces, \n     and more than 100 citations and awards from national veterans \n     service organizations and civic and humanitarian \n     organizations; and\n       Whereas Bob Hope has given unselfishly of his time for over \n     a half century to be with United States servicemembers on \n     foreign shores, working tirelessly to bring a spirit of humor \n     and cheer to millions of servicemembers during their \n     loneliest moments, and thereby extending for the American \n     people a touch of home away from home: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, That \n     Congress--\n       (1) extends its gratitude, on behalf of the American \n     people, to Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope for his lifetime of \n     accomplishments and service on behalf of United States \n     military servicemembers; and\n       (2) confers upon Leslie Townes (Bob) Hope the status of an \n     honorary veteran of the United States Armed Forces.\n\n

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 44--RELATIVE TO A POSTAGE STAMP\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself and Mr. Specter) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 44\n\n       Whereas the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of \n     America, an organization of patriotic Americans dedicated to \n     highlighting the role of Jews in the United States Armed \n     Forces, celebrated 100 years of patriotic service to the \n     Nation on March 15, 1996;\n       Whereas thousands of Jews have proudly served the Nation in \n     times of war;\n       Whereas thousands of Jews have died in combat while serving \n     in the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas, in World War II alone, Jews received more than \n     52,000 awards for outstanding service in the United States \n     Armed Forces, including the Medal of Honor, the Air Medal, \n     the Silver Star, and the Purple Heart;\n       Whereas, in World War II alone, over 11,000 Jews died in \n     combat while serving in the United States Armed Forces;\n       Whereas members of the Jewish War Veterans of the United \n     States of America have volunteered over 10,000,000 hours at \n     veterans' hospitals; and\n       Whereas honoring the sacrifices of Jewish veterans is an \n     important component of recognizing the strong and patriotic \n     role Jews have played in the United States Armed Forces: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) a postage stamp should be issued to honor the 100th \n     anniversary of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States \n     of America; and\n       (2) the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee of the United \n     States Postal Service should recommend to the Postmaster \n     General that such a postage stamp be issued.\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am submitting legislation \nexpressing the sense of Congress that the Postal Service should issue a \npostage stamp should be issued to commemorate the 100th anniversary of \nthe Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America. I am pleased \nto be joined by my distinguished colleague from Pennsylvania and \nchairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Specter.\n  The Jewish War Veterans of the United States was founded in 1896, \nearning it the distinction of being the oldest veterans organization in \nthe United States. The goal of its founders was to counter criticism in \nsome of the major national publications of the day that suggested that \nJewish Americans were unpatriotic and had not served in the Civil War. \nNot only did many Jews serve with distinction in the Civil War, but \nthousands have honorably served their country in subsequent military \nconflicts. More than 250,000 Jews served in World War I. During World \nWar II, approximately 11,000 Jews were killed and 40,000 were wounded.\n  Today, the Jewish War Veterans organization continues its mission of \nfighting anti-Semitism, promoting religious tolerance and defending the \nfirst amendment. Moreover, through its National Museum of American \nJewish Military History and other activities, it educates the public \nabout the contributions Jews have made to the defense of our Nation. \nThe organization also serves a vital role of advocating on behalf of \nadequate treatment of all war veterans.\n  My legislation is identical to legislation submitted to the 103d \nCongress. Senate Concurrent Resolution 60, which I was proud to \ncosponsor along with 62 of my colleagues. This legislation \noverwhelmingly passed the Senate on August 11, 1994. Unfortunately, \ndespite the Senate's wishes, the Postal Service has refused to issue a \ncommemorative stamp honoring this worthy organization. Thus, I believe \nthat it is time to reaffirm the Senate's position of this important \nmatter. I urge my colleagues to join in cosponsoring this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8203-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS \n                               ACT, 1998\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               D'AMATO (AND MOYNIHAN) AMENDMENT NO. 1022\n\n  Mr. SHELBY (for Mr. D'Amato, for himself and Mr. Moynihan) proposed \nan amendment to the bill, S. 1048, making appropriations for the \nDepartment of Transportation and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 1998, and for other purposes; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n       Out of the funds made available under this Act to the New \n     York Metropolitan Transportation Authority through the \n     Federal Transit Administration, the New York Metropolitan \n     Transportation Authority shall perform a study to ascertain \n     the costs and benefits of instituting an integrated fare \n     system for commuters who use both the Metro North Railroad or \n     the Long Island Rail Road and New York City subway or bus \n     systems.

Mr. President, it was a sad day in our Nation's \nhistory, and more significantly, to its southernmost territory in the \nSouth Pacific, the islands of Tutuila and Manu'a known also as American \nSamoa, when a grand lady, a woman of great courage, a long-time \neducator, passed away peacefully in Honolulu, HI, on June 13, 1997. She \nwas the late Hon. Seuva'ai Mere Tuiasosopo-Betham, former associate \njudge of the high court of American Samoa and former director of the \nAmerican Samoa Department of Education. She was 65 years of age.\n  ``Mere'' as she was popularly known, was born to the late High Chief \nOrator Mariota Tiumalu Tuiasosopo I of Vatia who was one of the \nsignatories of the Deed of Cession between the islands of Tutuila and \nManu'a and the United States of America in 1900. Her mother was the \nlate Venise Pulefa'asisina-Tuiasosopo of the village of Amanave. During \nthe islands' naval administration in 1950, Mere graduated as the only \nfemale out of 16 students in the first graduating class of the Amerika \nSamoa High School. High Chief Orator Tuiasosopo, a staunch educator and \nan influential person in Mere's life, who firmly believed in the vast \nopportunities offered by the new mother country, encouraged his \ndaughter to study abroad. She attended Geneva College in Pennsylvania \nand experienced the lessons of life to persevere and be disciplined \nwhile thousands of miles away from her home in the South Pacific.\n  After becoming one of the first Samoans ever to successfully complete \ncollege in 1954 and earning her teaching credentials, Mere returned to \nSamoa upon her parents wishes and delved into education, becoming one \nof the first teachers in the American Samoan educational system. Over \nfour decades, Mere dedicated her life to the teaching of Samoan \nstudents. She began as a classroom teacher, then an adviser, a vice \nprincipal, a principal, and eventually rose to the prestigious position \nof assistant director of the Department of Education at a time when \nvery few Samoans held administrative positions in government and the \nterritory's chief executive was still appointed by the Secretary of \nInterior. In 1978, when American Samoa elected its first Samoan \nGovernor, Mere was appointed as the first Samoan female to hold a \ncabinet office serving as director of the Education Department.\n  Since the inception of formal education in American Samoa, Mere's \nname has been synonymous with its development. She initiated the local \ncapacity building concept that involved efforts for staff development \nand the bilingual/bicultural education which consolidated the best in \nboth Samoan and Western curricula. Her local capacity building grew out \nof the need to upgrade the total teaching force in American Samoa which \nwas nearly 90 percent Samoan. She once said, that,\n\n       . . . for every child to be able to learn well, he must be \n     taught well . . . our people are our greatest and only \n     valuable natural resource, it is imperative that we invest \n     heavily in their development at all levels. In doing so, we \n     invest in our country's future stability, growth, health and \n     security.\n\n  Inherent in Mere's insistence on local capacity building was her \nconviction that the only way citizens in a developing country like \nSamoa can ensure their survival amidst the influxes of the Western \nworld, was to remain the masters of their land and development, and \ncontinue to reaffirm confidence in their ability to determine their own \ndestiny. It is also the mechanism, she believed, the Samoan culture and \nAmerican democracy could merge enabling Samoans to continue to live in \npeace and harmony.\n  Mere's conceptualization, development, and materialization of the \nbilingual/bicultural educational system of American Samoa was an \ninnovative approach to reconcile the fervent desire of Samoans to \nmaintain their identity as a cultural entity while educating their \npeople to meet the demands of the Western world. She held this notion \nfor nearly 40 years and firmly ingrained it in all of her students, \nmany of whom attest to the immense influence this great Samoan lady has \nhad in their lives.\n  Mrs. Betham received numerous awards as a leading educator in the \nPacific. She received the Samoan Educator of the Year award presented \nto her by former U.S. Secretary of Education, Dr. Terrell H. Bell. He \nthanked her for her efforts to improve educational opportunities in the \nPacific Basin saying, ``Progress in education (reform) depends most of \nall on the activities of leaders in each of our states and territories, \nand your example to the people of American Samoa has been bright * * \n*''\n  In 1991, Mere was appointed to the all-male high court of American \nSamoa which included seven Samoan associate judges who dealt mainly \nwith land and ``matai'' [chieftain] title laws. Her wisdom and \nknowledge of the ``fa'a-Samoa'' [Samoan culture] was fiercely sought by \nmany of the territory's leaders to help preserve the integrity and \nuniqueness of their Samoan heritage at the same time dispensing \nAmerican justice. As part of the criteria of being an associate judge, \nMere was initiated into her village's ``Nu'u o Ali'i,'' the council of \nchiefs, traditionally all-male in most Samoan villages. She was \nbestowed the Talking Chief title ``Seuva'ai,'' descriptive of one \nsurging\n\n[[Page S8205]]\n\nforward with determination but cognizant of her native surroundings and \nwhat the benefits will be to everyone.\n  Mere epitomized the true legacy of an educator, who throughout her \nlifetime set precedents for Samoan people and especially for Pacific \nisland women, teaching by example. As her island home developed under \nthe guidance of the United States of America for almost a century now, \nshe never forgot her role as an educated Samoan to maintain her \nindigenous culture.\n  Judge Betham is survived by her husband of over 40 years, James \n``Rusty'' M. Betham, five of her six children, five grandchildren, her \n83-year-old mother-in-law, a number of brothers and sisters, and a \nlarge extended family in her native Samoa and the world over. She will \nbe missed by all those who knew and loved her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8204-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        THOMAS BROS. GRASS, LTD.\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to commend Thomas Bros. \nGrass, Ltd., being named Entrepreneur of the Year by the Dallas \nBusiness Journal. Thomas Bros. began in the 1970's, with 10 acres of \nundeveloped land and a dream. E.A. Thomas and his four sons Ike, Mark, \nMike, and Emory, took those 10 acres and started a small business with \nthe desire to produce a wide variety of quality sod for golf courses, \nathletic fields, and residential properties. Over the years, that small \nsod farm has blossomed into a successful 2,000-acre family-owned \nbusiness, with sod operations in three States.\n  While their headquarters are located in Texas, Thomas Bros. has two \nsod farms in my home State of Tennessee. The farms in Taft and \nNashville have not only strengthened the economies of these \ncommunities, they have brought with them the Thomas family spirit of \nteamwork and community well-being. Not only are they well established \nas experts in sod production and installation, they have achieved a \nreputation for quality and efficient service. That reputation makes \nthem standouts in their field, and has earned the family work in major \narenas throughout the country, like the Cotton Bowl in Dallas and the \nKansas City Chiefs football club.\n  Mr. President, Thomas Bros.' team approach and home grown commitment \nto customer satisfaction has certainly benefited the State of Tennessee \nand is worthy of this recognition as Entrepreneur of the Year. I \ncongratulate them and wish them continued success in future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8205-1", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8205-S8206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REAUTHORIZING THE PRESCRIPTION DRUG USER FEE PROGRAM AND CERTAIN FOOD \n                    AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION REFORMS\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport S. 830, the FDA Modernization and Accountability Act.\n  This bill deserves support for one primary reason. It preserves the \nFDA's essential mission of validating the safety and effectiveness of \nnew drugs and medical devices, while encouraging innovation and the \ncommercialization of new, life-saving therapies.\n  This bill is the result of much debate, and tremendous consensus \nbuilding over the last two Congresses. I'm proud to have played some \npart in this as a Member of both the House and the Senate, having \nintroduced more than 2 years ago H.R. 1472, the FDA Modernization Act \nof 1995, which contains several of the key ingredients of the \nlegislation before us today.\n  From the time we get up in the morning until the time we go to bed at \nnight, we live, work, eat, and drink in a world of products affected by \nFDA decisionmaking.\n  Perhaps no other Federal agency has such a broad impact in the daily \nlives of average Americans.\n  Food handling and commercial preparation often occurs under the \nagency's scrutiny. Over-the-counter drugs and nutritional supplements, \nfrom vitamins to aspirin, also are certified by the agency.\n  Life-saving drugs for treatment of cancer, autoimmune deficiency, and \nother dread diseases are held to its rigorous approval standards.\n  Medical devices ranging from the simple to the complex, from tongue \ndepressors to computerized diagnostic equipment, must meet FDA quality \nstandards.\n  These products overseen by the FDA are woven deeply into the fabric \nof our daily lives, and the agency's twin missions of certifying their \nsafety and effectiveness is supported by the vast majority of \nAmericans.\n  Yet, balancing those missions against the time and expense required \nby manufacturers to navigate the FDA approval system has been difficult \nand controversial. In the last Congress, radical transformation of the \nagency, even ending the agency as we know it and replacing it with a \npanel of private-sector, expert entrepreneurs, became a goal of some.\n  At the very least, reforming the FDA at the beginning of the 104th \nCongress looked to be an exercise fraught with partisan political \nturmoil, and destined for gridlock.\n  But while there was focus on the extreme ends of the argument, those \nfolks arguing for no changes against members demanding wholesale \ndismemberment of the agency, a broader, bipartisan middle developed.\n  And with the help of Vice President's Gore's Reinventing Government \nProgram, Members of Congress from both political parties developed \npractical, bipartisan solutions to the critical process and management \nproblems in the FDA approval process.\n  I sought to mobilize this bipartisan movement with H.R. 1472 \nintroduced in June 1995. Some in my own party thought I had gone to \nfar, too fast, But I am gratified that many of the elements of that \nlegislation have been retained and strengthened in the legislation and \nmanagers amendment we expect to have before us this week.\n  These include: It streamlines approval systems for biotechnology \nproduct manufacturing; it allows approval of important, new \nbreakthrough drugs on the basis of a single, clinically valid trial; it \ncreates a collaborative mechanism allowing applicants to confer \nconstructively with the FDA at critical points in the approval process; \nit sets reasonable but strict timeframes for approval decisionmaking; \nit reduces the paperwork and reporting burden now facing manufacturers \nwhen they make minor changes in their manufacturing process; it \nestablishes provisions for allowing third-party review of applications \nat the discretion of the Secretary; and it allows manufacturers to \ndistribute scientifically valid information on uses for approved drugs \nand devices which may not yet be certified by the FDA.\n  I am especially pleased that Senators Mack, Frist, Dodd, Boxer, \nKennedy, and I could offer the provisions of this legislation relating \nto the dissemination of information on off-label uses of approved \nproducts.\n  This provision will allow manufacturers to distribute scientifically \nand clinically valid information on such uses following a review by the \nFDA, including a decision by the agency which may require additional \nbalancing material be added to the packet.\n  Here's why that's important: Manufacturers with an approved drug for \novarian cancer may have important, but not yet conclusive information \nfrom new trials that their drug also may reduce brain or breast \ncancers. That data, while perhaps not yet of a grade to meet \nsupplemental labeling approval, may be important for an end-stage \nbreast cancer patient whose doctor has exhausted all other treatments.\n  That doctor, and her patient, has the absolute right to that \ninformation.\n  This legislation will save lives, not sacrifice them.\n  It will mean that more doctors and their patients will have \nmeaningful access to life-saving information about drugs that treat \ndread diseases like AIDS and cancer.\n  It will mean that biologic products will have a swifter passage \nthrough an approval process which no longer will require unnecessarily \ndifficult demands with regard to the size of a start-up manufacturing \nprocess.\n  It will mean that break-through drugs which offer relief from, or \ncurses of deadly disease for which there is no approved therapy will \nget into the marketplace earlier, on the basis of a special expedited \napproval system.\n  But legislation, indeed laws, are only words on paper.\n  Mr. President, we must also have a new FDA Commissioner who is as \ncommitted to these changes as former Commissioner David Kessler was \ncommitted to the war on teenage smoking.\n  The pharmaceutical industry is a robust, risk-taking, technology-\ndriven\n\n[[Page S8206]]\n\nbusiness. But by measure of total U.S. employment growth in this \nindustry is stalling out. While sales by U.S.-based concerns continue \nto increase, more of the industry's manufacturing--its jobs--is \nmigrating overseas. Part of the reason is rising domestic development \ncosts. According to Tufts University, the average development time for \na new drug is now up to 7 years. And the cost of such developments now \nfigures out at something close to $360 million per product. We \nshouldn't kid ourselves about who foots the bill for these high \ndevelopment and approval costs--it's the consumer, and it comes via the \nextraordinary high prices we pay on drugs which can spell the literal \ndifference between life and death.\n  S. 830 significantly reforms that regime, recognizing that we all--\ngovernment, industry, and consumers--have a real stake in cutting the \nexplosive costs of bringing new medical products to the marketplace, \nand in making available break-through, life-saving therapies more \nquickly, and at a lower price.\n  Along with these important reforms, S. 380 also reauthorizes for 5 \nyears the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, a very successful program \nthat has helped swiftly approve scores of new life-saving therapies.\n  Let me also point out that while this bill makes substantial and far-\nreaching improvements, it distinctly moderates last year's reform \neffort.\n  So-called hammers that would have caused the agency to lose \njurisdiction over the approval process if tight decision-making \ndeadlines were not met have been eliminated.\n  Also missing is last year's provision requiring the agency to approve \nproducts previously approved in Europe.\n  My colleagues should understand that this bill is the result of \nefforts to reach a true common ground on many tough issues. Many more \nissues were gray, than they were black or white. Extremists on neither \nside of the debate can claim an advantage, or a victory.\n  The real victory, I believe, will be realized by the American \nconsumer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/07/28/senate-section/article/S8205-2", "month": "07", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, JULY 29, 1997\n\n  Mr. SHELBY.
