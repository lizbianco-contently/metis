Mr. President, I rise today to address a very important \nissue for our Nation's men and women in uniform, an issue that you and \nI have spoken about.\n  A recent article in the Omaha World Herald detailed problems that \nOffutt Air Force Base in Nebraska, headquarters for the Strategic \nCommand, is having with the condition of military housing on that base. \nI would like to read just a few paragraphs from this story. This is a \nstory all too familiar, Mr. President, especially to you as our \ndistinguished leader in the Armed Services Committee. This is a quote \nfrom the Omaha World Herald story:\n\n       Staff Sgt. Tony Suprenant and his wife, Karen, never \n     thought that life in the United States Air Force meant they \n     would get a palatial estate to call home. But the cramped and \n     drafty townhouse that was offered to them when they arrived \n     at Offutt Air Force Base last year was more of a sacrifice \n     than they were willing to make.\n       The two-bedroom home was so small that it would not hold \n     the modest amount of furniture they had gathered during their \n     7 years together on five bases. Offutt officials eventually \n     found a more spacious and recently refurbished three-bedroom \n     home for the couple and their 2-year-old daughter, Emily. Not \n     every family at that base is so lucky.\n\n[[Page S1780]]\n\n       Many of the 2,600 Offutt families who live in base housing \n     must cope with cramped conditions and an array of maintenance \n     headaches--frozen pipes, leaky basements, difficulty in \n     heating and cooling--that have only increased with time \n     and heavy use.\n\n  Sadly, Mr. President, this is a problem that extends across the \ncountry and throughout all branches of our military throughout the \nworld. It is a problem that we are not addressing as a nation, as a \nCongress. This is shameful. Like America's strength, our military \nstrength is its people--the men and women and their families who have \ncommitted their lives to protecting the freedoms of this country.\n  The Pentagon has estimated that they have problems with a majority of \nits 350,000 military housing units all over the world. In the Omaha \nWorld Herald article, Pete Potochney, who works in the Pentagon office \noverseeing military housing, is quoted as saying:\n\n       We would consider a lot of our houses as being unsuitable.\n\n  The Pentagon is devoting $680 million in the 1998 budget proposal to \nfix these houses. However, at that rate of spending, it will take the \nPentagon more than 30 years to fix all of the housing that need fixing.\n  Mr. President, the men and women who wear the uniform of the United \nStates should not have to wait 30 years for adequate housing for their \nfamilies. At the rate we are currently making progress, it is a rate \nthat is being made on this issue far too slowly, and most, if not all, \nof our current military personnel will never live in decent housing at \nthis rate.\n  The Clinton administration has repeatedly proposed budget cuts and \nmore budget cuts for our Nation's defense and our military. The \nPresident's national defense budget request for fiscal year 1998 is \n$2.9 billion less in budget authority than the level in the \ncongressional budget resolution and $3.6 billion less in outlays. \nMoreover, the President's budget proposes a decrease of 16 percent for \nmilitary construction in housing for our families.\n  Military officials estimate they have problems with a majority of our \nmilitary housing units, and yet the President has suggested reducing \nthe funding for this program by 16 percent. He also proposes a decrease \nin the military personnel account.\n  Where is the commitment in this budget to the men and women who wear \nour Nation's uniform? These men and women may be asked to put their \nlives on the line at any time, and yet we offer them inadequate housing \nand pay below the poverty line.\n  This is wrong, Mr. President. This is very wrong. We are not taking \ncare of our people in the military. If we do not reverse this trend, \nour national security will suffer.\n  This is a readiness issue, just as it is a quality-of-life issue. Our \ntroops are being deployed for longer periods of time, with more time \naway from their families and for more missions. We are asking more and \nmore from our service men and women and their families.\n  I ask my colleagues to place themselves in the position of a young \nenlisted person stationed halfway around the globe. How can this young \nman concentrate on his critically important national defense job if he \nis worried about his wife having to deal with broken pipes or his \nchildren living in a cold, damp home? Our service men and women are \noften placed in tense situations in charge of multimillion-dollar \npieces of highly technical military equipment. We only help to distract \nthem from their duties of national defense if we do not assure them \nthat their families are being taken care of and their families are \nliving in decent housing.\n  I truly fear the long-term consequences of the lack of attention and \nfunding devoted to maintaining adequate housing for our Nation's \nmilitary. I fear many bright young men and women will opt not to enter \nthe military when they see the lack of resources devoted to meeting \ntheir basic family needs.\n  The military today is much different than it was when I served nearly \n30 years ago. Today, most members of the military are married with \nfamilies. They all volunteer to serve this country. They volunteer for \nmany reasons. They do not expect to be treated in any special way, but \nthey should have the right to expect decent housing for their families.\n  Today's military is a high-technology military, Mr. President. It \nneeds to be capable of responding rapidly to a variety of situations \nthroughout the world. We need our best and our brightest young men and \nwomen to serve. But we will not attract or retain them if we are \nunwilling to invest in them and their families.\n  Mr. President, I intend to be very vocal on this issue. I have \nalready spoken to the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee this morning about this issue. We must begin placing \na higher priority in the defense budget on taking care of our people. \nThese are the people who protect America's freedoms. Freedom is not \nfree.\n  In fact, we need to place a higher priority for total defense \nspending in the overall budget. In many ways we live in a world today \nof greater uncertainty and danger than the one we have known for the \nlast 50 years. If we expect our military to respond to all these \nchallenges, if we expect our service men and women to risk their lives \ndefending America, and America's interests, then we must match those \nexpectations with appropriate funding for an acceptable standard of \nliving for them.\n  The foundation of our military is the men and women who serve. That \nis the very foundation of our society--our people, our families. Our \nmilitary is no different. Our military is the guarantor of American \nforeign policy and the protector of all our freedoms. Just as a house \nbuilt on sand will soon crumble, our military might cannot stand strong \nwithout committed good men and women.\n  If we are unwilling to invest in these men and women we will pay a \nheavy price, a very heavy price, a price far greater than budgetary \nnumbers.\n  Mr. President, I have written to the distinguished chairman and \nranking member of the Armed Services Committee today, as well as our \nformer colleague, the distinguished Defense Secretary, Bill Cohen, on \nthis issue. I intend to be very involved working with my colleagues on \nthis matter.\n  Let us do the right thing. Let us do the right thing for our people. \nLet us find ways to fix this problem. We owe it to the men and women \nwho proudly wear the uniform of the U.S. military.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those letters and the \narticle I mentioned from the Omaha World-Herald be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 1997.\n     Hon. William Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense, the Pentagon,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: America's men and women in uniform need \n     decent housing. I am asking for your firm commitment to make \n     that happen.\n       In missions around the world, our armed forces protect \n     America's freedom. But at bases across America, these same \n     dedicated people too often must live in substandard housing \n     that is simply unacceptable. I am deeply concerned about the \n     long-term consequences that poor living conditions will have \n     for our ability to maintain a strong, all-volunteer force.\n       This problem has hit home for me at Offutt Air Force Base \n     in Nebraska, where at least 500 housing units built in the \n     1950s and 1960s need to be replaced. Far too much base \n     housing has cracked foundations, cramped conditions, leaky \n     basements, heating and cooling problems, and gaps around the \n     windows. The housing problems at Offutt were described in the \n     enclosed Omaha World-Herald article from February 19, 1997.\n       The administration has talked about the importance of \n     military housing. But, frankly, I am disappointed in the \n     follow-through. While our housing problems are growing worse, \n     the President has proposed a decrease of 16 percent for \n     military construction and family housing. The President's \n     housing request is substantially less--by about $3 billion--\n     than levels set forth in the budget resolution passed last \n     year. At this rate, it would take 30 years to replace all the \n     substandard housing on our military bases--and after 30 years \n     of wear and tear on houses built today, we would need to \n     start replacing them all over again!\n       It's time we get ahead of this problem and make a real \n     commitment--in money as well as words--to providing adequate \n     housing for our military personnel. I spoke about this matter \n     today on the Senate floor and am enclosing a copy of my \n     remarks.\n       I am ready to work with you in this effort. Please let me \n     know what you plan to do and how I can help.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Chuck Hagel,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n[[Page S1781]]\n\n     \n                                                                    ____\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 1997.\n     Hon.

Tony Surprenant and his wife, Karen, never \n     thought that life in the Air Force meant they would get a \n     palatial estate to call home. But the cramped and drafty town \n     house that was offered to them when they arrived at Offutt \n     Air Force Base last year was more of a sacrifice than they \n     were willing to make.\n       The two-bedroom home was so small that it could not hold \n     even the modest amount of furniture they had gathered during \n     their seven years together on five different bases.\n       Offutt officials eventually found a more spacious and \n     recently refurbished three-bedroom town house for the couple \n     and their 2-year-old daughter, Emily.\n       Not every family at the base is so lucky.\n       Many of the 2,600 Offutt families who live in base housing \n     must cope with cramped conditions and an array of maintenance \n     headaches--frozen pipes, leaky basements, difficulty in \n     heating and cooling--that have only increased with time and \n     heavy use.\n       Base officials say that at least 500 of the units, built in \n     the 1950s and 1960s, should be replaced. They have proposed a \n     $46 million construction project that would begin in a few \n     years.\n       Military bases across the nation are managing family \n     housing that offers few modern amenities and is increasingly \n     expensive to maintain. The issue is critical to the military \n     because comfortable and affordable housing is a key benefit \n     in attracting the highest-quality troops to today's all-\n     volunteer military.\n       Amenities or not the Offutt family housing, which is free, \n     remains in high demand, particularly for lower-paid troops \n     who find it hard to obtain better private housing at prices \n     they can afford. Offutt has more than 400 families on a \n     waiting list for base housing.\n       ``Quite honestly, we are not taking care of our people,'' \n     said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.\n       Hagel, an Army veteran, former Veterans Administration \n     official and vocal advocate for veterans and service members, \n     decried the lack of attention and money devoted in recent \n     years to improving housing for soldiers and their families. \n     He said he would push for more money during this year's \n     budget debate.\n       Pentagon officials know they have a problem with the bulk \n     of the 350,000 homes for military families.\n       ``We would consider a lot of our houses as being \n     unsuitable,'' said Pete Potochney, who works in the Pentagon \n     office that oversees military housing issues.\n       Replacing or refurbishing all of the houses in need of \n     significant repair or updating would cost at least $20 \n     billion. Potochney said. At the rate the Pentagon has been \n     addressing the problem--the 1998 budget proposal would devote \n     $680 million to the initiative--it would take 30 years to fix \n     all of the military family houses in need of work.\n       A lack of space is a common complaint from Offutt families. \n     The living rooms in some of the units are not big enough for \n     a modest arrangement of a sofa, love seat, coffee table and \n     cabinets for a stereo and television.\n       Many of the 2,600 town houses for military families at \n     Offutt also have problems ranging from cracked foundations \n     that have made them structurally unsafe to units with little \n     or no insulation, which makes them difficult to heat and \n     often leads to frozen water pipes.\n       No one is living in a unit that is considered unsafe, \n     Offutt officials said. The handful of buildings in such \n     condition have been razed or are closed and scheduled for \n     demolition.\n       But the units that are in use lack amenities or have \n     problems that draw a steady stream of complaints.\n       Residents in the oldest family housing buildings at Offutt, \n     the Wherry area, said they must run heaters all day and night \n     during the winter just to keep temperatures in the high 60s. \n     Many windows are so dilapidated that they fail to block \n     breezes strong enough to steadily blow curtains.\n       Water frequently seeps into basement storage areas.\n       The base has tried to improve conditions. At least 100 \n     units have been remodeled and sometimes enlarged. Wooden \n     kitchen cabinets have replaced metal ones, and bathrooms have \n     been updated.\n       Base officials plan to continue renovating more homes each \n     year.\n       This is in addition to the $2.4 million spent each year on \n     an ``active and aggressive'' maintenance program that \n     addresses the most serious problems said Col. John Mollison, \n     commander of the 55th Support Group.\n       The units regularly receive fresh coats of paint and other \n     attention that make them as nice as possible without \n     investing the money needed for longer-term improvements said \n     Mollison, who oversees the base's housing complexes.\n       ``We fix the things that break,'' Mollison said. \n     ``Everything is cleaned.''\n       The Wherry housing area was built in the 1950s. The \n     Capehart housing area which has 2,000 single-family and \n     multi-plex units about two miles west of the base was built \n     in the 1960s. The units are typical of private homes and \n     apartments built at the time, Mollison said.\n       ``As we have seen houses change over the years, they have \n     tended to get larger and include more creature comforts,'' \n     Mollison said.\n       When residents complain about the housing, Offutt officials \n     plead for patience, saying that the continuing remodeling \n     efforts and the construction plans will improve the homes \n     eventually.\n       About 40 percent of Offutt's 6,200 families live in the \n     homes that the military provides. The base has dormitories \n     for single military members who live on base.\n       The remaining military members at Offutt own or rent \n     private housing off the base. These people receive a housing \n     allowance that covers about 80 percent of their rent or \n     mortgage costs and utilities.\n       Those who live in base housing do not receive a housing \n     allowance, but they pay nothing for rent or utilities. This \n     can mean an extra $2,000 to $3,000 in disposable income each \n     year according to a recent military housing study.\n\n[[Page S1782]]\n\n       The money makes a lot of people willing to cope with \n     cramped conditions and other problems. Finding private \n     housing at prices they can afford can be difficult for lower-\n     paid soldiers and airmen.\n       Recent studies, including one done for Offutt late last \n     year, indicated a shortage of rental housing in the area, \n     especially for lower-income residents.\n       Surprenant, who joined the Air Force in 1987, said housing \n     is an important benefit that makes a military career more \n     attractive.\n       The money saved by living in military housing allows Mrs. \n     Surprenant to stay at home with Emily. ``We think parents \n     should stay home with their kids if they can,'' Surprenant \n     said.\n       The Surprenants said they also have found that there are \n     more than just financial benefits to living in base housing.\n       ``In a military community, right away you have something in \n     common with your neighbors,'' Surprenant said.\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield my time.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I call on the American people to use this \nweekend and Monday to express their views to the Members of the U.S. \nSenate on whether or not we should have a balanced budget. The American \npeople can influence the vote that we will take next Tuesday at 5:15 \np.m. The American people overwhelmingly support a constitutional \namendment for a balanced budget because they know, they understand, \nwithout this guarantee, without this leverage, it will not happen. So \nthe decision we make next Tuesday is in the hands of the American \npeople. They need to let their Senators know how they feel. If their \nSenators have said they will be for it, commend them for it. If they \nhave said they are going to vote against it, ask them why. Ask them \nwhat is the alternative. Ask them, where is the historical proof that a \nbalanced budget will occur without the constitutional amendment.\n  If a Senator has switched his vote from a year ago or 2 years ago, or \nif a Senator has switched his vote from what he said he would do in \nlast year's elections, ask them why. How can you do that? How can you, \nin 6 months, change your mind on so fundamental an issue?\n  Mr. President, this is a question of honesty. It is a question of \ntruth in Government. We wonder why people are cynical, why they wonder \nabout us, why they question us. This is exhibit A. When you give your \nword to your constituency in your State during the election campaign \nthat you are going to vote for a constitutional amendment for a \nbalanced budget and then 6 months later you say, ``Gee whiz, I have \nlearned something new, it is hard to take.'' These are not new members \nto government and politics. These are people with experience at the \nState level, at the Federal level, in the House of Representatives. \nWhat is new?\n  No, this is a question of basic honesty. But the American people can \nmake that difference. If they will get on the phone, if they will call, \nif they will write, if they will express themselves, they can make sure \nthat this amendment passes next Tuesday.\n  The press, the Washington press, is saying it is over, they will not \nget but 66 votes. The fat lady has not sung. This ``ain't'' over. It is \nnot over until we take the vote. I would hate to be a Senator who votes \nnext Tuesday against this constitutional amendment for a balanced \nbudget, especially if I had said earlier that I was going to do \nsomething else.\n  I am still working on a couple of angles, too. I have been working \nwith the rules of the Congress for 24 years, and I tell my colleagues \nyou are never going to be absolutely sure what I am going to do. If I \ncan find a way to do what I think is right for the American people, I \nwill do it, and I will be innovative. I have a couple of ideas. Believe \nme, there are a couple of Senators in this Chamber who are sweating \nright now. I bet they will not be doing any press conferences this \nweekend. No. That is an age-old strategy when you are in Congress. If \nyou do not want to talk about something you are fixing to do that your \nconstituents do not agree with, you hide. Press availability is not \npossible. We need to do this.\n  Now, the argument is made by the President, ``Oh, we should just go \nahead and balance the budget.'' I agree. We should have done it last \nyear. The Congress passed a balanced budget. The President vetoed it, \njust 1 year ago. Why did we not do it the year before, the year before, \nor the year before? Why haven't we done it for 28 years? Who among us \nbelieves we will do it in 2 more years or 4 more years?\n  I am an optimist. I believe in the positive attitude of men like \nRonald Reagan--there is a pony in there somewhere. We will find a way \nto do this job. But I have not seen any evidence of it yet. I have done \nmy dead-level best to calm down the rhetoric and try to be positive and \nhold out hope and hold out an olive branch to Members of the Congress \non both sides of the aisle and between the two Chambers and with the \nPresident. I have said we should work together for the American people. \nWe should get this job done, balance the budget.\n  Mr. President, you have just been reelected. We have a majority in \nthe Congress. The American people want us to do some things for our \nchildren and for the future of our country. I have said we can do that. \nWe should do that. The President suggested early on in one of our \ndiscussions that we should set up a commission for a particular \nmatter--which I will not talk about now--and I said, ``You know, Mr. \nPresident, you just got reelected, we just got reelected. That is what \nwe are for. We should do the job.''\n  We don't need a commission. Why do we always have to have this deal \nwhere we punt it off to commissions where we can see no evil, hear no \nevil, speak no evil. They did it, not us. So let's see what we can do, \nand then maybe we will talk about a commission.\n  I said, ``Mr. President, please, please, show leadership and show \nsome courage in your budget. Show me that we can do it.'' And then he \nsent us his budget. We didn't trash it, cuss it, and throw it out into \nthe street and say it's dead on arrival. We weren't, obviously, happy \nwith it. I took over a day before I had much of anything to say. I \nactually read it and looked at the numbers, and I called him and I \nsaid, ``Mr. President, this is not what I hoped for. It is political \ncover.'' I understand. We have made it clear that we weren't going to \ngo through the exercise we went through last year. He was afraid, \nmaybe, to take political risks in sending up a budget that really would \nget us where we needed to go. He felt like, well, we will negotiate a \nreal result. But you can't have shell games and remove home health care \nfrom one part of Medicare over to the other, and say, gee, I just \nmagically saved $50 billion. You can't have triggers and lookbacks and \noptimistic assumptions and shove all the tough decisions off on the \nnext President. Two-thirds of what would be saved would occur after the \nyear 2000. No, it wasn't adequate, and I expressed my concern about it. \nBut I continue to say that, well, okay, I understand how that can \nhappen.\n  I am prepared to do my dead-level best to work with the Congress and \nwith the American people and the President to get a balanced budget \nagreement this year. But I am not going to be a part of a fraud and \nhold hands with the President, or anybody else, and say, this is it, we \ngot it done, unless it is real. So I think it puts additional pressure \non us to have the constitutional amendment. I have been here all these \nyears, in the House and in the Senate, and we have tried. Good men and \nwomen have said, yes, we can do this. Jimmy Carter said it; he meant to \ndo it. Ronald Reagan said it; he intended to do it. Congress has said \nwe are going to do it. We had the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings act to force us \nto do it with a sequestration, but it was a statute. It was only a \nstatute. Guess what happened. One by one, we removed all the hurdles, \nall the requirements that would have actually gotten us to a balanced \nbudget.\n  First, we said, oh, gee, we can't have it apply to this or to that \nprogram. I remember the negotiations. I was there. We said maybe not \nthis program,\n\n[[Page S1783]]\n\nmaybe not that program. We started off and we only exempted seven \nprograms. Then, one day, it was 21 programs. And in spite of already \nexempting 21 programs from an across-the-board cut of sequestration, as \nit was called, we got up to the ``lick log'' when we were going to \nactually have the programs cut across the board. Guess what Congress \ndid. Changed the date. They said, oh, gee, we will move it a year.\n  Congress will always find a way to avoid the tough decisions, unless \nit is in that revered document, the Constitution. So we have tried \nlaws, we have had good men and women in Congress and in the \nPresidencies saying we are to go do it, and we have not done it. It is \nnot easy. It takes courage, like I know the Senator from Connecticut \nhas. He would do what we need to do to encourage growth in the economy. \nHe would step up and cast the tough vote to control the growth in \nspending in some of these programs--all of these programs.\n  Everybody has to ante up and kick in. But I haven't seen it. I don't \nlike the idea of amending the Constitution. I voted to do it a few \ntimes, and probably if I could take back some of those votes, I would \ndo so. But this is not an insignificant thing. This is our children's \nfuture. I have a 29-year-old son, a young entrepreneur who is working \nhard. He employs 55 people. He sells pizzas. Today, I won't give the \nlabel of the pizza, but he is what the American dream is all about. He \nis out there working hard, making money, creating jobs, and paying a \nlot of taxes. He figured it out recently. He said, ``Dad, I am paying \nover 50 percent of everything I make in taxes.'' You know, that is \nterrible. It is terrible. A young, 29-year-old man, whose work hours \nusually are the toughest between 5 p.m. and 2 o'clock in the morning. \nHe is having 50 percent of it go to State, local, and Federal \nGovernments.\n  That is not the American way. I have a 26-year-old daughter, a young \nprofessional woman, who works hard and promotes our State of \nMississippi, promotes tourism. She does a great job. I am proud of her. \nBut I am saddling that son and daughter with an incredible burden, \nbecause I have not been able to help find a way to stop the deficit \nspending, to control the debt--yes, to reduce the debt of the country, \nand the $340 billion in interest on the national debt. Only Social \nSecurity exceeds the cost of interest on the national debt. If we don't \ndo something and do it now and do it tough, there will be over another \ntrillion dollars added to the debt by the year 2002.\n  So I think this is something that is worth amending the Constitution \nfor, because we are talking about the future of the country, the future \nof our economy, the future of our children and their children. If we \ndon't do it now, who will do it? When will it be done? So we should \namend the Constitution to require a balanced budget. And if we don't, \nthe American people will know truly that we are not serious about it \nwhen we say we want to balance the budget.\n\n  I have gone back and looked at the arguments over the years--even \nthis year--as to why we should not pass a constitutional amendment for \na balanced budget. There is no end to the things that have been \nsuggested. Some are absolutely hilarious, and some are purely \npolitical. Amendments have said basically that we should not do it \nuntil a Republican President submits the balanced budget, or maybe we \nshould say we should not do it until the Democratic President submits \nthe balanced budget. That is ridiculous. Then they said, well, it's \nbecause the escape hatch in times of recession or national emergency is \ntoo high--three-fifths. We should not have to have 60 votes. Just about \neverything we do around here takes 60 votes. Just about everything. And \nif it is easy to get out from under a balanced budget requirement, do \nyou think Congress won't take advantage of that? We are masters. We \nhave done it over and over and over again.\n  Capital budgeting has been talked about. Oh, they do it in the \nStates. Great. Let us take everything off the budget. Let's take out \nall the trust funds. I have been an advocate of that on occasion. But \nit is just a red herring.\n  Social Security. Oh, that is a good one. We can always rely on Social \nSecurity to scare the bejeebers out of folks. So that is a great cover. \nOh, yes, if we don't find some special way to deal with the Social \nSecurity requirement, oh, this would destroy the system. My mother, 83 \nyears old, bless her heart, counts on Social Security. She knows I am \nnot going to do anything to endanger that for her. I would not do that. \nIf we don't do that, that is what will endanger Social Security.\n  I could go on. I will speak again next Tuesday to try to help put \nthis thing in a proper perspective from the beginning to the end with a \nquote from Thomas Jefferson and some modern quotes about why we need to \ndo this and why we should have done it. I wanted to take a few minutes \nthis morning to say to the American people that it is up to them. If \nthey really want this, a way will be found to get one more vote--just \none more vote. Is it a Senator from Nevada or South Carolina? Maybe it \nis a Senator from South Dakota, or maybe even New Jersey. Somewhere, \nthere will be a Senator who will say: This does matter, and I am going \nto make the difference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n10 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1782-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1783-S1785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ANTHONY LAKE\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I rise this morning \nto discuss the status of the President's nomination of Anthony Lake--\nTony Lake--to be the Director of Central Intelligence.\n  Mr. President, I read from the New York Times this morning, which \nreports in its lead story, ``Leaders in the Senate demand FBI files on \nCIA nominee.'' I quote from the lead paragraph:\n\n       Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said today \n     that unless he received all of the FBI files on Anthony Lake, \n     he would not hold confirmation hearings for Mr. Lake.\n\n  Later, in that same story, the author says:\n\n       It is reported that two senior Republican members of the \n     committee, Senators Lugar and Chafee, said today they would \n     probably vote for Mr. Lake, barring some devastating \n     disclosure at the confirmation hearings.\n  Senator Lugar, our distinguished colleague and friend from Indiana, \nsays that he strongly disagrees with the demand for the opening of \nthese files and the delay of the hearing. According to Senator Lugar, \n``The whole confirmation process becomes more and more outrageous. \nPeople feel it is their duty to engage in character assassination or to \ncause the nominee's defeat, or to discourage and demoralize them. The \nFBI files are raw files,'' Mr. Lugar said. ``They may contain rumor, \ngossip, hearsay, or innuendo. They may be true, they may be false, they \nmay be scandalously defamatory, but they should not be the basis of \nevaluating someone's character.''\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor to appeal to the leadership of the \nIntelligence Committee to move forward with the hearing on March 11 and \nto treat this nominee fairly, because the process is becoming unfair. \nEvery time a hurdle is erected for Mr. Lake and he jumps over it, \nanother one seems to be erected in its place. Continuing with the \nsports analogy, every time Tony Lake moves the ball toward the goal \nline, the goal line is pushed back. And the process is beginning to \nlook more like a fishing expedition than like a process of \ncongressional evaluation of a Presidential nominee--one who has served \nhis country with distinction over the course of many years--that is \nfair and proceeding expeditiously and with a sense of due process.\n  Mr. President, in speaking about Tony Lake's nomination, I think it \nis important that I share my belief of what our role is when we advise \nand consent here in this Senate to nominations of the President. I \nfaced this question early in my time here, in 1989, on several \noccasions regarding the nominations of President Bush. I supported \nalmost all of them. It seemed to me then, as it does now, that our role \nhere is not to substitute ourselves for the President. The President is \nelected to make these nominations. I decided that the standard I would \nimpose is not whether I would have nominated this individual. That is \nwhat Presidents are elected for. The Senate's role is to advise and \nconsent. I think that means the standard we should follow is to \ndetermine whether the President's nominee is within the acceptable \nrange for\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\nthe particular job for which that person is nominated, not whether we \nwould have nominated that person.\n  Mr. President, on that standard, it seems to me that Tony Lake more \nthan meets the qualifications for being a superb Director of Central \nIntelligence at a very, very critical time for the intelligence \ncommunity in the history of our Nation.\n  As I indicated a few moments ago, Mr. Lake has served our country in \nvarious capacities with great honor over many years. He has been a \nstudent of government and a teacher of government in universities, and \nreturned to government again to serve for the last 4 years with dignity \nand, I think, great effect as the National Security Adviser.\n  What standards do we hold up for this particular nomination? I am \npleased to be able to find a good source to rely on. That is an article \nwritten by Robert Gates, CIA Director under President Bush, published \nin the Wall Street Journal on January 29 of this year. Bob Gates held \nup three standards for judging a nominee for Director of Central \nIntelligence.\n  No. 1, is that person recognized as a man of integrity and principle, \na man prepared to stand up for what he believes is right?\n  No. 2, is that person knowledgeable about foreign affairs?\n  No. 3, does that person have the confidence of the President and know \nwell the rest of the President's national security team?\n  On all three counts, Bob Gates, a distinguished public servant with \nan excellent record of service to our country, found Tony Lake \nqualified with a lot to spare.\n  I quote from that article in the Wall Street Journal. First, Bob \nGates says, Tony Lake is ``broadly recognized as a man of integrity and \nprinciple, and as a man with courage to stand up for what he believes \nis right. This offers reassurance that he will be independent of the \nWhite House in which he served and will be directed by a moral \ngrounding most Americans would find admirable.''\n\n  It is hard to convey this in a few moments on the floor. But I have \nknown Tony Lake for a number of years. And I do not agree with \neverything he has ever done in his career. But, believe me, this is a \nperson who has always been animated by a desire to do the right thing \nfor his country. And that is why Bob Gates says accurately that Tony \nLake ``* * * will be directed by a moral grounding most Americans would \nfind admirable.''\n  Second, whether or not one agrees with him on the issues, he is \nthoroughly knowledgeable about foreign affairs. That is self-evident \nbased on the enormously successful record he has made over the last 4 \nyears sitting at the center of America's foreign policy during a \ndifficult time, and one in which I think most observers agree has seen \nAmerica remain strong and recognized as not only the one superpower in \nthe world but a superpower that has used its power effectively and \nethically and morally.\n  Third, does he have the confidence of the President? I suppose that \nis self-evident since the President appointed him. He does. And, of \ncourse, he knows the rest of the people that comprise the national \nsecurity team in this administration. That is important, not just for \nmatters of friendship, but because the intelligence functions should be \nat the heart of our foreign policy. Because of the personal relations \nTony Lake has with the President, the Vice President and others in a \nforeign policy apparatus of this Government, he will bring intelligence \nto the center of their deliberations, where it clearly belongs.\n  I have said that in this process of evaluating Tony Lake's \nnomination, at every point where a hurdle was established he jumped \nover it, and then more hurdles were erected. Some of these questions \nhave been fair. The questions about how he handled stock holdings were \nexamined by the appropriate oversight bodies and he was cleared. And I \nhave some personal knowledge on questions about how he handled the \nshipment of arms from Islamic countries through Croatia to Bosnia \nbecause, along with the former majority leader, Senator Dole, and other \ndistinguished colleagues here, I worked for a long time to lift the \narms embargo against the Bosnians.\n  The question was, did Tony Lake do anything in response to messages \nfrom our Ambassador to Croatia indicating that the Croatians were \nwondering how we would react to shipments of arms across this country \nto Bosnia? Tony Lake responded that there were no instructions. Some \ncritics have seemed to suggest that there was a point in these \ndeliberations where, although Tony Lake clearly said there were no \ninstructions, somehow his body language conveyed a different message. \nNow, if we are getting to the point where we are beginning to question \nthe capacity of people to be Directors of Central Intelligence because \nof their body language, we are heading down a very unusual road.\n  I think questions about this incident have been well handled. Not \nonly was the no-instructions policy not covert, but it was not an \naction within the meaning of relevant statute. And, in my personal \nopinion, because our European allies were taking a position against \nlifting the arms embargo and letting these poor Bosnians defend \nthemselves, I think Tony Lake's decision to give no instructions \nsuccessfully resolved a very difficult situation and was the absolutely \nmoral decision to make.\n  OK, so he jumped those two hurdles. But now, as the process goes on, \nit seems that every accusation made against the White House, that every \nquestion of criticism about foreign policy, is being put on his desk. \nHe is being held up to a standard that is impossible to meet and \nfundamentally unfair. One day, somebody says, we will have to ask him \nquestions about the administration's policy on Haiti. Another says that \nwe have to check to make sure he had no involvement in any of the \npolitical fundraising going on in the White House. He seems to have \nkept himself very, very far from all of that.\n  Now, there is the question of the FBI report. Knowing Tony Lake as I \ndo, knowing his desire to cooperate with this Congress, I agree with \nSenator Robert Kerrey, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, when he says in the newspaper today that Tony will try to \nwork out some agreement by which the members of the Intelligence \nCommittee can see the FBI report. In some substantial sense, I regret \nthat. Senator Kerrey has seen the report in full. I asked him for his \njudgment. I trust him totally. He said that there was nothing he saw in \nthat report which would alter his decision to enthusiastically support \nTony Lake's nomination.\n  So I appeal to the leadership of the Senate Intelligence Committee. \nThe Senator from Alabama, the chairman, is a good friend and an \nhonorable, standup individual.\n  I understand that some people may oppose this nomination, but, \nplease, go ahead with that hearing on March 11. Let the man have his \nday. Ask him the tough questions. Then let the matter go to a vote in \nthat committee. Bring it out to the floor. We can debate it out here. \nLet us vote on it. But let us not subject this fine man, this great \npublic servant, this patriot to a kind of water torture where we keep \ndripping water on his head and do not treat him with the respect and \ndignity that he and the agency that he is nominated here by the \nPresident of the United States to lead both deserve.\n  Mr. President, Senator John McCain, distinguished colleague and \nfriend from Arizona, usually a pretty good guide to what is right \naround here--I say usually because he has a few gaps in logic with \nregard to the submarine construction program, but I leave those aside \nfor now--sent a letter to all of us on January 29 in which he said:\n\n       I support the nomination of Tony Lake to be the next \n     Director of Central Intelligence and will introduce him to \n     the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence when it holds \n     hearings on this issue. I have worked frequently with Tony \n     Lake over the years, and I agree with Bob Gates--\n\n  Referring to the earlier article I mentioned--\n\n     that he is a knowledgeable man of principle and integrity who \n     can be expected to work well with other members of the \n     President's national security team and with Congress.\n\n  End of the quote from the Senator from Arizona, the Honorable John \nMcCain.\n  Mr. President, let me just add this one word about the intelligence \ncommunity. I just do not think it is in the interest of the \nintelligence community\n\n[[Page S1785]]\n\nor the country to permit Tony Lake's nomination to be unfairly delayed \nor to get mired in partisan politics. This nomination should be judged \non its merits. That is all the nominee, that is all the Commander in \nChief, that is all any of us who support him are asking. Delay and \npolitical warfare risks doing serious damage not only to Tony Lake's \nhonor and good name but also to an agency that has traditionally \nenjoyed and still fundamentally and seriously deserves bipartisan \nsupport. The CIA and the intelligence community are at a crossroads. \nThey need a principled and strong leader now, and that man is Tony \nLake.\n  Mr. President, at the end of the column he wrote for the Wall Street \nJournal, Bob Gates summed it up very well, and I quote finally from \nthat article. Bob Gates says:\n\n       As the last CIA Director, nominated by a Republican \n     President and confirmed by a Democratic controlled Senate, I \n     strongly believe that hard questions should be asked of Mr. \n     Lake and then he should be confirmed expeditiously with broad \n     bipartisan support. This would be in the best interests of \n     the country and of the intelligence community.\n\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The Senator from West Virginia \nis recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, first I wish to thank the distinguished \nSenator, Mr. Craig Thomas, for his consideration in allowing me to go \nahead of him. He has been patiently waiting in the Chamber to be \nrecognized, but he has generously acceded to my request that I be \npermitted to proceed in that I have an important appointment to meet. I \nwill be very brief.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1783-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1785]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WAIVING DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I commend the President of the Republic of \nGeorgia, Mr. Eduard Shevardnadze, for the unusual but very appropriate \naction that he has recently taken regarding the actions of one of his \nnation's diplomats in Washington.\n  As has been widely reported, President Shevardnadze broke with \nlongstanding international precedent and waived diplomatic immunity \nfrom prosecution in the case of a Georgian diplomat who was arrested \nfor a particularly outrageous incident of drunken driving, resulting in \na high-speed crash and the death of a 16-year-old girl.\n  Diplomats have a special responsibility for representing their \ncountries in all manner of civil societies and all manner of \ngovernmental regimes. To prevent their being subject to harassment, \npunishment or other actions which would interfere with their \nrepresentational functions, immunity from prosecution has been a time-\nhonored protection.\n  Now, we have to think of our own diplomats, those who represent the \nAmerican Government who are abroad in countries that do not have the \ndue process principles for which our country is noted and working under \nthe Constitution which we have and which protects citizens.\n  Mr. President, somebody ought to call attention to this, and it just \nseems to me that more of us ought to take notice when something like \nthis happens. And we should not only speak out against the heinous \ncrime that was committed but also we should compliment the head of the \nforeign government that exercises and demonstrates high purpose and \nresponsibility in a situation such as this.\n  However, diplomats also have a special responsibility for exemplary \npersonal behavior, given their favored status. The tradition of \nimmunity is not a license to behave in any but the most commendable \nmanner. Immunity was not designed to protect loose living, risk taking \nor unlawful activities. Therefore, the action by President Shevardnadze \nin removing diplomatic immunity so that his diplomatic representative \ncan stand trial for his outrageous behavior does not erode the \ntraditional protection of diplomats but, rather, reinforces the need \nfor diplomats to act properly and lawfully.\n  I hope our own diplomats abroad would act properly and lawfully. I \ncould not condone any action that was not proper and lawful, and our \ngovernment should not condone it on the part of our own diplomats.\n  President Shevardnadze is a highly respected leader in a very \ndifficult part of the world. The Caucasian states of the Caspian region \nhave been subjected to continuous, sometimes very heavy-handed pressure \nfrom the former Russian overlords who resent their independent, \nsovereign status as new nation-states. Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia \nall fall into this category. The leaders of these nations have upheld \ntheir independence under great pressure. We have to commend them for \ndemonstrating that kind of courage. They have good independent \njudgment, and they deserve the support of the United States. The action \nof waiving immunity in this flagrant, flagrant case that I have \nreferred to is a good example of the sound independent judgment of \nPresident Shevardnadze, and I highly commend him and am proud to stand \non the floor of the Senate today to recognize the wisdom he has shown \nand the courage he has demonstrated.\n  Mr. President, I thank my friend, Senator Thomas, again, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nWyoming is recognized to speak for up to 30 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1785-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1785-S1787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MEDICARE PAYMENT EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will not, myself, use 30 minutes.\n  I rise today to talk about a bill we introduced this week, introduced \nthe day before yesterday, along with several of my friends from rural \nareas, including the Presiding Officer and Mr. Grams, who joins me, the \nSenator from Minnesota. We will talk a little bit about the Medicare \nPayment Equity Act.\n  I come from a place called Wapiti, WY. It is actually a post office \nbetween Cody and Yellowstone Park. This is a rural area. So, the unique \nproblems of rural medicine are near and dear to my heart.\n  We have in the Senate what is called a rural health caucus which, \nactually, 77 Senators have shown an interest in. I do recall the rural \nhealth group in the House, as well, which was very active and, as a \nmatter of fact, the Senator from Kansas, now presiding, was cochairman \nof that group.\n  So, we have a bill that deals with rural health care. And there are \nunique problems in rural health care. Other sponsors include Senator \nBurns from Montana, Senator Grassley from Iowa, and Senator Kempthorne \nfrom Idaho.\n  Basically, it is a question of fairness. All Americans pay the same \nrate into the payroll tax for Medicare, and I believe, as I think all \nwould believe that each, then, deserves the same kind of health care \nand the same kind of health care choices, the same kinds of services \nfor having paid that. But that is not the case. The payments for \nMedicare, managed care within Medicare, are greatly different \nthroughout the country. They are greatly different largely because they \nwere put into place, as a matter of history, as a matter of utilization \nin the fee-for-service area. So they vary a great deal.\n  This chart will give some idea of what they are. Remember, each of \nthese folks who receives these benefits has paid in similarly. However, \nthe payments for managed care in Medicare, in Arthur, NE, are $221 a \nmonth. On the other hand, in Richmond County, NY, $767 a month. You can \nsee the changes that exist here, and they are basically the highly \nutilized areas, the Floridas, the New Yorks and others who, in history \nof payments, have had high utilization so have a history of higher \npayments. The costs are not necessarily the same, but they are not that \nmuch different. What has happened is these risk contracts have \nbasically been set on history and give enough additional services to \ntake up that additional dollar. Not only do they get more money but \nthey get more services.\n  Here, in Blue Earth County, MN, the yearly payment is $600. Portland, \nOR, had $500; the beneficiary has to pay additional money, as is shown \nin the yellow. However, in Dade County, in Florida, the payment is \n$8,200 dollars a year. Not only do they get the additional payment, \nthey have unlimited prescription drugs, a $700 credit for hearing aids, \nand have a great deal of additional benefits. Remember, all of them pay \nthe same into the program.\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\n So what we have is a bill that would, over time, tend to equalize or \nat least levelize these kinds of payments.\n  There are cost differences. The costs in New York City for rent and \nother kinds of things are higher than they are in Greybull, WY. We are \nwilling to take that into account. However, expertise, medicines, and \nother kinds of things are just as valuable in Kansas as they are in \nFlorida.\n  So, what we propose to do and what this bill does is, rather than to \ncontinue this kind of reimbursement that is so out of place, it would \ngradually bring into account not only the costs that differentiate, but \nalso a national average, intending to level these out. We do not \npropose to reduce the costs that are in place in the higher levels but \nwe do propose to lift the increases, bring the increases up in the \nbottom levels so Wyoming providers will have an opportunity to compete, \nto provide these kinds of care.\n\n  The other effect, in addition to not getting the kinds of services \nthat are available through this inequity, is that users, seniors in \nMedicare who would like to have the option of managed care, really do \nnot have it in rural areas because it has not come, due to the \npayments. For example, where is there growth in managed care and \nMedicare? Only 3.6 percent in rural areas have an opportunity for this. \nOn the other hand, it is over 70 percent where the benefits are high, \nin the larger areas.\n  So, our proposal is to equalize, at least move to equalize these \npayments, to move to equalize these benefits to reflect the fact that \neveryone pays the same and that there ought to be some equity with \nrespect to the benefits that are provided. It is a fairness bill. It is \none we have talked about before and, indeed, was part of the omnibus \nbill last year which was vetoed by the President.\n  So we come back with it singled out to show that there is a problem, \nthere is an inequity, there is an unfairness between rural and more \npopulated areas. This bill, the Rural Medicare Payment Equity Act, will \nmove to remove that inequity from Medicare and managed Medicare to all \nseniors of this country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I am also pleased to be here this morning \nand to join with my colleagues in introducing the Medicare Payment \nEquity Act, as the Senator from Wyoming has just outlined. The passage \nof this legislation, I believe, is critical in righting the wrongs in \nthe Medicare system against States like Minnesota, Kansas, Wyoming, and \nsome of the other more rural States in the country.\n  There are three points I would like to emphasize, just to add to what \nthe Senator from Wyoming has already said. First, again, to reiterate, \nthe Medicare reimbursement formula is just plain unfair. While every \nAmerican pays the same payroll tax to the Medicare trust fund, \nMinnesotans find themselves with the second-lowest reimbursement rates \nin the Nation. By the way, every county in Minnesota falls below the \nnational average in the terms of Medicare reimbursement.\n  Second, the Medicare reimbursement formula discourages quality health \ncare. My State of Minnesota has been consistently recognized throughout \nthe Nation as one of the most innovative, one of the most efficient and \ncost-conscious States in the terms of health care. Yet these very same \nqualities, the traits which should be encouraged, not discouraged, have \nskewed the Medicare formula against our providers and also against our \nbeneficiaries.\n  Finally, the Medicare reimbursement formula discriminates against \nsenior citizens who live in rural areas of America. These older \nAmericans already face fewer health care options than those who live in \nurban centers. That is due to the lower reimbursement rates received by \nhealth plans. However, there is no incentive for them to offer managed \ncare services. So that means fewer choices for the senior citizens who \nare living in rural parts of the United States.\n  So, Mr. President, the system needs to be changed and that is exactly \nwhat our legislation does. By making fundamental corrections to the \nMedicare reimbursement formula, this bill will restore equity, it will \nhelp to expand access, and will also help to ensure a greater array of \nhealth care choices to beneficiaries in States like Minnesota as well \nas across rural America. It will change the system, and I am very proud \nto join my colleagues in introducing this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Again, I am pleased to be here to join my colleagues again in \nreintroducing and supporting the Medicare Payment Equity Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today, as was indicated by my \ncolleagues, Senator Thomas and Senator Grams, to speak to the Medicare \nPayment Equity Act of 1997. Like my colleagues have indicated, this \nlegislation will hopefully end the longstanding unfairness that denies \nthe Medicare beneficiary in rural counties the same services and \nbenefits that their urban peers receive. As has been indicated by both \nof my colleagues, all Americans, whether they live in the city or \nwhether they live in the country, pay the same 2.9 percent of payroll \nto the Medicare trust fund all during their working lives. All \nAmericans who choose Medicare part B pay the same monthly premium, but \nthat is where the similarities stop.\n  Based on the geographic area where seniors choose to retire, they \nreceive vastly different choices and benefits. Seniors living in New \nYork City or in Miami, as has been indicated by my colleagues, are \noffered more options to the Medicare system than almost all of Kansas' \n400,000 seniors who rely on Medicare. Many of these plans have no \nadditional premiums, and they may include extra benefits, such as \nprescription drug coverage or hearing aids or eyeglasses, just to name \na few.\n  Let me demonstrate what I am talking about. When a Kansas senior \ncitizen visits a relative in Miami or New York or Phoenix or some other \nmetropolitan area and talks to his brother, his cousin or any relative \nand learns that they receive, under their managed care plan under \nMedicare, free eyeglasses, free prescription drugs, even exercise \nlessons, of course, then that senior citizen goes back to Kansas or \nWyoming or Minnesota, or any other rural area, and they do not have \nthat opportunity. Yet, they pay the same amount.\n  Why does this happen? The difference is really due to the payment \nformula used to finance the managed care plans under Medicare. I am \ngoing to quarrel a little bit with the description of managed care. I \nknow that has a connotation in some areas, quite frankly, as rationing \nhealth care. I know that is harsh. Why don't we use the term \n``physician service network''? The acronym--everything has to have an \nacronym in Washington--is PSN. It allows the local hospitals, local \ndoctors, local administrators and the boards to join together, which \nthey are already doing, and offer, yes, a managed care plan, but it is \na physician service network.\n  We have something like that in Kansas in Salina where about 13 \nhospitals have joined together under something called ``the sunflower \nnetwork.'' We hope and we think that if we can offer that option to our \nseniors, we can hold the Medicare costs down, but we can bring them \nbetter delivery. It is a voluntary plan, it is not mandatory, and \ncertainly we think that is part of the overall Medicare reform plan.\n  Basically, under the current system, Medicare rewards any \nbeneficiaries who live in an inefficient medical market and punishes \nthose who participate in health plans that operate in efficient \nmarkets.\n  Medicare pays these health plans a capitation payment based on \nregional fee-for-service costs. This payment is known as the adjusted \naverage per capita costs--here is another acronym--AAPCC rate. That is \nextremely important in regards to the health care field.\n  The variation in the AAPCC rate is extreme. As has been indicated by \nmy\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\ncolleagues, for example, the AAPCC rate in Richmond, NY, is $767 per \nMedicare beneficiary, while the AAPCC rate for my constituents in \nRepublic County, KS--Belleville is the county seat--there it is only \n$265. This county is almost the lowest paid county in the United \nStates. In fact, 93 percent of all counties in Kansas are at or below \nthe national average of $467.\n  Clearly, there are cost factors that account for some of this \ndifference, but as Senator Thomas has pointed out, a difference of over \n$500 is simply unexplainable. This legislation really does address this \nissue by creating a new payment formula for managed care plans. \nSpecifically, our bill establishes a minimum payment for rural counties \nof 80 percent of the national input price adjusted capitation rate. \nThis will ensure all payments, even those in rural counties, will cover \nthe comprehensive benefits.\n  This legislation also includes an aggressive blend of national and \nlocal rates that will raise the lower payment areas closer to the \naverage, while taking into account actual input cost differences that \nexist from one region to another. This rate, which is based on an \naverage of 3 years of past data, will smooth the payments and reduce \nall of the volatility price differences. It is a transition.\n  Finally, this legislation excludes the disproportionate share of \npayments and graduate medical education funds from the calculations of \nthe formula.\n  Mr. President, this inequity must stop. Until we end this inequity, \nMedicare beneficiaries will not have the choices they deserve. We will \nnot control the Medicare costs that in some areas are out of control. \nHospitals and doctors will not have the tools they need to compete in \ntoday's physician service network markets, and Medicare will continue \nto overpay health plans in inefficient markets.\n  I want to add one other thing, lest people misunderstand. This is not \nan either/or choice. Senator Thomas, Senator Grams, myself, and Senator \nBurns are not trying to take away anything from Dade County, FL, or New \nYork or any other urban area. Under our formula, the premiums will \nincrease by 2 percent. That is not the idea here. We are merely trying \nto equalize this on a transition basis.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of the Medicare Payment \nEquity Act. That is precisely what it is.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, is the Senate under any time rules?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are in morning business, with 5 minutes per \nSenator.\n  Mr. GORTON. I ask unanimous consent I might be permitted to speak for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the long and often thoughtful debate over \nthe balanced budget amendment is now drawing to a close. It is also \napparently drawing to a regrettable unsuccessful end unless a sudden \nflash of enlightenment takes over the minds and hearts of one or more \nof the opponents to this amendment.\n  Nevertheless, I believe it appropriate for every Member of this body \nto state his or her reasons for support or for opposition to the \namendment. While I have done so in part, at least in the past, I should \nlike to share with my colleagues some of my thoughts on the subject.\n  Mr. President, from my perspective, perhaps the single most important \nreason for voting in favor of this constitutional amendment, for \nincluding a requirement making it considerably more difficult to spend \nmoney that we do not have, is a moral or ethical one.\n  Mr. President, we living today, representing the people of our States \ntoday, simply do not have the right to spend money to undertake \nobligations which we collectively are unwilling to pay for, thereby \nconsuming whatever goods or services Government provides to us today \nand sending the bills to our children and to our grandchildren. Mr. \nPresident, that is simply the wrong thing to do. We should not engage \nin that practice at all, and it is a simple disgrace that we have now \nengaged in it in each and every year for almost three decades.\n  Now, I am aware of, and I subscribe to, the positive economic impacts \nof balancing our budget. It is clear to me, as it is to most, that it \nwill mean lower interest rates which, in turn, make it easier for young \npeople--for all of our people--to purchase a home, an automobile, a \ncollege or university education. At the same time, a balanced budget \nprovides more economic growth and, thus, greater opportunities, again, \nfor all of us, but particularly for generations just moving into the \nwork force. These are important arguments. These are goals that we all \nought to see. But I believe that the balanced budget amendment would be \nimperative even if we were not able to prove in our own minds the \neconomic benefits of the amendment. For the reasons that I have just \nstated, it is wrong for us to spend the debt and to send the bills to \nthose who are not represented here, who, Mr. President, in most cases, \nhave not yet been born.\n  In this long and leisurely and thoughtful debate, we have been given \ndozens of reasons not to pass the amendment. Dozens of scarecrows have \nbeen raised: We can't respond to a military emergency that does not \ninvolve a declaration of war. We can't respond to a physical disaster. \nWe can't build our infrastructure. Social Security, or some other \nprogram, may be hurt by a balanced budget constitutional amendment.\n  Mr. President, first, as someone interested in the history of our \ncountry, I am reminded by the recitation of these objections to nothing \nso much as the case against adopting the Constitution in the first \nplace in 1787 and 1788. These arguments stem, just as did those \narguments more than two centuries ago, from a fear of the unknown. But, \nMr. President, those fears must be weighed against the actual, tangible \nhistory of the last half century. And that actual, tangible history \nshows us that, regrettably, we do not, without some constitutional \nconstraints, balance our budget. In fact, in my mind, each one of those \nthreats is more likely to become reality if we don't balance the budget \nthan if we do.\n  A balanced budget will provide a far stronger economy for the support \nof Social Security, a far stronger framework for the building of our \ninfrastructure, and a far stronger structure within which we can \nprovide for the education for our young people than does the present \nsystem, which threatens all of these things by the accumulated burden \nof the debt, added to each year by the amount of its annual deficit. So \nthe very threats that are causing Members to vote against this \nconstitutional amendment are more likely to come true if they are \nsuccessful than if they are not.\n  Mr. President, this may well be the most important single vote that \nwe cast during the course of this Congress. It is our duty, whether the \nconstitutional amendment passes or not, to produce for the people of \nthis country, for our colleagues, a budget which is balanced in fact. \nAnd it is clearly possible--though history gives very little cause for \noptimism--that we may do so in the absence of this amendment. At least \nthis debate has led to lip service on the part of the President of the \nUnited States and almost every Member of this Congress to the \nproposition that we should do so. But to see to it that not only we do \nso, but that our successors do so, that we break the mold of the \nhistory of the last decades, the passage of this amendment is \nabsolutely essential.\n  I am pleased that all of my colleagues on this side of the aisle plan \nto vote in favor of the constitutional amendment. I hope that a sudden \nflash of enlightenment on the other side of the aisle will help us to \nget the necessary 67 votes.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today, as I have in months gone by, \nto talk about some of the good things that are happening in Government. \nWe tend to dwell--because of the negative perception that the press \nthrows on almost everything that is done here in Washington--on things \nthat the Government is involved in that are not good. There are things \nwe do that are good, however, and I want to talk about some of those \nthings. I want to do this, Mr. President, in an effort to stem the tide \nof negativity that has engulfed the perception many Americans have \nabout their Government. Strident skepticism about our Government seems \nto rule the day. I worry about the harm it will do to our country in \nthe long term.\n  A recent survey of 1,000 registered voters found that about 63 \npercent of them did not want their children to be President. This is in \nstark contrast to what it was 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago. \nIf this is the case, where will we find the leaders for future \ngenerations?\n  There are, in fact, as I have already indicated, many Government \nefforts and agencies that serve this country well. Last summer I spoke \non this floor about the National Park Service, which began in the early \npart of this century as an idea of President Theodore Roosevelt. The \nNational Park Service has worked to preserve and protect the remarkable \nlands that we call our national parks.\n  Since Congress established the National Park Service, this agency has \ncared for these natural wonders. Today, about 80 years after the \nNational Park Service was formed, 270 million people will visit our \nNational Park System.\n  I am very proud that the most heavily visited entity in our entire \nNational Park System is in Nevada. The Lake Mead recreational area has \nover 10 million visitors every year. Because of the hard work of the \nPark Service, these national treasures will be available for all \nAmericans to enjoy for generations to come.\n  Another worthwhile Federal agency about which I have spoken is the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission. This is a very small agency, but \nvery effective agency, and it has jurisdiction over more than 15,000 \ndifferent products. It maintains a constant vigil to seek out and \neliminate harm to the American consumer. For example, after a baby's \ndeath resulting from a faulty playpen right here in the District of \nColumbia, the Consumer Product Safety Commission responded quickly by \nremoving these playpens from stores and issued a nationwide alert to \nall consumers.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission most recently made news by \nrecalling popular fleece clothing because it was found to be \ndangerously flammable. At one time, we had a similar problem with \nchildren's pajamas catching on fire. Because of the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission, we now have flame-retardant pajamas for our \nchildren.\n  From investigating reports about unsafe products to protecting our \nchildren from lead poisoning on playgrounds, the Consumer Product \nSafety Commission has proven, in my opinion, to be an indispensable and \nbeneficial Government agency.\n  Every summer wildfires sweep the Western part of the United States. \nAbout 25,000 brave men and women fight those fires. These self-\nsacrificing and hard-working firefighters are coordinated through the \nNational Interagency Fire Center, which is a joint project of the \nForest Service and the Bureau of Land Management. These people put \ntheir lives on the line. Hundreds of these men and women parachute out \nof the back of airplanes with backpacks weighing almost 100 pounds. We \nhave hundreds more who propel off helicopters into harm's way in order \nto save life, property, and our great natural resources.\n  We should be proud of this work done by the Federal Government. When \nwild fires race across our forests and fields, and the flames threaten \nour communities, these brave firefighters risk their lives to keep us \nsafe.\n  Today, I want to take the time to recognize the good work of another \nGovernment Agency that takes care of us when we suffer calamities. That \nis the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. Mr. President, \nwhen I was in the other body, one of the committees I served on had \njurisdiction over authorizing what FEMA did. In those days, more than a \ndecade ago, FEMA got a lot of bad publicity. They have made remarkable \nimprovements. This organization is one of the best examples of how \nGovernment truly works for Americans.\n  In late December and early January, northern Nevada experienced the \nworst floods in the history of our State. We do not have many rivers in \nNevada, but three tiny rivers in northern Nevada--the Truckee, Carson, \nand Walker Rivers-- became raging torrents, washing away people, \nanimals, and property. While most of America was enjoying the New \nYear's holiday, we in Nevada were besieged by the ``Flood of 1997,'' as \nwere a number of other Western States. When northern Nevadans were \nconfronted with this devastating damage, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency quickly responded to the short-term and long-term \nneeds of residents and businesses. With FEMA's help, Nevada is not only \nrebuilding, but we are well on the road to recovery.\n  FEMA has been tremendous. They called on their reserves and utilized \ntheir experts to assist with our devastating farm losses. They were \neven able to bring in people that could deal with the losses we had to \ntourism.\n  FEMA is an agency that is used to handling water damage. About 80 \npercent of the emergencies they deal with in the United States deal \nwith water damage and floods. They are truly experts at this.\n  FEMA was established as an independent agency in 1979 when \nits original purpose was to deal with nuclear attack. That is no longer \nthe case. While the Agency once operated within a narrow mandate, it \nhas since been expanded to handle disasters generally.\n\n  Mr. President, this is an agency that recognizes that people who are \nhit by floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and other national disasters \nare Republicans, Democrats, and independents. This is an agency that \nmust act on a bipartisan basis. And I think they have done a good job \nof doing that.\n  Due to the present Director, James Lee Witt, who visited Nevada \nduring the flood disaster, FEMA has become an example of good \ngovernment. For example, in an effort to streamline and reduce costs, \nFEMA has closed a number of field offices and has drafted a plan to \nreduce its internal regulations, which we all dislike, by more than 50 \npercent. It has become a cost-effective agency which has developed an \ninnovative, customer-oriented approach to government. Most notably, \nfrom the very first sign of disaster, FEMA works in partnership with \nState and local governments, as well as businesses and private \nagencies. I can testify to this, as it is precisely what happened in \nNevada. FEMA does not act like some type of monolithic big brother \ntrying to supersede all local efforts. Everything they do is in \npartnership with local government. They also deal with business \nconcerns. When the New Year's flood struck, FEMA was on the ground \nwithin hours to begin the coordination of relief efforts in Nevada. In \nconjunction with local officials, FEMA conducted preliminary damage \nassessments. They did not do it on their own. They did it with local \nofficials. Based on FEMA's initial findings, the President declared 6 \nof our 17 counties disaster areas, and one major city in Nevada as a \ndisaster area. After the declaration, FEMA began some more good work \ncoordinating numerous assistance efforts in the State.\n  In a disaster, FEMA becomes the central point of contact for a wide \nrange of emergency responses, including planning, mitigation, and \nrecovery. Aid offered by the Agency ranges from low-interest loans, \neven cash grants, to advice on how to mitigate damage from future \ndisasters.\n  FEMA's basic disaster recovery assistance falls into three main \ncategories. No. 1 is human services, or individual assistance, which \nprovides aid to individuals, family, and business owners. No. 2 is \ninfrastructure and public assistance, which helps State and local \ngovernments pay for emergency services and repair damages to facilities \nsuch as roads, bridges, buildings, and utilities.\n  During the flood, when it was still raging, I went into an area \noutside of\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\nour capital, Carson City, to meet with county commissioners. One of the \nbig problems we had with the Carson River, which is a wild river with \nno dams, was with a levy that had been washed away. This levy had been \nthere for as long as anyone could remember, but no one claimed \nownership of it. It did not belong to the county. It did not belong to \nthe State. The farmers did not claim it, and neither did the Indians. \nIt was essential, however, that levy be reconstructed. So the county \nsaid, ``We will take responsibility.'' As soon as they did that, FEMA \nwas there to begin work on how to reconstruct the levy, which is so \nessential to prevent damage from Nevada's spring thaws.\n  The third disaster assistance category is hazard mitigation \nassistance, which provides funding for reducing future losses in \ndisaster areas. We have an area along the Truckee River where FEMA is \nconsidering buying all of the land. It is likely that this area will \nsuffer another flood, so why should we continue to put those residents \nin harms way? The homes should not have been built there, and FEMA's \nefforts to buy this land is a fundamental part of hazard mitigation \nassistance.\n  Additionally, one of the first things FEMA does in an afflicted \ncommunity is activate what they call the National Teleregistration \nCenter. This sounds like a fancy name, but it is basically a telephone \nbank which begins taking applications for assistance within hours of \nthe President's declaration. In Nevada, we have had over 3,000 people \nregister for assistance by using this telephone number. Moreover, as of \njust a few days ago, FEMA had issued millions of dollars in housing \nchecks to Nevadans; approved nearly a half a million dollars in \nindividual and family grants in Nevada; obligated almost $5 million in \npublic assistance grants to repair and restore Nevada public \nfacilities; and issued $15,000 in disaster unemployment assistance to \nNevada residents left jobless.\n\n  One reason FEMA works so well in a partnership with local governments \nis because, when there is a disaster, they do not come in and say we \nare going to take care of everything. The reason cooperation is coming \nfrom State and local governments is because they are required to come \nup with 25 percent of the costs of these repairs.\n  Amidst all the chaos of this devastating flood, FEMA was a source of \nhope, assistance, and relief. In time of disaster, when communities are \nreeling from devastation caused by nature or humans, it is vital than \nan emergency management infrastructure is ready to respond immediately. \nFEMA works in cooperation with States and nonprofits to pick up where \ntheir efforts left off. This efficient Federal Agency also works to \ncover what residents' insurance does not.\n  Since the potential for flooding in some areas is still extreme, \nFEMA's efforts in hazard mitigation planning are invaluable. I have \nalready talked about an example of that. The Carson and Walker Rivers \nare threatening to flood again, and the problem will not be gone until \nthe snow has melted. The flood of 1997 washed away levees, choked river \nchannels, and saturated soils. These conditions make the area ripe for \nmore flooding. FEMA will be there to help if this untoward situation \ntakes place. Because of strong leadership and a willingness to make \nnecessary reforms, FEMA has become an indispensable Government agency \nfor millions of Americans who have suffered these terrible losses. In a \n1994 survey, over 80 percent of natural disaster victims approved of \nthe way FEMA did its work. This is clearly, Mr. President, government \nworking for us. The Director, James Lee Witt, should be very proud of \nthis Agency. I know I am.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi).

Mr. President, before this day is ended, the \nadministration must decide whether or not to certify Mexico as an ally \nin the war against illegal drugs.\n  Having served in the House of Representatives as chairman of the \nWestern Hemisphere Committee for some years, and representing the State \nof New Jersey, which, among other centers of urban and suburban life in \nour country, has been plagued by narcotics, I feel a need and a \nresponsibility to address the administration on this issue before it \nmakes its final judgment because I believe, based on the actions of the \nGovernment of Mexico in the last year, the choice, though difficult, is \nvery clear. The simple fact is that no country anywhere on the globe \nnow poses a more immediate threat to our actions in curtailing the \nspread of narcotics than Mexico. Indeed, the administrator of the DEA \nhas said, and I quote, ``Mexicans are now the single most powerful drug \ntrafficking operation in the world.''\n  The State Department's 1996 World Narcotics Control Strategy Report \noutlines the threat that Mexico now represents. It cites Mexico as the \nprincipal transit route for cocaine entering the United States and a \nmajor source for heroin and marijuana. Indeed, Mr. President, it has \nbeen suggested that with the success of American operations in the \nCaribbean and the Bahamas, fully two-thirds of cocaine now entering the \nUnited States is being routed through Mexico. As we have succeeded in \nthe Caribbean and the Bahamas pound for pound, dollar for dollar, \nMexico has been available to compensate the drug cartels. The State \nDepartment's 1996 report further concludes, ``Mexico is the most \nimportant money laundering center in the Western Hemisphere.''\n\n  There is no escaping the fact that Mexican cartels now are bribing \nwhomever can be bribed and killing those who resist. In recent months, \neight Mexican prosecutors and law enforcement personnel have been \nmurdered in Tijuana, all this since certifying last year that Mexico \nwas assisting United States Government operations. In the last year, \nMexico has failed to capture or extradite a single high-ranking member \nof any drug cartel. There are now 52 outstanding United States \nextradition requests for drug dealers, and Mexico has not complied with \na single one of those extradition requests. Indeed, Mr. President, \nthere is no record of any Mexican national ever being extradited to the \nUnited States on a narcotics charge.\n  There has been considerable hope since certification last year that \nthe use of the Mexican Armed Forces would represent a change. If, \nindeed, the narcotics strategy of Mexico included not simply law \nenforcement personnel who might have been compromised but Mexico \nrepresented and recognized that this was a matter of their own national \nsecurity and involved their armed forces, that there might be a change. \nBut the record is now clear. There has not been a change. The \nannouncement of only last week that General Gutierrez, a 42-year \nveteran of the armed forces, had accepted bribes from the Carrillo \nFuentes cartel makes clear that the entry of the Mexican Armed Forces \nis not only insufficient but inadequate and, indeed, potentially \ncounterproductive.\n  Changes in Mexican law lead us to the same conclusion. Last year the \nMexican Parliament passed criminal money laundering laws, but they are \nboth incomplete and completely not implemented. These laws at a minimum \ndo not require banks to report large and suspicious currency \ntransactions. Unfortunately, the Mexican Government, having not \nimplemented its antinarcotics strategy, having now recognized that the \nentry of the armed forces is inadequate or counterproductive and taking \nno actions against laundering with the banks, it therefore, in my \njudgment, can be concluded that Mexico has not taken the certification \nprocess seriously. Previous certifications have brought no new \ncooperation, and now we must reach a different judgment.\n  Indeed, Mr. President, in light of the evidence of the corruption of \nlaw enforcement personnel, new evidence of corruption of the armed \nforces, the failure to comply with American requests for extradition, \nthe failure to enforce their own laws on money laundering, the United \nStates Government should be answering the following question: What else \nwould Mexico have to do to be denied certification? Having\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\nfailed on almost any level of analysis, what else could they do? Here \nis what we see.\n  The United States today will also readdress the question of whether \nor not Colombia should be recertified. It is an arguable question. In \nthe last year, since we denied certification, the Colombian military \ngenuinely seems to have at least undergone some change. They have \nmobilized 5,000 troops and through the use of joint military and law \nenforcement operations destroyed laboratories producing 1\\1/2\\ tons of \ncocaine per day. They have issued 3,000 arrest warrants on drug charges \nand removed 450 million dollars' worth of cocaine from the production \npipeline.\n\n  The administration may or may not, on their own evidence, recertify \nColombia. But the Colombian experience gives evidence that, while it is \ndifficult to take action against a friendly government, people in \nColombia or Mexico that we respect, it is successful. Our \ndecertification of Colombia produced results. It is a question the \nadministration must address before deciding on their actions about \nMexico today.\n  The President is faced with three possibilities in deciding whether \nto certify Mexico in the drug war. He can certify that Mexico is fully \ncooperating with the United States Government actions. That would be \nfalse on its face. There is no evidence to support a conclusion that \nMexico is being cooperative. Indeed, it would make the entire \ncertification process lose all credibility. No nation involved in \nnarcotrafficking within its borders would ever feel any responsibility \nor pressure to cooperate with the U.S. Government activities if we were \nto so stretch our credibility by fully certifying Mexico.\n  Second, the administration can decertify Mexico and bring a halt to \nall American foreign assistance except antidrug programs.\n  Or, third, the administration can decertify Mexico but grant a \nnational security waiver. The last of these options I would understand. \nPeople could legitimately argue the relative merits of decertification \nwith a national security waiver, based on specific promises of the \nMexican Government; to deny certification but, for 1 more year, to give \none last chance for them to meet the responsibility to their own \npeople, the international community, and their previous promises. But \nto certify, given that this other option is available, would be \ninexplicable to our own people, an insult to those engaged in this \ncountry in law enforcement, and contrary to the evidence.\n  On occasion, in this country, we describe our efforts against \nnarcotics as a war on drugs. But in dealing with foreign governments \nwith whom we would like to have good relations, we seek to win a war \nwithout casualties. The sensitivities of the Mexican Government might \nbe a casualty in this certification, but it is necessary if we are to \nbe serious and produce real results.\n  Finally, I hope the administration will reach the right judgment. The \nstakes are high. I urge the administration to take these comments and \nthese facts into consideration in reaching its judgment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In speaking in morning business this morning, I want to \nexpress my concern, actually for the first time, on an issue that has \nbeen brewing publicly and not so publicly for well over 2 months now. \nAs the Senate struggles to try to develop a mechanism under which we \ncan effectively investigate the alleged wrongdoing at the White House \nas it relates to Presidential campaign fundraising, the issue gets \nlarger and larger by the day. Yesterday, I finally believed it was time \nto speak out in relation to the Justice Department appointing \nindependent counsel. I say so because it is obvious to me now that the \npublic does not want the Congress to grind itself into gridlock and \npartisan fracturing in an effort to do what it should responsibly do, \nand that is investigate alleged wrongdoing or violations of law on the \npart of the executive branch.\n  Be that as it may, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nalso finding themselves in what I believe to now be a most embarrassing \nsituation, having to argue that we probably ought not to do this, or to \nreduce the scope of what we should legitimately do, all in defense of a \nPresident who, by the hour, appears to be increasingly more involved in \nwhat is allegedly wrongdoing or violation of Federal campaign law.\n  So, yesterday, I asked the Attorney General in a press release to \nappoint independent counsel and to move ahead with what she and the \nJustice Department must responsibly and rightfully do. The New York \nTimes editorialized, and they said this:\n\n       Janet Reno's insistence that she is waiting for creditable \n     evidence before appointing an independent counsel has now \n     reached a point of mindlessness. By the standards that \n     applied to the Carter, Reagan, and Bush administrations, \n     the threshold for appointing an independent counsel has \n     been reached and passed. If she will but look, Ms. Reno \n     will see a pervasive pattern of reckless behavior and an \n     array of suspicious incidents that cry out for an \n     independent counsel.\n\n  That editorial went on to say--it speaks of the White House, and it \nsays:\n\n       Presidents and their White House aides are inevitably \n     involved in campaign planning, as certainly U.S. Senators are \n     in the planning of their campaigns. But, by openly bartering \n     Presidential invitations for political contribution and by \n     relentlessly mixing official and political, this \n     administration has gone so far beyond the normal rules of \n     political behavior and the traditional interpretation of \n     Federal law that even so dogged a Democrat as Pat Moynihan. . \n     . .\n\n  And so on and so forth. And it speaks again for Ms. Reno to appoint \nthat independent counsel.\n  This morning in the Washington Times, again, headlines, ``Reno Not \nReady for Outside Probe.''\n  My question today is to Ms. Reno. When will you be ready? When there \nis a massive public outcry of wrongdoing or alleged wrongdoing? When \nthe evidence piles so high at the door of the White House that you \ncannot step across the threshold to go see your friend, the President, \nMr. Clinton?\n  Ms. Reno, wake up. Listen to what is being said in public. It is time \nto act. It is time we develop an independent counsel, bipartisan, \nnonpartisan, to investigate what is now verging on a major scandal. \nSomeone asked me while I was traveling in Idaho last week, ``Why is the \nPresident out advocating campaign finance reform when it appears that \nhe is the greatest violator?'' I said, ``There is an old adage that \nthose who sin the most are the first to the altar.''\n  We find it increasingly embarrassing to read in the newspapers \neveryday that somehow the White House, the very image of this country, \nwas used for personal gain in a way that no other President has used \nit.\n  So, once again, today I call on the Attorney General to do what she \nmust responsibly do. The allegations grow by the day. Ms. Reno, do what \nyou should do. Appoint an independent counsel to investigate, in a \nnonpartisan way, what should be done, for the sake of the Presidency \nand the White House itself.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \narticle entitled ``Irate Clinton Blasts Moves for Counsel'' be printed \nin today's Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Feb. 18, 1997]\n\n                 Irate Clinton Blasts Moves for Counsel\n\n                           (By David Rogers)\n\n       Washington.--An angry President Clinton called Democratic \n     senators this week complaining of demands inside the party \n     for a special counsel to investigate foreign influence in \n     fund raising for his presidential campaign.\n       Minority Leader Tom Daschle (D., S.D.) was awakened around \n     1 a.m. Monday by Mr. Clinton. Leaders of the Democratic \n     Senatorial Committee were also called Sunday night by the \n     president, who angrily reminded senators he had gone to New \n     York to raise money for their campaigns in the prior week.\n       None of the senators called by Mr. Clinton would discuss \n     these conversations, and the White House declined to comment. \n     Members of Congress and Democratic aides, however, confirmed \n     the timing and substance of the calls. Mr. Clinton appears to \n     have been provoked by Sunday talk shows in which former New \n     Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and Sen. Russell Feingold (D., Wis.) \n     endorsed the appointment of an independent counsel.\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\n       The picture of an agitated president making late-night \n     calls is very different from the calm image the White House \n     has sought to project. The incident testifies to the \n     increased tension between Mr. Clinton and Congress amid the \n     almost daily revelations regarding his past fund-raising \n     practices.\n       Trying to seize the high ground, Democrats are demanding \n     that Republicans make a commitment to allow campaign-finance-\n     reform legislation to come to the floor this year. But Mr. \n     Clinton's outbursts may only feed Republican complaints that \n     Democrats are stalling on behalf of the embattled president--\n     an important fund-raiser.\n       The fight is expected to come to a head in the Senate as \n     early as next Wednesday. Mr. Dashcle said yesterday that \n     Republicans must promise to bring up campaign reform this \n     spring if Democrats are to support funding for a GOP-backed \n     inquiry of campaign abuses by the White House.\n       ``We will not agree to funding . . . to anything, until we \n     get campaign-finance reform,'' said the South Dakota \n     Democrat. His statement, the clearest linkage of the two \n     issues to date, is designed to exploit GOP division on this \n     front.\n       The Republicans' strongest reform advocate, Arizona Sen. \n     John McCain, supports both an independent counsel and a \n     campaign-finance bill, but Majority Leader Trent Lott (R., \n     Miss.) is decidedly cool to overhauling the current system. \n     Caught in the middle is Sen. Fred Thompson (R., Tenn.), who \n     chairs the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, charged \n     with carrying out the planned inquiry. And some Republicans \n     are openly proposing to scuttle Mr. Thompson's budget if the \n     investigation becomes a vehicle to advance campaign reform.\n       Mr. Lott last night warned Democrats against filibustering \n     the committee's funding but said he had exhausted efforts to \n     reach a compromise and expected to meet the issue head-on \n     next week.\n       As the Thompson inquiry has stalled, smaller investigations \n     are springing up. One of the latest comes from a Senate \n     Judiciary subcommittee overseeing the National Bankruptcy \n     Review Commission. The commission's chairman, Brady \n     Williamson, attended a fund-raiser for Mr. Clinton last \n     September that drew a large set of big donors from the \n     bankruptcy professional community.\n       In an interview this week, Mr. Williamson said he went as a \n     ``private citizen'' and only after seeking an opinion from \n     the White House counsel's office. But Sen. Charles Grassley \n     (R. Iowa), chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee, said \n     yesterday he had received written correspondence indicating \n     those running the event had pressured members of the banking \n     industry to attend if they wanted to be heard on bankruptcy \n     issues.\n       In another development, Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     agents who this week raided the Washington offices of the \n     U.S.-Thai Business Council couldn't find records related to \n     Ban Chang International, which shared offices with the \n     council and helped finance it. Pauline Kanchanalak, a major \n     Democratic contributor whose gifts are now under srcutiny by \n     the FBI, worked for Ban Chang and helped organize the \n     council.\n       Ban Chang is a subsidiary of Ban Chang Group, a \n     conglomerate based in Bangkok, Thailand. Last June Ms. \n     Kanchanalak and a relative gave $185,000 to the Democratic \n     National Committee in conjunction with a coffee event at the \n     White House with President Clinton, attended by top \n     executives of another Thai conglomerate, CP Group.\n       People familar with the matter say the FBI wants to know if \n     Ms. Kanchanalak knows where the records are, but she is \n     currently thought to be in Thailand. Her Washington-based \n     attorney, and an attorney for Ban Chang in Washington, \n     couldn't be reached for comment.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to address an issue which has been \nraised by other Members on this floor, which I believe is of great \nsignificance and which must be resolved in the next few days. That is \nthat the Clinton administration has a difficult matter of rendering a \ndecision, in consultation with the Secretary of State, as to whether or \nnot to certify Mexico as a nation that is cooperating in the area of \nour war on drugs.\n  There are many factors to consider before making such a decision, but \nthe primary factor for me is what effect does such a decision have on \nour ability to fight the use of drugs here in the United States? Drug \nabuse continues to be one of the primary serious problems, primary and \nmost serious problems, our Nation is facing, especially among our young \npeople in our inner cities. Fighting drugs has to be one of the most \nimportant goals of this administration and of this Congress.\n  Since the so-called certification process was begun in the mid-\n1980's, Mexico has always been deemed to be a nation that is making a \nstrong effort in the drug war, and many of us in Congress have had \nconcerns, and continue to have concerns, about Mexico's progress.\n  So at some point, you have to evaluate the effects of bestowing \ncertification status on Mexico. Has certification improved Mexico's \nability to deal with drug cartels? Have cocaine seizures increased? Are \ndrug dealers being arrested and convicted? Are antimoney-laundering \nbills being enacted into law in Mexico? And finally, and perhaps most \nimportant, are the Mexican law enforcement agencies cooperating with us \nand are they free of corruption?\n  It is this last point that I think remains the most single \nsignificant concern and impediment to certification. The arrest of the \nMexican General Jesus Gutierrez Rebollo, the Mexican drug czar in \ncharge of Mexico's counternarcotics efforts, on a charge of bribery, \ncocaine trafficking and for having ties to organized crime leaders in \nMexico's drug cartels, was, in the words of our own United States drug \nczar, General McCaffrey, a ``terrible blow.'' It really is more than \nthat, of course. To have the chief law enforcement officer in the area \nof drug enforcement in Mexico turn out to be nothing more than a front \nman for the Mexican drug cartels undermines all credibility of the \neffort of Mexico in the area of fighting drugs.\n  Our intelligence agencies are now conducting a damage assessment to \nestablish how many of our agents, informants and counterdrug operatives \nwere put at risk. It is believed that a very large number have been put \nat risk, and, in fact, the damage to this intelligence network may \nexceed the damage that was created in the CIA by the Aldrich Ames case. \nIf you remember, in the Aldrich Ames case a large number of agents and \noperatives for the CIA died.\n  When you add up the evidence about the results of certification, you \nhave to wonder what effect it has had on stemming the flow of drugs \ninto this country. Mexico is the source of 70 percent of the cocaine on \nAmerican streets and is the growing source of the most violent types of \ndrugs. The primary cartels which are now shipping their drugs to the \nUnited States are no longer centered in Colombia. They are two cartels \ncentered in Mexico. The antimoney-laundering laws are incomplete and \nnot yet implemented. In short, the battle against drugs being shipped \nto the United States from Mexico is being lost in Mexico.\n  In light of the ongoing corruption and the flow of drugs into our \nNation, I believe the United States must withhold full certification. \nThe cost of drug abuse to our society remains too high to take any \nother course. There is no doubt that on the domestic front, we can do a \ngreat deal more, and we must. In fact, it was unfortunate that this \nadministration essentially ignored this problem during its first term, \nbut the administration has now turned its attention to this issue, and, \nhopefully, we can make greater progress. We need strong leadership from \nthe White House. The President does control the bully pulpit and, as we \nsaw with Mrs. Reagan's efforts under the ``Just Say No'' program in the \neighties, the White House can have a dramatic effect on utilization.\n  But at the same time, we must pursue a more effective policy that \nwill cut off the flow of drugs from source countries like Mexico. I \nbelieve that withholding full certification to Mexico would send the \nright message from the American people to the Government of Mexico, and \nthat message is that the status quo is not acceptable. I urge the \nPresident to hear the concerns of our agents on the front lines who \ncannot trust their Mexican counterparts for fear of being compromised. \nAs the DEA Administrator, Mr. Constantine, stated, ``There is not one \nsingle law enforcement institution with whom DEA has a really trusting \nrelationship.''\n  It is time, Mr. President, to take strong action, and I strongly \nsuggest that we not pursue certification.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1791-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1791-S1792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SOCIAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I want to also speak on another subject \nwhich is of equal importance. It is of importance, however, to the next \ngeneration in a different way. It is of importance in the area of \nfiscal policy, and that is the question of Social Security.\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\n  There is an atmosphere, of course, which has pervaded American \npolitics, and especially politics in Washington, that discussing \nsubstantive reform to Social Security laws of our country is to commit \npolitical hari-kari; that any discussion of Social Security must be \ndone in the most passive and benign way or else a person in public \noffice will suffer great consequence.\n  But we can no longer afford to take this head-in-the-sand approach to \nthis absolutely critical and core issue of public policy. We know that \nthe Social Security system is fundamentally broken and that it is \nheaded toward an enormous bankruptcy. We know that if we take no \naction, purely as a function of demographics, we will see a collapse of \nthe Social Security system in the early part of the next century, and \nwith it probably a collapse of our Nation's finances, as we will simply \nbe unable to bear the load of paying for the system.\n  This is not a result of having a failed system for the last 40 years. \nWe have had an extraordinary system for the last 40 or 50 years. It is \na result simply of the fact that the Social Security system was not \nstructured to deal with the generational demographics which we are \nheaded toward. The post-war baby-boom generation is going to turn the \ntables of productivity upside down and the tables of who gets and who \ngives relative to the Social Security system.\n\n  Today, approximately 3.1 people pay into the system for every 1 \nperson who takes out. By the time the post-war baby-boom generation is \nfully taking down its share of Social Security, we will only have two \npeople paying into the system for every one person taking out. That \nmeans that by the year 2020, the Social Security system will be running \napproximately a $216 billion deficit which will be escalating in a \ngeometric progression.\n  This deficit will essentially absorb all the discretionary dollars of \nthe U.S. Government, and we simply will be unable to fund the operation \nof Government, beyond either paying for Social Security or choosing \nsome other course. What will happen is, we will have to create a \nmassive economic disruption to address the issue, probably a national \ninflation on the order of what happened in the German Weimar Republic \nafter World War I.\n  So this issue must be addressed. It is like that television ad for an \noil filter that says, ``You can pay me now or pay me later.'' By paying \nnow, by doing something now, we can alleviate the problem for the next \ngeneration or reduce it dramatically at a low cost, but if we wait \nuntil later, the cost to the next generation will be astronomical, and \nwe will not have fulfilled our obligation as passers of the torch.\n  So I have proposed a piece of legislation which addresses this issue. \nI recognize that stepping into this water maybe doesn't make political \ngood sense, but I happen to believe that if we do not step into this \nwater, or if somebody doesn't begin to step into this water, nothing \nwill happen. So I put on the table a proposal on Social Security, which \nI introduced last week, which addresses the underlying problems of the \nsystem.\n  It has four basic elements, and, as a practical matter, it addresses \nthe next generation--my generation--and younger people's generations as \nto how they will be impacted. It has very little significant impact on \nthe people who are presently receiving benefits from the Social \nSecurity system.\n  The first element of it, and probably the most magic, unique--I won't \nuse magic, that will be too egotistical a term--the most unique is I am \nsuggesting we take now what is presently the surplus in the system, \nwhich surplus we expect to run through the year 2010, and we refund \nthat surplus to the wage earners.\n  Today, $20 billion more is paid into the system than is paid out of \nthe system for benefits. That means the wage earners in this country \nare paying $29 billion more in taxes than they need to pay under Social \nSecurity to support the Social Security system.\n  My suggestion is that we refund that by reducing the payroll tax by \nthat 1 percent, from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent, which works out to \nabout 12 percent actually, but a 1-percent reduction. And we allow the \nwage earner to take that 1-percent savings and put it into a savings \naccount, into a savings vehicle like an IRA or some other personal \nsavings vehicle and invest it for their future. This would allow us to \nbegin to prefund the liability of a system which is now subject to \ncontingent funding.\n  We now have a pay-as-you-go system. There is no account which is set \nup for anybody who is on Social Security. What is paid in today is paid \nout today. This would allow us to begin to prefund that liability and \nto give working Americans who are under the age of 50 an opportunity to \nstart to save for their retirement. And it would do it without \nimpacting at all--at all--the present benefit structure of senior \ncitizens.\n  In addition, we must acknowledge that our society is living longer \nand being more productive. When the Social Security system was \nofficially created, the average life of an American male was 61, and \nthe retirement age was set at 65. Franklin Roosevelt was no fool. \nToday, the average life expectancy of an American male is 72 and is \nmoving toward 78. Retirement age remains 65.\n  My proposal, for people who are under the age of 45, would scale up \nthe retirement age and give them lead time to anticipate that. Again, \nit would affect nobody who is on the system or about to come on the \nsystem.\n  In addition, I do something which is called changing the bench \npoints, which is essentially affluence testing, not for people who are \non the system today but people who are under the age of 45.\n  These are some changes that would bring about a solvent system. They \nare different, but they are proposals that need to be put on the table \nand discussed. Mr. President, I thank the indulgence of the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1791-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1792-S1793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the drug czar released the national drug \ncontrol strategy recently, as he is required to do. The President held \na press conference to announce the strategy and his budget for fiscal \n1998 to combat drug use in this country. This strategy now includes a \nrequest for almost $16 billion. That is about a 5.4-percent increase, \nwhich is just about average for recent drug budgets. While I welcome \nthe strategy and the increase, I am concerned that it does not live up \nto the requirements set out in the law. I am even more concerned that \nthe strategy seems to walk away from the war on drugs. This strategy \nwould seem to have us believe that we can combat the problem of rising \nteenage drug abuse by simply treating the wounded. It is walking away \nfrom a war on drugs to talking about fighting a cancer.\n  I have heard Mr. McCaffrey on this issue before. The view seems to be \nthat a ``war'' is the wrong metaphor for our efforts. It seems that we \nmust act as if our problem is more akin to therapy. We must treat the \nproblem of illegal drugs and not combat it. In this view, it is time to \ntrade in our old car for a sleek new model. I appreciate the drug \nczar's sensitivities on this issue, but quite frankly, this trade-in is \ngoing to buy us a lemon.\n  This walking away from years of efforts to combat drug abuse and \ninstead substituting ``phrases about treating a condition'' is simply \nwaving a white flag. It sends the signal that instead of combating \nillegal drugs we must accept them like we would a disease. While I \nagree that the problem of illegal drug use and smuggling are deeply \nimbedded in our society, I do not buy the idea that we need to tolerate \nthis situation.\n  I do not think we gain much by blurring the language we use. I do not \nbelieve that we gain ground with our efforts to keep kids off drugs by \nsending weaker signals about our efforts. This is even more true at a \ntime when kids are using more drugs.\n  I am concerned that the present strategy simply doesn't have the \njuice needed to get us moving. The real story about the present \nsituation of drug use in this country today is that we are losing. By \nthe only standard that matters, whether more kids are deciding to use \nmore drugs, our efforts are failing. In every reporting mechanism that \nwe have, it is clear that in the last 5 years, more kids are using more \ndrugs.\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\n  It is clear that fewer kids are seeing drug use as dangerous. It is \nclear that drug use is increasingly glorified in our popular culture, \nin movies, music, and on TV. It is clear that legalization themes are \ngaining a wider circulation among our elite media and cultural leaders. \nWith all of these things happening under our very noses, it is clear \nthat we have a crisis on our hands.\n  Today, there are some 3 million hardcore addicts in this country. \nReflect for a moment on how we got this population. Most of these \nindividuals decided to use drugs the last time this country flirted \nwith idea that drugs were OK. Their decision in the 1960's, 1970's, and \nearly 1980's left us with a major abuse problem. We were making \nprogress, however, in keeping new generations from making the same \nmistake. That is now changing. And it is changing rapidly. We face a \nproblem of major dimensions. In that context, we need to have a clear \nidea of what we need to be doing. We need to know how we are going to \nmake a difference.\n  Unfortunately, as I read the present strategy, I do not come away \nwith a sense that we have a plan that comes to grips with the problem.\n  According to section 1005 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, the \ndrug czar is required to submit to Congress each year a strategy that \nincludes ``long-range goals for reducing drug abuse in the United \nStates,'' and short-term objectives which the Director determines may \nbe realistically achieved in the 2-year period beginning on the date of \nthe submission of the Strategy.'' It was the intent of Congress that \nthis strategy include standards of measurement so that we could see \nwhat was being achieved. Last year, I wrote Mr. McCaffrey on this issue \nand made it clear that Congress expected to see clear, straightforward \nlanguage on measurable standards. The House communicated a similar \nmessage.\n  What we find, however, is a series of goals and objectives that \ncontain no measurable standards. What we find is the promise that at \nsome future date we will see an effort to have such standards. What we \nfind is a watering down of our drug control efforts by trying to \npresent vague guidelines in a 10-year strategy that does not address \nour present crisis in teenage drug use.\n  We know from every survey on drug use done in this country that teen \nuse of drugs is increasing dramatically. We know that increasingly kids \nsee fewer dangers in using drugs. We know that kids at younger ages are \nstarting to use drugs. We know that the legalization movement in this \ncountry is working overtime to get dangerous drugs accepted as part of \nnormal life.\n  In my view, when we are failing in our goal to keep kids off drugs, \nwe are failing in our job. The present strategy does not tell us how we \nare going to reverse this trend. Certainly, vague goals and objectives \nand the effort to bury the need for decisive action in a 10-year \napproach falls short of the mark.\n  This strategy is disappointing and it seeks to avoid accountability. \nWe are in the midst of a crisis of teenage drug abuse and increasing \nlegalization talk. Yet, the strategy avoids addressing this crisis in a \nclear and straightforward way. It tries to bury this crisis in tables \nand charts that talk about progress made in reducing drug use in the \n1980's and early 1990's. This is a sandwich without the beef.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1792-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1793-S1794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             IT'S FOR KIDS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, what responsible parent has not forgone \nsomething he or she wanted for the benefit of a child? We make \nsacrifices today for the tomorrows of our children. We defer doing \nthings, we give up buying something, we go out of our way.\n  But it is not just in our own lives that we do things for our \nchildren's sake. We support public education. We pass safety laws. We \ntake steps to ensure the well-being of kids. We do this out of \nresponsibility as parents. We do this as members of a civilized \ncommunity that knows the importance of investing in its future through \nfuture generations.\n  Those of us who are adults today benefited from the efforts and \nsacrifices our parents made on our behalf. And their parents before \nthem.\n  It is in acknowledgment of these simple truths that I wanted to talk \nbriefly about this Nation's drug problems. I want to talk about the \nserious challenge that we face to the health and well-being of our \ntomorrows in the lives of our children today.\n  While we were out on the recent recess, something happened that needs \nconcern us. In essence that was the advancement of an effort to \nlegalize drugs in this country. It was not a fair fight. The American \npublic, overwhelmingly, in just about every opinion vehicle I can think \nof, has indicated its enduring opposition to drug legalization. The \nwell-funded legalization lobby knows this. They know they cannot fight \nfor legalization on the merits. They cannot tell the truth about what \ntheir real agenda is. So they resort to weasel words and fast talk. As \nthe old saying goes, you can fool some of the people some of the time, \nand that's usually good enough.\n  What I'm talking about in this case is that those who promote \nlegalization of drugs have resorted to appealing to the public's sense \nof care and concern for the sick and dying to promote drug \nlegalization. The notion that is advanced by the legalization advocates \nand their money men is that smoking marijuana is a treatment for a \nnumber of physical disabilities and terminal illnesses. Relying on \nanecdotal evidence and the exploitation of the public's generous and \ncaring impulses, they have slipped in legalization measures in two \nStates and are targeting a number of others for similar treatment. They \nare also using this approach to go around Federal controls on illegal \ndrugs and international treaties that commit the United States to \nmaintaining adequate drug control policies.\n  Briefly, I want to review what is being claimed and the tactics that \nhave been used. First, let's recall a little history. We are not \ninexperienced in this country in seeing the medicalization of dangerous \nsubstances. At one time in this country, individuals and businesses \ncould market anything as a medicine and make any claim for its \neffectiveness. In this fashion, opiates and cocaine were freely \nmarketed in nostrums sold over the counter and through the mail. The \nmakers of these drugs claimed miracle cures for their products. They \nalso had endless testimonials from satisfied customers on how well the \nproducts performed. Here was no evidence for the claims, however. There \nwas an increasing number of addicts, hooked on self-administered, \ndangerous substances marketed as medicine. As a recent article in the \nNew Republic noted, as a result of these freely available over-the-\ncounter drugs, addiction in this country soared in the early years of \nthis century. Public health officials estimated that 1 in 200 \nAmericans, including children, were addicted.\n\n  In addition to marketing these dangerous drugs, unscrupulous \nbusinesses, and individuals also sold many concoctions made from \nunknown ingredients. And they made claims that these could cure \nanything that ailed humanity.\n  Again, they could call upon boxcars full of anecdotes to support \ntheir claims. We have coined a word for these so-called medicines. We \ncall them snake oil. We also have a word for the people who pushed \nthem--snake oil salesmen or quacks. Our grandparents, who had to deal \nwith these practices, woke up to the fraud that was being perpetrated \non the public. They realized that dangerous drugs were creating a major \naddiction problem. They realized that unknown ingredients were doing \ngreat harm, either directly by poisoning people, or by keeping people \nfrom seeking real treatments for real problems. They demanded better. \nThey demanded that we control dangerous drugs sold to the public. They \ninsisted on truth in advertising. And they required scientific support \nto establish the value of things offered to the public as medicine.\n  In addition, they also took steps to ban dangerous drugs and to \ndetermine what drugs had medical uses that also could be demonstrated \nto be safe and effective. Based on this experience, our predecessors in \nthis body passed the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. They created the \nFood and Drug Administration in 1938 to ensure the availability of safe \nmedicine. They also passed a variety of laws to deal with the use and \ndistribution of dangerous drugs. We have continued these efforts.\n  Among more recent efforts, were the development of schedules for \ndrugs\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\nthat laid out categories for dangerous drugs and their proper control \nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970. These schedules include a \nclassification of drugs for their potential for abuse and their medical \nvalue. This scheduling system gives us a handle on what science and \nexperience continue to tell us about dangerous drugs. Marijuana, along \nwith PCP and LSD, are included in the category of drugs with a high \npotential for abuse and no recognized medical use in its smoked form.\n  But we have not stopped here. In response to public pressure in our \nlast major drug epidemic, we created the drug czar's office to help \ncoordinate our national efforts. We mandated better coordination of \nFederal efforts through high-intensity drug trafficking areas. In \naddition, this body continues these efforts. We have spent a good deal \nof legislative time insisting that our international partners also take \nsteps to stop the production and distribution of dangerous drugs. We \nare signatories to various international treaties, such as the 1988 \nU.N. convention, that commits us to maintaining a drug-free \nenvironment.\n  These facts do not mean that various individuals stop trying to \nsmuggle illegal drugs and sell them to the public. It does not mean \nthat unscrupulous business enterprises or individuals stop trying to \nsell snake oil to the public. We cannot afford to abandon lightly the \nidea that things offered to the public as medicine must meet exacting \nstandards and scientific validation.\n\n  We must be cautious when confronted with sophisticated advertising \ncampaigns that seek to circumvent Federal and State laws and establish \nprocedures for determining safe and effective medicines.\n  Indeed, it should give us pause if any group seeks to push a so-\ncalled medicine through the electoral process. One has to stop and ask \nwhy. If the motive is to provide a medicine, why is it that this so-\ncalled medicine requires an effort to by-pass science, to ignore \nexperience, and to rely on methods wholly unsuited to the concern at \nhand. What we see is that various individuals are resorting to \ntestimonials, anecdotes, and junk science. They do this to legitimize \nthe notion that marijuana should be made available for just about any \ncondition one can name. This is not a path that leads us to responsible \npublic policy, sound medical practice, or a caring and compassionate \napproach to the sick.\n  In the case of medical marijuana, we see an effort underway that \nseeks to by-pass good science and responsible medicine. There is no \nvalid science that demonstrates the medical usefulness of smoking \nmarijuana.\n  Indeed, as recently as February 1994, the U.S. District Court in \nWashington, DC, denied a petition by marijuana legalization groups to \nhave marijuana rescheduled. Not only did the court deny the petition of \nthe legalizers, it specifically noted that their appeals for \nrescheduling were based on anecdotes and testimonials. No valid \nscientific studies were offered to support their claims. As the opinion \nnotes each of the various legalization experts admitted, under oath, \nthat he was basing his opinion on anecdotal evidence, on stories he \nheard from patients, and on his impressions about the drug. The science \nsupporting the claims was not there.\n  In fact, there is considerable and growing evidence to the contrary. \nMany of the carcinogens that accompany tobacco are present in similar \nor greater quantities in marijuana smoke. Moreover, a growing body of \nevidence indicates the serious, harmful, long-term effects for health \nand mental development from smoking marijuana. No major medical \nassociation or research institute supports the claim for the medical \nuses of smoking marijuana. The claims remain anecdotal. No major \nindustrialized country endorses its medical use. Just recently, \nHolland, which condones limited public use of marijuana, has noted no \nmedical utility for marijuana.\n  On the contrary, the principal source of support for marijuana as a \nmedicine comes from groups that favor legalization of drugs. Again, one \nought to ask what is really going on when it is not the medical \ncommunity clamoring for action but rather lobbying groups that seek to \nlegalize certain drugs.\n  Major funding for campaigns to support the idea of marijuana as \nmedicine comes for individuals and groups that favor drug legalization \nor liberalization. The major support for the effectiveness of marijuana \nas a medicine comes from anecdotes. It is not based on science because \nthe science doesn't support the claims. The legalization groups know \nthis and have hit upon methods to try to legalize drugs, at this point \nmarijuana, by other means.\n\n  They make no pretense among themselves about the agenda. They do, \nhowever, resort to misdirection in their public pronouncements. Thus, \nthey exploit the public's trust and goodwill to accomplish an agenda \nthat the public has repeatedly opposed. This is not about medicine for \nsick people but about playing on people's sympathies to legalize a \ndangerous drug.\n  They have sought to turn responsible public policy on its head. It is \ntheir argument that drugs are dangerous because they are illegal, not \nthat they are illegal because they are dangerous. They would have us \nbelieve that our real problem is only the laws that make heroin or \ncocaine or marijuana or methamphetamine illegal for anyone to buy and \nuse as they see fit.\n  They would have us forget our own experiences. They would have us \ndisregard the wisdom of our grandparents and others who learned a \nbitter lesson all those years ago. As Bill Bennett said, drugs are \nillegal because they are dangerous. They are not dangerous because they \nare illegal. We forget that simple reality at our great cost. And it \nwill be our kids who will pay the price.\n  As another old saying goes, fool me once shame on you. Fool me twice, \nshame on me.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1793-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1794-S1795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF SHEPHERD COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, from a practical standpoint, education is \nfundamental to a society interested in securing a better future for \ngenerations to come. But, on a more personal level, I can think of few \nthings in life that provide for the kinds of pleasure, growth, and \nsense of self-worth as does the acquiring of an education.\n  Today, I wish to pay tribute to a long-standing pillar of education \nin West Virginia--Shepherd College. Shepherd College, in Jefferson \nCounty, was founded 125 years ago yesterday.\n  This school, which is located in West Virginia's oldest town, is \nproof that we can preserve our heritage and traditions at the same time \nwe are preparing ourselves for the challenges of tomorrow. With its \nroots firmly planted in history, Shepherd College continues to evolve \nand prepare for the challenges of the new millennium.\n  Shepherd College first opened in September 1871, as a private school \nin a single building that had previously served as the Jefferson County \nCourthouse, and today bears the name McMurran Hall, in honor of \nShepherd College's first principal, Joseph McMurran. McMurran and two \nassistant professors were hired that year to teach the 42 students who \nwere instructed ``in languages, arts and sciences.''\n  On February 27, 1872, the West Virginia Legislature passed an act \nestablishing Shepherd College as a four-year school, dedicated to the \ntraining of teachers, and accredited to bestow the Bachelor of Arts \ndegree. A liberal arts program was approved in 1943, and in 1950, the \nBachelor of Science degree was added.\n  Today, Shepherd College, part of the State College System of West \nVirginia, boasts 3,700 students who are enrolled in 80 different fields \nof study.\n  In recent years, more than a dozen new buildings have been added to \nthe campus. I am proud to have played a role in that growth by adding \nfunds to federal appropriations bills for the school's new Science and \nTechnology Center. The new Center is intended to help prepare students \nin fields such as computer science, environmental science, biology, and \nchemistry--areas of education which are critical to the future ability \nof our nation to compete\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\nin the global market place, and in which our country, sadly, is lagging \nbehind other industrialized nations. This facility will also provide \nworking partnerships with the many federal facilities located in the \nEastern Panhandle, helping area residents to develop careers in high-\ntech fields, and, in turn, helping West Virginia and the nation to \nachieve a more prosperous future.\n  At noon yesterday, Shepherdstown echoed with the sounds of bells, \npealing in honor of the school's 125-year commitment to education, a \nfitting tribute to its founders.\n  Along with my fellow West Virginians, I wish Shepherd College a happy \n125th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1794-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1795-S1796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HIGHWAY TRUST FUND AND THE GAS TAX\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, back on June 5, 1996, I sent a letter to all \nSenators signaling my intention to offer an amendment to the next \navailable tax bill to place into the Highway Trust Fund the 4.3 cent \ngas tax that is currently used for deficit reduction.\n  Senators will recall that, back in May and June of last year, there \nwas much debate on this 4.3 cent gas tax, which was first imposed by \nthe Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. During this past summer, \nI deferred offering this amendment on two occasions at the request of \nboth the Majority and Minority Leaders. Unfortunately, another \nopportunity to offer the amendment did not arise.\n  My purpose in proposing that the 4.3 cent gas tax be placed into the \nHighway Trust Fund is to better enable the Congress to reverse the very \ndestructive trend of federal disinvestment in our nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. By increasing the revenue stream to the \nHighway Trust Fund, it would be my hope and expectation to leverage \nadditional resources for our Federal-Aid Highway program in order to \nstem the deterioration of our nation's highways.\n  Our federal investment in infrastructure as a percentage of the total \nfederal budget has declined significantly since 1980. Few economists \nwould disagree that adequate long term investment in infrastructure is \ncritical to a nation's economic well-being. Only through investment \nhere at home, investment to maintain and renew our own physical plant, \ncan our economy grow and generate healthy wages for its citizens.\n  Even so, our nation's investment in infrastructure as a percentage of \nour Gross Domestic Product has almost been cut in half since 1980. As a \nnation, we continue to invest an absolutely paltry percentage of our \nGross Domestic Product in infrastructure--a percentage considerably \nless than our chief economic competitors in Europe and Asia.\n  Nowhere do we pay a greater price for inadequate infrastructure \ninvestment than in our nation's highways. Our national highway system \ncarries nearly 80 percent of U.S. interstate commerce and nearly 80 \npercent of intercity passenger and tourist traffic. The construction of \nour national interstate system represents perhaps the greatest public \nworks achievement of the modern era. However, we have allowed segments \nour National Highway System to fall into serious disrepair.\n  The Department of Transportation has released its most recent report \non the condition of the nation's highways. Its findings are even more \ndisturbing than earlier reports. DOT currently classifies less than \nhalf of the mileage on our interstate system as being in good condition \nand only 39 percent of our entire national highway system is rated in \ngood condition. Fully 61 percent of our nation's highways are rated in \neither fair or poor condition. Almost one in four of our nation's \nhighways' bridges are now categorized as either structurally deficient \nor functionally obsolete. This is not the highway infrastructure that \nwill help our country and its citizens continue to prosper into the \ntwenty first century. If we allow this decay to continue, it will \nconstrict the lifelines of our nation.\n  According to the DOT, our investment in our nation's highways is a \nfull $15 billion short each year just to maintain these current \ninadequate conditions. Put another way, we would have to increase our \nnational highway investment by more than $15 billion a year to make the \nleast bit of improvement in the status of our national highway network \neach year.\n  It is critical to point out that, while our highway infrastructure \ncontinues to deteriorate, highway use is on the rise. Indeed, it is \ngrowing at a very rapid pace. The number of vehicle miles traveled has \ngrown by roughly 40 percent in just the last decade. As a result, we \nare witnessing new highs in the amount of congestion, causing delays in \nthe movement of goods and people that are very costly to our national \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the requirements we place on our \nnational highway system are growing while our investment continues to \ndecline. We are simply digging ourselves into a deeper and deeper hole. \nSix years ago, in 1991, it was estimated that an investment of $47.5 \nbillion dollars would be necessary on an annual basis to ensure that \nhighway conditions would not deteriorate any further than they existed \nin that year. By 1993, that figure grew to $51.6 billion. And two years \nago, that figure grew to $54.8 billion. The longer we delay making \nfederal highway spending a priority, the more expensive it gets to \nreverse this destructive trend.\n  In the coming months, the Senate will take up legislation to \nreauthorize the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, or \nISTEA. Many members, including myself, have come to the Floor to \nintroduce legislation to address specific transportation needs in their \nstates and regions. Also, many members have spoken to the need for \nformula changes to bring about what they perceive to be a more \nequitable distribution of funds from the highway program. Just \nyesterday, our new Transportation Secretary, Rodney Slater, testified \nbefore the Environment and Public Works Committee on the broad outlines \nof the Administration's proposed ISTEA reauthorization bill. There are \nmany fine initiatives in the Administration's bill just as there have \nbeen many fine initiatives introduced by Members from all regions of \nthe country.\n  However, we must face the fact that, absent a determined effort by \nthe Congress and the Administration to substantially increase the \ncurrent level of spending on our highway program, we are not going to \nstem the deterioration of our highway infrastructure. Similarly, it is \nunlikely that, as we reauthorize ISTEA, we will be able to accommodate \nnew initiatives and address substantial formula changes.\n\n  Just last month, I was pleased to join with 55 of my colleagues in \nwriting to the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nDomenici, asking that the upcoming Budget Resolution allocate \nsufficient budget authority to the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee to allow for a robust ISTEA reauthorization bill. But it must \nbe recognized that the ISTEA reauthorization bill is just that--an \nauthorization bill. And while ISTEA does allocate some direct funding \nfrom the Highway Trust Fund outside of the appropriations process, the \nvast majority of funds distributed under the Federal-Aid Highway \nProgram are controlled by annual obligation limitations set by the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  The Administration's budget proposal assumes that there will be \nincreased contract authority provided for several meritorious programs \nunder the Federal-Aid Highway Program over the next six years. But the \nunfortunate fact is that the Administration's budget simultaneously \nassumes that the annual obligation limitation set by the Appropriations \nCommittee will be frozen at the current year's level for the entire \nlife of the next authorization bill. Put another way, under the \nAdministration's proposal, states will not be allowed to obligate one \nadditional penny in any of the next six years above the current year's \nlevel.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate that we can have a reasonable debate as \nto whether the solution to this problem is depositing an additional 4.3 \ncents into the Highway Trust Fund. The Highway Trust Fund currently has \nsome sizable unobligated balances. Moreover, income to the Highway \nTrust Fund has been steadily rising as a result of increased gas \nconsumption and the fact that an additional 2.5 cents has been \ndeposited in the Highway Trust Fund since the beginning of Fiscal Year \n1996. However, one thing that cannot be denied is the fact that \nsubstantially increased funds are necessary to stem the\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\ndeterioration of our federal highway system. A mechanism must be \ndeveloped to ensure that, even while we strive to eliminate our annual \nbudget deficit, we begin to stem the tide of federal disinvestment in \nour transportation infrastructure.\n  Toward that end, I look forward to working with Chairman Domenici of \nthe Budget Committee and its Ranking Member, Senator Lautenberg, along \nwith the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee and the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee to \nseek a way to ensure substantially increased authorizations and \nobligational authority for our federal highway responsibilities. We \ncannot be responsible stewards of federal tax dollars and, at the same \ntime, pass a steadily deteriorating transportation infrastructure on to \nour children and grandchildren.\n  Now Mr. President, I did not seek to hold up consideration of H.R. \n668 yesterday evening by proposing amendments to address our highway \ninfrastructure needs. I recognized the urgency of renewing the aviation \nticket tax. The Airport and Airways Trust Fund is on the verge of \nbankruptcy and, absent the renewal of the ticket tax, our nation's \nairport construction enterprise, as well as the procurement of \ncritically needed air traffic control equipment, will be at risk. \nIndeed, airports are also a critical element of our transportation \ninfrastructure. And, as in the case of highways, our airport \ninfrastructure needs continue to grow while federal investment \ncontinues to fall precipitously. The current funding level for the \nAirport Improvement Program has fallen more than 30 percent in just the \nlast five years. And the president's budget for the coming fiscal year \nasks us to cut the program an additional 32 percent. The last thing I \nwanted to do yesterday evening was endanger necessary investments in \nour aviation infrastructure in the hopes of addressing the needs of our \nhighway infrastructure.\n  However, I rise today to state my intention and commitment to work \nwith the Senate leadership as well as the leadership of all the \nrelevant committees to ensure that we put policies in place this year \nto adequately address the need for increased highway investment. I \ninvite all members to join me in this cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1795-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1796]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

A bill to amend chapter 3 of title 28, United States Code, to \nprovide for the appointment in each Federal judicial circuit court of \nappeals, of at least one resident of each State in such circuit, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 THE JUDICIARY APPOINTMENTS ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce the Fairness in\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\nJudiciary Appointments Act of 1997, with my colleague, the senior \nSenator from Hawaii. Our measure would require the appointment of \njudges on the circuit court of appeals from all States in the circuit. \nThis legislation is identical to S. 1320, which was introduced in 1995.\n  This measure will require no new appropriations and no additional \nspending authority. It would, however, ensure fairness in the \nappointment of circuit court judges and remove political pressure in \nweighing the nomination of a person from a more populated State over an \nindividual from a less populated State.\n  Our bill would require that judges on the circuit court of appeals be \nappointed from every State in the circuit. The impact of the measure on \nfairness and justice would be long-term and far-reaching. It will \nassure that all citizens of every State in the Nation are represented \nby an active circuit judge on each of the circuits.\n  I am disappointed that the past three administrations have failed to \nnominate a circuit court judge from Hawaii, which is part of the ninth \ncircuit. Hawaii's only active judge serves as a senior judge since his \nretirement over 10 years ago. There are currently 8 vacancies on the \ncourt out of 28 seats. Two additional judges are expected to retire \nthis spring, which will mean that a full one-third of the seats on the \nninth circuit court will be vacant.\n  I will not go into the inability of the Senate to act on judicial \nappointments in the last Congress at this time. However, I will state \nfor my colleagues that I am hopeful we will eliminate the existing \nbacklog of vacancies at all levels of the Federal court system in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  It is my firm belief that legal decisions should be based on the law, \nnot representation. But representation would add to the credibility and \nlegitimacy of the Federal appellate courts and the decisions they \nrender. I urge my colleagues to support the Fairness in Judiciary \nAppointment Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that my bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 382\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. STATE RESIDENCY OF JUDGES OF FEDERAL COURTS OF \n                   APPEALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 44(c) of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended--\n       (1) in inserting ``(1)'' after ``(c)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end thereof the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(2) In each circuit (other than the Federal judicial \n     circuit) there shall be at least one circuit judge in regular \n     active service appointed from the residents of each State in \n     that circuit.''.\n       (b) Appointments.--As vacancies occur and judgeships are \n     created for Federal circuit judges, the President shall make \n     appointments under section 44(a) of title 28, United States \n     Code, in a manner to meet the requirements of subsection \n     (c)(2) of such section (as added by subsection (a) of this \n     section) at the earliest practical date.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO:\n  S. 383. A bill to require the Director of the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency to provide funds for compensation for expenses \nincurred by the State of New York, Nassau County and Suffolk County, \nNY, and New York City, NY, as a result of the crash of flight 800 of \nTrans World Airlines; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n            FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce legislation which will \nrequire the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency [FEMA] \nto compensate the many State, county, and local governments throughout \nNew York that assisted Federal officials in the rescue and salvage \noperations immediately following the crash of Trans World Airlines \nFlight 800.\n  As you will recall Mr. President, on July 17, 1996, TWA flight 800 \ncrashed into Federal waters off the coast of Long Island, NY killing \nall 230 persons aboard. Immediately following the incident a vast army \nof rescuers set forth from the counties of Nassau and Suffolk, Long \nIsland, and the city of New York to offer their assistance. Many of the \nrescuers were ordinary citizens. Others were from U.S. Coast Guard \nstations located within the area. However, the vast majority of the \nrescuers came from the many State, county, and local municipalities \nthroughout the region. Braving darkness and rolling seas these heroes \nset forth upon the Atlantic Ocean, in many cases in small boats piloted \nby area residents and fishermen to help persons unknown to them.\n  In the hours and days immediately following the tragic crash, divers \nfrom the city of New York, and the New York State Police, working with \nNavy and Coast Guard officials, began their search for survivors. \nBraving frigid waters, darkness and the hazards created by the wreckage \nitself they soon realized the enormity of the loss of life. They then \nbegan the undaunted task of recovering the bodies of those who had lost \ntheir lives in the crash. These divers labored around the clock for \nweeks on end with only a few hours of fitful sleep performing this most \nsensitive of tasks. The men and women who labored under these harshest \nof conditions are to be commended.\n  While efforts continued under the water, the air above the crash site \nwas filled with activity. National Guard helicopters stationed in New \nYork were requested to transport Federal officials to and from the \ncrash site and to assist in recovery operations.\n  On land, National Guard engineers provided cranes to lift large \npieces of the aircraft. These pieces were eventually loaded upon \nNational Guard trucks in Brooklyn, NY, and transported to a hangar at \nCalverton, Long Island where they were reassembled. National Guard \nunits provided security at the Brooklyn and Calverton facilities. \nNational Guard units also provided generators to provide desperately \nneeded lighting to assist in the recovery process.\n  Additionally, the New York State Department of Transportation \nprovided steel and lumber in support of the National Guard's recovery \nefforts. The New York State Department of Corrections provided mobile \nhomes to provide temporary housing for U.S. Navy and Coast Guard \nofficials. New York State, county, and local police officials assisted \nthe FBI with the collection and processing of large pieces of the \naircraft. These same officials also provided security at the reassembly \nfacility at Calverton. In probably one of the most sensitive and \ndelicate of efforts, members of the Suffolk County Medical Examiners \nOffice worked tirelessly and expeditiously in the identification of the \nvictims of the crash in order that they might be returned to their \nloved ones. These are only a few of the examples of the assistance that \nwas provided by and continues to this date to be provided by the \ncitizens of the State of New York to Federal authorities.\n  New York State, New York City, Suffolk and Nassau Counties offered \ntheir assistance in this emergency without hesitation. However, the \nmagnitude of the rescue and recovery operation imposed tremendous \nfinancial strains on these entities. To date, nearly $13 million has \nbeen spent by State, city, and county governments and this total could \nvery well increase as the final accountings are tallied. The \nlegislation that I am introducing today will provide financial \ncompensation to these entities for the costs they incurred in \nresponding to and assisting in the efforts to retrieve the bodies and \nwreckage of TWA flight 800. This legislation will require that all \nrequests for restitution be forwarded directly to the Governor of New \nYork who will in turn submit a request to the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency. Total compensation would be capped at $20 million.\n  Mr. President, we all commend the efforts of the State of New York, \nthe city of New York, and Nassau and Suffolk Counties and the many \nthousands of men and women who offered their assistance in this time of \nneed. I believe that this is the right thing to do to provide fair \ncompensation to those entities that responded to this extraordinary and \ntragic incident.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to allow States \nto regulate the disposal of municipal solid waste generated outside the \nState; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n\n                  solid waste disposal act amendments\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to \ngive States and localities the right to regulate, and if they choose, \nreject, interstate shipments of municipal solid waste.\n  Mr. President, this is not a new issue to this body; we have grappled \nwith the subject of interstate waste for years. The Senate has passed \nlegislation to address this problem in each of the past three \nCongresses. Unfortunately, similar legislation has not been passed by \nthe House of Representatives. This problem only grows more and more \nserious as we delay passing this important legislation.\n  An estimated 16 million tons of municipal solid waste travels across \nState lines each and every year. And the problem will only grow in the \nfuture. Last May, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and New York \nGov. George Pataki announced an agreement to close the city's last \nlandfill, the Fresh Kills landfill. Without additional landfill space \nin New York, an additional 4 million tons of municipal solid waste will \nbe on the interstate market every year after Fresh Kills closes on \nDecember 31, 2001.\n  Landfills across the country are filling up, and communities are \nsearching for new places to send their garbage. They are looking at \nplaces like North Dakota, where the air, water, and soil have not been \nspoiled by pollution and where local communities may be willing to take \ntremendous amounts of money in exchange for landfill space. Whether \nthey want this imported waste or not, States and surrounding \ncommunities are almost powerless to stop the flow of garbage across \ntheir borders. Further, residents of local communities that agree to \naccept out-of-State waste often do not have all the information they \nneed to make an informed choice to open their landfill space to \nimported garbage.\n  Mr. President, out-of-State waste has already come to my State of \nNorth Dakota. We have been accepting industrial waste from General \nMotors plants from all across the country, although GM has recently \nbegun sending their waste to another facility. We also import municipal \nsolid waste incinerator ash from Minnesota. And one waste company tried \nfor many years to open a superdump in North Dakota that would take \nnearly twice as much municipal solid waste as the entire State of North \nDakota produces. My State is not unique in its situation; this is \nhappening all across the country.\n  Mr. President, the residents of my State and citizens across the \ncountry are tired of being powerless to regulate interstate waste. In \nfact, just last year North Dakota's voters approved an initiated \nmeasure that was designed to deter imports of other States' waste into \nNorth Dakota. That measure was ruled unconstitutional by the U.S. \ndistrict judge. In the judge's decision, he wrote, ``The reality \nappears to be that trash is trash, and any law classifying it into \nhome-grown versus foreign will not work.''\n  Mr. President, unless Congress acts to give States and localities the \nauthority to regulate and reject interstate waste, this situation will \ncontinue. The bill I am introducing today is really very simple. First, \nit gives States the authority to regulate interstate waste. If a State \nwants to reject new solid waste shipments, my bill would allow that.\n  Second, it requires that affected local governments formally approve \nof any waste import. This gives the communities the ability to veto \nproposed shipments of out-of-State waste.\n  Third, it provides an opportunity for the area surrounding the host \ncommunity to be involved in a decision to accept out-of-State waste. A \ndecision on siting a solid waste landfill, especially one that will \ntake large amounts of imported waste, must be a collective one, and a \nsmall community alone should not be able to make a decision that will \naffect a much larger area.\n  Finally, my bill requires that waste companies publicly release all \nthe relevant information about their proposed landfill before a \ncommunity makes a decision on it. This information should include \nestimated environmental impacts and mitigation, economic impacts, \nplanned expansion, financial disclosure, and records of past violations \nby the owner and operator of the proposed disposal site. Waste \ncompanies hold up the promise of jobs and economic incentives, but they \ndo not want to reveal the potential risks involved in their plans. In \nmany cases, they may not even reveal their overall plans until it is \ntoo late to stop them. One practice I have seen involves having a local \ndeveloper purchase a site and get a permit to dispose of modest amounts \nof solid waste. The big interstate waste company then buys out the \nlocal party and aggressively expands the site's permit. The local \ncommunity doesn't have a chance. This isn't fair and cannot be allowed \nto continue. Communities must be able to make informed choices.\n  Mr. President, we have been working on the interstate waste problem \nin the Senate for many years now. The problem has not gone away and it \nwill not go away without congressional action. The trash is still \nmoving, and States and communities are almost powerless to stop it. It \nis time to enact strong interstate waste legislation into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 384\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, it is my pleasure to take a moment \nto recognize JALEX, the Japanese Language Exchange Program. Since its \ninception in 1992, the JALEX Program has made valuable educational \ncontributions to students in the United States preparing to function in \nan increasingly global environment.\n  There are few Americans who would dispute the importance of providing \nour young people with an education that will prepare them to function \neffectively in the world. It is the responsibility of our educational \nsystem to prepare them to be competitive and cooperative in this global \nenvironment. You will be pleased to know that this kind of preparation \nis happening through JALEX, a unique program funded by the Center for \nGlobal Partnership of the Japan Foundation and administered by the \nLaurasian Institution.\n  JALEX is unlike many exchange programs because it is reciprocal, \npairing novice teachers from Japan with mentor teachers of Japanese in \nthe United States at the precollegiate level. The program is designed \nto mutually benefit teachers from Japan and teachers and students in \nthe United States. JALEX began as a modest prototype serving 18 schools \nin 5 States and has grown to serve 76 schools and community \norganizations in 20 States, including 18 cities in my home State of \nIndiana. JALEX also operates in Washington, Oregon, Utah, Kansas, \nMissouri, Nevada, Tennessee, Iowa, Illinois, Texas, Wisconsin, \nMichigan, Minnesota, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, Connecticut, \nMaine, and Vermont.\n  In the process of achieving its mission--enhancing Japanese language \ninstruction in the United States and classroom experience for native \nJapanese teachers of Japanese-as-a-foreign-language study--the program \nalso provides opportunities for meaningful cultural exchange for \nthousands of American citizens.\n  Since 1985, the study of Japanese in United States schools has grown \nrapidly. Despite the comparative difficulty of Japanese and the \nlongstanding appeal of Romance languages, interest in and demand for \nJapanese language instruction has continued to grow on a global scale.\n  JALEX began in 1992 when President Bush and Prime Minister Miyazawa \nacknowledged the essential role of enhanced Japanese language training \nto advance global partnership between the two nations. During the Tokyo \nsummit in May l996, President Clinton and Prime Minister Hashimoto \nvowed to further promote exchange programs between young people of \nJapan and the United States as a means of strengthening this bilateral \nrelationship.\n  The Center for Global Partnership of the Japan Foundation and the \nFreeman Foundation should be applauded for their generous support of \nthis program.

Mr. President, today, the President's rules \nagainst teenage smoking will go into effect. I applaud President \nClinton for these new rules and for his leadership in fighting youth \nsmoking. It's critically important.\n  Mr. President, it's time to stop beating around the bush about \ntobacco. Tobacco is a deadly addictive drug. And those who deal in this \ndrug are dealers in death. They're responsible for snuffing out the \nlives of thousands each year. And they should be held accountable.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. President, these deadly dealers also have \ntremendous political power. We saw evidence of this earlier this week, \nwhen a spokesman for the attorney general of Virginia said that the \nState would refuse to enforce, or even respect the validity of, this \nFederal rule against teen tobacco use. It was an outrageous and \nshocking statement. And although he has since backed off of it, the \nincident highlights the importance of protecting our children from big \ntobacco, and their deadly drugs.\n  Mr. President, just this week, Gen. Barry McCaffrey, our Nation's \ndrug czar, recognized that cigarettes are a gateway drug, and that we \nwill not be able to effectively fight cocaine, marijuana, and heroin \nuse unless we work to prevent cigarette smoking by children. Children \nwho smoke are eight times more likely to use illicit drugs than those \nwho do not smoke. Of adults who use cocaine, 83 percent smoked \ncigarettes as gateway behavior.\n  Mr. President, it's now clear that the front lines of the drug war \nare not only in Bogota or Mexico City. They're right here in this \ncountry--in the corporate headquarters of tobacco companies and at our \nneighborhood convenience stores. The rule that goes into effect today \nwill prevent kids from engaging in addictive behavior--behavior that \ncould lead to other dangerous and illegal habits. As General McCaffrey \nhas explained, prevention of Teen tobacco addiction is key to our \nnational drug control strategy.\n  Mr. President, the tobacco companies have been peddling these drugs \nto our kids for far too long. Although the industry denies that they \ntarget children in cigarette marketing, that's obviously not true. \nConsider this. How many 6 year olds do you think can identify Joe Camel \nas a symbol for smoking? The answer, incredibly, is 91 percent; 91 \npercent of 6-year-olds link Joe Camel with smoking. That, Mr. \nPresident, is not an accident.\n  Mr. President, tobacco industry marketing doesn't stop with \nadvertising. They also give away products that they know will appeal to \nkids. Over half of adolescents that smoke own at least one tobacco \npromotional item, such as a Tee-shirt, cap, sporting good, or a \nlighter.\n  Today, as the first part of the President's rules will go into \neffect, we will\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nbegin the process of protecting our Nation's children from an industry \nthat kills 410,000 Americans each year. And we can't let the tobacco \nlobby undercut this effort.\n  The rule that goes into effect today would bar the sale of cigarettes \nto persons under the age of 18. Additionally, in order to ensure that \nno children slip through the cracks, stores would be required to check \nthe identification of any individual who appears to be 26 or younger. \nThis Federal rule is necessary because recent studies have shown that \nkids are able to buy cigarettes over the counter 67 percent of the \ntime.\n  I have seen evidence of this problem firsthand. I went along on a \nsting operation in my home State in which I witnessed children purchase \ncigarettes with ease. It was very disturbing, but typical.\n  Mr. President, the rule that goes into effect today is a historic \nfirst step toward eradicating the epidemic of children's smoking \nplaguing our Nation. David Kessler, the outgoing Commissioner of the \nFood and Drug Administration has called this problem a pediatric \ndisease and he is right. Of the 3,000 kids who start smoking every day, \n1,000 will die of smoking-related illness.\n  So, Mr. President, I again commend the administration for their \nbattle against teen smoking. And I pledge here and now that if anyone \ntries to undermine that effort, I will fight it every step of the way.\n  After all, we're talking about saving lives here. The lives of our \nchildren and grandchildren. And all of us have a responsibility to \nstand up to the tobacco lobby, and do the right thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1800-4", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO MEGAN CHAMBERLAIN ON BEING HONORED WITH THE GIRL SCOUT GOLD \n                                 AWARD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I believe that the Congress must \nmake permanent the research and development [R] tax credit. The R \ncredit has proven to be critical to the United States' economic growth \nand international competitiveness. The credit has led to many successes \nin U.S. scientific research and innovation, such as extraordinary \naccomplishments in pure mathematics; unprecedented growth in the power \nand availability of information technology; and rapid progress in \nfinding cures for life threatening diseases such as AIDS, cancer, and \nmultiple sclerosis.\n  For my State of North Dakota, the new information technologies mean \nthat information industries are creating thousands of jobs. Despite \nthese accomplishments, and the obvious long-term benefits, the R \ncredit continuously faces challenges to its existence. Because the R \ncredit has never been made permanent, it has had to be extended seven \ntimes by Congress since its inception. This transitory treatment of the \nR credit has forced R companies to be more hesitant in planning \nfuture research projects. Unfortunately Mr. President, this on-again \noff-again process also led to an unnecessary and disturbing \ncircumstance in 1996. For the first time in the history of its \nconsecutive extensions, last year the R credit was not extended \nretroactively, leaving a gap in the law from July 1, 1995 through July \n1, 1996. The gap has, and will continue to, adversely affect our \ncountry's R efforts. The gap has already contributed to decreased \ninvestment in R and less planning for future R projects by many \ncompanies. Currently, the R credit is due to expire on May 31, 1997.\n  Mr. President, we must act now to permanently extend the R credit \nand send the right signal to our Nation's innovators. Failure to act \nwill not only jeopardize our Nation's research efforts, but it will \nalso threaten the United States's world leadership in R Our Nation's \ngrowth in R investment over the past decade has already been slow \ncompared to Japan, Germany, Italy, and France. Budget realities are \nforcing the United States to further curtail discretionary spending for \nbasic research. In fact, United States non-defense R investment has \nbeen flat at 1.9 percent of GDP after peaking at 2.0 percent in 1985, \nwhile Japan's has continued to grow to 3.0 percent. Although Germany's \nR commitment has been fairly stable at 2.7 percent since 1987, it is \nsignificantly higher than in the United States. One of the main reasons \nthe United States lags behind these countries in R investment is \nbecause these countries offer their innovators generous tax incentives \nfor R, including both deductibility of current expenses and special \ntax credits. Future economic challenges to the United States are also \nlikely to come from developing countries in Asia as they boost R \ninvestment to catch up to the rest of the world.\n  New realities are being shaped by rapidly growing international R \ncapabilities. These new R capabilities have created both global \noptions as well as competitive pressures whose dimension are barely \nunderstood. Unless Congress decides to adapt to these realities and to \nenact a permanent R credit, the United State's leadership in the \nglobal arena may plummet. Such a result will not only adversely impact \nthe United States internationally, but at home as well in lost jobs, \ndiminished economic growth and a decreased standard of living.\n  As we prepare for the 21st century, we must remain committed to \nproviding an environment that fosters technological investment, \nscientific exploration, and global competitiveness. Future economic \ngrowth and the prosperity of all Americans depends on continued R \nAmerica' well being depends on it. Let's remove the uncertainty \nsurrounding the R credit's extension once and for all, and extend the \ncredit permanently.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1801-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1801-S1802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STAND DOWN OF A-6E INTRUDER\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am proud today to honor the \nretirement of the Navy's A-6E Intruder. Attack Squadron 196 at Whidbey \nNaval Air Station in my home State and Attack Squadron 75 in Virginia \nBeach will stand down the final two Intruder squadrons in simultaneous \nceremonies today.\n  As the backbone of carrier attack aviation for the past 36 years, the \nA-6E Intruder stood ready to face the enemy in any weather, day or \nnight. The A-6 put teeth in the term ``carrier forward presence.'' It \nsaw combat in Vietnam, Lebanon, Libya, in the waters of the Arabian \nGulf and over the shores of Kuwait and Iraq. It delivered iron bombs, \nlaser guided bombs, and every air-to-ground missile available in the \nNavy inventory for the past three decades. The A-6E Intruder was the \nhardest working plane on the flight deck.\n  The pilots and bombardier/navigators who flew the Intruder had great \naffection and respect for the aircraft and its ability to withstand \nheavy enemy fire. They too should be honored for their courage and \ndedication to this great nation. They will truly miss the A-6.\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\n  We also honor the thousands of Intruder maintainers, both past and \npresent, who kept the A-6E flying day and night, at sea and ashore. The \nexcellent record of the Intruder is a testament to the hard work of \nthese men and women.\n  Finally, let us remember the Intruder crews who never returned. In \nservice to our Nation, they paid the ultimate price flying this machine \nthat they loved. We must never forget them. From this day on, the \nUnited States Navy must continue to carry on the spirit of Intruder \nattack.\n  On a personal basis, my son-in-law, Joe Nortz, was an A-6 bombardier/\nnavigator during most of his 20-year Navy career. He is attending the \nstand down ceremony at NAS Whidbey as a great admirer of a great \naircraft.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1801-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATION OF THE 125TH ANNIVERSARY OF CONCORD COLLEGE\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on February 28, 1872, the West \nVirginia State Legislature passed a proposal to create the Concord \nState Normal School. Now, 125 years later, Concord College, as it is \ncommonly referred to, educates some 2,400 students in a wide range of \nprograms. I wanted to take this opportunity to share with my colleagues \nmy pride in this remarkable institution that celebrates its 125th year \nof bringing southern West Virginia's best and brightest together.\n  The enabling legislation that created Concord provided no State funds \nfor the school. So the townspeople raised $1,700 by subscription to \nerect the first building on land donated by Mr. William Harvey Martin. \nOn May 10, 1875, 70 students attended classes that first session in a \nrough frame building. In 1885, under the leadership of principal Capt. \nJames Harvey French, the school received $5,000 in State funds to build \na new brick building to recognize the service given the State by the \nschool. That new building was completed in 1887, and the first \ndormitory was built in 1891, on North State Street. In 1896, the town \nin which the college is located changed its name to Athens in \nrecognition of Concord's role as a crucial and influential center of \neducation for southern West Virginia.\n  In November 1910, the downtown facilities were destroyed by fire. The \nfaculty and students were resilient, as typical West Virginians are, \nand they began holding classes the next day in other locations about \ntown. The current campus site on Vermillion Street in Athens was bought \nby the town in early 1911. The campus endured a second and even more \ndamaging fire in 1912, but Concord rebounded stronger than ever.\n  On July 1, 1919, Concord gained its independence from the State \nNormal School in Huntington. The title of principal of the institution \nwas changed to president. The school awarded its first baccalaureate \ndegree to three graduates in June 1923. Eight years later the school \nchanged its name to the Concord State Teachers' College. Under the \ndirection of President Joseph Franklin Marsh, Sr., the named changed \nagain in 1943, to the current Concord College.\n  President Joseph F. Marsh, Jr., one of the longest serving \npresidents, oversaw the construction of the Alexander Fine Arts Center, \nCentennial Hall, three residence halls, the faculty housing units at \nWitherspoon Park, and the maintenance building. Years later, in the \nadministration of President Meredith N. Freeman, enrollment grew and \nseveral new academic programs were established. And as of 1991, under \nthe direction of current president, Jerry Beasley, Concord became one \nof the first institutions in the Nation to join the prestigious Bonner \nScholars Program. The Bonner Program rewards students who are actively \ninvolved in public service by helping to finance their college \neducation.\n  This program, in particular, is very dear to me. In 1964, I moved to \nWest Virginia as a VISTA volunteer. To see that our young people want \nto be involved in community service warms my heart and gives me hope \nfor the future.\n  In recognition of the legislative act founding Concord State Normal \nSchool, an anniversary convocation has been designated for today in \nAthens.\n  Mr. President, Concord College is an enormously important part of \nWest Virginia higher education, and continues to be an institution West \nVirginia residents are proud of. The 125th anniversary convocation \ntaking place today is a program commemorating the college's beginning--\nand its future. I have no doubt the school's future will continue to be \na bright one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1802-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO GEORGE BALD ON BEING NAMED THE ROCHESTER BUSINESS LEADER OF \n                                THE YEAR\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncommend George Bald, the economic development director for the Pease \nDevelopment Authority and a Rochester community leader, on being named \nthe Rochester Business Leader of the Year. I congratulate him for his \nrecord of excellence in business and community development.\n  George Bald's record of achievement is certainly worthy of this \noutstanding honor. In 1978, he was elected mayor of Somersworth where \nhe served until 1984. He had a bold plan for the Rochester area which \nspearheaded the development of a new municipally owned industrial park \nwhile utilizing an existing park. George's next endeavor was as head of \nthe newly established economic development department where he became \nknown for exceptional economic success. Through his leadership, \nRochester was effectively promoted as an attractive business location. \nHe also strengthened relations with existing industries. Thanks to \nGeorge's efforts, Rochester became the corporate headquarters of \nCabletron Systems and during his tenure thousands of new jobs have been \ncreated.\n  George also helped establish a solid foundation on which the city of \nRochester will continue to grow. From 1991 to 1993, he became city \nmanager and in 1994, George was entrusted the position of economic \ndevelopment director for the Pease Development Authority. He served on \nthe Industrial Affairs Council at the Chamber of Commerce and the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee.\n  His outstanding community support is demonstrated in his \nparticipation with the Heritage Trust and his service on several boards \nof directors such as the Frisbie Memorial Hospital, the Rochester \nVisiting Nurses Association, the Gafney Home and the Somersworth \nHousing Authority. George is a former vice president of the New \nHampshire Association of Industrial Agents, a member of the American \nEconomic Development Council and a director of the Northeast Industrial \nDevelopers Association. Equally important, his friends know him for his \nintegrity and dedication and as a man who is willing to go the extra \nmile to help his community.\n  I wish to congratulate George for his recognition as Rochester's \nBusiness Leader of the Year, and I am proud to represent George in the \nU.S. Senate. He has certainly earned this praise from the business \ncommunity he has sought to help over the years. Congratulations \nGeorge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1802-2", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1802-S1803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         VONNIE AND DALE BROWN\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the great State of North Dakota has \nbrought forth many sons and daughters who have made tremendous \ncontributions to our Nation and our world. Throughout its history, our \nState has given rise to individuals of great character, strong \nperseverance, and expansive vision. Today, I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing two such individuals of whom North Dakota is very \nproud: Vonnie and Dale Brown.\n  A native of Columbus, ND, Vonnie Ness was the daughter of Martha and \nClifford Ness and the granddaughter of Norwegian homesteaders, who came \nto the United States in the 1800's to settle in North Dakota. Possessed \nwith both a great love and talent for dance, Vonnie graduated with a \ndegree from Minot State University. When she and Dale married and later \nmoved to Baton Rouge, LA, she combined a career as an instructor at \nLouisiana State University with the responsibilities of full-time \nmotherhood to their daughter, Robyn. For many years, Vonnie taught a \nvariety of dance courses at LSU where she was a much-loved and highly \npopular instructor. Since leaving LSU, she has continued her \ninternationally acclaimed research in ethnic and folk\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\ndance and maintains an extensive schedule of travel throughout eastern \nEurope as a preeminent scholar in this field.\n  Born in Minot, ND, 61 years ago, Dale grew up in the most challenging \nof circumstances. He was raised in a single-parent home by a mother, \nAgnes Brown, whose strength of character and persistence in the face of \ngreat poverty kept the family together. Dale's life is a testament to \novercoming hardship through optimism and hard work. Indeed, he has \nnever not worked, having held a job throughout his childhood and young \nadulthood to support his family and help pay for his college education \nat Minot State, of which he is also a proud alumnus. In turn, North \nDakota and Minot State University are extremely proud of him. When he \narrived at LSU, charged with reestablishing a once-powerful basketball \nprogram that had fallen on hard times, Dale took to the task with his \nusual blend of tenaciousness and God-given ability. It was not long \nbefore the Fighting Tigers were living up to their name, and LSU was \nonce again on the map as a basketball powerhouse.\n  The statistics are in the record books and speak for themselves. \nSince he arrived at LSU in 1972, Dale's teams have gone on to secure \nfour Southeastern Conference titles, made 13 NCAA tournament \nappearances, including two trips to the Final Four, and provided \nthousands of hours of enjoyment to spectators who appreciated seeing \nskill and sportsmanship in college basketball. Over 25 years he has \nrecruited, coached, and mentored a long list of players who have had \nsignificant careers in the NBA.\n  But the record books don't even begin to tell the full story of what \nDale Brown has done at LSU and contributed to our society. Ask any of \nthe players he has coached what it is that they most value about their \nexperience at LSU and they will tell you, clearly and simply, ``It's \nbeen an honor playing for him.'' A current team member recently said in \nan article in the Washington Post about Dale's upcoming retirement, \n``He just teaches you more than basketball. He teaches you how to be \nsuccessful in life. Every day it's always more than basketball. It's \nhow to have an interview, how to hold a job. He's always bringing in \nmotivational speakers to talk to us.''\n  Too often in college sports, the goal of developing mature young \nwomen and men is forgotten to the all-consuming need to win, to show \nmore skill on the playing field takes precedence overall else. To be \nsure, Dale Brown has compiled a record of great success on the \nbasketball court; his players have benefited from his technical skill \nand coaching ability and have played very, very well. But his greatest \nlegacy will be the players who have matured, through exposure to his \ncharacter and example, into fine human beings. Our society needs more \nof these people and we need more teachers like Dale and like Vonnie to \nhelp our young people aim high and grow.\n  As Dale prepares to leave his position at LSU, coaching his last game \nthis Saturday, we would like to recognize him and Vonnie for their \ncontributions and wish them well as they enter this exciting new period \nof their lives together. Many new experiences await them, but some \nthings will remain; undoutedbly, they will continue to leave their own \nspecial marks on the people they encounter and the lives they touch \nevey day.\n  Mr. President, North Dakota is a State of achievers, of people who \novercome adversity and who embody the most noble characteristics of our \npioneer ancestors and try their hardest, sometimes failing, but never \nquitting. Such is the example set for us by Vonnie and Dale Brown. \nVonnie and Dale live in Louisiana now, but they will forever be North \nDakotans, carrying forth their fellowman that make our State strong and \nall of us proud. I ask my fellow Senators to join me in saluting them \ntoday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1802-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO GILES PRIDE\n\n Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the work of \nNashville's own Capt. Giles Pride. Giles Pride has been a cornerstone \nto the success and service of the Nashville Fire Department for 52 \nyears. At age 72, he is hanging up his fireman's hat and flame \nretardant jacket.\n  Pride began his career at the young age of 19, when he said he was \n21-years-old in order to meet the eligibility requirements for joining \nthe fire department. He was given very little training, worked 12 hours \na day, and was paid $150 a month. That was in 1944, and at his \nretirement he had served longer than any other full-time firefighter in \nthe State of Tennessee.\n  Over the years, Pride has seen many advancements in firefighting, \nfrom the introduction of more innovative equipment to new strategies \nfor fighting certain types of fires.\n  Mr. President, the work of a fireman is not always pleasant. Giles \nPride has plenty of memories of comradery and friendship at Nashville's \nFire Department. But he has also faced the hard reality of putting his \nlife on the line every day to save the lives of others. Captain Pride \nhas given 52 years of his life to the people of Nashville.\n  Too many times we hear of fire taking and destroying the lives of its \nvictims. Not often enough do we thank the firefighters, like Captain \nPride, who bring safety and security to our communities. Today, Mr. \nPresident, I tip my hat to Capt. Giles Pride for a job well done, and I \nwish him all the best in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1803-1", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO MELISSA BROWN ON BEING HONORED WITH THE GIRL SCOUT GOLD \n                                 AWARD\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I am pleased to have joined my \ncolleagues in supporting final passage of H.R. 668, an urgently needed \nmeasure to reimpose the aviation excise taxes through the end of fiscal \nyear 1997, and give the Internal Revenue Service authority to transfer \npreviously collected aviation excise taxes into the Airport and Airway \nTrust Fund.\n  Reinstatement of these excise taxes for fiscal year 1997 are \nessential to the continued operation of our Federal aviation system. \nThe Airport and Airway Trust Fund into which these taxes are deposited, \nis funded by a 10-percent passenger ticket tax; a 6.25-percent cargo \nwaybill tax; a $6.00 per person international departure tax; and \ncertain general aviation fuel taxes. In 1997, this trust fund is \nexpected to provide 62 percent of the Federal Aviation Administration's \n[FAA] fiscal year 1997 budget. More specifically, the trust fund is \nexpected to provide $5.3 billion of the FAA's $8.6 billion total fiscal \nyear 1997 budget. Of this $5.3 billion, $3.6 billion will provide 100 \npercent of the resources necessary to fund the FAA's capital programs, \nwhile $1.7 billion will provide 34 percent of the fiscal year 1997 \nbudget for FAA operations.\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n  When the authority to collect the aviation excise taxes lapsed on \nDecember 31, 1996, officials from both the General Accounting Office \n[GAO] and the FAA initially predicted that the $4.35 billion in \nuncommitted balances in the fund at that time would be available to \nfund the FAA's capital programs through June 30, 1997. If Congress did \nnot reinstate the taxes by July 1, 1997, they predicted, the Office of \nManagement and Budget [OMB] would have to reduce the FAA's capital \naccounts, which are totally funded out of the trust fund--including \nboth the facilities and equipment [F] account and Airport Improvement \nProgram, to account for the $1 billion shortfall between the trust \nfund's fiscal year 1997 expected contribution of $5.3 and the actual \ncontribution of $4.35.\n  According to the FAA, this reduction in the facilities and equipment \naccount could force the FAA to issue stop work orders on all major F \ncontracts, which include upgrades of the current air traffic control \nsystem throughout the country. The Airport Improvement Program would \nsuffer an even greater impact. Under the original projections, if the \naviation taxes were not reinstated, funding for the airport improvement \nwould have to be reduced by as much as $300 million in fiscal year \n1997. Existing funding agreements under the AIP would be maintained, \nbut no new, discretionary funding would be provided for high priority \nsafety and security projects, capacity projects, and important noise \nmitigation programs.\n  From a Washington State perspective, fiscal year 1997 funding for \nnoise mitigation is particularly important. Seattle-Tacoma \nInternational Airport has been a national leader in noise mitigation \nprograms and was the first to implement a local housing insulation \nprogram to reduce the impact on houses near the airport. The current \nprogram, which is partially funded through the AIP's discretionary \nnoise mitigation grants, is scheduled to run through the year 2003.\n  Under the FAA and GAO's original projections, it was clear that \nreinstating the taxes as quickly as possible was the appropriate action \nfor Congress to take to ensure that the U.S. aviation system continues \nto be the best system in the world. The need to do this became even \nmore urgent in mid-January, however, when the Treasury Department \nannounced that because of an accounting error, the Airport and Airway \nTrust Fund could be insolvent as early as March or April.\n  Let me explain the events, as I understand them, which led to \naccounting error made at by the Treasury Department. Each airline \ndeposits the ticket taxes it collects to the IRS every 2 weeks. Under \nthe look-back provisions of the IRS safe harbor rule, however, an \nairline can base the amount of that payment on the amount of excise \ntaxes it collected in a 2-week period from the second preceding quarter \nbefore the current quarter. In other words, in making a 2-week tax \npayment in the third quarter of the year, an airline can deposit the \namount it collected in a 2-week period during the first quarter of that \nyear. If the taxes it deposits are less than what the airline actually \ntook in during the third quarter, the airline can make up that \nunderpayment when it files its quarterly return. The quarterly return \ndate is approximately 2 months after the close of the quarter.\n  The 10-percent ticket tax was in place during the fourth quarter of \n1996. The airlines semimonthly tax payments for that quarter, however, \nwere based on the second quarter of 1996, during which time no excise \ntaxes were collected. The airlines, in essence, did not remit any \nexcise taxes during the fourth quarter of 1996, even though they were \ncollecting these taxes from passengers at that time. The airlines had \nto make up for these tax underpayments by the time they file their \nfourth quarter returns, which are due today. Without this legislation, \nhowever, these taxes would not be deposited into the aviation trust \nfund, since the general-fund-to-trust-fund transfer authority expired \nalong with the aviation excise taxes on December 31, 1996.\n  It appears that the Treasury Department did not account for the \ncomplex accounting procedures, and assumed that the trust fund would be \ncredited with $1.5 billion more than it could have been, unless \nCongress reinstated the authority for the IRS to transfer the fourth \nquarter excise taxes to the trust fund.\n  Last night, the Senate passed the bill that will avert the imminent \ninsolvency of the trust fund and ensure that our aviation system \nremains the best and safest in the world. The temporary reinstatement \nof the excise taxes, however, does not necessarily mean that the taxes \nshould be extended indefinitely. Last year, Congress created the \nNational Civil Aviation Review Commission [NCARC] to study new \nmechanisms to fund the FAA after an indepedent audit of FAA needs. The \nreport on the independent audit of the FAA's projected needs was \nreleased today, February 28, and now the NCARC can do its work and \nreport back to Congress in early October 1997. While I would have \npreferred to maintain the aviation taxes through the end of the year to \nensure that there was not another lapse while Congress thoroughly \nconsiders the NCARC recommendations, procedural and time contraints \nmade it impossible to do this. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/02/28/senate-section/article/S1803-3", "month": "02", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "28", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO BRYCE PICKERING, THE 1997 U.S. SENATE YOUTH PROGRAM DELEGATE \n                           FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.
