He has been pastor to me and my \nfamily, the majority leader and his family, the President pro tempore \nand his family, and others of our colleagues in both the Senate and the \nHouse.\n  ``Pastor'' is the appropriate word because of his love and his \naffection and his endearment that he has displayed toward us and our \nfamilies. And we feel exactly the same way about him.\n  Dr. Jones is a graduate of Texas Christian University, and Southwest \nBaptist Theological Seminary. He has been pastor of churches in Texas, \nbut the primary focus of his ministry has been with Columbia Baptist \nChurch in Falls Church, Virginia going back as far as March of 1969.\n  He is currently retired. It is a loss to the people who have attended \nfaithfully over the years Columbia Baptist Church.\n  But, again, to his dear wife, Betty, and his family and his \ngrandchildren, and the many organizations that he has been associated \nwith and continues to be associated with--I will just name two of \nthose: He is a member of the University Board of Regents at Baylor \nUniversity in Texas, and has been on the Executive Board of Prison \nFellowship from its very inception.\n\n  Reverend Jones has a gift of prayer, and, as we heard this morning, \nan eloquence in prayer. I hope someday, if he has not already, that he \nwill publish those prayers because they are exceptional.\n  And he also has the gift of remembering those with whom he has come \nin contact with. Every once in a while I will receive a note with a \nprayer attached to it personalized to me and to our family, ``Just \nthinking of you, wanted to share this thought, your friend, Neal.''

Mr. President, I, too, would like to join in extending my\n\n[[Page S190]]\n\nthanks to Dr. Neal Jones, and to express my appreciation to him for \nwhat he has meant in my own life and my family's life.\n  He was a pastor at Columbia Baptist Church. My family and I attended \nthere during the years that our children were in their teens, and it \nwas a wonderful experience. As a matter of fact, he baptized our \ndaughter, our son, and even my wife. So I have a special feeling in my \nheart for that church and for the pastor. We are delighted to have you \nhere today.\n  I, too, want to thank you for those little messages that I get at \ncritical times in my life. Sometimes I am under certain pressure, and \nDr. Jones seems to sense it. But he has a wonderful message always at \nthe end: ``No response necessary.''\n  Thank you, Dr. Jones, for all you do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S189-9", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, this morning the Senate will proceed to 2 \nhours of morning business with several Senators recognized for \nindividual periods of time.\n  At 12 noon it is my hope that the Senate can consider the Ronald \nReagan Airport naming bill and/or the Senate concurrent resolution \ncondemning Iraq's threat to international peace and security. It was my \nhope that the minority leader would be able to enter into a reasonable \ntime agreement on both of these issues which would allow for the debate \nto occur today and any amendments and votes on those amendments and \nfinal passage to occur on the morning of Tuesday, February 3rd. I am \nnow informed at this point that will not be possible. Therefore, those \nvotes could occur today.\n  Now, there are some ominous signs on the horizon that really bother \nme. This is the first week that we are back. It takes a little time to \nget back in the swing of things. I understand that. I know Senators \ndidn't expect a lot to occur in terms of votes this week. But already I \nhave had numerous Senators come to me and say, ``Oh, could we not have \nvotes on Thursday? Certainly we will not have them on Friday and \nMonday, and, by the way, I can't vote on Tuesday morning.''\n  There is a limit to how much the Democratic leader and I can \ncooperate with Senators in protecting their schedules. I certainly have \na record that shows that I am sensitive to that. I would like for the \nSenate to work during the daylight instead of night, for instance, and \nwe achieved that to some degree. But if every Senator thinks that he or \nshe can inconvenience 99 Senators because they have some little bit \nthey want to do somewhere, that is not the way it is going to work this \nyear. They should not start out that way.\n\n  So I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, don't do this. \nDon't even come to leadership on both sides of the aisle and say, ``Can \nyou defer a vote on Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday?'' or, for that \nmatter, late Monday afternoons or Friday mornings. We have legislative \ndays this year that will probably add up to around 100 days and a lot \nof work to do--a lot of important budget issues, infrastructure issues, \nforeign policy issues that we can't ignore or delay.\n  So I am not threatening. I am not complaining yet. This is the \nkickoff. We will get going here pretty quickly. But I am having \ndifficulty getting Senators to be ready to go to work. I have at least \nfour bills that we should consider this week or next week, and for one \nreason or another I am being told, ``Well, we are not quite ready.''\n  The recess is over. It is time for the class to get back to work, and \nlet's work to do that.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be glad to yield to the Senator from South Dakota, \nthe Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I sympathize with the majority leader's \nproblem and tell him that I share the same frustration. I have had \nSenators come to me this week who indicated that they can't be here on \na particular day this week. I have noted, while we will try to \naccommodate those problems this week, that people need to be here. They \nneed to be prepared to vote. They need to recognize that we have very \nlimited time and that we have a lot of work ahead of us. We are not \ngoing to be able to do it if all we have is Wednesday afternoon. But \nthat in essence seems to be the attitude: we will try to do all of our \nwork on Wednesday afternoons. That isn't going to work around here.\n  Whether you are in the minority or the majority, we have a lot of \nthings we know we must do. We can't afford the luxury of having more \nand more of these scheduling conflicts and relegate the Nation's \nbusiness and the Senate's business to Wednesday afternoon.\n  So I want to assure the majority leader of my determination to see \nthat we put in a full week, that we get the work done, and that we try \nto accomplish all that I know he and the rest of us would like to \naccomplish this year.\n  I thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank Senator Daschle for his cooperation in this. This \nis not just on one side of the aisle. We are both working this problem. \nWe will fulfill our obligation as leaders in ways that have not always \nbeen the case around here.\n  Senators have already been told when they can expect to be in session \nor have recess periods for the whole year. We will indicate as far in \nadvance as we can when we may not have a vote on Friday or Monday if we \nknow for sure, for instance, that there is a conflicting conference. We \nwill also try to have a legislative calendar that really shows the \nbills we are going to be dealing with all year.\n  So we will give everybody as much advance notice as we possibly can, \nand then we would expect cooperation in return.\n  On the Iraq resolution, this is an important resolution. This is a \nsensitive time. I think we should think about it carefully. There is no \nneed to rush to judgment. We ought to talk about it. We ought to think \nabout it. We ought to make it clear what our concerns are about Saddam \nHussein and the fact that the inspectors are not in Iraq. We need to \nthink about its ramifications not only for the region but the world. We \nneed our allies to be with us--not just the British but the French, the \nRussians, and the Chinese, and everybody else because this is a threat \nto the whole world. We need to make it clear that the present situation \nwill not stand.\n\n  This resolution that Senator Daschle and I have been working on, as \nalways you have to craft it with words of art. You have to make sure \nthat you have the right words in there. And we do not want to go beyond \nwhat is responsible. But I think that it is timely. I think we would \nhave been doing this resolution sometime in the first 2 weeks at the \nbeginning of this year regardless of other events unrelated to this. \nThis is something that the Senate usually does.\n  So again, I urge Senators to look this resolution over. Let's do the \nresponsible thing and let's do it very quickly. We need to have a full \ndiscussion. We need to do it today. And we can do it again on Monday. \nBut we should vote on it on Tuesday. If not, it could be overrun by \nother events maybe not as important. But we already have the schedule \nset for Tuesday in terms of some debate and some votes on nominations. \nWe have a couple of other bills that we are considering for next week.\n  Senator Daschle will work with me. And let's just talk today about \nhow we can proceed today and whether or not we know we are going to \nhave votes today or when we can be assured we will have votes on \nTuesday morning.\n  Thank you, again, and I thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S190-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

TOM OSBORNE\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, this morning I come to the floor to \nrecognize a man who has lived the American ideals of integrity, courage \nand, leadership. This man, Mr. President, is Dr.\n\n[[Page S191]]\n\nTom Osborne, head football coach of the University of Nebraska \nCornhuskers.\n  My good friend and Nebraska colleague, former Governor of the State \nof Nebraska, Senator Bob Kerrey, joins me in this recognition this \nmorning.\n  I have also informed my good friends and colleague from the State of \nMichigan, where there seems to be some controversy as to which football \nteam really was No. 1 at the end of the season, Michigan or Nebraska, \nthat I would welcome their support in recognition as well. Quite \nhonestly, and seriously, Mr. President, Senators Levin and Abraham have \nasked me to extend to Dr. Osborne their best wishes as well. Of course, \nwith the distinguished Presiding Officer being a leader in the Kansas \nState Wildcats' efforts over the last few years, I, too, will add your \ngood wishes for Dr. Osborne, and thank you, Mr. President.\n  After 25 years as head coach, Tom Osborne has decided to retire and \ndevote more of his time to his family and important voluntary \norganizations. Tom Osborne has been a constant in Nebraska sports \nhistory. In 1955, as a high school student in Hastings, NE, he was \nnamed the Omaha World Herald's High School Athlete of the Year. He \ncontinued his success in athletics at Hastings College where he was a \nstarter on both the school's football and basketball teams. Once again, \nin 1958, the Omaha World Herald honored him with the College Athlete of \nthe Year award.\n  After a stint in the National Football League with the San Francisco \n49ers and the Washington Redskins, he landed at the University of \nNebraska in 1962. Shortly thereafter, he joined the now legendary \nfootball coach, the late Bob Devaney, and coordinated the offense for \nNebraska's national championship teams in 1970 and 1971. In 1973 Tom \ntook over from the retiring Devaney as head coach of the Nebraska \nCornhuskers.\n  Tom Osborne made lasting impressions on his players and people of \nNebraska and all of college football. His resume is unprecedented and \nessentially unbelievable--a 25-year record of 255 wins, 49 losses and 3 \nties. Over the past 5 years, his Cornhusker teams posted an NCAA record \nof 60 wins and 3 losses. Coach Osborne led the Huskers to three \nnational championships--1994, 1995 and 1997 in which the Huskers shared \nthe title, as I mentioned, with the University of Michigan. Tom led the \nHuskers to 13 Big 8/Big 12 Conference titles, 25 straight 9 win seasons \nand 25 straight bowl appearances.\n  With all these accomplishments by his teams on the field, it should \nalso be noted that, under Coach Osborne, Nebraska had 46 first team \nacademic All-Americans and 201 academic all-conference honorees, and \nthe graduation rate of Osborne's players leads and has led the Big 8/\nBig 12 Conference and is ranked also as one of the highest graduation \nrates in the Nation.\n  Tom Osborne loved coaching. It was his life. But he was more. He was \nmore than just a coach. If you would ask any of his players, they would \ntell you that he was a father figure, a good friend. Osborne had many \nopportunities to leave college football and coach in the National \nFootball League, but he never did. He had many opportunities to leave \nNebraska, but he never did. He loved the coaching and the teaching \nassociated with college football. But probably more than that, he loved \nthe opportunity to help his players grow mentally and spiritually and \nbecome outstanding citizens. As Coach Osborne has said over his \nmagnificent career, that in the end is all that counts. When the game \nis over, it is over. But what that young man does with his life at the \nend of his football career is most important; how he contributes to his \ncommunity, to his family and to his nation is most important.\n  The Nebraska football program will continue on successfully. There \nwill be more national championships and conference titles, but Tom \nOsborne will not be at the helm. We all know that he will not be far \naway, however. When spring football practice starts, we probably will \nnot expect to see Coach Osborne on campus. You might locate Coach \nOsborne at a local fishing hole.\n  Tom Osborne will be remembered as one of the greatest college \nfootball coaches ever to stroll up and down the sidelines. His \ncontributions to the University of Nebraska and college football will \nnever be forgotten. When the reigning national co-champions run on to \nTom Osborne Field next fall in Memorial Stadium in Lincoln, there will \nbe something missing. The stoic figure of Tom Osborne will not be \nroaming the field guiding the Cornhuskers to another victory, but his \ninspiration and his legacy will be present.\n  Thank you, Tom, for your leadership and your contributions. Thank \nyou, most importantly, for your character, for serving as a role model \nfor America's young people. You have inspired us all, and you will be \nmissed.\n  We all wish you well. We wish Nancy and your family much continued \nsuccess, good health, happiness, and a little rest--and good fishing.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Tom \nOsborne, the recently retired head coach of the Division I-A collegiate \nfootball co-national champions--my alma mater--the University of \nNebraska, Lincoln.\n  In 1973, Tom Osborne replaced a Nebraska legend, Coach Bob Devaney. \nAs those of us who walk the halls of Congress can attest, succeeding a \nlegend is no easy task.\n  But Coach Osborne immediately proved himself worthy of the job in his \nrookie year with a sweet victory over UCLA. UCLA had ended the Huskers \n32-game winning streak in the beginning of the 1972 season, and the \nsignificance of this victory was not lost on the coach or the fans. It \nwas a fine start to a remarkable 25-year career that until this January \nhad included two national championships.\n  In this, his final season, Coach Osborne led UNL to a perfect record. \nHis well drilled, well disciplined, well-conditioned team played every \nminute, of every quarter, of every game with pride and determination. \nThe 13-0 Huskers played with the guts, grit and determination of a \nchampion. They were rightfully honored as co-champions, along with an \nimpressive University of Michigan squad, after thoroughly whipping the \nthird ranked University of Tennessee and their talented quarterback \nPeyton Manning in the Orange Bowl, on January 2nd. A fitting location \nto end his prestigious career and win a piece of a third national \nchampionship.\n  After the game, when asked about the co-championship possibility, \nCoach Osborne used the class and understatement he is famous for in his \nanswer: ``We had 13 games on our schedule and we won 13 games.'' Can't \nargue with that!\n  Ironic that he would end his career on the same Orange Bowl field \nthat saw the germination of his coaching legend. It was on that same \nfield in 1984 that Tom Osborne defied convention and risked the \nnational championship by forgoing a virtually guaranteed game tying \nextra point and a lock on the national championship, by electing to \nattempt a more risky two-point conversion for an outright win and an \noutright national title. I will spare the details of the failed \nattempt, and say only this: Tom Osborne gained more respect in defeat, \nthan many will ever achieve with victory.\n  I am sure I speak for Nebraska fans as well as Michigan fans--and \nindeed all college football fans across the nation--when I say I would \nhave loved to see the two teams play one more college football game \nthis season. As a banner unfurled by a Nebraska fan at the Orange Bowl \nstated ``Anytime. Anywhere.''\n  Through his dedication to the University, his staff and his players, \nCoach Osborne has brought pride and joy to our state, our university \nand to all Nebraskans. His unique qualities as a coach and person are \nhis unwavering faith and his dedication to the young men who play for \nhim. It is fitting he will be remembered for the man he is, as much as \nfor his abilities as a coach.\n  Keith Jackson, ABC-TV's legendary football announcer recently told \nthe Omaha World-Herald, ``He's a better man than he is a coach. His \ncoaching speaks for itself. You can look up his numbers in the record \nbooks. Less obvious is the way he lives. He's a humanist. Tom Osborne \nalways felt he could help people.''\n  Thank you, Tom Osborne, for all you have given the people of \nNebraska. I salute you and applaud the 1997 University of Nebraska \nFootball Huskers on a job well done.\n\n[[Page S192]]\n\n  Mr. HAGEL.

Mr. President, winter is only half over, and even \nthough there has been some stormy weather here in the Nation's Capital, \nsections of the Northeast experienced the ice storm of the century, \nmaybe the millennium, earlier this month. For 2 days straight, freezing \nrain, snow and sleet battered the Champlain Valley of Vermont, upstate \nNew York and parts of New Hampshire, Maine and the Province of Quebec.\n  Tens of thousands of trees buckled and shattered under the stress and \nweight of several inches of ice that coated their branches. Power lines \nwere ripped down by falling branches and the weight of the ice, leaving \nhundreds of thousands of people without electricity for days and even \nweeks. In fact, some are still without electricity. Roads were covered \nwith ice and rivers swelled and overflowed with heavy rain. The \ncrippling ice storm brought activity in the area to a grinding halt.\n  Just a few days after the storm, Senator Leahy and I visited the \nhardest hit areas of Vermont. The storm's damages were the worst I have \never seen. In the Burlington area, 20 to 25 percent of the trees in \nthat city were toppled or must be chopped down. Another 25 percent were \ndamaged. The storm also destroyed sugar bushes and dropped trees across \nhiking trails and snowmobile trails.\n  Mr. President, local and State emergency officials acted quickly to \nhelp their fellow Vermonters and to assess the damage. Soon after the \nstorm, the President declared six Vermont counties a disaster. The \nresponse from FEMA was impressive, and I thank Director James Witt for \nstanding behind Vermont.\n  Vermonters rallied, with the help of the National Guard, led by \nAdjutant General Martha Rainville, to help themselves and their \nneighbors.\n  As the temperatures dropped below zero days after the storm, with \nthousands still without power, volunteer firefighters, police officers \nand National Guard troops and every able-bodied citizen came together \nworking day and night to help feed, heat and care for the people in \ntheir community.\n  Hardest hit were dairy farmers. Already struggling to make ends meet \ndue to low milk prices, the ice storm left farms without power to milk \ntheir cows. Cows need to be milked twice a day every day. At times, \ncows went for hours and even days without being milked. Fortunately one \nof the missions of the National Guard was to get power generators to \nfarms and to keep them running so that farmers could milk their cows \nand keep their milk cool and preserve the health of the cows.\n  One unit of the National Guard became known as the ``Mobile Milking \nTeam''--or the MMT, as is usual in the military sector to have \nacronyms--by going farm to farm with their generators. However, despite \nthe efforts to bring generators to farmers, for many the damage was \nalready done. Because the margins are already so close for many \nfarmers, the loss of a single milk check could mean staying in business \nor selling out.\n  Mr. President, the organized and volunteer responses to this disaster \nwere incredible. The Vermont Petroleum Association, in conjunction with \nMobile Oil and R.L. Vallee Petroleum, came to the aid of the farmers \nand the homeowners who were relying on their generators to run their \nbusinesses and to heat their homes by graciously donating 8,000 gallons \nof diesel fuel.\n  Stories of Vermonters helping Vermonters were commonly told \nthroughout the disaster counties in the State. Utility companies worked \nlong hours in the cold to help clear debris and restore power. Lines \nmen and women came from as far away as Hawaii to help repair the \ndamage. Let me tell you, the ones from Hawaii had an adventure they \nwill never forget.\n  Vermonters also helped their neighbors to the north just across the \nCanadian border. Two weeks after the storm first hit, over 700,000 \ncitizens in the Providence of Quebec were still without power and over \n30,000 people were relying on meals from local food shelves. I teamed \nup with Cabot Creamery and H.P. Hood to help get 20,000 pounds of \ncheddar cheese, yogurt, and cottage cheese and 1,000 cases of water so \nnecessary through the many restrictions at the border to help feed the \nCanadians who were driven from their homes. Many Vermonters helped by \nsending firewood and heating oil. Thousands of cords of wood were \nshipped over.\n  Mr. President, the citizens and trees of Vermont as well as upstate \nNew York, Maine and New Hampshire have suffered enough from this storm. \nLocal and State assistance will help communities and individuals get \nback on their feet. But Federal relief is needed to ensure that the \ndisaster areas are not overwhelmed by their recovery.\n  I know I speak for Senator Leahy and my colleagues from New York, \nMaine and New Hampshire when I say we all will do what we can to help. \nWe look forward to the coming spring. But before the arrival of warm \nweather, months of hard work to restore Vermont to its pristine beauty \nis needed. And we will all be helping, I assure you.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I asked for 30 minutes today because I \nthink it is very important that we address an issue that will be coming \nbefore the Senate in the very near future. It is an issue that has been \nbrought about by the President's pronouncement that he wants to keep \nour troops in Bosnia in an undefined mission for an undefined time.\n  Mr. President, I think that would be a mistake for our country. I \nhope the Senate will focus on this issue. Indeed, I hope the American \npeople will focus on this issue, because it is going to set a precedent \nthat I think is very bad.\n\n  I do not want to pull up stakes and leave Bosnia without doing it in \na responsible way. I think America has that responsibility. But in fact \nmany of us have asked the President to lay the groundwork with an \nestablished and clear mission that has a chance to succeed and a \nmission that has a finite term so that both our allies and any enemies \nof our cause would know exactly what to expect from America. But in \nfact both our allies and our adversaries could not possibly know what \nto expect from America because in fact America has said it is going to \nleave twice and we have not left. In fairness, we have not left because \nwe have not laid a proper base to leave.\n  What I am asking the President to consider and what I would ask the \nAmerican people to consider is starting the process of an honorable and \nresponsible approach to Bosnia which includes an honorable exit.\n  Mr. President, we are looking at a time when our readiness is being \ncalled into question. In fact, if you look at all of the \nresponsibilities that America has in the world, I think we are spending \ntoo much on Bosnia and therefore putting in jeopardy the security of \nthe United States in the future and the future of our ability to \nrespond to other places where America may have to respond even \nunilaterally. And, Mr. President, that is not what we should be doing.\n  I think it is most important that America start with the issue of \nBosnia,\n\n[[Page S193]]\n\naddress it in the way that America should, and we must look at our \noverall responsibilities in the world.\n  The Bosnia operation has already diverted nearly $8 billion from our \nnational defense. A growing lament at the Pentagon among senior \nofficers is that we are in danger of returning to the hollow military \nof the late 1970s. Let me list some of the indicators that demonstrate \nthat our military is once again at risk.\n  Last year, the military had its worst recruiting year since 1979. The \nArmy failed to meet its objective to recruit infantry soldiers, the \nsingle most important specialty in the Army.\n  A Senate Budget Committee investigator recently reported finding \nserious Army-wide personnel and readiness problems. At the National \nTraining Center, where our troops go for advanced training, units \nrotating in typically come with a 60 percent shortage in mechanics and \noften a 50 percent shortage in infantry. These shortages were blamed on \nthe fact that these personnel, especially the mechanics, are deployed \nabroad for missions such as Bosnia.\n  More than 350 Air Force pilots turned down the $60,000 bonuses they \nwould have received to remain in the cockpit another 5 years. A 29 \npercent acceptance rate for the bonus compares with 59 percent last \nyear and 81 percent in 1995. Mr. President, that is stark difference.\n  The Air Force is finding, whatever the perks, it cannot hold on to \nits best pilots. Last year, about 500 pilots resigned, most of them \nlured to the airlines. This year, the number will top 700, and the Air \nForce says it is not able to train enough new pilots to replace them.\n  Recently, a lack of critical parts for F-16 aircraft forced two \nfighter squadrons in Italy to cannibalize grounded aircraft to ensure \nthey can continue to conduct the NATO peace enforcement mission over \nBosnia.\n  A Senate Budget Committee investigator also found that some small \nunits are now being led by junior people because sergeants are off on \npeacekeeping duty. As a result, subunits, from basic squads on up, do \nnot train with the leaders that they would go to war with, breaking the \nrule of ``train just as you would go to war.''\n  Since 1991, the United States has cut its Armed Forces by about a \nthird. It may be more difficult, more risky and possibly more costly to \ninvade Iraq again now. We are going to debate and vote on a resolution \ntoday expressing our support for the President's strong actions toward \nIraq. But the fact is, if anything went wrong, we would have to divert \ntroops from every theater in the world to prevail. This is not the best \nsituation considering the heavy responsibilities that we have in other \nparts of the world.\n\n  Defense cuts of almost 50 percent over the last decade have put our \nsecurity at risk. But this has been made worse by the diversion of U.S. \nresources and readiness in Bosnia and elsewhere. Policymakers in the \nClinton administration have spent more time discussing Haiti than \nChina, more on Bosnia than on missile defense. We are not developing a \npolicy that is going to put our country in the best position to deal \nwith the myriad of issues that will face this country and our security \nin the next century.\n  The Clinton administration is missing a big-picture view of the world \nand the proper role for the United States. Our growing involvement in \nBosnia is a very good example of that. Just last week, U.S. forces were \ndirectly involved in tracking down and capturing a war criminal who \ncalled himself ``the Serb Hitler.''\n  The Dayton accords made apprehension of war criminals a priority. But \nthose agreements also made it clear that this responsibility would be \nthe responsibility of the parties to Dayton--civilian police and \nGovernment officials. In fact, less than 1 year ago the former NATO \ncommander, George Joulwan, told the Congress this:\n\n       The military are not policemen. And I think . . . the \n     proper responsibility rests on the parties. That is what \n     Dayton says . . . [I]f we are not careful we will go down \n     this slippery slope where the military will be put in the \n     position of hunting down war criminals. This is not within my \n     mandate.\n\n  That is Gen. George Joulwan speaking.\n  I joined with many of my colleagues in the Senate to oppose the \ndecision to send our troops to Bosnia. One of our principal concerns \nwas that, once there, our mission would be indefinite and it would lead \nto mission creep. We were bolstered in our concerns by former Secretary \nof Defense William Perry and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nShalikashvili, who warned us that without a specific deadline for \nwithdrawal, there would be the potential for expanding the mission.\n  I am concerned that Secretary Perry's warnings are coming true. While \nwe were in recess, the President announced that thousands of U.S. \ntroops would remain in Bosnia after the June 30 deadline, and \nremembering that the Senate had unanimously endorsed that deadline of \nJune 30, 1998, which his administration had established.\n  After 240 U.S. Marines were killed in Lebanon in 1984, Defense \nSecretary Caspar Weinberger established six principles upon which the \ndecision to send U.S. ground troops should be based. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       The U.S. should not commit forces unless the engagement is \n     in our vital national interest. If we do commit forces, we \n     should have clearly defined political and military \n     objectives. We should know how those objectives can be \n     accomplished and we should send the appropriate forces to \n     complete the objectives. We must constantly reassess and \n     adjust our relationship between our objectives and forces if \n     necessary. The commitment of troops should be a last resort, \n     not the first.\n\n  We have violated virtually every one of Cap Weinberger's principles \nin Bosnia. Bosnia was supposed to be a 1-year peacekeeping operation \nthat would keep the factions apart until their own forces could come in \nand keep the peace from the ground up. They would have local elections \nand general elections for their national leadership. They would begin \nto resettle refugees.\n\n  Two years have gone by since Dayton. I was in Brcko in August, one \nweek before the eruption in Brcko in which U.S. troops were harmed. I \nwas able to see how far we had come. It was my fourth trip to Bosnia, \nmy sixth trip in 2 years to the whole region. I'm going back next week \nwith other concerned Members of Congress.\n  What I saw in Brcko was the resettling of refugees who did not even \nmeet their neighbors from the other factions, even though they were \nliving next door to each other. The atrocities committed right there in \nBrcko against thousands of Muslims are as bad as anything I have ever \nheard reported from the Nazi atrocities in World War II, and yet we are \ntrying to say come and live together in the American way. I have called \nthis an attempt to Americanize the Balkans--multiethnic neighborhoods \nwhich we, thank goodness, do have in America--but forcing people to do \nthis so prematurely could be antipeaceful. I think it is going to \nprolong the uprisings if we try to force this before the people \nthemselves are ready, before the wounds have healed from the atrocities \nthat have been committed.\n  That is why I have suggested that perhaps it would be better to take \none step in between. Let the peace settle in. Let the economic \ndevelopment start. The geographic regions established by the conflict \nand endorsed by the Dayton accords are nearly 90 percent homogenous. \nThe Bosnian state is 90 percent Muslim. Srpska, the Serb part of \nBosnia, is 95 percent Serb. Croatia is almost exclusively Croatian.\n  Within these divisions they are beginning to be able to have a \nsemblance of government, but they are not going to get economic \nstability if forced refugee settlement continues to cause further \nconflict.\n  The ``elections'' that they held last year were elections in which \nthe voters came in under armed guard. They voted for people who cannot \nlive there. They left under armed guard and the people elected cannot \nserve. They are themselves exiles from the regions they ``represent.'' \nWe have declared that a victory. Mr. President, people elected by \nvoters under armed guard, and the people elected are not even living \nthere is not what I consider an election in our sense of the word.\n  There are other things that I hope we consider in trying to have a \npositive approach to the situation we face today. There are a variety \nof conditions that I suggest would lay a ground work for a peaceful \nsituation in Bosnia, that would allow them to begin to grow and build \nin economic stability, and in\n\n[[Page S194]]\n\nwhich America could have an honorable exit. Hopefully, our European \nallies and our Russian allies who are there on the ground, as well, \nwould be able to leave the country in the hands of its own people.\n  First, reconvene the Dayton parties for a progress check. Be willing \nto modify where it is necessary. Dayton was certainly brought about by \npeople who want to do the right thing. It is not bad to say that we \nshould come back together and assess where we are 2 years later and \nmodify, if necessary. I think the administration could take the lead \nhere.\n  Second, establish a civilian-led and operated police training task \nforce. Establish a police training academy capable of graduating 500 \npolice every quarter. A similar process was attempted in Haiti. General \nJoulwan was a strong supporter of this approach.\n  Third, establish the remaining ground troops as a combined joint task \nforce in accordance with the President's own partnership for peace \ninitiative, originally under American command, but to be turned over to \nallied command within a specific period of months. This should include \nsignificant participation by prospective NATO allies--Poland, the Czech \nRepublic and Hungary--as an opportunity to bear the burden of post-cold \nwar European security.\n  Four, require the administration to make a supplemental \nappropriations request for Bosnia of a specified duration in advance of \nits spending the funds. Mr. President, this should not come from our \ndefense budget. We cannot take from our defense readiness to the tune \nof $3 billion a year and expect to be able to keep a military that has \na quality of life that would continue to attract our best and \nbrightest, and it most certainly should not take from our strategic \ndefenses for the future.\n\n  Last, build a firewall between Bosnia operating funds and procurement \nand research and development funds. It is very important that we begin \nto look at letting the people of Bosnia have some form of self-\ndetermination. Without conditioning our continued troop commitment to \nBosnia, I'm afraid we are trying to put a round peg in a square hole. \nWe would be looking at American troops indefinitely. We would be \nlooking at a never-ending commitment, and we would be taking resources \nthat are vitally necessary for our own security and for our \nresponsibilities around the world.\n  Mr. President, I think it is most important that we look at this \nissue of Bosnia and establish a policy that has a chance to succeed. If \nthe President would do that, I would be the first in line to support \nthe decision. As a matter of fact, I think keeping thousands of troops \nin a 30,000-troop enclave in Bosnia in perpetuity is not good military \nstrategy and is not based on a policy that has a chance to succeed. \nRemember what General Shalikashvili said, and that is that having a \ndefined deadline is important to avoid mission creep. We have learned \nthat before and we should not forget that lesson. I think it is \nimportant that we continue to reassess Bosnia because this is laying \nthe predicate for our responsibilities and our actions in the world in \nthe future.\n  I think it is possible to have a policy that has a chance to succeed \nwith honorable American involvement. I think Americans will support a \ncontinued troop commitment if it has a chance to succeed. Teddy \nRoosevelt was right. He said ``America must speak softly and carry a \nbig stick.'' That is the role of a superpower. We don't have to shout. \nWe do not have to have troops on the ground at every civil uprising \naround the world. If we do, we make enemies and we are in danger of \ndoing that right now with the Serbs. We will become the focal point and \nthe target of the hostilities and then we will be in a situation where \nwe will have to defend ourselves. We need to step back and act like a \nsuperpower.\n  Once we make a commitment we must be willing to back it up and do \nwhat we say we are going to do. That is what is so important about \nacting firmly in Iraq. We must be a good and solid ally and we must be \na feared and respected enemy. That is what a superpower should be. We \nmust realize our place in the world. Make sure our defenses are strong. \nMake sure we are not dissipating our resources to such an extent that \nwe will not be there when only we have the capacity to act.\n  I will close with a quote from John Quincy Adams when he was \nPresident, and it is still good today. ``America well knows, that while \nonce enlisting under other banners than her own, she will involve \nherself beyond extraction in all wars of interest and intrigue. The \nfundamental maxims of her policy would change from loyalty to force, \nwherever the standard of freedom and independence has been or will be \nunfurled there will America's heart be. She goes not abroad in search \nof monsters to destroy. She is a well wisher to the freedom and \nindependence of all.''\n  Mr. President, it is most important that America not succumb to the \npenchant for wanting to go out and get involved in every conflict in \nthe world but remember as a superpower we have a unique capability to \nbring warring parties to the table because we are not a party that is \nhostile to any nation. Mr. President, we could lose that special status \nthat we have in the world if we do not remain strong within ourselves \nand we will not remain strong if we continue to dissipate our resources \nso that our own readiness and our own strategic capabilities are in any \nway diminished.\n  I ask my colleagues to help in working with the President and this \nadministration to pursue an honorable policy with our allies in Bosnia, \na policy that has a chance to succeed and respects the fact that when \nwe put troops in harm's way it is under the most limited circumstances \nand only when there is a United States security issue before us. That \nis not the case in Bosnia. We must help the people of Bosnia but not \nwith continued presence of thousands of troops on the ground when their \nplace can be taken by the parties and the people who live in Bosnia and \nwho we hope will live in peace with our guidance for the years to come.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, the United States completed a major round of \ninternational global climate change negotiations at Kyoto, Japan, on \nDecember 11, 1997. Senators and staff members from the Senate \nMonitoring Group, created by the Senate leadership in accord with the \nrecommendation in Senate Resolution 98, adopted last July 25, 1997, \nwere included on the U.S. delegation. The Senate was well represented \nat the talks. The chairman of the Monitoring Group, Senator Chuck \nHagel, as well as Senators John Kerry, John Chafee, Joe Lieberman, Max \nBaucus, and Mike Enzi, dedicated considerable time and effort there to \nunderstand the issues being debated and to engage our negotiators on \nthose issues. They have reported mixed results at the negotiations. The \nU.S., together with the other 39 industrialized nations, agreed to \nspecific, legally binding targets for emissions of six greenhouse \ngases. The United States agreed to a numerical target of reducing \ngreenhouse gases by 7 percent below 1990 during a budget period between \n2008 and 2012. According to the administration, this commitment is \nactually about a 3 percent reduction below the 1990 emissions level \nafter other technical provisions of the protocol are included in the \ncalculations. It should be noted, however, that the administration has \nnot yet provided the economic analysis to demonstrate how their \ncalculations result in a 3 percent reduction, rather than 7 percent.\n  The rules of this U.N.-sponsored conference allow decisionmaking by \nconsensus. Therefore, only those provisions not subject to major \ndispute were included in the final protocol, and one can say that the \nUnited States and all\n\n[[Page S195]]\n\nthe other countries which approved the protocol arrived at in Kyoto did \nso without dissent and without taking actual votes on its provisions. \nUnder these circumstances, it is understandable that in some cases only \nbroad concepts could be included, with the devilish details deferred \nfor later. There were a number of areas of achievement for the United \nStates, and I commend the skill and persistence of our American \nnegotiating team, led by Ambassador Stuart Eizenstat, for those \nsuccesses. There were, however, some disappointing results, or even \nlack of results, and a number of important uncertainties that need to \nbe resolved.\n  My colleagues should understand that the negotiations at Kyoto are \nnot perceived by the parties to be the end of the story--far from it. \nThe next major meeting of the parties, so-called COP-4, will convene in \nBuenos Aires, Argentina, in November of this year, after the elections. \nIn the interim, there will be one or two preliminary meetings, now \nscheduled to take place in Bonn, at which time, hopefully, further \nprogress on the details of the general concepts agreed to at Kyoto, and \non matters not yet resolved, might be made.\n  I am far from satisfied with the results of the negotiations thus \nfar, the goal of which is exceedingly ambitious for it is no less than \nto positively control man's impact on the Earth's climate. The dynamics \nof climate, the impact of man's influence on it, its timeframes and \nthresholds and danger points are still far from perfectly understood. \nIt is still far from being perfectly understood. It is certainly \nunderstandable, then, that every goal sought was not totally achieved \nat Kyoto, and that further study and work are needed. Having said that, \nI believe that the consensus of most scientists who have examined the \nglobal warming issue, and certainly the large majority who have \nparticipated in the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange, have concluded that the balance of evidence suggests that human \nactivities are indeed having a discernible and unfavorable impact on \nglobal climate systems. I accept the proposition that the potential for \nserious climate disruption is real and that the global community must \nrespond at an appropriate pace in accordance with scientific evidence \nas it its developing.\n\n  Now, Mr. President, I am not a scientist, of course, and I am not a \nphysicist. But as Benjamin Franklin said at the Constitutional \nConvention in 1787, ``I have lived a long time.'' I am seeing some \nchanges in the weather system, in the climatic system. It seems to me, \nvery clearly, that the summers are hotter and the winters, at some \npoints, certainly are warmer, and that floods more often occur, that \nstorms ravage parts of our country more often. There seem to be more \ndroughts, more disasters that strike our land. And so I just sense that \nsomething is going on out there. I don't need any scientific evidence \nto impress that feeling upon me. But what the scientific evidence \nsuggests is that, should global warming occur, by the time we have \nabsolute confirmation that our planet is warming, it might well be too \nlate to take preventative action. For this reason, I have been \nconcerned about the threat of global warming, and I believe that it \nmight be prudent to undertake cost-effective measures to deal with the \nrisk of climate change as a form of a global insurance policy. However, \nit will do no good for the United States to take such steps alone.\n  The Byrd-Hagel resolution was adopted by the Senate by a vote of 95-\n0. It was adopted unanimously by the Senators who voted, and there were \n95 present.\n  The results of the Kyoto talks did not satisfy--with reference to the \nByrd-Hagel resolution--the two goals that were agreed upon, in the \ncontext of what I like to say was a unanimous Senate adoption of the \nByrd-Hagel resolution. What were those two goals agreed upon in that \nresolution? I quote from the resolution:\n\n       That it is the sense of the Senate that--(1) the United \n     States should not be a signatory to any protocol to, or other \n     agreement regarding, the United Nations Framework Convention \n     on Climate Change of 1992, at negotiations in Kyoto in \n     December, 1997, or thereafter, which would--(A) mandate new \n     commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions for \n     the annex I Parties, unless the protocol or other agreement \n     also mandates new specified scheduled commitments to limit or \n     reduce greenhouse gas emissions for Developing country \n     Parties within the same compliance Period, or (B) Would \n     result in serious harm to the economy of the United States.\n\n  Let's read that again. This is what the Byrd-Hagel resolution said, \nand it was agreed to by a vote of 95-0 here in the Senate. This is what \nit said insofar as the operative words are concerned:\n\n       That it is the sense of the Senate that--(1) the United \n     States should not be a signatory----\n\n  Should not add its name.\n\n     to any protocol to, or other agreement regarding, the United \n     Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992, at \n     negotiations in Kyoto in December, 1997, or thereafter, which \n     would--(A) mandate new commitments to limit or reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions for the annex I Parties, unless the \n     protocol or other agreement also mandates new specified \n     scheduled commitments to limit or reduce greenhouse gas \n     emissions for Developing country Parties within the same \n     compliance Period, or (B) Would result in serious harm to the \n     economy of the United States.\n  Mr. President, the Kyoto protocol did not meet either of these two \nSenate standards.\n  Regarding Developing Country commitments, part A, the developing \ncountries, the so-called Group of 77 plus China, steadfastly and \nadamantly refused to accept binding commitments such as were entered \ninto by the developed countries, the industrialized countries, or Annex \nI countries, in the Kyoto protocol. China made her position clear, and \nit was an unambiguous ``no''! That was China's answer. ``No.'' The \nstandard response from the developing world to our concerns is to argue \nthat the industrialized nations should make all of the reductions, \nbecause of the developed world's historically high levels of greenhouse \ngas emissions. The developing world also points to our relative wealth, \nand to their relative poverty, in arguing that we should shoulder the \nentire financial and economic burden of all reductions.\n  But this argument is environmentally, and economically unsound. \nFirst, as I have previously noted, the emissions of the developing \nworld will surpass those of the industrialized world in about 2015. \nAfter that point, the growth in developing world emissions is projected \nto overtake any emissions reductions that the industrialized world \nmight make. China, herself--and China said ``no'' at Kyoto--will become \nthe largest emitter of CO2, carbon dioxide, in the world during the \nfirst half of the next century, surpassing the United States.\n  Second, I am concerned about the emissions from the most advanced of \nthe developing nations, countries like China, India, Brazil, Argentina \nand Mexico, who are experiencing explosive growth, and who are on their \nway to joining the club of industrialized countries. Even a marginal \nand even an incremental increase in the standard of living for every \nresident of China will result in a huge increase in greenhouse \nemissions. While no one wants to deny the benefits of economic growth \nand higher standards of living to anyone around the world, it is \nimperative that China's economic growth be coupled with the \nresponsibility for its impact on the global environment. Cleaner \neconomic expansion is possible and must be expected. And it is easier \nto begin development with an eye toward the environmental situation \nthan it is to take corrective action later.\n  If progress is to be made this year in reaching a truly global \nagreement, it will occur only when the developing world realizes that \nit is at risk from the adverse consequences of climate change at least \nas much as we are. Most studies indicate that these nations are, in \nfact, at greater risk--at greater risk--than the advanced countries.\n  Since atmospheric warming is a global problem, without the \nresponsible action by key developing countries, we will not have a \nglobal solution, and we will not solve the global problem. It makes \nlittle sense for the developed countries to penalize themselves for an \noutcome which will be unsuccessful. As I wrote to the President on \nDecember 15, 1997, binding commitments for developing nations should be \npaced according to the ability of each country to achieve greenhouse \ngas emission limitations appropriate to its national circumstances and \neconomic growth. These limitations could be gradually\n\n[[Page S196]]\n\nimplemented. Whether such commitments are in fact appropriate and \nrepresent best effort by each nation, will not be difficult to discern. \nAs the saying goes, we will know it when we see it. For the moment, \nthere is nothing to be seen from the developing nation quarter. So, it \nwill be the task of the Administration to bring those key greenhouse \ngas (GHG) emitting nations into legally binding commitments during the \nsame compliance period that has been agreed upon by the advanced \nnations, that is, the period 2008-2012.\n  Mr. President, I also remain concerned about whether the agreement \nreached in Kyoto meets the second standard set by the Byrd-Hagel \nresolutions, S. Res. 98, namely, that its implementation would not \nresult in serious harm to our economy. Since the impact of the \nagreement on the U.S. economy is not now clearly understood, we cannot \nrule out the likelihood of such damage. It is critical that our nation, \nand the Senate, understand the probable costs of these specific actions \nproposed to address global climate change, as well as the possible \nconsequence of taking no action.\n  What is the cost? What is the cost, if no action is taken? What is \nthe cost if certain actions are taken?\n  The administration has not yet presented a comprehensive economic \nanalysis, sector by sector, regarding the impact of the Kyoto decision \non our economy. Without such an assessment, understood in detail, the \nKyoto agreement's impact on autos, on the coal industry, on steel, on \naluminum, on cement, on the oil industry, on consumers, on builders, on \npeople of varying income levels, there would be little sense in the \nSenate's even debating the protocol.\n  The lack of satisfaction on either count of the S. Res. 98 \nstandards--as I say, there are two of them--means the Kyoto protocol \nfall short, and there would be virtually no chance of securing the \napproval of two-thirds of the Senate were the President to decide to \nsubmit it for such approval. The President has already indicated his \nagreement with this assessment, and I believe that he agrees that the \ndecisions of the conference are just the first part of an ongoing work \nin progress which will continue over 1998 and perhaps beyond, until a \ncomprehensive, effective, and understandable agreement is reached that \nwould be worthy of Senate consideration.\n  On the positive side, the U.S. negotiating team deserves our \ncommendation for sticking to certain central principles, which were \nincorporated into the protocol as agreed to in Kyoto. The negotiations \nwere tough, grueling and long. Nonetheless, it was the United States, \nled by Under Secretary Eizenstat, that obtained agreement on many of \nour most important priorities, in direct contrast to the Europeans, who \nwitnessed the rejection of almost all of their more draconian and \neconomically harmful ideas.\n  The U.S. won some victories. What were they?\n  First, free market mechanisms, called Emissions Trading and Joint \nImplementation, pushed strongly by the United States, were agreed to \nafter difficult debate. This was a substantial American victory. The \npurpose of these mechanisms is to allow advanced nations and their \nindustries to satisfy their requirement for emissions limitations by \nsharing, buying and selling credits internationally, and to fulfill \npart of their obligations by assisting developing nations in developing \ncleaner technologies and conservation. These mechanisms are based on \nthe environmental reality that cutting greenhouse gases anywhere on \nearth reduces the global concentration of greenhouse gases virtually \neverywhere on our planet. It therefore makes economic sense to reduce \nthose emissions wherever it is most cost effective to do so. Emissions \ntrading will allow the industrialized nations to buy and sell credits \nthat will be created by the most cost effective reductions of \ngreenhouse gases. Through emissions trading, industrialized nations may \ntransfer to, or acquire from, another country party emission reduction \ncredits resulting from projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gases for \nthe purpose of meeting its commitments under the treaty.\n  A further mechanism, called joint implementation, or the Clean \nDevelopment Mechanism (CDM), was included, at the urging of the U.S. \nnegotiating team, by which industrialized countries can earn credits by \ncontributing financially to projects in developing countries. These \nprojects would involve industries and utilities in the developing world \nthat are far less efficient than ours, and that create more pollution. \nBy helping to bring polluting plants up to U.S. standards, industries \ncan earn credits while sharing our pollution-reduction technologies and \nproduction processes. We can maximize our ``bang for the buck,'' by \nreducing greenhouse gases to a far greater degree than it would be \npossible in the U.S. alone, and earn credits for doing so, which would \npartially offset the cost of our reductions at home.\n  While we can applaud the inclusion of these market mechanisms in the \nKyoto protocol, we do not yet know how they will work, to what extent \nthey will be overlaid by bureaucracies with their own agendas. We \nshould want the maximum freedom of action for American companies to \nmake arrangements with foreign partners without an overbearing presence \nand pressure by international bureaucrats or bodies, because the role \nand rules of the game for private companies are central to the \nviability of any trading scheme. The robust development of market \nmechanisms that are flexible and give maximum freedom of choice and \naction by American industry is important. They will be needed if the \nUnited States can even hope to meet the emissions reductions targets it \nhas agreed to at Kyoto. Based on projections of the growth of emissions \nusing current technologies and processes, the United States, in order \nto meet these goals, would have to reduce our overall GHG emissions \nmore than 30 percent below where they would otherwise be in the 2008-\n2012 commitment period. Reducing projected emissions by a national \nfigure of one-third does not seem plausible without a robust emissions \ntrading and joint implementation framework.\n  The rules as to how these mechanisms will work will be the subject of \nnegotiation, and American industry, the environmental community, and \nthe Senate will be intensely interested in how they are developed. \nBecause these market mechanisms could lower the cost of compliance with \na treaty, I encourage the Administration to solicit the opinions and \nsupport of the business and environmental communities in this regard. \nOur business community is uniquely qualified to comment on this \nsubject, and it is in the economic self interest of U.S. industry to \nassist in the creation of strong, robust, and flexible rules for \nemissions trading and joint implementation in order to lower the cost \nof implementing any climate change treaty which might be submitted to \nthe Senate. Indeed, I hope that the Administration will provide its own \nconcept of how these mechanisms should be implemented as soon as \npossible, so that support for this crucial set of procedures and rules \ncan be developed.\n  There is also some controversy as to whether forest conservation \nprojects will be allowed under the rules on these mechanisms. That is, \nfor example, if an American company helps to preserve endangered \nforests or other natural carbon sinks in a developing country, it could \nearn credit for that activity. And I support that concept, but it was \ncontroversial in Kyoto. Senators need to hear from the Administration \nregarding whether such conservation projects will be included, or \nwhether further negotiations are needed to include them.\n\n  A second major achievement by the American negotiating team in Kyoto \nwas the inclusion of a provision allowing the purchase of emissions \nallowances from Russia, which will assist in lowering the cost of U.S. \ncompliance to a protocol. This allowance is partly the result of the \nsubstantial downturn of the Russian economy in recent years. While this \nprovision has been criticized as a kind of windfall, it is no different \nfrom a similar mechanism that has been insisted upon by the European \nUnion, that is, the creation of a so-called European bubble, which \nallows all of Europe to reap the benefits of emissions reductions as \nthe East German economy is modernized, and, in the United Kingdom, as \nthe north sea gas fields came on line to supplant coal fired utilities.\n  The first budget period in the Kyoto agreement covers the years 2008-\n2012. This was strongly opposed by the European Union and the \ndeveloping world as\n\n[[Page S197]]\n\nbeing too weak, despite the fact that anything less would severely harm \nnot only the U.S. economy, but also that of the Europeans. The 2008-\n2012 decision allows more time for smoother transitions by U.S. \nindustry to the requirements included in the Kyoto protocol.\n  Decisions of the parties to the conference about protections for \nemissions originating from national security activities--such as U.S. \nbases abroad or U.S. forces on deployment, and U.S. forces in joint and \nmultilateral task forces--were included in the discussion. As this is a \nmatter of concern to many Senators, I shall ask later that an article \nfrom the January 1, 1998, Washington Post which elaborates on this \npoint be included in the Record. I point out that no other negotiating \nteam, from any other country, even included representatives from its \ndefense ministries to Kyoto. Only the United States did this. Thus, our \nnational security operations appear to have been protected in the \naccord.\n  The U.S. negotiating team was able to have included all six \ngreenhouse gases, including three synthetic substitutes for ozone-\ndepleting CFC's, which, while small in total volume, nonetheless have a \nsignificantly higher capability to trap heat, and over time will become \nmore significant. There was strong resistance on the part of some \nnations to the inclusion of these three gases because of their utility \nin high technology, but the U.S. position prevailed in this matter as \nwell, with the assent of significantly affected U.S. industries.\n  Despite these successes, there were, as I have indicated, some \nshortfalls. First, despite the best efforts of Ambassador Eizenstat and \nhis very competent team, the United States was not able to get \nagreement on the Administration's goal of reducing U.S. emissions to \nthe 1990 level. This was the overall target announced by President \nClinton when he unveiled his policy toward the talks last October. The \nEuropeans insisted upon a reduction of 15 percent below 1990 levels, \nand the developing world wanted an eventual reduction of 30 percent \nbelow 1990.\n  The final agreement includes a reduction target of 7 percent below \n1990 for three greenhouse gases, and 7 percent below 1995 for the other \nthree gases. In addition, a more generous definition of carbon sinks \nwas included. The Administration calculates that the change to a 1995 \nbaseline for three synthetic greenhouse gases, coupled with the \ninclusion of additional potential carbon sinks, results in an actual \nreduction target for the United States of approximately 3 percent below \n1990 levels. This agreement, I note, should be viewed in the context of \nthe broader negotiations. While the U.S. did not achieve its original \ngoal of a flat reduction to 1990 levels, the final agreement of \napproximately 3 percent is a far cry from the 15 percent reduction \ndemanded by the Europeans.\n  However, I have not yet seen any firm analysis as to how the \nAdministration computed its estimate of a 3 percent reduction once the \n1995 baseline for 3 gases is included, and the more generous \ndefinitions of sinks. I still have not seen any hard numbers on how \nthis estimate was calculated, or what the estimated impact of this \nreduction target would be on the U.S. economy.\n  So, the target cannot be evaluated as good, bad, or otherwise. The \nSenate will just have to withhold judgment. I hope that the economic \ncase will be presented in detail at hearings that I know the committees \nof jurisdiction will be holding over the next few months. Good, sound \nanswers are needed. The American people deserve to know what changes, \nif any, in their life styles will be required to meet the Kyoto \ncommitments; what sacrifices, if any, will have to be made; what new \ntechnologies will need to be developed and put into place; what shifts \nin our national fuel mix would be contemplated; and many other \nquestions dealing with national implementation of such commitments.\n\n  The details on the market mechanisms have not been worked out, and so \nwe need to create the details of a regime for trading, technology \ntransfer, and mutually-agreed-upon projects across the globe. How will \nsuch schemes evolve?\n  Third, the protocol leaves to the future such vital issues as \ncompliance, monitoring, and enforcement measures. For a binding \ninternational system to be effective, it is elementary that it be fair \nand enforceable. Americans take their commitments seriously, and abide \nby their promises, but the same cannot always be said for all other \nparties. Therefore, a system of effective procedures that monitors the \ncompliance of all parties with their obligations; and effective \nenforcement, presumably with some form of penalty system for \ncompliance, are clearly required. The emissions trading credit system \nwill be denominated in dollars, and the potential for fraud must be \nreduced to minimal levels for the system to work.\n  Fourth, the scientific community needs to conduct even more research \ninto climate change. There are many unanswered questions as to the rate \nand effects of climate change. We do not yet know, for instance, the \nrole of clouds, which seems to me to be rather fundamental. We do not \nknow whether climate changes will be gradual or abrupt.\n  It is now up to the Administration to roll up its sleeves and map the \nroad from here. First, the details of the concepts agreed to at Kyoto \nmust be developed in close cooperation with the industrial and \nenvironmental and consumer groups that are affected. Second, a program \nis needed to demonstrate how the implementation of commitments we \nagreed to in Kyoto would be achieved, and what the effects throughout \nour economy may be.\n  As part of that program, the Administration is expected to propose a \nrange of tax incentives and research and development projects. I note \nthat some of this R & D has already been completed, namely in the area \nof clean coal technology. Fifty percent of the power generated in this \ncountry comes from coal-fired boilers, and coal will continue as a \nsignificant factor in our energy mix for years to come. As a result of \nprograms that I have actively supported for the last decade, a wide \nrange of clean coal technologies has been developed that result in the \nmore efficient burning of coal--which directly reduces carbon dioxide \nemissions. I note that these R & D projects were fifty percent cost-\nshared by industry. While this technology has been tested in some pilot \nprojects, it continues to be expensive to install on a small scale. \nOnly its widespread implementation will lower the per-unit cost of \nmanufacturing and installing such clean coal units.\n  I have had many conversations with representatives of the coal and \nutility industry about various approaches that could be used to \nencourage the construction of clean coal units, as well as the need to \ncontinue research and development. I urge the Administration to also \ndiscuss these issues with coal-fired utilities, and to support a \nvariety of such initiatives. We should also be concerned about the huge \nnumber of coal-fired power plants that China is projected to build \nduring the next two decades, and we should consider initiatives to \nencourage China and the other big emitters to use only the most \nefficient and effective clean coal technology.\n  Mr. President, the canvas that was created at Kyoto is only partly \npainted in. It is a work in progress, and there is ample time to do the \njob right.\n  I hope that the President will not sign his name to the protocol at \nthis point. There is plenty of time to do that over the next year. Let \nus wait and see what the next November meeting will produce and what \ncan be accomplished in the meantime. I am concerned that if the \nPresident signs this protocol at this point, it will compromise his \nflexibility in dealing with the developing countries over the next \nyear. There is plenty of time to sign. The developing countries might \nmisinterpret the signature of the President on the protocol at this \ntime. They may think: ``Oh, you see, he has talked tough, but he is \nsigning his name.'' And they may be induced thereby to hold out and to \nmore stubbornly resist, more stubbornly resist taking actions and \ncommitting themselves to join with developed countries in a specific \nregime to provide a global solution.\n  I have outlined what I think are the commendable series of \nachievements by our negotiators in the face of rather hostile \nnegotiating partners from both the developing world and the European \nUnion. Much remains to be done. The goal of the negotiations is the \nmost challenging ever conceived and undertaken in the international \nenvironmental area. The glass may not be even\n\n[[Page S198]]\n\nhalf full, but the forum for filling it with the most palatable liquid \nwe can fashion is available throughout this year and beyond that, if we \nhave but the tenacity and the imagination and the will to persevere.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post \narticle and my December 16, 1997 letter to President Clinton be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Jan. 1, 1998]\n\n  Kyoto Pact Includes a Pentagon Exemption--Armed Forces Permitted to \n                 Pollute During Some Overseas Missions\n\n                           (By Joby Warrick)\n\n       The global warming treaty negotiated in Japan last month \n     could lead to tougher pollution controls on everything from \n     mopeds to Mack trucks, but at least one major emitter has \n     managed to reserve its right to pollute: the Pentagon.\n       A little-noticed provision in the treaty gives the armed \n     forces of any country a free pass to emit greenhouse gases \n     during certain overseas military operations, an exemption \n     secured by U.S. negotiators in the final hours of the Kyoto \n     climate summit despite objections from Iraq and Russia.\n       The exemption was pushed through, at the Defense \n     Department's insistence, to ensure that international police \n     actions and humanitarian missions remain unfettered by future \n     curbs on fossil-fuel emissions, administration sources said. \n     The climate treaty, which must be ratified by national \n     governments to become law, would force the world's developed \n     countries to sharply reduce their output of greenhouse gases \n     over the next two decades or face sanctions.\n       ``It was the one issue the Pentagon cared most about, and \n     we did well on it,'' said a U.S. official who participated in \n     the talks.\n       The exemption is spelled out in two sentences of a \n     technical paper that was ratified Dec. 11, at the close of \n     the all-night negotiating session that produced the world's \n     first binding agreement on combating global warming. One \n     sentence says fossil fuels used by ships and aircraft in \n     ``international transport'' cannot be counted against a \n     country. The other sentence exempts all ``multilateral \n     operations'' conducted under a United Nations umbrella.\n       In practice, the exclusions would apply to military vessels \n     headed toward overseas staging areas or participating in such \n     operations as the recent relief mission to Somalia or the \n     U.S.-led war against Iraq.\n       The exemptions offer obvious benefits for the United \n     States, which is both the world's only superpower and the \n     largest single emitter of greenhouse gases, But U.S. \n     negotiators said they were motivated mainly by a desire to \n     eliminate a potential alliance-breaker. In the future, they \n     said, countries might refuse to join the United States in \n     sending armies to world hot spots if it meant blowing their \n     limits on greenhouse gas emissions.\n       ``We didn't want to create a disincentive for future \n     humanitarian operations,'' said one military source who spoke \n     on the condition of anonymity.\n       In fighting for the exemption, the Clinton administration \n     also may have been seeking to deny Republican critics a \n     potent weapon in their battle to defeat the accord. For \n     several months leading up to the Kyoto summit, conservative \n     groups had argued that a global warming treaty would \n     undermine national security by weakening military training.\n       The idea of a military exemption was first floated by U.S. \n     negotiators in October at a U.N. conference in Bonn, Germany, \n     where it drew initial skepticism from some European allies. \n     When debated at the 159-nation Kyoto conference, the proposal \n     was strongly protested by Iraq--and, initially, by Russia.\n       Iraq, one of the few nations to experience the full brunt \n     of the kind of U.N.-sponsored ``multilateral operation'' the \n     American plan envisions, could have blocked the proposal \n     under conference rules that require all decisions to be \n     approved by consensus. But in a bit of diplomatic sleight-of-\n     hand, the conference chairman gaveled the rules through after \n     the Iraqi delegation had left the conference room.\n       U.S. environmental groups, which have generally applauded \n     the Kyoto agreement, complain that the exemption is overly \n     broad because it applies to commercial international carriers \n     as well as military ships and planes. Climate negotiators \n     left for a future conference the complicated task of \n     apportioning responsibility for emissions by commercial \n     airlines.\n       ``It's a pretty big loophole,'' the Natural Resources \n     Defense Council's Dan Lashof said.\n       It might have been even bigger. The Clinton administration \n     considered exempting armed forces from the rules altogether, \n     but then rejected the idea. The reason, sources said, was the \n     Defense Department's remarkably strong performance in cutting \n     its own emissions over the past decade--an achievement \n     attributed both to military downsizing and improvements in \n     energy efficiency.\n       Unless the Pentagon's gains are factored in, they said, the \n     United States might have a much tougher time meeting its \n     obligations for reducing emissions.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Appropriations,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 16, 1997.\n     Hon. William J. Clinton,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am writing to commend the skill and \n     persistence with which your negotiators, Ambassador Stuart \n     Eizenstat and his team, represented the United States at the \n     recently concluded climate conference in Kyoto, Japan. I view \n     the decisions of the conference as the first part of an \n     ongoing work in progress which should continue in Buenos \n     Aires next fall and finally, hopefully, culminate in an \n     effective global treaty to control greenhouse gases.\n       While I await an official, comprehensive report from your \n     Administration on the details and economic impacts of the \n     Kyoto agreement, I would like to share a few observations at \n     the outset of this important post-Kyoto period. I believe \n     that the potential for serious climate disruption is real and \n     that the global community must respond at an appropriate pace \n     in accordance with scientific evidence. Ambassador Eizenstat \n     has indicated that a number of key U.S. priorities were \n     agreed to at the negotiations, including emissions trading \n     and voluntary projects between industrialized and developing \n     countries; reduction targets for man-made emissions of all \n     greenhouse gases; incentives for worldwide forest \n     preservation; and incentives for early emissions reduction. \n     These are the direct result of American proposals, and are \n     milestones on the road to cost-effective restrictions of \n     greenhouse gas emissions on a global basis. These features \n     are intended to reduce economic dislocations and maximize the \n     use of new technologies and free market mechanisms.\n       However, of paramount concern is that the agreement reached \n     in Kyoto does not meet the first standard set by the Senate \n     in S. Res. 98, namely that the biggest emitters in the \n     developing world have not yet agreed to binding commitments \n     to be executed together with the industrialized nations. Such \n     commitments should be paced together according to the ability \n     of each country to achieve greenhouse gas emission \n     limitations appropriate to its national circumstances and \n     economic growth, and could be gradually implemented. In the \n     absence of simultaneous legally binding commitments by key \n     developing countries to grow in an environmentally sound way, \n     there will not be an effective restriction of worldwide \n     greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, there would be little \n     prospect of treaty approval in the U.S. Senate.\n       I am also concerned about whether the agreement meets the \n     second standard set by S. Res. 98, that its implementation \n     would not result in serious harm to our economy. Since the \n     impact of the agreement on the U.S. economy is not now \n     clearly understood, we cannot yet rule out the possibility of \n     such damage. It is critical that our nation understands the \n     probable costs of these specific actions proposed to address \n     global climate change, as well as the probable consequences \n     of taking no action.\n       Given the incomplete nature of the Kyoto agreement, I \n     believe that it would be prudent for you to withhold your \n     signature until a more comprehensive treaty is arrived at \n     which would be more deserving of Senate approval. \n     Nevertheless, with these caveats, a major new beginning has \n     been achieved in addressing the long-term problem of global \n     warming. I look forward to receiving the commitment of \n     nations such as China, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Korea, \n     and Argentina to join us in this effort in the near future.\n       Many on both sides of this issue have been quick to \n     register their displeasure with the Kyoto agreement. It has \n     been denounced by some environmentalists for not going far \n     enough, and by some in industry for going too far. While it \n     is regrettable that we were not able to reach an agreement \n     with the developing world in Kyoto, it seems clear that we \n     did gain acceptance on a number of important U.S. objectives. \n     Therefore, I recognize that this is a worthwhile work in \n     progress, and that a durable and effective solution to global \n     climate protection, one which provides sustained economic \n     growth and clean development for all countries, will require \n     a step-by-step approach. I welcome the announcement by the \n     Administration that you consider the Kyoto agreement to be \n     but the first step in a framework or architecture to continue \n     the negotiations, on the basis that this is a global problem \n     requiring global solutions.\n       I look forward to working with the Administration as the \n     process of negotiating an acceptable international agreement \n     proceeds over the next year.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                   Robert C.

Mr. President, at the outset I congratulate our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Byrd, for, as usual, a very erudite \nand well-thought-out statement. When I entered the Chamber, I saw \nSenator Byrd speaking, and I saw a thick sheaf of papers. I was glad to \nhave the opportunity to listen to Senator Byrd's presentation because \nhe is more than the conscience of the Senate; he is the intellect of \nthe Senate and a great tribute to this body. So I congratulate Senator \nByrd.\n\n[[Page S199]]\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator. I could \ndeliver a very appropriate encomium. I could say many appropriate \nthings with respect to the ability of the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. He is a great friend of mine. I have tremendous respect \nfor his knowledge in the field of law, and I always listen when he \nspeaks. I thank him for his very kind and overly charitable remarks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague for \nthat reply. I have been in this body, now, going on 18 years.

Mr. President, the thrust of President Clinton's State \nof the Union address was ``save Social Security first.'' The quickest \nway to save Social Security is to stop looting Social Security. Over \nthe years, we have looted the Social Security trust fund with wild \nabandon; we owe it to the tune of some $631 billion right this minute. \nIt should be a $631 billion surplus. But actually, since Congress has \nexpended it on foreign aid, defense, food stamps, and other programs in \norder to appear fiscally responsible, there is a deficit in Social \nSecurity.\n  I see now from the Congressional Budget Office, and I take it from \nthe President's budget to be submitted next Monday, that the CBO, along \nwith the Congress and the President, is prepared, again, to go forward \nwith this nonsense of a unified budget. The unified budget is a fraud. \nIt allows Congress to spend money but get credit for not spending \nmoney. Only here do fiscally irresponsible people get a good government \naward.\n  Let's think back a minute on President Lyndon Johnson, because the \nconsensus is, ``President Johnson changed government accounting \nprocedures and created the concept and introduced the use of a unified \nbudget, and that is how he got a surplus.'' This is false; false. I was \npresent during that time; I was there with George Mahon, chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. We asked if we could cut $5 billion to \nachieve a total budget of $178 billion for the Great Society and the \nVietnam War. Can you imagine that? We funded the Great Society and the \nWar with just $178 billion. And where are we today? Today the budget is \n$1.7 trillion. During LBJ's presidency, we balanced the budget with a \nsurplus of $3.2 billion. The Social Security trust fund then only \namounted to $300 million. So President Johnson balanced the budget \nwithout trust funds and without a unified deficit.\n  What really happened was that Wilbur Mills of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, who was running for President up in New Hampshire, said to \nthe American people: ``Oh, we have so much money in that Social \nSecurity fund; I will give you a 10-percent COLA.'' Then along came \nPresident Nixon and he said, ``If he will give you 10, I will give you \n15 percent.''\n  We started draining the fund during the seventies. By 1980-1981--when \nI was chairman of the Budget Committee--we could see we were going to \nhave a horrendous deficit in Social Security. So we formed the \nGreenspan commission, and we issued a report that recommended not only \nto impose a higher tax for Social Security to balance the Social \nSecurity budget, but more particularly to build up a trust fund for the \nPresiding Officer.\n  Now, old men like Senator Thurmond and I are going to get our Social \nSecurity money. But I don't know that younger Americans are going to \nget theirs. The fact of the matter is that according to the Greenspan \nCommission, baby boomers were to be cared for with Social Security \nthrough the year 2056. To show that, I ask unanimous consent that \nsection 21 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Social Security and the Unified Budget\n\n       (21) A majority of the members of the National Commission \n     recommends that the operations of the OASI, DI, HI, and SMI \n     Trust Funds should be removed from the unified budget. Some \n     of those who do not support this recommendation believe that \n     the situation would be adequately handled if the operations \n     of the Social Security program were displayed within the \n     present unified Federal budget as a separate budget function, \n     apart from other income security programs.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, section 21 says take Social Security off \nthe unified budget and record it as a separate trust fund.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that section 13301 of the Budget Act be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Subtitle C--Social Security\n\n\n           sec. 13301. off-budget status of oasdi trust funds\n\n       (a) Exclusion of Social Security from all budgets.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and \n     disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance \n     Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund \n     shall not be counted as new budget authority, outlays, \n     receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n       (1) the budget of the United States Government as submitted \n     by the President,\n       (2) the congressional budget, or\n       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act \n     of 1985.\n       (b) Exclusions of Social Security from congressional \n     budget.--Section 301(a) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n     1974 is amended by adding at the end the following: ``The \n     concurrent resolution shall not include the outlays and \n     revenue totals of the old age, survivors, and disability \n     insurance program established under title II of the Social \n     Security Act or the related provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 in the surplus or deficit totals \n     required by this subsection or in any. . . .''\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I got that reported out of the Budget \nCommittee, and President George Walker Herbert Bush signed it into law \non November 5, 1990: ``Thou shalt not use the Social Security trust \nfund.'' But, Mr. President, Congress today totally ignores it. Here is \nthe economic budget outlook for fiscal year 1999.

Table 2, instead of showing that trust funds are not \nused, shows that Congress uses over $165 billion of trust funds--$165 \nbillion. That is $101 billion from Social Security and $64 billion from \nthe military retirement trust fund, Civil Service retirement trust \nfund, highway trust fund, airport trust fund; and the surplus crowd is \ntrying to report just a $5 billion deficit. Come on.\n  You have to go all the way back, Mr. President, to page 42 of the \nCBO's report. If you look at page 42, you can find the real deficit, \nbecause down there they have the gross Federal debt. Of course, they \ndon't put it in red. I wish I had a chart here so everybody could see \nit.\n  This is not how a family budgets. Families ask themselves if they \nspend more than they take in? They don't employ this unified budget \nnonsense, or economic flows or the Wholesale Price Index or the \nConsumer Price Index or any of this economic gobbledygook. If you spend \nmore than you take in, you have a deficit, and that adds to your debt.\n  Page 42 of the Congressional Budget Office's report shows that we go \nfrom a $5.5 trillion debt in 10 years to over $7.5 trillion. In the \nnext 5 years, according to this chart, we are going to spend $957 \nbillion more than we take in--under this so-called balanced budget \nplan. Yet everyone is running around, patting each other on the back \nand complimenting each other on fiscal responsibility and discipline. \n``A balanced budget as far as the eye can see,'' says the President. \nDr. June O'Neill said the same thing yesterday before the Budget \nCommittee. Mr. President, they are talking out of the whole cloth.\n  Their claims are false. They continue to use these trust funds to \nobscure the debt and deceive the people. We already have used Social \nSecurity, military, civilian, unemployment, highway, airport, railroad \nof $1.5 trillion we owe now, and under the 1998 projected current \npolicy, CBO reports it will be $1.652 trillion. So we are using all of \nthese trust funds, and President Clinton said all trust funds. I read \nfrom that particular report where he said any trust funds. I want to \nmake sure everybody gets that because I am not being technical at all.\n  I quote President Clinton: ``Tonight I propose we reserve 100 percent \nof the surplus. That's every penny of any surplus.''\n  Mr. President, I have two bills that do just that. Boy, are we going \nto put them to the task of truth in budgeting. I ask unanimous consent \nthat these bills be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bills were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1587\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pay-as-you-go Extension \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AMENDMENT TO THE BALANCED BUDGET ACT.\n\n       Section 252(a) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985 is amended by adding at the end the \n     following: ``This section shall be effective until the \n     Federal budget excluding the receipts and disbursements of \n     the social security trust funds, the Federal military retiree \n     trust fund, the highway trust funds, and any other Federal \n     trust fund included in the gross Federal debt is in balance \n     or surplus.''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                S. 1588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Deficit Integrity Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRUST FUND PROTECTION.\n\n       The receipts and disbursements of the social security trust \n     funds, the Federal military retiree trust fund, the highway \n     trust funds, the medicare trust fund, the civil service \n     retirement trust fund, the unemployment trust fund, the \n     airports trust fund, and any other Federal trust fund \n     included in the gross Federal debt shall not be--\n       (1) included in the Federal budget baseline for any fiscal \n     year; and\n       (2) counted as new budget authority, outlays, receipts, or \n     deficit or surplus for purposes of--\n\n[[Page S201]]\n\n       (A) offsetting any tax decrease; and\n       (B) offsetting any spending increase.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. This is a short, one-paragraph bill. It says that \nCongress cannot use any of these surpluses and trust funds for any tax \ncut or any spending increase where we have caps.\n  Maybe, Mr. President, they will get the money from the tobacco \nsettlement. I don't know where they will get the money from.\n  You are looking at a Senator who voted against spending increases and \nagainst tax cuts last year in order to try to bring about fiscal \nresponsibility. We enjoy a good economy, Mr. President. And we want to \nstay the course. But let us practice truth in budgeting, and let us \nmean it. I have provided all the facts and figures here.\n  There is a chart that everybody in America ought to see: the gross \nFederal debt. In the past year, 1997, we ran a deficit not of $22 \nbillion but of $188 billion. The Congressional Budget Office projects \nan actual deficit of $170 billion. And, Mr. President, in 1999, the \ndeficit will increase from $170 billion to $200 billion. Why? Because \nrather than heading in the right direction, Congress and the President \nlast year increased spending and cut out revenues. Under current \npolicy, the deficit will continue to soar, right on up and away to $205 \nbillion by the year 2000.\n  So everybody ought to understand that Congress and the White House \ncan make all the wonderful talks they like; and everyone can say, \n``Well, the President wants to use those funds for spending, and I want \nto use it for tax cuts.'' That suits me, whatever you all want to do, \nbut let us have truth in budgeting and let us not use any of the trust \nfunds as an offset.\n  The bills I introduce today will achieve both of these goals; they \nwill ensure an honest budget and protect Social Security and other \ntrust funds.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He and the Senator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, have \nmade speech after speech after speech on the floor of this body about \nhow we do not have truth in budgeting. We do not have a balanced \nbudget. We are not even close to a balanced budget and are not going to \nbe for some time to come. And the idea of people talking about tax cuts \nor using the budget surplus, which does not exist, to using that \nsurplus to cut taxes or to increase spending is an absolute absurdity.\n  I think this year, 1998, we are anticipating a $100 billion surplus \nin Social Security. So I lend my support to what the President said the \nother night. And I lend my support to what the Senator from South \nCarolina just said.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bumpers pertaining to the introduction of S. 1586 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to commemorate an \nimportant event in the history of my State, the State of Ohio, and also \nthe history of this Congress. Over the just-concluded recess, my good \nfriend, Congressman Lou Stokes, announced he will retire at the end of \nthis Congress. Lou Stokes will retire after 30 years representing the \npeople of his Cleveland area district.\n  Mr. President, when I first entered the House of Representatives in \n1983, Louis Stokes had already been there for 14 years--14 years \nbuilding friendships and developing a reputation as a powerful and \neffective leader.\n  Lou Stokes is a leader. Mr. President, he is more than that. Lou \nStokes is a good man. One of my own favorite memories of Lou Stokes, \nand frankly it is one of my memories that I will carry with me all my \nlife and my career in politics, was the very moving speech that \nCongressman Lou Stokes made when he and I served together on the Iran-\nContra Committee. Mr. President, this was a contentious time. \nCongressman Stokes and I did not always agree on everything about these \nhearings or about the facts of that series of events that led to the \nIran-Contra hearings. But there was a moment during the hearings when \nLou Stokes spoke from the heart and he really let us know what kind of \na person he is, sort of what makes him tick. We really had an insight \ninto the soul of this very good man.\n  In his remarks he expressed heartfelt love of this great country of \nours. Let me quote a portion of what Congressman Lou Stokes said at \nthat time:\n\n       I wore the uniform of this country in World War II in a \n     segregated Army. I wore it as proudly as you did, even though \n     our Government required black and white solders in the same \n     Army to live, sleep, eat, and travel separate and apart while \n     fighting and dying for our country.\n       But because of the rule of law today's servicemen in \n     America suffer no such indignity. . . . My mother, a widow, \n     raised two boys. She had an eighth grade education. She was a \n     domestic worker who scrubbed floors. One son became the first \n     black mayor of a major American city. The other sits here \n     today as chairman of a House Intelligence Committee. Only in \n     America, only in America, Colonel North, only in America.\n\n  Mr. President, Louis Stokes said these words at a time of great \ntension in our country and in the Congress. In doing so, he gave voice \nto what Abraham Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.\n  That, Mr. President, is really who Louis Stokes is, a truly honorable \nman who represents the finest aspects of the American spirit. \nCongressman Stokes rose from poverty to become a great American \nstatesman. He was Ohio's first African American member of the U.S. \nCongress. He was the first African American ever named to the House \nAppropriations Committee.\n  First, first, first, again and again and again, Mr. President. Where \na path had not been carved out before, Louis Stokes took the lead and \nblazed a trail by himself. He was chairman of the Congressional Black \nCaucus, he was chairman of the House Ethics Committee, he was chairman \nof the House Intelligence Committee, he was chairman of the historic \nHouse committee that investigated the assassinations of President \nKennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He was chairman and is \ncurrently ranking member of the appropriations subcommittee on VA-HUD \noverseeing $87 billion of our Federal budget.\n  For the last 5 years he has been the dean of our State's \ncongressional delegation.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to have served for so long with this truly \ngreat American, here in the Senate for the last 3 years, as well as the \n8 years we served together in the U.S. House of Representatives. So \ntoday, Mr. President, I join the people of Ohio in thanking Congressman \nLou Stokes for all he has done to move our State and our country \nforward.\n  Louis Stokes's hometown newspaper, the Cleveland Plain Dealer, says \nthat he is ``A man who, through word and deed, created a legacy of \nexemplary public service. . . . After his long years of distinguished \nservice, Congress won't be the same without him.''\n  Mr. President, how true that is.\n  So to our friend, Lou Stokes; his wife, Jay; his children, Shelley, \nAngela, Louis, Lorene; and his grandchildren, who I know he cherishes \nso much, Brett, Eric, Grant, Kelley, Kimberley, Alexandra, and \nNicolette, thank you very much. Thank you for sharing him with us. We \nwish you, Congressman Stokes, and your children and your grandchildren \nand the rest of\n\n[[Page S202]]\n\nyour family all the best for a wonderful future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S201-3", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING SENATOR JOHN GLENN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I will take a moment this afternoon to say \na few words about another truly historic announcement that occurred \nduring the recess. On behalf of the people of the State of Ohio and all \nof our colleagues in the U.S. Senate, let me say how truly proud we are \nof our distinguished friend and colleague, Senator John Glenn. By now, \neveryone in America knows that in October at the age of 77, Senator \nJohn Glenn will return to space as a member of the crew of the space \nshuttle Discovery.\n  Mr. President, very few people show the kind of courage shown \nthroughout his lifetime by John Glenn, courage that Senator Glenn \nshowed when he flew 149--149--heroic combat missions as a Marine pilot \nin World War II and then in the Korean war facing death from enemy \nfighters and antiaircraft fire. Because of all the enemy fire that John \nGlenn braved, we are told his buddies called him the ``Mig-Mad \nMarine,'' and I guess they had a few other names for him, as well.\n  Mr. President, it comes as no surprise to those of us who know him \nthat our friend, John Glenn, is that kind of a rare person. One \nreporter commented that when he was a young man he was thrilled by then \nColonel Glenn's orbits around the Earth and yelled out, ``Go, Colonel \nGlenn, go.'' Well, Mr. President, I had pretty much the same \nexperience, as millions of Americans did. My experience occurred when I \nwas in high school, my wife Fran and I were in high school in Yellow \nSprings High School and the day that John Glenn orbited the Earth and \nmade that historic flight I happened to be in Mr. Ed Wingard's science \nclass in Yellow Springs High School. We all listened on the radio to \nthe progress of this truly historic flight. For those who were not born \nat that time or cannot remember it, it is hard to describe the \natmosphere in this country. It is hard to explain how literally this \ncountry came to a stop, when people gathered around TVs and gathered \naround radios for that period of time as he went around the Earth and \nmade those three orbits.\n  In fact, just about anyone around back then can tell you how \nimportant that achievement was for the American people, and they can \ntell you where they were and what they were doing at that moment. We, \nas a Nation at that time, Mr. President, were shaken, we had been \nshaken when the Russians beat us into space with the Sputnik, Sputnik \nsatellite, earlier in 1957 and then in April of 1961 they sent Yuri \nGagarin into orbit, the first man in space. The same week as that \nflight the U.S. was rocked by the tragedy and failure of the Bay of \nPigs invasion in Cuba.\n  In short, Mr. President, America was reeling, and that is one of the \nreasons why our hearts were lifted so very much by John Glenn's daring \nexploit. That, Mr. President, was a great day to be an American. I hear \na lot of that enthusiasm today after the announcement that Senator \nGlenn will be going back into space. I think that one of his last \npublic services as a Member of the U.S. Senate may be one of the most \nvaluable achievements of his long and very distinguished career because \nJohn Glenn has a rare, truly incredible opportunity to educate the rest \nof us, to educate the American people about the value of America's \nadventure in space. Who better, Mr. President, than John Glenn to speak \nto Americans about this great American achievement? Who better to \nexplain to us the importance of NASA, the importance of space \nexploration? And who among us, except John Glenn, has that historical \nperspective and can explain it in terms that average Americans can \nunderstand? John Glenn has a unique ability to tell this great story. \nHe has that ability because he has lived it.\n\n  Mr. President, I think this space mission is already starting to fire \nup the imagination of the American people about the wonders of \ndiscovery. It can remind us again that we as Americans have a tradition \nof national greatness and that the pursuit of national greatness \nremains our continued breathtaking challenge. So, Colonel--Senator--the \nhearts of all Ohioans and the hearts of your colleagues in the Senate, \nand indeed all Americans, will be with you on your historic mission. \nOur hearts will also be with your great family and with your heroic \nwife Annie. As President Clinton said the other night, godspeed, John \nGlenn.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are still in morning business.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I rise today because after 16 years of \ndenials, delays, and indifference on the part of the U.S. Department of \nEnergy, the American taxpayers are about to find themselves saddled \nwith the liability for our nation's nuclear waste.\n  It is a liability they do not deserve, and one they most certainly \ncannot afford. Unfortunately, the President failed to warn them on \nTuesday night during his State of the Union address that many of the \nachievements he acknowledged are at risk--threatened by a federal \ngovernment failure so massive that it may take the taxpayers years, \neven decades, to burrow out from underneath it.\n  What could be so potentially devastating? The failure of the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy to begin accepting the nation's spent commercial \nnuclear fuel.\n  And, Mr. President, the taxpayers will inherit the responsibility for \nthat failure just three days from now.\n  At midnight on January 31, 1998, the DOE is required by law to begin \naccepting spent nuclear fuel from sites across the nation.\n  The clock was set in motion 16 years ago, upon enactment of the \n``Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982.''\n  Since then, utility ratepayers have been required to pay the federal \ngovernment more than 13 billion of their hard-earned dollars in \nexchange for the promise that the DOE would develop and build a \ncentralized repository for the safe and efficient storage of spent \nnuclear fuel.\n  But that's yet another government promise that won't be kept.\n  Today, 16 years later--with 7 billion of those ratepayer dollars \nalready spent--the waste is piling up.\n  Nobody at the DOE wants it--nobody at the DOE is prepared to claim \nit--and because there's no place to put it, nobody at the DOE would be \nready to take it by the January 31st deadline anyway. That's just three \ndays from now.\n  At the same time energy consumers are pouring billions into the waste \nfund, ratepayers and utilities are continuing to pay for on-site \nstorage at more than 70 commercial nuclear plants throughout the \ncountry.\n  In other words, ratepayers are being forced to pay twice for nuclear \nwaste storage--all because the Department of Energy has failed to meet \nits legal obligations to the American people.\n  Sadly, these costs pale in comparison to the true catastrophe the DOE \nhas in store for the taxpayers beginning just three days from now.\n  The United States Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, in a ruling \nissued on November 14, said that not only is the DOE authorized to \nbegin accepting waste on January 31, but also able to fulfill its \ncontractual obligations to remove it.\n  By failing to do so, the court ruled, the DOE makes the federal \ngovernment liable for any damages resulting from even the smallest \ndelay in performance.\n  And we all know who foots government's bills.\n  By failing to take possession of the nation's nuclear waste just \nthree days from now, the DOE will in essence make the American taxpayer \nresponsible for those damages.\n  According to the Nuclear Energy Institute, the estimated cost of \nstoring spent nuclear fuel at power plants across the nation through \n2020 is $56 billion, with the federal government--the taxpayers--liable \nfor every dollar.\n\n[[Page S203]]\n\n  And when nuclear power plants begin to shut down because the \nutilities don't have the facilities to store fuel on site, the chain \nreaction of higher energy costs and lost jobs that are certain to \nfollow represents yet another costly economic consequence of this \nfederal folly.\n  The impact on the environment of alternative energy sources must also \nbe examined.\n  How is it possible that all of this will be set into motion just \nthree days from now, and yet it didn't merit a single sentence in the \nPresident's State of the Union address?\n  Mr. President, it's ironic that, while the DOE has failed to meet \nAmerica's nuclear waste storage needs, the DOE has resumed collecting \nspent nuclear fuel from a total of 41 other countries under the ``Atoms \nfor Peace'' program.\n  Similar to the large number of our states which are facing nuclear \nwaste storage problems, countries from around the world are \nexperiencing the same problems. The only difference is that their \nneeds--not our own ratepayers' needs--are being met by our federal \ngovernment.\n  In fact, the DOE has completed ``urgent relief'' shipments of spent \nnuclear fuel assemblies from European nations to the agency's facility \nat Savannah River. It has also accepted nuclear spent fuel from Latin \nAmerican countries.\n  Ultimately, up to 890 foreign research reactor cores will be accepted \nby the DOE over a 13-year period.\n  Mr. President, an important point to discuss when it comes to these \nforeign nuclear waste shipments is how they are transported once they \nreach the continental United States.\n  Nuclear assemblies from these 41 countries have been and will \ncontinue to be transported by rail and truck to the Savannah River \nFacility. The safety record of these shipments speaks for itself.\n  The federal government won't accept commercial spent nuclear fuel, \nbut it's actively accepting nuclear waste from many American \nuniversities.\n  Nuclear waste from research reactors at our finest educational \ninstitutions is being accepted at the DOE's Savannah River facility. \nAgain, this nuclear waste is being safely transported by rail and truck \nacross the nation.\n  These shipments serve as a very small portion of the 2,400 shipments \nof high-level nuclear waste that have already been shipped across the \nUnited States, including naval spent fuel.\n  So, Mr. President, transportation is no longer a question of \ntechnology but becomes one of politics.\n  I understand the rationale behind reducing our international nuclear \ndangers by collecting and transporting spent fuel within our borders.\n  But what I and many others cannot comprehend is how our government \nhas made it a priority to help foreign countries with their nuclear \nwaste problems while simultaneously ignoring the concerns right here in \nour own country.\n  Our ratepayers are paying the bill to take care of our own waste \nproblem. Yet that isn't being addressed but our ratepayers and our \ntaxpayers are paying to help foreign countries do the same thing.\n  The President on Tuesday also failed to mention that the costs of \nmissing the January 31st deadline will be borne as much by grandma and \ngrandpa as they will by any corporate executives or Members of \nCongress.\n  He didn't mention that nuclear power is a fuel that burns nothing, \nthereby helping us achieve cleaner air and a better environment.\n  He failed to mention that the costs of his global warming treaty will \nbe even higher for every American if we continue to shut down nuclear \npower plants in favor of coal-burning technologies.\n  Most regrettably, he failed to offer any kind of explanation into why \nhis administration supports the Department of Energy as they unlawfully \nstick it to the American taxpayers.\n  It therefore falls to Congress to step forward and offer a solution.\n  Along with my colleagues, Senators Murkowski and Craig, I've \ncoauthored legislation that will protect the American public from the \ncosts they face from this impending crisis.\n  Our bill will reform the current civilian nuclear waste program to \navoid the squandering of billions of dollars of ratepayers' and \ntaxpayers' money.\n  It will eliminate the current need for on-site storage at our \nnation's nuclear plants, keep plants from shutting down prematurely due \nto lack of storage space, and maintain stable energy prices.\n  Our bill will also assure that transportation of nuclear waste will \ncontinue to be conducted in a safe manner.\n  The ``Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1997'' passed both houses of \nCongress last session by overwhelming, bipartisan votes.\n  While conferees have yet to be appointed, a veto threat from the \nWhite House continues to prevent a responsible solution from becoming \nlaw.\n  Again, a veto threat from the White House on this issue continues to \nprevent the responsible solution from becoming law.\n  As representatives of the people, it's the responsibility of the \ngovernment to ensure that every taxpayer dollar entrusted to us is \nspent in a responsible and meaningful way. In the case of nuclear waste \nstorage, the government has failed this most important of tests.\n  While the DOE waits, and hides behind courtroom appeals, and shirks \nresponsibilities it is legally bound to accept, Americans across our \ncountry can expect yet more rate increases and yet higher taxes from a \ngovernment that's either too afraid or to incompetent to act.\n  Just three days from now, who's going to explain that to the \ntaxpayers?\n  Americans deserve to hear from their leader on this issue. They \ndeserve and expect a rational explanation for the Administration's \ninaction on their behalf. Silence, Mr. President, is not the answer \nthey so desperately need.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I assume we are in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am a member of the Budget Committee, \nand under Senator Domenici's very good leadership, we are starting a \nnew budget process as we do every year. Today he called a hearing of \nour committee to hear from Chairman Greenspan. Chairman Greenspan is a \nperson who is very well respected, not only on both sides of the aisle \nby Members of the Congress, but also by the President. He was \nreappointed to the chairmanship of the Fed by this President. Further, \nhe is very well respected by the people of this country and, most \nimportantly, by people who, as investors in America, have to have \nconfidence in the economy. I think that Chairman Greenspan exudes a \ngreat deal of confidence himself. He establishes in most everybody \nconfidence in the economy because of his caution. Economic growth over \nthe last several years has had a great deal to do with the steady hand \nof Chairman Greenspan.\n  As we start a new budget season, it is very appropriate that Chairman \nGreenspan be invited by Chairman Domenici to come to appear before the \nSenate Budget Committee.\n  We had a chance to listen to an outstanding presentation by Chairman \nGreenspan. It was relatively short, but throughout the sermon on the \neconomy, Chairman Greenspan called for this Congress and this President \nto be very cautious, as we go into the budget process in this year, \nespecially about spending, about taxes, and having too rosy a scenario \nabout our economic future.\n  He expressed a great deal of confidence that the future is very \nbright for our economy, but incumbent in what he said was a caution \nthat, by unwise budget decisions, we have the capability of lousing up \na rosy opportunity. He put a great deal of emphasis upon the good that \ncomes from paying down on the national debt. He also expressed, in \nresponse to some questions, that next to paying down the debt a great \ndeal of economic good can come from cutting marginal tax rates and \ncutting capital gains. None of these is\n\n[[Page S204]]\n\nan end unto themselves, but help to make sure that there is a positive \nattitude in this country for people who will invest to create jobs in \nAmerica in order to keep this economic miracle going.\n  I was very happy to hear the caution expressed by Chairman Greenspan, \nbecause I sense, as he senses--and obviously, I am back here for the \nfirst week since last fall's recess so I have not visited with a lot of \nmy colleagues--that over the last 3 months the anticipated surplus is \ngenerating too much talk about renewed spending. The White House \nproposes about eight new spending programs that the President wants to \ncreate, adding up to about $63 billion--and those are not discretionary \nspending; for the most part those are entitlements. Some Members of \nCongress, want to spend more money, while other Members of Congress \nwant to give tax cuts. I love to give tax cuts. I probably have voted \nfor most every tax cut that has been suggested since I have been in the \nSenate--but I think that at this point both this Senator from Iowa and \nmy colleagues and the President of the United States ought to follow \nthe advice of Chairman Greenspan and exercise some caution about \nspending increases and tax cuts. As I said, it appears to me that a \ngolden opportunity might be lost because we think this windfall is in \nour pockets already. It is like it is burning a hole in our pockets. We \ncan hardly wait to spend it.\n  I almost sense that Chairman Greenspan would like to express a couple \nwords he cannot ever use again. I think he senses an irrational \nexuberance on the part of Congress and the President of the United \nStates, just to fritter away a wonderful opportunity we have here to \nreestablish the confidence of the people in the economy and, \nparticularly, in the fiscal policy of the Congress, which was adopted \nin a bipartisan way last year.\n  So I would follow on with Chairman Greenspan and ask my colleagues to \ncool it, to make sure that we learn from history. During the last \ndecade, the decade of the 1980's, we found it is very easy for \nconservatives to ask for more money to spend on defense and then, \npretty soon, that opens up the door for other increased spending. Well, \nif we are going to spend more money on defense, liberals are going to \nget their hands in the cookie jar and say we have to have more money \nspent on domestic programs. Then there is always the other side of the \naisle, people wanting tax cuts, and, as I said, I even like tax cuts. \nBut pretty soon you are on an irresponsible approach that brings \ntrillions and trillions of dollars of debt.\n\n  Now, finally, after last year, it looks as if we are on a path to \ngetting to a balanced budget, to stopping the building of the legacy of \ndebt that our generation has left to our kids and grandkids. So I think \nwe have to just cool it. We do not yet have this money in our pocket. \nLet us at least wait until it is there, and that is not going to be \nduring this budget season. We have a historic opportunity, a windfall \nopportunity to do good. I know we have a strong economy, and that is \nwhere most of the praise can go--for balancing the budget even before \nthe year 2002 as we promised.\n  Also, Congress has exercised some restraint, finally. I do not think \nthe public realizes it, but we have. Three out of four people in this \ncountry do not believe we are going to have a balanced budget when we \nsay we are going to have it. Three out of four people, even after a \nbipartisan effort to accomplish it, do not believe today it is going to \nhappen. Even with all the talk about more money coming in than \nanticipated, even with the President saying we are going to balance it \nbefore we said we were, still three out of four people do not believe \nwe are going to balance the budget. So we have an opportunity, if we \nare cautious, as Chairman Greenspan said, to reduce that cynicism, to \nreestablish confidence in the American people that maybe we have a \nsound fiscal policy here and that we will balance the budget.\n  We still have those, however, who say we ought to spend it, including \nthe President of the United States. There are people who say we ought \nto have tax cuts.\n  Now, we have a rare opportunity which seldom comes to Congress. If we \njust do nothing, we can do a great deal of good. How often, if Congress \njust does nothing, can some good come from it? But it is this simple. \nIf we stay with the spending caps that we adopted last year in a \nbipartisan compromise, if we can stay with those caps, we are going to \nbalance the budget before the year 2002, and we are going to pay off on \nthe national debt without taking any action, because the Secretary of \nthe Treasury just rolls over less old debt from week to week because of \na budget surplus. So you gradually pay down on the national debt just \nby Congress taking no action. A great deal of good comes from Congress \njust doing nothing.\n  We would reduce the cynicism of three out of four people in this \ncountry as to whether or not we are really serious about balancing the \nbudget. That reestablishes confidence in the economy. It is going to \nencourage people to invest, and with investment you create jobs. We are \ngoing to reduce the interest costs to the Federal Treasury. The biggest \nitem in the Federal budget is now interest--not defense, not Social \nSecurity or Medicare--interest. We will reduce it.\n  Most importantly, we are going to be able to restore the American \ndream of our children and grandchildren. Every generation has thought \ntheir kids would have it better than their generation, but today's \ngeneration does not believe that their children will have a better \nfuture and their grandchildren have yet a better future because of the \nlegacy of debt our generation is leaving. We can restore the American \ndream to our children and grandchildren.\n\n  We also have an opportunity to do something that I never thought I \nwould be able to be a part of in my lifetime--helping pay off on the \nnational debt, reducing the legacy of debt that we have left to our \nchildren and grandchildren. It seems to me, not only is that good \neconomically, but if we have an opportunity to do that--we have been \nliving high on the hog for the last 3 decades because of Government \nborrowing--we can pay down that legacy of debt and keep a moral \nobligation that we ought to have for our generation to live within its \nmeans.\n  We can also do what the President suggested needs to be done. We \ncould also strengthen the fiscal position of the Federal Government so \nwhen the IOUs come due on Social Security we will be in a strong \nposition to pay those IOUs. So the President needs to exercise \nrestraint. Three years ago in the State of the Union Message we heard \nthat the era of big Government is over. But this year we heard that the \nera of saying the era of big Government is over, is over.\n  We also have to have some restraints on these tax cuts. Not that \ntaxes can't be cut in the future, but we ought to make sure what we \nhave in surplus first. We need to do it right and we should not do it \npiecemeal, and we have a tendency to do it in a piecemeal fashion.\n  But most important, if we just cool it, if we just keep the cork in \nthe bottle, if we just do nothing, we will do a great deal of good, not \nonly for today but for our children and grandchildren. That is why I \nsay we should take the advice of Chairman Greenspan that he gave to the \nSenate Budget Committee today and just be very, very cautious.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S203-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S204-S205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, a troubling aspect in assessing all aspects \nof maintaining a strong U.S. national security is one that receives \nscant attention--the fact that the United States is more deeply \ndependent upon foreign countries to supply most of America's energy \nneeds. The situation today is worse than ever before in our history.\n  I began in 1996 my reports to the American people every week in which \nI stated the precise amount of oil imported by the U.S. from foreign \ncountries. Some of these countries are openly hostile to U.S. \ninterests. I make these reports to emphasize the extent to which the \nU.S. has become perilously dependent on them.\n  I investigated this issue a decade ago when I presided over several \nhearings as the then chairman of the Agriculture Committee. In my \npresent capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nwe have held hearings; more are scheduled this year.\n  While the Administration acknowledges that U.S. oil imports are a \nnational security concern, nothing has been done by the Administration \nto resolve U.S. dependency on foreign oil.\n  Now, Mr. President, a few up-to-date statistics: The American \nPetroleum Institute reports that for the week ending January 23, the \nU.S. imported 7,776,000 barrels of oil each day, 64,000 barrels fewer \nthan the 7,840,000 imported each day during the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly \nless oil than a year ago, Americans still relied on foreign oil for 55 \npercent of their needs last week, and there is no sign that the upward \nspiral will abate.\n  Before the Persian Gulf War, the United States obtained approximately \n45 percent of its oil supply from foreign countries. During the Arab \noil embargo in the 1970s, foreign oil accounted for only 35 percent of \nAmerica's oil supply.\n  Which raises the inevitable question: is anybody else interested in \nrestoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American \nworkers?\n  It is argued that America should use up foreign oil reserves before \ntapping into our the remaining U.S. domestic supply. But I submit, Mr. \nPresident, that economic calamity will occur in America if and when \nforeign producers shut off our supply--or double the already enormous \ncost of imported oil flowing into the U.S.--now 7,776,000 barrels a \nday.\n  Mr. President, the Foreign Relations Committee will continue its \nexamination of U.S. dependency on foreign oil in 1998. I shall also \ncontinue to report to the Senate--and to the American people--on a \nregular basis regarding this increasingly dangerous trend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S205-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S205-S206]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    THE IMPORTANCE OF RATIFYING THE WIPO TREATIES AND ENACTING WIPO \n                        IMPLEMENTING LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I hope that the Senate will make a new \nyear's resolution to focus its energy on issues that create American \njobs, protect American ingenuity, and improve the lives of the American \npeople. I was disappointed last year that we wasted so much of the \nSenate's limited time on partisan and divisive issues.\n  This year the Senate should be in the business of doing America's \nbusiness. We should be working in a bipartisan manner to enact \ncopyright term extension legislation so that America's trading partners \nwill recognize American copyrighted works for the same term that those \ncountries grant their own national works. We should be passing \nencryption legislation to allow American hi-tech companies the freedom \nto compete vigorously in the global marketplace. We should be enacting \npatent reform legislation to help American innovators, big and small.\n  High on the Senate's agenda for doing America's business should be \nratifying the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) treaties \nand enacting WIPO implementing legislation. To this end, I would like \nto take a few moments to discuss why we should care about these WIPO \ntreaties, how America will benefit when we ratify these treaties, and \nhow we can get the job done.\n\n\n                             WE SHOULD CARE\n\n  Those who care about America's economy and America's creative spirit \nshould care about the WIPO treaties. Ratification of these treaties \nwill help protect and enhance U.S. intellectual property rights \nthroughout the world. In the body of the Constitution as originally \nratified, the word ``right'' appears only once and that is with regard \nto the protection of intellectual property. From our beginnings as a \nNation, the Constitution has included within Congress' enumerated \npowers, authority ``To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, \nby securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive \nRight to their respective Writings and Discoveries.'' The importance of \nprotecting and encouraging the intellectual creations of our citizens \nhas always been a fundamental priority for our country and a \nresponsibility of our national government.\n  Today, millions of Americans owe their jobs and prosperity to \nindustries created by America's innovators and creators. The \nInternational Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) released a 1996 \nstudy prepared by Economists Incorporated that outlined the \ncontribution of U.S. intellectual property industries to the U.S. gross \ndomestic product, employment, and foreign trade. It detailed, for \ninstance, that in 1994, copyright industries contributed an estimated \n$385 billion to the U.S. economy, accounting for approximately 5.7% of \nthe GDP. The study concluded that during the period from 1984 to 1994, \njob growth in the core copyright industries was twice as fast as \nemployment growth in the economy as a whole. Regarding foreign sales, \nthe study found that the copyright industries' exports are larger than \nthe exports of almost all other leading industry sectors.\n  In addition to the economic boon that they provide this country, the \nintellectual property rights granted to U.S. citizens have fostered the \ncreative spirit of the American people. From the days of Benjamin \nFranklin and Thomas Jefferson to the dawning of the coming century, \nAmerican creative geniuses abound in the visual arts, recording, \nwriting, and software development industries. The U.S. leads the world \nin creative products. What other country can boast of the multitude of \ncreative, artistic, and technological visionaries?\n\n\n                          AMERICA WILL BENEFIT\n\n  Because the U.S. is the world-wide leader in intellectual property, \nthe U.S. will be the main beneficiary if the U.S. Senate ratifies the \nWIPO treaties and the Congress enacts WIPO implementing legislation.\n  Secretary Daley has observed that ``the treaties largely incorporate \nintellectual property norms that are already part of U.S. law.'' The \nAdministration has concluded that the U.S. need only make two \nsubstantive changes and several non-substantive changes to U.S. law to \nbring it into compliance with the treaty requirements. What the \ntreaties will do is give American owners of copyrighted material \nessentially the same protections for their intellectual property in \nthose foreign countries that become party to the treaties as they enjoy \nhere in the United States.\n  Let me give you an example. The U.S. already has a distribution right \nof the sort provided in the treaty. Many other countries, however, do \nnot yet recognize this right. So if a U.S. publishing company suspects \nthat its books are being illegally copied in a country that does not \nhave a distribution right, it cannot go after the distributor of the \nillegally copied goods in that country. Imagine trying to stop illegal \ndrug usage if you couldn't go after the drug distributors. That is the \nproblem that our copyrighted industries face battling piracy in many \ncountries throughout the world today.\n\n\n                          GETTING THE JOB DONE\n\n  We should consider and pass the WIPO Copyright and Performances and \nPhonograms Treaty Implementation Act, S.1121, which I cosponsored with \nSenators Hatch, Thompson and Kohl last July. I hope that the Senate \nwill\n\n[[Page S206]]\n\nnot further delay in examining the impact of the treaties and the \nimplementing legislation. We need to expedite the process of resolving \nissues essential to S.1121.\n  I intend to work with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee on \nthese important matters. I want to commend Senator Hatch for the time \nhe has spent and is spending seeking to resolve matters that have \nbecome impediments to progress on important intellectual property \nmatters.\n  Unfortunately, these important legislative matters were stalled last \nyear by linkage to additional issues not necessary to their enactment. \nWe made no progress on the treaties and implementing legislation. \nAmerica cannot afford further delay.\n  Some have expressed concern that ratification of the WIPO treaties \nand enactment of implementing legislation threaten to increase what \nthey perceive to be a current risk that they will be held liable for \ncopyright infringements by users whose conduct they can neither prevent \nnor control. They are demanding legislation limiting their copyright \nliability and demanding that it be resolved before ratification of the \nWIPO treaties and passage of implementing legislation can proceed.\n  The extent to which and circumstances under which copyright liability \nmay be imposed on online service providers is a matter that I believe \ncould easily be dealt with separately from the WIPO treaties and \nimplementing legislation. Were service provider liability to be \nconsidered legislatively, I think that Congress would be better off \nworking toward carefully targeted clarifications of the law rather than \nattempting to legislate wholesale reform that risks becoming obsolete \nin a short time, or freezing industry practices and preventing them \nfrom evolving as efficiently as possible.\n  Vinton Cerf, the co-inventor of the computer networking protocol for \nthe Internet, stated in The New York Times:\n\n       The Internet is now perhaps the most global and democratic \n     form of communications. No other medium can so easily render \n     outdated our traditional distinctions among localities, \n     regions and nations.\n\n  We see opportunities to break through barriers previously facing \nthose living in rural settings and those with physical disabilities. \nDemocratic values can be served by making more information and services \navailable.\n  Technological developments, such as the development of the Internet \nand remote computer information databases, are leading to important \nadvancements in accessibility and affordability of art, literature, \nmusic, film, information and services for all Americans. Properly \nbalancing copyright interests to encourage and reward creativity, while \nserving the needs of public access is the challenge. Historically, the \ngovernment's role has been to encourage creativity and innovation by \nprotecting copyrights that create incentives for the dissemination to \nthe public of new works and forms of expression.\n  Intellectual property can, at times, be arcane and abstract. But \nthese matters have very real and important consequences to the American \neconomy and creative spirit, and the viability of industries that \nproduce everything from movies to records to books to software depends \non it. That means that the American people are depending on us to put \npartisan differences aside. We may not make headline news by working on \nWIPO implementing legislation, but we will help create American jobs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S205-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S206-S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMARKS OF GOVERNOR CECIL H. UNDERWOOD ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ENERGY \n                        RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on yesterday, Wednesday, January 28, the \nGovernor of the State of West Virginia, Cecil H. Underwood, appeared \nbefore the Interior Subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee \nto testify about the significance of energy and research development. I \nask unanimous consent that the text of Governor Underwood's remarks be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the remarks was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n    Testimony of Cecil H. Underwood, Governor of the State of West \n Virginia, to the Interior Subcommittee of the House of Appropriations \n                      Committee, January 28, 1998\n\n       Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify \n     today about the importance of energy research and development \n     (R). I bring to your deliberations the perspective of a \n     governor of an energy-producing state, which also relies on \n     energy-intensive industries for its economic foundation. I \n     also come before you with a regional perspective as the \n     chairman of the Southern States Energy Board.\n       By way of further introduction, as governor, I have become \n     a leading advocate of the use of technology in moving our \n     state forward. As I have said many times throughout West \n     Virginia, technology is the vehicle that will drive our state \n     into the 21st century. Applications of technology are opening \n     new avenues for meeting the energy needs of our people, our \n     businesses and our industries. Energy R will be crucial in \n     the creation and application of the technologies that will \n     fuel our economic engine in the years to come.\n       Our collective transition into a new century and millennium \n     makes us more cognizant of other economic transitions that \n     are underway. We are moving toward a more global economy, \n     toward a technology-driven and information intensive economy, \n     toward boundless applications of new technology and toward \n     economic diversification that builds upon our industrial \n     foundation.\n       As we move toward the exciting opportunities of the new \n     times, our nation must be careful that it does not move away \n     from energy-intensive industries that still are economically \n     vibrant and vital or from energy sources that can help meet \n     the growing needs of the future. As with all real progress, \n     though, our success in economic transition depends on our \n     abilities to explore new ways to address traditional \n     challenges.\n       Our preparation for the future is complicated also by new \n     proposals that seek to improve our physical environment but \n     that may have a devastating impact on the economic \n     environment in many parts of the country, including West \n     Virginia and the chairman's home state of Ohio. The \n     environmental restrictions that may be imposed and the \n     resulting economic impact on many areas make the need for \n     energy research and development that much more urgent.\n       As governor of an energy-producing state, I sense that \n     urgency more acutely, especially as such R would be \n     critical to efforts in three main areas: helping our domestic \n     energy producers meet the challenges of new regulations and \n     an economy in transition; exploring ways that energy \n     producing companies and traditional industries, which use \n     significant amounts of energy, can become environmentally \n     responsible while maintaining economic vitality; and \n     developing new markets for traditional energy resources and \n     new applications to meet changing market opportunities.\n       Energy-related R is a crucial investment in the future of \n     my state and our country. It is critical to preparing the \n     industries of our region for the challenges and opportunities \n     of the new times ahead in the 21st century.\n\n\n             energy issues of the future for west virginia\n\n       The best way to determine an appropriate course of action \n     is to determine first the goal or destination sought. So I \n     begin my evaluation with what my state and our nation must do \n     with a description of where I want us to be in 12 years.\n\n                       A Vision for the Year 2010\n\n       Our vision for the year 2010 is that West Virginia will be \n     a showcase state for efficient power generation and efficient \n     industrial energy usage. There will be several state-of-the-\n     art, highly efficient, environmentally compliant fossil fuel \n     power generation plants in the state. Coal-based generation \n     plants in West Virginia will be in compliance with all clean \n     air regulations, demonstrating technologies developed in the \n     U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Clean Coal Technology \n     program. West Virginia's manufacturing plants will be highly \n     productive and energy efficient with virtually all waste heat \n     and waste materials reused and recycled.\n       Power generation markets in West Virginia will be \n     competitive, deregulated, and electricity rates in West \n     Virginia will be among the lowest in the nation. Residential, \n     commercial and industrial customers, both in and out of the \n     state, will be able to obtain power from the most efficient \n     sources. The power transmission system will have excess \n     capacity, enabling export of additional power from the state; \n     West Virginia generators will have access to the transmission \n     grid at rates that reflect the actual cost of transmission. \n     We believe that in 2010, as is the case today, about 75 \n     percent of the power generated in West Virginia will be sold \n     in competitive markets out of state and that growth in demand \n     for power generated in West Virginia will average about 2 \n     percent per year.\n       Our vision for 2010 is that West Virginia will have a \n     significant involvement in the development and demonstration \n     of environment technologies that enable domestic fossil fuels \n     to remain the country's dominant fuel for generation of \n     electricity. For example, West Virginia projects will \n     demonstrate technologies, which reduce the amount of \n     CO2 introduced into the atmosphere during \n     extraction and use of fossil fuels. Technologies to capture \n     CO2 and sequester it in\n\n[[Page S207]]\n\n     deep underground coal mines and gas reservoirs will be \n     developed and demonstrated in the state.\n       Furthermore, West Virginia will be a major technology \n     innovator for non-CO2 producing uses of coal. For \n     example, there will be a growing industry in the state for \n     production of chemicals and advanced carbon materials made \n     from coal-based feedstocks.\n       In 12 years, the West Virginia coal mining industry will \n     continue to be highly efficient and use state-of-the-art \n     technologies that minimize environmental and social impacts \n     of mining. Current and past mine sites will be reclaimed and \n     waterways will be protected from acid mine drainage.\n       For our basic industries such as aluminum, steel, glass, \n     chemicals, wood products and mining to remain globally \n     competitive in the year 2010, we believe it will be necessary \n     for them to continually improve their productivity by \n     participating in programs such as the U.S. DOE's Industries \n     of the Future (IOF) program. For that reason, West Virginia \n     is working with the Office of Industrial Technologies to \n     develop a state-level IOF program to promote industry, \n     government and academic cooperative projects to improve \n     industrial productivity through energy efficiency, waste \n     minimization and use of new technologies.\n       In our vision of 2010, West Virginia's coal and natural gas \n     companies will work together with utilities and high \n     technology companies on collaborative projects to help West \n     Virginia manufacturing industries remain globally \n     competitive.\n       For the year 2010, we envision at least 25 percent of West \n     Virginia's fleet and commuter vehicles being powered by \n     alternate fuels, such as natural gas, electric, hybrid \n     electric or coal-based diesel. Natural gas refueling stations \n     and recharging facilities will be conveniently located across \n     the state. Furthermore, we anticipate that West Virginia will \n     be participating in a consortium of mid-Atlantic states \n     developing a high-speed, intercity light-rail transportation \n     system.\n       West Virginia will continue to be the largest producer of \n     natural gas east of the Mississippi River, as well as a major \n     storage and transfer area for interstate natural gas \n     transmission systems. West Virginia is becoming a major \n     producer of coalbed methane, and by 2010, no coalbed methane \n     will be flared or vented to the atmosphere. It will be \n     recovered and used for production of heat and power.\n       In addition to coal and natural gas, West Virginia will \n     have by 2010 a diversified portfolio of energy sources \n     including coalbed methane, wood residues, waste coal, wind \n     and biomass.\n\n\n               potential barriers to achieving the vision\n\n       There are several potential barriers to West Virginia \n     achieving its vision for 2010 relative to power generation \n     and industrial energy efficiency. We have serious concerns \n     with the Environmental Protection Agency's emissions \n     standards for NOx, as proposed on November 7, \n     1997. Likewise, our state is also concerned about how, as a \n     result of the Kyoto Conference, new restrictions on \n     greenhouse gases--in particular CO2--could have a \n     devastating impact on the cost of energy production and the \n     economy of our state.\n       EPA's proposal prescribes an overall NOx \n     reduction of 44 percent from West Virginia sources. This \n     would require power plants in the state to reduce their \n     NOx emissions by as much as 85 percent from 1990 \n     levels and other industrial/manufacturing sectors by 25 \n     percent to 70 percent. The impact on the state could be \n     severe, jeopardizing up to 11,000 jobs in the manufacturing \n     and power generation industries--more than 12 percent of West \n     Virginia's industrial work force.\n       There is growing concern around the world about global \n     climate change due in part to burning fossil fuels. West \n     Virginia expects to do its part to prevent global climate \n     change, but we strongly believe that greenhouse gas emissions \n     standards should be equitable worldwide and based on science. \n     Allowing developing nations to have an unfair advantage over \n     developed nations on the amount of emissions allowed puts the \n     United States--and more specifically states, such as West \n     Virginia--at a competitive disadvantage. Consideration must \n     be given to potential economic impacts of precipitous \n     CO2 reductions and R programs developed to \n     ensure the energy security of the country.\n       As a competitive electricity industry evolves and various \n     federal and state-level legislative restructuring bills are \n     considered, it is important that West Virginia be able to \n     export power. There should be no barriers to the sale of low-\n     cost West Virginia electricity to customers in other states. \n     The cost of transmitting electricity should reflect the \n     actual marginal costs of transmission. Flat rate (postage \n     stamp) pricing schemes for transmission would weaken West \n     Virginia's advantage of being a low-cost electricity producer \n     located near the major East Coast load centers.\n       Exporting West Virginia power to out-of-state customers \n     requires adequate transmission capacity and fair transmission \n     pricing policies. West Virginia should be included in the \n     dialogue on formation of regional transmission groups and \n     procedures for operating the transmission system.\n       Formulation of sound energy policy requires a thorough \n     knowledge of the relative costs of producing and consuming \n     power from various fuels and with various technologies. For \n     example, the true environmental costs of renewable energy \n     sources such as wind, hydro and photovoltaic need to be \n     understood better. Furthermore, the cost of externalities \n     such as a military force to guarantee access to offshore \n     sources of crude oil is not reflected in the domestic price \n     of petroleum products.\n\n\n         research and development needed to achieve the vision\n\n       Research must be conducted on cost-effective technologies \n     to minimize emissions of greenhouse gases, NOX, \n     particulates and other pollutants associated with the use of \n     fossil fuels. Such research could be conducted through \n     cooperative university, industry and government agreements, \n     but the R priorities must be determined by industry. An \n     excellent model for developing industry-led research agendas \n     is the U.S. DOE's Industries of the future program run by the \n     Office of Industrial Technologies. The U.S. DOE Clean Coal \n     Technology program is also a model of industry/government \n     cost-shared research that encourages commercial \n     implementation of new technologies to improve efficiency and \n     ameliorate environmental impacts of coal-based power \n     generation. Such technologies are important to the energy \n     security of the country in the event crude oil supplies are \n     interrupted or the price of natural gas increases sharply.\n\n Research and Development Related to Power Generation and Transmission\n\n       Several fields present compelling opportunities to explore \n     strategies and new approaches that would: increase efficiency \n     and reduce the costs of producing electricity with new \n     technologies such as low NOX burners, fuel cells, \n     coal gasification combined cycle, cofiring with biomass or \n     natural gas, etc.; improve efficiencies on retrofit \n     technologies, reduce pollution emissions and extend the life \n     of existing power plants; continue investment in certain \n     clean coal technologies to further reduce costs, improve \n     efficiency and reliability and minimize emissions; optimize \n     all aspects of power plant operation toward increased \n     efficiencies; and explore ``in-situ'' utilization of existing \n     coal reserves.\n       Develop technologies for eliminating NOX \n     emissions from diesel engines; explore technologies for \n     capturing, utilizing and sequestering CO2; design \n     pollution permit trading systems that treat fixed and mobile \n     sources equitably; improve and validate mathematical models \n     of pollution transport and global climate change phenomenon; \n     increase the reliability and capacity of existing \n     transmission line right-of-ways with use of improved power \n     electronics, high-temperature super conductors, voltage \n     control, protection against sudden voltage collapse, improved \n     system stability and real-time monitoring of line \n     temperatures; reduce further the cost of high-voltage DC \n     transmission lines; improve understanding of how electric \n     power markets work. (Studies to determine the actual costs of \n     transmitting power so economically efficient, i.e., marginal \n     cost, transmission-pricing schemes can be devised); and \n     assess economic and scientific impacts of rule making.\n\n    Research and Development Related to Industrial Energy Efficiency\n\n       West Virginia is working through the national industries of \n     the Future program to implement an IOF-WV program to identify \n     and conduct multidisciplinary projects, which will be of real \n     benefit to West Virginia's aluminum, steel, glass, chemical \n     and wood products industries. At a recent IOF-WV Symposium in \n     Charleston, the five industry groups were asked to brainstorm \n     the question, ``What specific projects should be undertaken \n     to increase productivity and reduce costs through improved \n     energy efficiency, reduced waste, use of new technologies, \n     better inventory and management systems, etc.?'' There were \n     33 project ideas from the aluminum industry group, 21 from \n     the steel industry group, 15 from the glass industry group, \n     26 from the chemical industry group and 16 from the wood/\n     forest products group. Over the next year, the IOF-WV program \n     will expand to include metal casting and mining.\n       Their suggestions for the fields of R include: strategies \n     to reduce the cost of power for West Virginia's energy \n     intensive manufacturing industries, e.g., better energy \n     demand management systems; new systems for improved on-line \n     process monitoring and improved sensors and controls; \n     development of better waste minimization and recycle \n     strategies, e.g., industrial wastewater treatment \n     technologies; product designs for recycling materials and \n     wastes; more effective recovery and use of industrial waste \n     heat; better strategies for cross industry use of waste and \n     by-product from one process or company as feedstock for \n     another; streamlined environmental permitting processes; and \n     evaluation of proposed mining sites in terms of potential \n     acid water production, subsidence and impacts on roads, \n     bridges and scenic areas.\n\n\n            funding for energy and industrial efficiency R\n\n       Deregulation and competition in the electricity industry \n     could lead to reduced spending by the private sector on long-\n     range energy related R The federal government must provide \n     leadership with incentive programs to co-fund development and \n     implementation of a spectrum of energy technologies. The DOE \n     and the states will need to develop cooperative R programs \n     appropriate to the needs and resources of individual states.\n       All stakeholders must make investments in energy R \n     Although generation is being deregulated, transmission and \n     distribution of electricity will remain regulated. State and\n\n[[Page S208]]\n\n     federal laws on restructuring of the electricity industry can \n     authorize wire charges or other fees to develop a pool of \n     funding for energy R projects. The energy industries in \n     West Virginia must play leading roles in developing resources \n     to support R on environmentally compliant technologies for \n     fossil-based power generation. Investment in implementing \n     these technologies also will be required.\n       To retain the interest and involvement of West Virginia \n     companies in the Industries of the Future program, it is \n     necessary that we make rapid progress toward funding for \n     joint projects, which will benefit their future survivability \n     and competitiveness. We are currently working with five \n     industry sectors (aluminum, steel, glass, chemicals and wood/\n     forest products) and plan to add metal casting and mining. A \n     budget of about $1,750,000 per year would be required to run \n     a meaningful state-level IOF program.\n       State and federal incentive programs that encourage \n     companies to invest in new technologies that save energy and \n     minimize emissions should be expanded. The U.S. DOE's \n     existing program in National Industrial Competitiveness \n     through Energy, Environment, Economics (NICE-3) Is an \n     effective mechanism to encourage private-sector Investment in \n     new energy efficient technologies.\n       The U.S. DOE's State Energy Program provides funding \n     directly to the states, permitting them the flexibility to \n     support energy initiatives that are uniquely Important to \n     their situations. In West Virginia, a cornerstone of the \n     State Energy Program is our work with industry to identify \n     process modernization opportunities. These industrial \n     projects yield meaningful cost-savings and environmental \n     benefits that are key to the long-term health of our nation's \n     industries. International trade treaties require that our \n     industries become more competitive. West Virginia became the \n     first state to institute a state level Industry of the Future \n     program.\n       Another Important component of our energy program is the \n     promotion of alternative fuels. Through the State Energy \n     Program, we are supporting alternate fuels training programs, \n     as well as development of a compressed natural gas fueling \n     infrastructure. West Virginia was one of the first states to \n     Initiate a statewide Clean Cities program. The overall goal \n     of the State Energy Program is to enhance our nation's energy \n     security.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       In summary, production and utilization of fossil fuels, \n     generation and transmission of electricity and energy \n     intensive manufacturing industries dominate the economy of \n     West Virginia. We envision our low-cost electricity and \n     manufacturerd goods as being critical to the energy security \n     and industrial competitiveness of the nation throughout the \n     next century. The energy research needs and agenda outlined \n     in this paper are of great Importance to our state. We are \n     committed to participating in partnerships and coalitions to \n     develop resources and to carry out the R program. West \n     Virginia wishes to participate fully in the energy/\n     environment/economic policy debates. We very much appreciate \n     the opportunity to present our thoughts to the Interior \n     Subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives \n     Appropriations Committee and look forward to further \n     discussions and actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S206-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S208]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EDUARD SHEVARDNADZE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on January 25, 1998, this past Sunday, the \nPresident of Georgia, Eduard Shevardnadze, celebrated his 70th \nbirthday. President Shevardnadze is one of the central international \npolitical figures of our age, and has been pivotal in the \ntransformation of the communist Soviet empire into a group of nation \nstates which have now embraced the goals of individual freedom, \ndemocratic processes, and free market economics. It is noteworthy that \nthis transformation, the dismantling of an empire with large \nintelligence and military forces, and with a history of inbred \nhostility toward the West, occurred absent any violent confrontation \nwith the United States, or our European allies.\n  Much of the credit for this peaceful transformation, the ending of \nthe Berlin Wall and the cooperation between the Soviet leadership and \nthe United States on major arms control and reduction agreements, \nrightfully belongs to the enlightened and forceful personality of Mr. \nShevardnadze. His role emphasizes the crucial part played by \npersonalities in the shaping of the major events of human history. He \nserves as an example that history is shaped to a large extent by \nindividual men, rather than by social movements or economic \nimperatives.\n  For instance, Russian cooperation with the United States in working \nto condemn, and then oust, Saddam Hussein's forces from their \noccupation of Kuwait was to a large extent due to the courageous \nsupport of Mr. Shevardnadze in the face of opposition from forces in \nRussia which wanted to preserve a historic Russian-Iraqi alliance. His \nhelp in establishing a cooperative relationship with the United States \nregarding the invasion of Iraq actually forced Gorbachev's hand and \ntrumped the Soviet security bureaucracies. It has been well documented \nthat Shevardnadze quickly shed the negative approach to East-West \nrelations that was the hallmark of former Russian Foreign Minister \nAndrei Gromyko when Shevardnadze took over the Foreign Ministry of the \nSoviet Union in 1985. Both former Secretaries of States George Shultz \nand James Baker have written extensively about Shevardnadze and praised \nhis many contributions to the ending of the cold war. As a former U.S. \nAmbassador to the Soviet Union, Jack Matlock, has written in the \nSeptember 25, 1997, issue of the ``New York Review of Books,'' ``If \nGorbachev had been served by a less imaginative and courageous foreign \nminister it is doubtful that the cold war could have been ended as \nrapidly and definitively as it was.''\n  Shevardnadze served as Soviet Foreign Minister from 1985-1991, and \npresided over the rapid transformation of East-West relations and the \nend of the cold war. It was, as I have said, an extraordinary era in \nwhich we have all been fortunate to participate in and to witness. In \n1991, Eduard Shevardnadze resigned as Soviet Foreign Minister in \nprotest over what he perceived as the coming of a military dictatorship \nin Russia, and he returned to his native Georgia. Georgia was in an \nadvanced state of shambles, with the economy devastated following the \nbreakup of the Soviet Union. The country was in a state of ruinous \ncivil war. Shevardnadze entered political life there, and was elected \npresident of Georgia in November 1995, with over 70 percent of the \nvote. Currently, he also serves as the Commander in Chief of the armed \nforces of Georgia, and has brought new hope, stability, and economic \ndevelopment to that nation. A new constitution has been adopted, and \nShevardnadze has secured the transportation of Caspian oil through \nGeorgia and negotiated a number of agreements with both Russia and the \nneighboring Caucasus states. As the current ambassador of Georgia to \nthe U.S., the Honorable Tedo Japaridze, has written to me regarding \nPresident Shevardnadze's goals, ``he is committed to build democracy in \nGeorgia, brick by brick.''\n  Eduard Shevardnadze is a man who has made a difference in our age, \nand he will continue to make a difference. He has many admirers in the \nUnited States, including myself, and I wish him well on the event of \nhis 70th birthday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S208-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S208-S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN McGOFF\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a good \nfriend and a business leader from my State who recently passed away, \nMr. John McGoff. Mr. McGoff was one of our State's most successful \nbusiness leaders, making his fortune, and his impact, primarily in the \narea of publishing. He owned a number of news publications and was a \ngreat success, but I think he would prefer to be remembered for several \nother things he achieved in his lifetime.\n  First was his great sense of community spirit. Mr. McGoff was truly a \nman who loved the communities in which he lived. He invested \nconsiderably, out of his own resources, in the communities in which he \nresided, in the schools of those communities, in our State's university \nsystem, and in a variety of other valuable institutions.\n  In fact, when tribute was paid to him last Saturday, it was in an \nauditorium in the high school serving the tiny town in which he lived, \nan auditorium which he personally had built with his own dollars.\n  I think John McGoff also would want to be remembered as a man who \nloved his country. He put this love to the test by serving in the \nUnited States military. He served with distinction in the infantry \nduring World War II, both in North Africa and in Europe. He also played \nan active role in the political process, in our State and at the \nnational level.\n  He was committed to the discussion of public policy. And he acted on \nthis\n\n[[Page S209]]\n\ncommitment, not only through the newspapers he owned, but also through \nhis efforts to launch a variety of other publications, including one of \ntoday's most successful law journals, the Harvard Journal of Law and \nPublic Policy, which he helped to initiate through personal \ninvestments.\n  Mostly, I think John McGoff would want to be remembered as a man who \nloved his family. Indeed, I can remember how, on virtually every \noccasion in which we were together I would receive a detailed account \nof every one of his children, what they were doing and what their most \nrecent achievements and challenges were. When we paid him tribute last \nSaturday, each of those children was there to help remember their \nfather and to pay great testament to his wonderful life.\n  So, on behalf, I know, of many people in our State who certainly will \nmiss John McGoff and regret his passing, I want to say his was a full \nlife, one of great success; the life of a person who loved his \ncommunity, loved his country, loved his family--truly loved America and \neverything for which she stands.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S208-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S209]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1295\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request with \nregard to S. 1295, which is the naming of the National Airport the \nRonald Reagan Airport. But before I propound that request, let me say I \nwant to make some comments after we have this request, about why we are \ndoing this, and put in the Record some of the history about what is \ninvolved. I have been talking to the principal sponsor, Senator \nCoverdell. I know he has been talking to Members on both sides of the \naisle. Senator Daschle and I have talked about it. I don't think we \nhave, it would appear, an agreement worked out as to how this is to be \nconsidered, but I hope we can continue to talk about why this is \nimportant, why we want to do it, and see if an agreement can be worked \nout. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  One week from Friday is the birthday of former President Ronald \nReagan. I think it would be a very good and a magnanimous gesture by \nthe Congress and by the President of the United States if he could be \nable to sign this bill on President Ronald Reagan's birthday. That is \nwhy the timing is critical and why we want to go ahead and begin to \ntalk about it. Because Senators on both sides of the aisle had \nconflicts today, we are not going to be able to vote on it today--or \nwould not have been able to vote on it, probably, today, anyway. But it \nis my hope, my intent, that we could get it done next Tuesday and then \ncomplete the process so we could do this in recognition of this great \nPresident.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the Commerce Committee be discharged from \nfurther consideration of S. 1297 and further the Senate proceed to its \nimmediate consideration, and further, that there be one amendment in \norder relative to the modification of the original bill, with total \ntime for debate limited to 2 hours equally divided between Senators \nMcCain and Hollings or their designees, and, following the debate, the \nSenate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the amendment, to be \nfollowed by third reading and final passage. I further ask that if a \nrollcall vote is requested in relation to the amendment or passage, the \nvotes be postponed to occur on Tuesday, February 3, at a time to be \ndetermined by the majority leader after notification of the minority \nleader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object, and I will be compelled \nto object at this time, for several reasons.\n  First, there are a number of Democratic Senators who want the \nopportunity--to have a right to offer perhaps more than one amendment. \nThere may or may not be opposition to this legislation, but there \ncertainly is cause for some consideration of aspects to this issue that \nmay not be as evident as we consider the prospect of a bill of this \nnature today: The costs associated with it; the process that we use in \nnaming national or important public facilities; people have raised the \nquestion of whether it is appropriate for us to take the name \nWashington off of the name of this particular airport--ironically, the \nsame month that we celebrate President Washington's birthday. So we \ncelebrate not only one but two birthdays in February. The name \nWashington is very prominent in February, as is President Reagan's of \ncourse. Some have even asked whether the Reagan family wants this to be \ndone.\n  So, Mr. President, there are a lot of very legitimate questions. As I \nsay, there are a number of Democratic Senators who may or may not be in \nsupport of this legislation, following the exploration of many of these \nissues. So I do not think it would be in our best interests to proceed \ntoday. I have had some discussions with the distinguished majority \nleader about the matter, and will continue to do so in an effort to \nresolve these questions and try to find a way with which to assure that \nthis issue is fully explored and debated without unnecessary delay.\n  So, on the basis of all of those relevant issues, Mr. President, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I yield to the chairman of the committee \nthat has jurisdiction in this area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S209-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S209-S219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRENAMING WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT ``RONALD REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for bringing \nthis issue forward in an expeditious fashion. I do believe President's \nReagan's upcoming birthday is an important time for us to mark this \noccasion. I thank Senator Coverdell, whose original thought I believe \nthis was, along with the encouragement of millions of Americans all \nacross the country. I have a longer statement, I would say to the \nmajority leader, that I would like to give after his remarks, but let \nme just say, briefly, I find this--I find this astounding, that we \nwould block this. There have been many fallen leaders. There are many \nformer Presidents we have had, and living Presidents, that--there has \nnever been any problem with the naming of things. I have been told that \nthere may be an effort to name the Justice Department after the late \nRobert F. Kennedy. I would strongly support such a thing and I believe \nmost of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would also. But \nfor us to block this at this time, given President Reagan's condition--\nwhich we all are very well aware of--I think is unfortunate and, even \nworse, if this blocks this well-intentioned proposal to honor one of \nthe most decent and nonpartisan and kindly people that I have ever had \nthe privilege of knowing in politics, I think it would be a terrible \nmistake.\n\n  I yield back to the majority leader. I will have further remarks \nlater on. I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator McCain, for \nhis comments. I know we will be interested in hearing the balance of \nhis comments. I thank him for allowing me to explain a little bit about \nwhat is going on here, if I could.\n  First of all I want to emphasize that the proposal is to name \nNational Airport, which is commonly referred to as Washington National \nAirport, the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. Washington \nNational Airport was not named after George Washington. It was named \nafter the District of Columbia, to denote a location, a physical \nlocation. I think everybody would understand that that would be \nappropriate, the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n  This idea, as I understand it, originally came from the immediately-\npast Governor of Virginia, the State where this airport is located. \nThat was the first time I ever heard it was from former Governor George \nAllen.\n  The principal sponsor, Senator Coverdell, has worked in previous \nRepublican administrations, has been committed to this and has been \ndoing very good work in the preparation for this to happen. As for my \npersonal situation, I had the clear impression that this was something \nthat was supported by the family and friends of the President.\n  But I also want to emphasize again something I noted earlier. The \nreason why we want to do it early is not just because we are looking \nfor work, not\n\n[[Page S210]]\n\njust because we want to ram it through--I really thought it would go \nthrough, you know, on a shouted unanimous vote. It's because it is a \nspecial time in the life of a man who has meant so much to this country \nand to so many of us.\n  In my 29 years in political life, this man, former President Ronald \nReagan, has meant more than any other single person. I think history \nwill show clearly he is one of the two greatest Presidents of this \ncentury, and in my opinion, the greatest by far. So I was very \ncomfortable with moving it quickly, because of the birthday \nconsideration. Keep in mind, now, this is a President, as you would \nexpect from Ronald Reagan, who is sort of riding off into the sunset. \nHe has been a credit to our country in so many ways, and since he has \nbeen President he has gone back to his beloved California and he has \nbeen battling a terrible disease that millions of Americans have to \ndeal with, Alzheimer's disease. It is one of the programs, one of the \ndiseases where we really don't fund adequate research. We hear all of \nthese other things that are really looked into at NIH, all these other \nresearch programs, all these other problems, yet this one probably gets \nthe short end of the stick.\n  So I have been proud, and saddened, by the fact that he is afflicted, \nnow in an advancing way, with this terrible disease. So I want, in any \nway we can, to say to him how much we appreciate him, what he has done \nfor our country, and to his family and the sacrifices they made. Every \nPresident makes sacrifices to be President, and their families probably \neven more. So that is what is the driving force here. Who he is, what \nhe is going through, what he has meant to this country, what he has \nmeant to so many of us, and the fact that it is a special time in his \nlife.\n  The point is made, this is not an appropriate edifice. It is really \nnot that pretty. It is new.\n  Or that, ``Gee, it may not even be here in 25 or 50 years. We need \nsomething, a monument, that will be there for 100 years, 200 years or \n1,000 years.'' I think there is some merit to that.\n  Some people say, ``We have this building down on Pennsylvania Avenue \nthat is going to be named after him,'' and that is fine. It is not as \nif we can only name one facility. I don't know how many Roosevelt \nmonuments and memorials we have. That's OK, and I voted for memorials \nand monuments to a lot of Democrats. I don't think we vote on these \nthings because they are Democrat or Republican. Once they become a \nformer Secretary of State, like John Foster Dulles, or former President \nKennedy, they are a former President or a former Secretary, and, in \nmany instances, we owe them an awful lot.\n  I even think somebody said, ``Usually we wait until they have passed \non.'' I think it is a ridiculous idea. What good is it to them then? Do \nthey have any idea how much they meant to us then? I don't think we \nought to make it a practice to do it immediately or while they are \nstill in office. But for special people and special occasions, I think \nit makes us a greater people.\n  I would like to include some examples of memorials and monuments that \nin the past have been named for U.S. Presidents: John F. Kennedy Center \nfor the Performing Arts, 1963; James Madison Building, 1965; Lyndon B. \nJohnson National Historic Site, 1969; Harry S. Truman Dam and \nReservoir, 1970; Lyndon B. Johnson Memorial Grove, 1973; Lyndon B. \nJohnson Manned Spacecraft Center, 1973; Lyndon B. Johnson Civilian \nConservation Corps Center, 1974; Gerald Ford Building, 1977; Herbert \nHoover Building, 1981; Dwight D. Eisenhower Interstate System, 1990; \nTheodore Roosevelt Building, 1992; Ronald Reagan United States \nCourthouse, 1992; Woodrow Wilson Plaza, 1994; Ronald Reagan Federal \nBuilding and International Trade Center, 1995.\n  I do believe that we want to do this in a bipartisan way. I know \nthere are some in both parties in this country who are not all that \nexcited about this--with good reason, I understand that. But I also \nknow there are people on both sides of the aisle and all over the \ncountry who don't care about partisan politics who feel like this \nshould be done.\n  Maybe I am influenced in bringing this up by a speech I read just a \ncouple weeks ago by Margaret Thatcher, another great leader in this \ncentury, a speech she made on December 10, 1997, at the Sheraton \nWashington Hotel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her entire speech be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the speech was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                   [From Human Events, Jan. 16, 1998]\n\n                 How Reagan's Courage Changed the World\n\n       The following is the text of the speech delivered by former \n     British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the Heritage \n     Foundation's gala 25th anniversary dinner at the Sheraton \n     Washington Hotel, Dec. 10, 1997:\n       It is a great honor to be asked to be the inaugural speaker \n     of this series of lectures on ``The Principles of \n     Conservatism'' organized to celebrate the 25th anniversary of \n     the Heritage Foundation. Heritage has flown the flag for \n     conservatism over this last quarter-century with pride and \n     distinction.\n       I've always considered America fortunate in having an \n     apparently inexhaustible supply of conservative thinkers \n     prepared to challenge the fashionable liberal consensus. That \n     is a tribute to the intellectual energy and the taste for \n     debate which are so characteristic of this great country and \n     which sometimes seem distressingly absent in contemporary \n     Europe. But it is also a tribute to Heritage (and in \n     particular to Ed Feulner) that these conservative thinkers \n     have been motivated and sustained in their mission.\n       It is no less an honor--and, dare I say, still more of a \n     pleasure--to be invited here on the occasion of the \n     presentation of the Clare Booth Luce award to my old friend \n     Ronald Reagan.\n       President Reagan is one of the greatest men of our time, \n     and one of the greatest American Presidents of all time. If \n     that is not fully appreciated today, and sadly it is not, it \n     isn't really surprising. After all, so many people have been \n     proved wrong by Ronald Reagan that they simply daren't \n     acknowledge his achievement.\n       Forests have already been pulped to print the revisionist \n     analyses of the '80s. Those who were once so confident of the \n     superiority of the Soviet system that they advocated \n     appeasement of it now pretend to believe that it was doomed \n     to inevitable collapse. Tell that to the Russians! The former \n     Soviet ministers didn't, and don't, doubt the seriousness of \n     the struggle, even if Western liberal commentators do.\n       No one in the West appreciates all this better--and no one \n     served the President and this country more loyally--than Cap \n     Weinberger, here to receive the award on Ronald Reagan's \n     behalf. He was also a great friend to Britain, above all \n     during the Falklands War. It's nice to be among \n     conservatives. It's still nicer to be among friends.\n       When the Heritage Foundation asked me to make the virtue of \n     courage the centerpiece of this lecture, I was not \n     displeased. Of the four cardinal virtues (courage, \n     temperance, justice and prudence) it is the last (prudence) \n     that the ancient philosophers traditionally placed at the \n     moral apex. They did so because they understood, quite \n     rightly, that without that practical, seemingly rather dull \n     virtue, none of the others could be correctly applied. You \n     have to know when and how to be brave, or self-controlled or \n     fair-minded, in particular situations. Prudence--or what I \n     would prefer to call a good, hearty helping of common sense--\n     shows the way.\n\n\n                   courage and charm of ronald reagan\n\n       But in my political lifetime I believe that it is fortitude \n     or courage that we've most needed and often, I fear, most \n     lacked.\n       Today we are particularly conscious of the courage of \n     Ronald Reagan. It was easy for his contemporaries to ignore \n     it: He always seemed so calm and relaxed, with natural charm, \n     unstudied self-assurance, and unquenchable good humor. He was \n     always ready with just the right quip--often self-\n     deprecatory, though with a serious purpose--so as to lighten \n     the darkest moments and give all around him heart. The \n     excellent recent study by Dinesh D'Souza refreshed my memory \n     about some of these occasions and told me of others which I \n     didn't previously know.\n       Right from the beginning, Ronald Reagan set out to \n     challenge everything that the liberal political elite of \n     America accepted and sought to propagate.\n       They believed that America was doomed to decline. He \n     believed it was destined for further greatness.\n       They imagined that sooner or later there would be \n     convergence between the free Western system and the socialist \n     Eastern system, and that some kind of social democratic \n     outcome was inevitable. He, by contrast, considered that \n     socialism was a patent failure which should be cast onto the \n     trash heap of history.\n       They thought that the problem with America was the American \n     people, though they didn't quite put it like that. He thought \n     that the problem with America was the American government, \n     and he did put it just like that.\n       The political elite were prepared to kowtow to the \n     counterculture that grew up on American campuses, fed by a \n     mixture of high-brow dogma and low-brow self-indulgence. Gov. \n     Reagan would have none of it and expressed his disdain in his \n     own inimitable fashion.\n       On one occasion students, chanting outside the governor's \n     limousine, held up a placard bearing the modest inscription. \n     ``We Are the Future.'' The governor scribbled down his\n\n[[Page S211]]\n\n     reply and held it up to the car window. It read: ``I'll sell \n     my bonds.''\n       In those days, of course, there were not many people buying \n     bonds in Ronald Reagan. But from the very first time I met \n     him I felt that I had to invest. I was leader of the \n     Opposition--one of the most tricky posts in British \n     politics--when Gov. Reagan paid me a visit. The impression is \n     still vivid in my mind--not so vivid that I can remember \n     exactly what he said, only the clarity with which he set \n     forth his beliefs and the way he put large truths and complex \n     ideas into simple language.\n       As soon as I met Gov. Reagan, I knew that we were of like \n     mind, and manifestly so did he. We shared a rather unusual \n     philosophy, and we shared something else rather unusual as \n     well: We were in politics because we wanted to put our \n     philosophy into practice.\n\n\n                      RONALD REAGAN'S ACHIEVEMENT\n\n       Ronald Reagan has changed America and the world, but the \n     changes he made were to restore historic conservative values, \n     not to impose artificially constructed ones.\n       Take his economic policy, for example. It was certainly a \n     very radical thing to do when he removed regulations and cut \n     taxes and left the Fed to squeeze out inflation by monetary \n     means. Supply-side economics, Reaganomics, Voodoo economics--\n     all these descriptions and mis-descriptions testified to the \n     perception of what was proposed as something outlandish. But \n     it really wasn't and Ronald Reagan knew it wasn't.\n       After all, if you believe that it's business success that \n     creates prosperity and jobs, you leave business as free as \n     you possibly can to succeed. If you thing that it's \n     governments--taxing, spending, regulating, and printing \n     money--that distort the business environment and penalize \n     success, you stop government doing these things.\n       If, at the deepest level, you have confidence in the talent \n     and enterprise of your own people you express that \n     confidence, you give them faith and hope. Ronald Reagan did \n     all these things--and it worked.\n       Today's American prosperity in the late 1990s is the \n     result, above all, of the fundamental shift of direction \n     President Reagan promoted in the 1980s.\n       Perhaps it's something of an irony that it's an \n     administration of instinctive spenders and regulators that \n     now is reaping much of the political reward. But we \n     conservatives shouldn't really be that surprised, for it was \n     the departure from some of those conservative principles, \n     after Ronald Reagan and I left office, that left conservative \n     politicians in both our countries out in the cold. One of \n     Thatcher's iron laws is that conservative governments that \n     put up taxes lose elections.\n       It is, however, for fighting and winning the Cold War that \n     Ronald Reagan deserves the most credit--and credit not just \n     from Americans, but from the rest of what we called in those \n     days the Free World, and from those in the former Communist \n     states who can now breathe the air of liberty.\n       President Reagan's ``expert critics'' used to complain that \n     he didn't really understand communism. But he understood it a \n     great deal better than they did. He had seen at first hand \n     its malevolent influence, under various guises and through \n     various fronts, working by stealth for the West's \n     destruction.\n       He had understood that it thrived on the fear, weakness and \n     spinelessness of the West's political class. Because that \n     class itself had so little belief in Western values, it could \n     hardly conceal a sneaking admiration for those of the Soviet \n     Union. For these people, the retreat of Western power--from \n     Asia, from Africa, from South America--was the natural way of \n     the world.\n       Of course, there were always some honest men struggling to \n     arrest the decline, or at least to ameliorate its \n     consequences. The doctrine of ``containment'' was envisaged \n     as a way of conducting a strategic resistance to Communist \n     incursion. Similarly, the doctrine of ``detente'' also had \n     its honorable Western advocates--none more so than Henry \n     Kissinger. But the fact remains that it meant different \n     things to different sides.\n       For the West, detente signified--as the word itself \n     literally means--an easing in tension between the two \n     superpowers and two blocs. This made a certain sense at the \n     time, because it reduced the risk of a nuclear confrontation \n     which Western unpreparedness had brought closer because we \n     had allowed our conventional defenses to run down.\n       But it also threatened to lead us into a fatal trap. For to \n     the Soviets, detente signified merely the promotion of their \n     goal of world domination while minimizing the risk of direct \n     military confrontation.\n       So under the cloak of wordy communiques about peace and \n     understanding, the Soviet Union expanded its nuclear arsenal \n     and its navy, engaged in continual doctrinal warfare, and \n     subverted states around the globe by means of its own \n     advisers and the armed forces of its surrogates. There was \n     only one destination to which this path could lead--that of \n     Western defeat. And that's where we were heading.\n       This was a message which few newspapers and commentators \n     wanted to hear. It was at this time--the mid-1970s--that \n     after one such speech I was generously awarded by the Soviet \n     military newspaper Red Star the sobriquet of the ``Iron \n     Lady.''\n       You might imagine that it would be easier to call for a \n     return to military strength and national greatness in the \n     United States, a superpower, than in the United Kingdom, a \n     middle-ranking power. But, oddly enough, I doubt it.\n       America, as I found from my visits in the '70s and early \n     '80s, had suffered a terrible decline of confidence in its \n     role in the world. This was essentially a psychological \n     crisis, not a reflection of realities. We now know that the \n     arms build-up by the Soviets at that time was an act of \n     desperation. The Soviet Union was dangerous--deadly \n     dangerous--but the danger was that from a wounded predator, \n     not some proud beast of the jungle.\n       The more intelligent Soviet apparatchiks had grasped that \n     the economic and social system of the USSR was crumbling. The \n     only chance for the state that had so recently pledged to \n     bury the West, but which was now being buried by its own \n     cumulative incompetence, was to win an arms race. It would \n     have to rely for its survival on the ability to terrify its \n     opponents with the same success as it had terrified its own \n     citizens.\n       A totally planned society and economy has the ability to \n     concentrate productive capacity on some fixed objective with \n     a reasonable degree of success, and do it better than liberal \n     democracies. But totalitarianism can work like this only for \n     a relatively short time, after which the waste, distortions \n     and corruption increase intolerably.\n       So the Soviet Union had to aim at global dominance, and \n     achieve it quickly, because given a free competition between \n     systems, no one would wish to choose that of the Soviets. \n     Their problem was that even though they diverted the best of \n     their talent and a huge share of their GDP to the military \n     complex, they lacked the moral and material resources to \n     achieve superiority. That would be apparent as soon as the \n     West found leaders determined to face them down.\n       This was what Ronald Reagan, with my enthusiastic support \n     and that of a number of other leaders, set out as President \n     to do. And he did it on the basis of a well-considered and \n     elaborated doctrine.\n       The world has, of course, seen many international \n     doctrines--Monroe, Truman, and Brezhnev have all made their \n     contributions, some more positive than others. But for my \n     money it is the Reagan doctrine, spelt out very clearly in \n     the speech he gave to British parliamentarians in the Palace \n     of Westminster in 1982, that has had the best and greatest \n     impact.\n       This was a rejection of both containment and detente. It \n     proclaimed that the truce with communism was over. The West \n     would henceforth regard no area of the world as destined to \n     forgo its liberty simply because the Soviets claimed it to be \n     within their sphere of influence. We would fight a battle of \n     ideas against communism, and we would give material support \n     to those who fought to recover their nations from tyranny.\n       President Reagan could have no illusion about the \n     opposition he would face at home in embarking on this course: \n     He had, after all, seen these forces weaken the West \n     throughout the '70s.\n       But he used his inimitable ability to speak to the hearts \n     of the American people and to appeal over the heads of the \n     cynical, can't-do elite. He and Cap Weinberger made no secret \n     of the objective: military superiority. The Soviets \n     understood more quickly than his domestic critics the \n     seriousness of what was at stake. The Russian rhetoric grew \n     more violent; but an understanding that the game was up \n     gradually dawned in the recesses of the Politburo.\n       It is well-known that I encouraged President Reagan to ``do \n     business'' with President Gorbachev. I also still give credit \n     to Mr. Gorbachev for introducing freedom of speech and of \n     religion into the Soviet Union.\n       But let's be clear: The Soviet power brokers knew that they \n     had to choose a reformer because they understood that the old \n     strategy of intimidating and subverting would not work with \n     Ronald Reagan in the White House and--who knows?--even \n     Margaret Thatcher in 10 Downing Street.\n       The final straw for the Evil Empire was the Strategic \n     Defense Initiative [SDI]. President Reagan was, I believe, \n     deliberately and cunningly tempted by the Soviets at \n     Reykjavik. They made ever more alluring offers to cut their \n     nuclear arsenals, and the President, who was a genuine \n     believer in a nuclear-weapons-free world (it was one of the \n     few things we disagreed about), thought he was making \n     progress.\n       There was no mention of SDI, and it appeared that the \n     Soviets had tacitly accepted that its future was not for \n     negotiation. Then, at the very last moment, they insisted \n     that SDI be effectively abandoned. The President immediately \n     refused, the talks ended in acrimony, and in the media he was \n     heavily criticized.\n       But it was on that day, when a lesser man would have \n     compromised, that he showed his mettle.\n       As a result of his courage, work on the SDI program \n     continued and the Soviets understood that their last gambit \n     had failed. Three years later, when Mr. Gorbachev peacefully \n     allowed Eastern Europe to slide out of Soviet control, Ronald \n     Reagan's earlier decision to stand firm was vindicated. The \n     Soviets at last understood that the best they could hope for \n     was to be allowed to reform their system, not to impose it on \n     the rest of the world.\n       And, of course, as soon as they embarked upon serious \n     reform, the artificial construct of the USSR, sustained by \n     lies and violence for more than half a century, imploded with \n     a whimper.\n       The idea that such achievements were a matter of luck is \n     frankly laughable. Yes, the President had luck. But he \n     deserved the luck he enjoyed. Fortune favors the brave, the \n     saying runs.\n\n[[Page S212]]\n\n       As this hero of our times faces his final and most \n     merciless enemy, he shows the same quiet courage which \n     allowed him to break the world free of a monstrous creed \n     without a shot being fired. President Reagan: Your friends \n     salute you!\n\n\n                      new challenges face the west\n\n       Democracies, like human beings, have a tendency to relax \n     when the worst is over. Our Western democracies accordingly \n     relaxed--both at home and abroad--in the period after the \n     fall of the Berlin Wall.\n       It was, of course, right that in this period there should \n     be a new look at priorities. The threat from the Soviet Union \n     was much diminished--both directly in Europe and indirectly \n     in regional conflicts that they had once exploited.\n       At least the worst errors of the past were avoided--America \n     stayed militarily committed to Europe, NATO remained the \n     linchpin of Western security and, in spite of the \n     protectionist instincts of the European Union, progress \n     continued with reducing barriers to trade.\n       These elements of continuity were crucial to the relative \n     security and (in spite of the turbulence in the Far East) the \n     considerable prosperity we enjoy today. These were the \n     positive aspects.\n       But there are also worrying negative ones. Each will \n     require new acts of political courage to overcome.\n       First, lower defense spending in America, Britain and \n     elsewhere was used not to cut taxes and so boost prosperity, \n     but rather the so-called Peace Dividend went principally to \n     pay for welfare. This in turn has harmed our countries both \n     socially and economically, worsening trends which had already \n     become manifest.\n       Welfare dependency is bad for families and bad for the \n     taxpayer. It makes it less necessary and less worthwhile to \n     work. The promotion of idleness leads, as it always does, to \n     the growth of vice, irresponsibility and crime.\n       The bonds which hold society together are weakened. The \n     bill--for single mothers, for delinquency, for vandalism--\n     mounts. In some areas a generation grows up without solid \n     roots or sound role models, without self-esteem or hope.\n       It is extraordinary what damage is sometimes done in the \n     name of compassion. The risk of reversing the growth of \n     welfare dependency and repairing the structure of the \n     traditional family is one of the most difficult we in the \n     West face.\n       Secondly, the post-Cold War slackening of resolve has led \n     to a lack of military preparedness. Understandably, with the \n     end of the Cold War the sense of omnipresent danger receded. \n     Less excusably, the fact that the Soviet Union and its \n     successor states no longer challenged the West's very \n     survival led Western countries to behave as if other, new \n     threats could be ignored.\n       Yet the truth is so obvious that surely only an expert \n     could miss it: There is never a lack of potential aggressors.\n       We now have to reassess our defense spending, which has \n     been cut back too far. Still more significant has been the \n     failure to grasp the vital importance of investment in the \n     very latest defense technology. The crucial importance of \n     keeping up research and development in defense is the great \n     lesson of SDI. It is also the lesson--in two respects--of \n     today's confrontation with Iraq.\n       The original defeat of Saddam's forces was so swift--though \n     sadly not complete--because of our overwhelming technical \n     superiority. The fact that we are still having to apply \n     constant pressure and the closest scrutiny to Iraq also bears \n     witness to the lethal capability which science and technology \n     can place in a dictator's hands and the enormous difficulty \n     of removing it. Chemical and biological weapons and the \n     components for nuclear weapons can be all too easily \n     concealed.\n       The proliferation of ballistic missile technology also \n     greatly adds to the menace. According to the Defense Studies \n     Center at Lancaster University in Britain, 35 non-NATO \n     countries now have ballistic missiles. Of these, the five \n     ``rogue states''--Iraq, Iran, Libya, Syria and North Korea--\n     are a particular worry.\n       North Korea has been supplying ballistic missiles to those \n     who can afford them, and it continues to develop more \n     advanced long-range missiles, with a range of 2,500 to 4,000 \n     miles. According to U.S. sources, all of Northeast Asia, \n     Southeast Asia, much of the Pacific, and most of Russia could \n     soon be threatened by these latest North Korean missiles.\n       Once they are available in the Middle East and North \n     Africa, all the capitals of Europe will be within target \n     range. And on present trends a direct threat to American \n     shores is likely to mature early in the next century.\n       Diplomatic pressure to restrict proliferation, though it \n     may be useful, can never be a sufficient instrument in \n     itself. It is important that the West remain able and \n     willing--and is known to be able and willing--to take \n     preemptive action if that should ultimately become necessary.\n       But it is also vital that progress be made towards the \n     construction of an effective global defense against missile \n     attack. This would be a large and costly venture to which \n     America's allies must be prepared to contribute. It would \n     require a rare degree of courageous statesmanship to carry it \n     through.\n       But it is also difficult to overstate the terrible \n     consequences if we were to fail to take measures to protect \n     our populations while there is still time to do so.\n       Thirdly, political courage will be required constantly to \n     restate the case for Western unity under American leadership. \n     America was left by the end of the Cold War as the effective \n     global power of last resort, the only superpower. But there \n     was also a widespread reluctance to face up to this reality.\n       The same mentality which Ronald Reagan had had to overcome \n     was at work. Large numbers of intellectuals and commentators, \n     uneasy at the consequences of a victory whose causes they had \n     never properly understood, sought to submerge America and the \n     West in a new, muddled multilateralism.\n       I suppose it's not surprising. As Irving Kristol once \n     noted, ``No modern nation has ever constructed a foreign \n     policy that was acceptable to its intellectuals.''\n       In fact, it is as if some people take a perverse delight in \n     learning the wrong lessons from events. It was Western unity, \n     under inspiring American leadership, which changed the world. \n     But now that unity is at risk as the European Union, with \n     apparent encouragement from the United States, seems bent on \n     becoming a single state with a single defense--a fledgling \n     superpower. Such a development would not relieve America of \n     obligations; it would merely increase the obstacles to \n     American policy.\n\n\n              policymakers succumbed to liberal contagion\n\n       Today's international policymakers have succumbed to a \n     liberal contagion whose most alarming symptom is to view any \n     new and artificial structure as preferable to a traditional \n     and tested one. So they forget that it was powerful nation \n     states, drawing on national loyalties and national armies, \n     which enforced UN Security Council Resolutions and defeated \n     Iraq in 1991. Their short-term goal is to subordinate \n     American and other national sovereignties to multilateral \n     authorities; their long-term goal, one suspects, is to \n     establish the UN as a kind of embryo world government.\n       Surely the crisis in the former Yugoslavia should have \n     shown the folly of these illusions. There the tragic farce of \n     European Union meddling only prolonged the aggression and the \n     United Nations proved incapable of agreeing on effective \n     action. We are still trying to make the flawed Dayton \n     Settlement--which neither the EU nor the UN could have \n     brought about--the basis of a lasting peace in that troubled \n     region.\n       The future there is unpredictable, but one thing I do \n     venture to predict: The less America leads, and the more \n     authority slips back to unwieldy international committees and \n     their officials, the more difficulties will arise.\n       International relations today are in a kind of limbo. Few \n     politicians and diplomats really believe that any power other \n     than the United States can guarantee the peace or punish \n     aggression. But neither is there sufficient cohesion in the \n     West to give America the moral and material support she must \n     have to fulfill that role.\n       This has to change. America's duty is to lead. The other \n     Western countries' duty is to support its leadership.\n       Different countries will contribute in different ways. \n     Britain is closer to the United States by culture, language \n     and history than is any other European country. British \n     public opinion is therefore readier to back American \n     initiatives. Moreover, Britain's highly professional armed \n     forces allow us to make a unique practical contribution when \n     the necessity arises.\n       But the fundamental equation holds good for all of us: \n     Provided Western countries unite under American leadership, \n     the West will remain the dominant global influence. If we do \n     not, the opportunity for rogue states and new tyrannical \n     powers to exploit our divisions will increase, and so will \n     the danger to all.\n       So the task for conservatives today is to revive a sense of \n     Western identity, unity and resolve. The West is after all \n     not just some ephemeral Cold War construct. It is the core of \n     a civilization which has carried all before it, transforming \n     the outlook and pattern of life of every continent.\n       It is time to proclaim our beliefs in the wonderful \n     creativity of the human spirit, in the rights of property and \n     the rule of law, in the extraordinary fecundity of enterprise \n     and trade, and in the Western cultural heritage, without \n     which our liberty would long ago have degenerated into \n     license or collapsed into tyranny.\n       These are as much the tasks of today as they were of \n     yesterday, as much the duty of conservative believers now as \n     they were when Ronald Reagan and I refused to accept the \n     decline of the West as our ineluctable destiny.\n       As the poet said:\n       ``That which thy fathers bequeathed thee Earn it anew if \n     thou would'st possess it.''\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I just want to read some brief, selective \npassages from what Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of \nGreat Britain, had to say:\n\n       President Reagan is one of the greatest men of our time, \n     and one of the greatest American Presidents of all time. If \n     that is not fully appreciated today, and sadly it is not, it \n     isn't really surprising. After all, so many people have been \n     proved wrong by Ronald Reagan that they simply daren't \n     acknowledge his achievement. . .\n       But in my political lifetime I believe that it is fortitude \n     or courage that we've most needed and often, I fear, most \n     lacked.\n\n[[Page S213]]\n\n       Today we are particularly conscious of the courage of \n     Ronald Reagan. It was easy for his contemporaries to ignore \n     it: He always seemed so calm and relaxed, with natural charm, \n     unstudied self-assurance, and unquenchable good humor. He was \n     always ready with just the right quip--often self-\n     deprecatory, though with a serious purpose--so as to lighten \n     the darkest moments and give all around him heart. . .\n       Right from the beginning, Ronald Reagan set out to \n     challenge everything that the liberal political elite of \n     America accepted and sought [as gospel].\n       They believed that America was doomed to decline. He \n     believed it was destined for further greatness.\n       They imagined that sooner or later there would be \n     convergence between the free Western system and the socialist \n     Eastern system, and that some kind of social democratic \n     outcome was inevitable. He, by contrast, considered that \n     socialism was a patent failure which should be cast onto the \n     trash heap of history.\n       They thought that the problem with America was the American \n     people, though they didn't quite put it [that way.] He \n     thought that the problem with America was the American \n     government, and he did put it just [that way.]\n\n  In conclusion, and what I think is so beautiful a statement about our \ncountry and our world and about Ronald Reagan, she summed it up \nperfectly. She said:\n\n       It is time to proclaim our beliefs in the wonderful \n     creativity of the human spirit, in the rights of property and \n     the rule of law, in the extraordinary fecundity of enterprise \n     and trade, and in the Western cultural heritage, without \n     which our liberty would long ago have degenerated into \n     license or collapsed into tyranny.\n       These are as much the tasks of today as they were of \n     yesterday, as much the duty of our conservative believers now \n     as they were when Ronald Reagan and I refused to accept the \n     decline of the West as our ineluctable destiny.\n       As the poet said: ``That which thy fathers bequeathed thee \n     Earn it anew if thou would'st possess it.''\n\n  A great speech. I have just taken some portions from it. It meant a \ngreat deal to me.\n  I hope we will honor former President Ronald Reagan in this way. I \ncan think of a lot of Democrats I would be perfectly willing to name \nsome building or some facility for. I think President Jimmy Carter has \nreally been an example since he has been President. I don't know that \nwe have named anything after him. I don't know that he sought it, or \nhis family. I am not saying we should do it now. This is not partisan \nwith me, but it is very emotional, and I hope that we will find a way, \nworking together, to get this bill through in time for his birthday. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for his \nremarks just now. No one, or few, I suppose, can match the eloquence of \nMargaret Thatcher, especially as she talks about one of those partners \nin leadership that she shared so much with in the time that she led \nBritain to the heights that it achieved during her tenure as Prime \nMinister.\n  I am quite sure that with unanimity, this Senate wishes to honor our \nformer President. So the majority leader's wish will come true; we will \nhonor President Reagan. In fact, as he noted, we will honor him quite \ncertainly, regardless of what happens to the airport. We will honor him \nby naming after him the largest nondefense building in the country, a \nGovernment building, a beautiful building, a building that will last \nfor centuries, a building dedicated to permanence and a building with \ngreat meaning, I think, to all of us as we pass down Pennsylvania \nAvenue today.\n  It is an extraordinary new accomplishment, architecturally and in \nmany other ways. We have already made the decision to name that \nsuperior piece of architecture after our former President, Ronald \nReagan.\n  So let no one be misguided by the remarks today. We honor President \nReagan. No one should also be misled with regard to our intentions. \nThere was comment made that we are blocking this legislation. If we \nwere blocking it, Mr. President, we would not have agreed for it to \npass out of committee unanimously. If we were blocking it, we would \nhave demanded hearings and we would have used whatever procedural \ndevices at our disposal in the committee. We have not chosen to do \nthat. We are not blocking it today. We have no reservations about \nbringing it up. We are simply not willing to support a unanimous \nconsent request that limits us to one amendment.\n  Finally, let me say the majority leader noted that we are not taking \nWashington's name off the airport. The only amendment our Republican \ncolleagues wish to offer has as its stated purpose, and I will quote, \n``to rename the Washington National Airport located in the District of \nColumbia and Virginia as `Ronald Reagan National Airport.' ''\n  So if that doesn't take Washington's name off the airport, I don't \nknow what does. That is exactly what it does on line 5, page 1. It \nsays:\n\n       From here on after approved June 29, 1940, the airport \n     known as Washington National Airport shall hereafter be known \n     and designated as ``Ronald Reagan National Airport.''\n\n  So, quite clearly, let no one, regardless of what one may think about \nhonoring our former President Ronald Reagan, quite clearly we are doing \nit by removing the name of the first President of the United States, \nGeorge Washington. Now, we may want to do that, but that clearly is the \ndesign, that is the intent of this legislation, and that is why we \nthink it is in our interest to explore it, to talk about it.\n  It isn't mutually exclusive. We can find ways to honor our former \nPresident, and we can find ways to ensure that we do it correctly and \ndo it with all of the facts on the table. That is all we are asking. \nLet's do it with eyes wide open, knowing the ramifications, knowing \nexactly what it is we are doing and then pursuing the best course after \nthat. I think we can do that. I pledge my assistance in working with \nthe majority leader and our Republican colleagues to do it. But we are \nnot ready yet. I am sure at some point soon we will be, but let's \nproceed in a positive way, not criticizing one another as we start out \nthis effort, but finding the best way with which to resolve these \nquestions. I am sure that can be done, and with that optimism, I yield \nthe floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to yield in a \ncouple minutes to the Senator from Georgia, but I first feel compelled \nto answer a couple of comments the distinguished Democratic leader and \ngood friend of mine made.\n  First of all, I don't think any American identifies Washington \nNational Airport with George Washington. They identify it with \nWashington, DC. So let's really be clear about that. To take the word \n``Washington'' out of it is not in any way demeaning or lessening the \nreputation of George Washington; it is because it was identified with \nWashington, DC.\n  We named Idlewild Airport ``Kennedy Airport.'' I am sure whoever \nIdlewild was, or whatever location it was, didn't feel aggrieved when \nit wasn't called Kennedy-Idlewild Airport.\n\n  Second of all, let's talk about the cost here one second. The bulk of \nthe costs associated with the name change at National Airport are \nrelated to changing the signs and logos for the airport.\n  I would like to enter into the Record a copy of a letter from a \ngroup, Americans for Tax Reform, which created and promoted the Reagan \nlegacy project. The letter states:\n\n       In order to ensure no expenses will be incurred by the \n     Federal Government as a result of this bill, we are willing \n     to coordinate fundraising efforts to fund the creation of \n     appropriate signs and logos for the Ronald Reagan National \n     Airport.\n\n  The letter goes on to estimate these costs at $60,000. Let's put that \nin context. We just spent well over $1 billion in modernizing \nWashington National Airport. The cost of this would be $60,000. If \nthere is a deep and abiding concern on the other side of the aisle \nabout the costs associated with changing the name, I can assure you \nthat Senator Coverdell, Senator Lott and I and everybody else will lead \na fundraising effort and pay for this. I am deeply moved about their \nconcern about the taxpayers' dollars.\n  I don't like to start out the year this way, Mr. President. I really \ndon't. We have enough problems. We have enough difficulties around here \nwithout our getting hung up on doing what is the right thing for one of \nthe greatest men in the history of this Nation.\n\n[[Page S214]]\n\n  The interesting thing is, he doesn't want to be honored in any way \nbecause he doesn't think he deserves it, which is the mark of the \ngreatness and humility of the man. But for us to somehow get hung up on \ncost, on logos, on whether the name ``Washington'' is out of it, this \nis not an appropriate way to start out this year.\n  I want to tell my friends on the other side of the aisle, we feel \nvery strongly about this issue--very strongly--and if we get hung up on \nthis thing and we are not able to go ahead and honor Ronald Reagan on \nhis birthday, it is going to start things off on a very bad note.\n  I also want to point out, yes, thanks to Senator Hollings and the \nbipartisan spirit in which we run the Commerce Committee, it was \ndischarged from the Commerce Committee, but we also had a markup \nscheduled today, and we would have marked up that bill and reported it \nout of committee today as well. So I appreciate the cooperation of my \nfriends on the Commerce Committee, but we would have reported it out of \nthe Commerce Committee today, I have no doubt about that.\n  Again, I don't want to be repetitive, but I am astounded--I am \nastounded--that when Americans from all over this country would like to \nhave this opportunity to honor Ronald Reagan on his birthday as he goes \nthrough this very difficult period, that we should somehow raise a \nstraw man about costs and logos and Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, I would like to conclude by saying I first came to \nknow Ronald Reagan during my years in Vietnam when President Reagan was \nGovernor of California. The North Vietnamese had orchestrated an effort \nto demoralize their American prisoners by convincing us that our \ncountry opposed the war and that we had been forgotten and left behind.\n  As new American prisoners were brought to Hanoi, however, they took \nadvantage of our primitive communications abilities. They made sure \nthat we knew about this Governor in California who was helping lead \nefforts to secure our release and take care of our families in the \nmeantime. This Governor, Ronald Reagan, served as a very welcome \nreminder that our country had not forgotten us. I and many others will \nforever be indebted to him for that and for the friendship we developed \nafter the war.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bond). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I see there are some other speakers. I \nhave some extended remarks, but I will be brief now in deference to \nother people if they have a comment to make. But Mr. President, this is \nthe definition of ``pettiness.'' This is demeaning. The concept that we \nwould honor a former President, but we have to extract a price.\n  A memorandum went out to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nthat wanted an IRS reformation amendment tacked to this legislation. \nThe idea that ``You can have this memorial, but only if we extract \nsomething from it, too.'' Maybe this is an indication of just how \ncynical this city has become from top to bottom.\n  I have great respect for the minority leader. I consider him a very \ngood friend. But who would counsel him to suggest ``We haven't heard \nfrom the Reagan family''? What are they supposed to do, buy tickets and \nfly over here and lobby outside the Chamber? Is that what you would ask \nof them to do?\n  The other gentlemen on the list that I have heard that you perhaps \nwould choose to honor, so be it. Honor them. Come forward with these \nideas, but not as a quid pro quo to a memorial to this former \nPresident.\n  Do you remember the memorial to the late President Franklin \nRoosevelt? Was there some skirmish over there? Did there have to be \nsome ratification or some affidavit from their family as to whether or \nnot it ought to be built and how? I, like Senator McCain, would not \nhave been able to envision that we would be discussing Ronald Reagan in \nthis manner.\n  Are we removing the name of the airport? Has their family \nappropriately petitioned this Congress that only awards things to those \nthat are on their knees asking?\n  Can there not be an acceptance of fact that we are dealing with a \ngreat American figure who is wounded--who is wounded--who is near the \nend? And here we are piddling around with, was it named after the \nPresident or after the city or have we heard from them, the family, and \nhow much will it cost, when everybody knows it is minimal?\n  The only word that characterizes it is ``demeaning.''\n  Mr. President, I will ask for time later on, but I yield the floor in \ndeference to my colleague from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I thank my friend from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise for the simple purpose of simply \ninforming the Senate of a very happy occasion in the very near future. \nIt will be the dedication of the Ronald Reagan International Trade \nBuilding at 16th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, the largest Federal \nbuilding, as it happens, in the city and the completion, after 60 or 70 \nyears--70 years of the Federal Triangle proposal which was begun by \nAndrew Mellon under the Presidency of Herbert Hoover for whom the \nCommerce Building across from 16th Street is named.\n  The Ronald Reagan Building was--it should be noted that he signed the \nbill on August 21, 1987, the Federal Triangle Development Act. I had \noffered the measure here. It passed, very happily, and authorized the \nconstruction of an international, cultural and trade center on that \nsite--a billion dollars worth of real estate. The site was cleared in \n1928 and remained a parking lot until now. I remember writing a \nproposal for President Kennedy on the redevelopment of Pennsylvania \nAvenue--a parking lot of surpassing ugliness.\n  But then in 1995, with the building up and about to be running, \nCongresswoman Andrea Seastrand, who represented the District in which \nthe President lives, introduced a bill to name it for him. Senator Dole \ncosponsored it here. It was passed unanimously, I should think, in both \nbodies. And on December 22, 1995, in a very fine ceremony in the Oval \nOffice, President Clinton signed that bill. Speaker Gingrich, Mr. Dole, \nMr. Daschle, the Vice President, and the Senator from New York were \nthere. Alas, Representative Seastrand had a vote and could not come.\n  The building is a 2-century building. It will be there for a very \nlong while. We own the land. It will save money because we will move \npeople from rented space to Government space in the same manner that \nthe Judiciary Building now flanks Union Station but it is a \ncongressional building. It is on Federal land. It is a lease-to-own \nproject. In about 25 years we will have it. We are already paying less \nrent than we were paying in rented space because we own the land. It is \na handsome building. It is a triumphal building.\n  The architectural critic of the Washington Post, Benjamin Forgey, has \ngiven it his very warm endorsement. It has a great atrium. As you walk \nin it, you see the names, Ronald Reagan and International Trade \nOrganization Building--the Ronald Reagan Building, and in it the \nNational Trade Center. You know you are at a special place designed \nfor, authorized, and built by a very special man, and now to be named \nfor that man in a ceremony that I hope will be joyous, celebratory, and \non the edge sad as we consider the condition of our former President, \nbut proud that he was just that.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. JOHNSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I want to thank the Senator from New York for calling \nour attention to this extraordinary event.\n  Could you share with us again, one, what the timing is of the \nceremony?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. April 28 or May 5.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. What will be involved in this ceremony?\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Well, there will be the formal dedication. There will \nbe, I believe, the National Symphony. There will be a musical. It will \nbe a day-long event. And I hope people will find time for it. There is \nnothing like it that will have happened in our city--well, for those \nwho do not know the history, the Federal Triangle was moving along very \nwell. The crash came, and they stopped--boom--they just stopped. Now\n\n[[Page S215]]\n\nwe have finished it. President Kennedy envisioned it. President Reagan \nmade it possible. And we are naming it for President Reagan.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I wonder if it isn't fair to say--there has been some \nharsh rhetoric here and knocking down of straw men as we have gone \nabout discussions this afternoon in the United States Senate relative \nto memorializing former President Reagan. And I wonder if it isn't fair \nto say that the issues that have been raised are not questioning \nwhether to suitably and appropriately memorialize President Reagan's \nadministration. The questions are not partisan in nature. We have \nmemorialized Presidents of both political parties, as we always will \nand always should. There is no opposition, certainly, to the largest \nbuilding I believe on all of Pennsylvania Avenue, America's main \nstreet, the avenue that is used for our inaugural parades, the largest \nbuilding, a very prominently located building--and it has yet even to \nhave the ceremony for its opening, but it passed by unanimous vote, the \nSenator tells us, in both the House and Senate; bipartisan on both \nsides of the aisle--but there was no resistance to memorializing in a \nvery prominent and very focal, high focal point of our Nation's most \nimportant street an enormous building named for President Reagan.\n  So it would seem that the issues that have been raised here are not \npetty, are not meant to demean or in any way undermine the recognition \nof the contributions that President Reagan made--and he made very \nsignificant contributions to this Nation--but that there are legitimate \npoints being raised, one, about the process, rather than the politics, \nof naming and especially renaming where the name George Washington has \nalways been tied to National Airport--in fact National Airport, I \nbelieve, was designed with the terminal intended to be evocative of \nMount Vernon and located in a community very near Mount Vernon and \nwhere he is very closely associated with the Arlington and Alexandria \ncommunities--and whether there ought to be a more systematic process \nfor especially renaming institutions that have been previously named \nfor other great Americans.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. So the question is not one of whether President Reagan \nshould be memorialized. Certainly he should be.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I believe the time is on your side.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. The Senator from New York controls the time.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I yield the floor and say I spent 35 years getting this \nbuilding built. I leave it to others to describe how it should be \nnamed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I assume you are yielding?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I certainly yield.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Is the Senator aware of the fact that your side has \noffered a proposal that, yes, go ahead; we can proceed with this, \ncomma, but we have to have something for it. We have somebody else we \nwant to have another building named after. I mean, I am getting \nconfused signals here. Are we really getting into a discussion about \nchanging the name of the Washington, DC, airport? We are going to \ninvoke all this intellectual analysis of how that building was built. I \nmean, that is not what was being sent to us all morning long.\n  We were not arguing over, you know, the dynamics of the process, \nwhether or not we are going to name another building. I do not object \nto you all naming another building for somebody that you want to honor, \nbut it ought to be done on its own. This should not be held up in this \nmanner as a negotiating tool. And that is what has been going on all \nday.\n  Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. If the Senator will yield back.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I certainly will.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Obviously, I do not speak for my colleagues on either \nside of the aisle. I speak only as this Senator, expressing, one, my \nconviction that there ought to be a very significant memorial to Ronald \nReagan. There is one that has been built. The doors, the ribbons have \nnot yet been cut. They soon will be. And this is an extraordinary \nmemorial in one of the most prominent locations of all of Washington. I \napplaud that.\n  The only other question I raise is whether there ought to be yet \nanother memorial before the ribbon has even been cut on the first large \none, which would have an effect on the airport that memorialized George \nWashington and which has not gone through what seems to me, from this \nSenator's point of view, an orderly, thoughtful process.\n  The Board of Trade in the Washington area, other groups think this is \na poor idea, that perhaps there ought to be other memorials to Ronald \nReagan. I would say probably that is true. The suggestion is there \nought to be one in every State. Perhaps there ought to be. Perhaps \nthere ought to be more in Washington, DC.\n\n  However, I simply raise as this Senator's point of view that I think \nwe are getting carried away in a nonsystematic and not terribly \nthoughtful process about how we name and pull names off of memorials to \ngreat Americans. So I have nothing but great respect to express for \nPresident Reagan and his family, and I regret that any of this debate \nthat has been caught up in exactly how best to memorialize great \nAmericans would by anyone be perceived as somehow negative or otherwise \nundermining respect for this past President.\n  However, I think there are legitimate concerns expressed by some that \nhave nothing to do with partisan politics, that have nothing to do with \nrespect or lack of respect for past Presidents, particularly this past \nPresident. I simply want to raise that issue, that there are concerns \namong those who I think in good faith are expressing some concern not \nabout memorialization but about a specific renaming. The issue, I \nthink, in that sense is narrow.\n  I personally feel that there is room for improvement in the process \nthat we use for the naming of institutions. That isn't to say, however, \nthat the naming of any particular institution wouldn't be approved by \nwhat I think ought to be a nonpartisan commission of some sort, which I \nthink would greatly strengthen our current rather hodgepodge way of \nnaming institutions and buildings and facilities that will be that way \nfor hundreds of years--unless, of course, there are changes in power in \nCongress and we develop this precedent that whoever is in the majority \ncomes in and changes the names of buildings. That would be a terrible \nmistake.\n  I hope the Reagan building downtown stays that way virtually forever \nand that there is never a thought of renaming that. I simply raise this \npoint to hopefully lend a bit of thoughtfulness and recognition that at \nstake here is not the honor of the Reagan family or President Reagan \nnor is it necessarily partisan politics.\n  I do not necessarily join in with others who may see other political \nagendas here. This is an institution of 100 individuals, and there are \nprobably 100 agendas on this floor on a given day, but I do want to \nshare those observations with my friend and my colleague about the \nconcerns that came to my mind on this issue.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I accept the convictions of my good \ncolleague and his wish that this would not have the taint that it does. \nUnfortunately, that is what has happened here.\n  Nor is there anything unique here. Just last year I voted for \nlegislation to honor a colleague on your side of the aisle, one in my \nown State, a legislative process just like this, a fellow Congressman \nwho is retired, John Rowland. We named a courthouse in our State for \nhim and we were very glad to have been part of it. He deserves it.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. And I add that I joined in the unanimous consent on the \nnaming of the Reagan building downtown as a Member of the other body \nduring that time, and I am proud of that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I accept the statement of the Senator.\n  Unfortunately, during the course of the last several hours, this has \nturned into a quid pro quo. From my own view, I would rather that it \nnot be accepted than we get into, ``Well, we will do this if you do \nthat,'' and we will name this that and this something else. I can only \nspeak for myself. That is my view of it.\n  I mentioned a little earlier, Mr. President, that there are some \nunique\n\n[[Page S216]]\n\ncircumstances that we are confronting in this particular case with \nformer President Reagan. I have been going through some of his legacy \nof late, and I will share one of the most profound letters an American \nleader has ever written to his country. It came to us on November 5, \n1994.\n\n       My fellow Americans, I have recently been told that I am \n     one of the millions of Americans who will be afflicted with \n     Alzheimer's disease.\n       Upon learning this news, Nancy and I had to decide whether \n     as private citizens we would keep this a private matter or \n     whether we would make this news known in a public way. In the \n     past, Nancy suffered from breast cancer and I had my cancer \n     surgeries. We found through our open disclosures we were able \n     to raise public awareness. We were happy that as a result, \n     many more people underwent testing. There were treated in \n     early stages and able to return to normal, healthy lives.\n       So now we feel it is important to share it with you. In \n     opening our hearts, we hope this might promote greater \n     awareness of this condition. Perhaps it will encourage a \n     clearer understanding of the individuals and families who are \n     affected by it.\n       At the moment I feel just fine. I intend to live the \n     remainder of the years God gives me on this Earth doing the \n     things I have always done. I will continue to share life's \n     journey with my beloved Nancy and my family. I plan to enjoy \n     the great outdoors and stay in touch with my friends and \n     supporters.\n       Unfortunately, as Alzheimer's disease progresses, the \n     family often bears a heavy burden. I only wish there was some \n     way I could spare Nancy from this painful experience. When \n     the time comes, I am confident that with your help she will \n     face it with faith and courage.\n       In closing, let me thank you, the American people, for \n     giving me the great honor of allowing me to serve as your \n     president. When the Lord calls me home, whenever that day may \n     be, I will leave with the greatest love for this country of \n     ours and eternal optimism for its future.\n       I now begin the journey that will lead me into the sunset \n     of my life. I know that for America there will always be a \n     bright dawn ahead.\n       Thank you, my friends. May God always bless you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Ronald Reagan.\n\n  Now, Ronald Reagan's birthday is next February 6, and we ought to do \nthis. This ought to be a part of the sunset journey.\n  I again say, it is absolutely beyond comprehension that a suggestion \nwas made here this afternoon that somehow his family ought to have been \nmore pronounced and more explicit about their desires with regard to \nthis legislation. To have done so would have been entirely--I repeat, \nentirely--uncharacteristic for the man that wrote this letter to do. \nNor would he in any way have condoned any member of his family making \nsuch a suggestion. The only way that something like this could happen \non the eve of these final moments would be for it to be a spontaneous \ngesture from the American people.\n  So, Mr. President, just for clarity, you never know what will happen \nin an institution like this, but again I would be prouder that this \nlegislation suffered a defeat over the nuances from the other side than \nfor there to be an asterisk on the legislation that suggested the only \nway that this body and this Congress could reach out at this moment was \nif we made some tradeoff; there have been others that got a little \nsomething here or there, like you do every day in this town. My own \nview is it would be diminishing and demeaning of what is being \nattempted and endeavored to be done here today in the name of a great \nAmerican President, among others. But this one was a great American \nPresident who, as I said earlier, is wounded.\n  There are moments in our lives and in the history of our country that \nrequire a spontaneous response and not some methodical appointing of a \ncommission to measure and weigh every balance. Thank heavens nature \ndoesn't function that way.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, to the subject that we have been \ndebating, which is legislation to rename Washington National Airport \n``Ronald Reagan National Airport,'' we have had quite a discussion here \nthis afternoon. As I said a little earlier, I have been going through, \nduring the course of this exercise, the various things, of course, that \nhave been said about our former President. I got to thinking, well, who \nknows him best? And, of course, that is the former First Lady, Nancy \nReagan. I was reminded that I had the opportunity to hear her in one of \nthe most heartfelt speeches I believe I have ever heard in San Diego at \nthe national convention in that beautiful city. It was quite a task \nthat she had to perform, to come forward before the Nation, given the \nsituation that the Reagans had been facing, and try to bring a message \nto those gathered and to the American people.\n  I think this is an appropriate time to revisit what she said about \nher husband, President Reagan, at that time. I will skip the \nintroduction, the acknowledgement of the crowd, and move to the heart \nof the speech, which was undoubtedly difficult for her to deal with \nbecause she was moving to the moment in which she felt she had the \nresponsibility to convey to the Nation a feeling about her husband's \nPresidency and her husband's views of America.\n  She said this:\n\n       Just 4 years ago, Ronnie stood before you and spoke for \n     what he said might be his last speech at a Republican \n     Convention. Sadly, his words were too prophetic. When we \n     learned of his illness, Alzheimer's, he made the decision to \n     write his letter to the American people.\n\n  This is the letter I read a moment ago from the President himself.\n  She says:\n\n       And the people responded, as they always do. I can't tell \n     you what your cards and letters have meant to both of us. The \n     love and affection from thousands of Americans has been, and \n     continues to be, a strengthening force for Ronnie and me each \n     and every day.\n\n  I want to reread that sentence because the other side has evoked that \nthere is some family responsibility here that they should have \nfulfilled as a precedent before moving for congressional action on \nthis, which as I have said repeatedly is just beyond my understanding. \nBut I will read for them what she said to America:\n\n       I cannot tell you what your cards and letters have meant to \n     both of us. The love and affection from thousands of \n     Americans has been, and continues to be, a strengthening \n     force for Ronnie and me each and every day.\n\n  In other words, it was a source of encouragement and strength for \nthem at that time to hear from our fellow countrymen about his work. \nThat's what that means.\n\n       We have learned, as too many other families have learned, \n     of the terrible pain and the loneliness that must be endured \n     as each day brings another reminder of this very long \n     goodbye. But Ronnie's spirit, his optimism, his never-failing \n     belief in the strength and goodness of America is still very \n     strong. If he were able to be here tonight, he would once \n     again remind us of the power of each individual--\n\n  How many times had we heard that from President Reagan, about the \npower of each American?\n\n       Urging us once again to fly as high as our wings will take \n     us and to never give up on America.\n\n  The majority leader was here earlier and was talking about Margaret \nThatcher and what she had said about the former President. I might \nrevisit that in just a little bit. But that's the point that Margaret \nThatcher always focused on--the never give up on America or never give \nup on Western civilization, and what she so admired in the former \nPresident. Here it is documented by Nancy Reagan when she said.\n\n       . . . remind us of the power of each individual, urging us \n     once again to fly as high as our wings will take us and to \n     never give up on America. I can tell you with certainty that \n     he still sees the ``shining city on a hill,'' a place full of \n     hope and a promise for us all.\n       As you all know, I am not the speechmaker in the family. So \n     let me close with Ronnie's words, not mine. In that last \n     speech 4 years ago, he said, ``Whatever else history may say \n     about me when I am gone, I hope it will report that I \n     appealed to your best hopes, not your worst fears, to your \n     confidence rather than your doubts, and may all of you as \n     Americans never forget your heroic origins, never fail to \n     seek divine guidance, and never, never lose your natural God-\n     given optimism.''\n       Ronnie's optimism, like America's, still shines very \n     brightly. May God bless him and, from both of us, God bless \n     America.\n\n  You know, several weeks ago, I was in a discussion about American \nliberty.\n\n[[Page S217]]\n\n  I was talking about the fact that free people behave completely \ndifferently than people who are not free or oppressed. One of the key \ncomponents of a free people is their optimism--optimism, the belief \nthat they can accomplish, the belief that they can build, the belief \nthat they cannot be vanquished. And there is no American in \ncontemporary history who so fueled and energized that key component of \nAmerican liberty as did President Ronald Reagan. He was the epitome of \noptimism.\n  I see we have just be joined by my good friend and colleague and \nneighbor, the Senator from Alabama, and in deference to his time I am \ngoing to withhold these other remarks for a moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have the honor to speak on this \nlegislation sponsored by the distinguished Senator from Georgia. I so \ngreatly admire him. I admire his principle, integrity, ability, and \npassion for this issue. I think it is an important issue, and I am \nproud to be a cosponsor of this resolution. We ought to recognize \npeople who have made great differences in this Nation's history. I \nthink President Reagan is one of those people.\n  I thought I would take a very few minutes to tell a story that \nillustrates how deeply and how important President Reagan's life is to \nthe American people and to the people of the world.\n  In 1993, I went on a church trip to Russia and spent a week there. \nOur group went to a small city of 40,000 people that is located 5 hours \neast of Moscow in an area where very few Americans were allowed in over \nthe years because it was a security area in the Soviet Union. We went \nto the town of Sovetsk. I was able to stay with another American in the \nhome of a Russian businessman who was beginning to develop a business \nin Sovetsk. The first night we arrived they were going to celebrate the \nbaptism of their daughter. A Russian Orthodox priest appeared in his \ngreat robes. The mother, father, and the grandparents had come in from \nthe Ural Mountains, and it was a goodly group of people there. It was a \nmarvelous ceremony as the priest performed that baptism.\n  As we had dinner afterwards the priest told us that since \nperestroika, since the fall of the wall, he had baptized 18,000 people \nin that town of 40,000. He told us that before the wall fell he was not \nallowed to baptize people. He said he was not allowed to wear his \nrobes, and that the Soviet Communist authorities moved him around 6 \nmonths or so at a time so that he could not really get to know his \ncongregation and so he would be unable to build the kind of rapport \nthat is necessary. He discussed how he could now wear his robes, how he \ncould now walk about town, how he could now meet with the mayor, and \nhow he was now respected in the city in public affairs. For this priest \nand his congregation, it was now a great time.\n  At the conclusion of that discussion my host proposed a toast to \nRonald Reagan ``who made us believe in God again.''\n  Mr. President, I don't know if they missed the translation. But the \nheart of that was very, very real.\n  President Ronald Reagan helped shape this world. He helped free \nmillions of people from a totalitarian state. He called the Soviet \nempire an ``evil empire,'' and evil it was.\n  Before we went to Russia, we spent time with a college professor who \nhad spent 6 months there. He said, ``I used to teach that the United \nStates and Russia were just like scorpions in a bottle. There is no \ndifference between us.'' Now, however, he says that after having been \nthere and after having met with young Russian people he has changed his \nmind. In the words of that professor, ``when I would talk in that \nfashion, the Russians looked at me like I was crazy. They said, `What \nare you talking about? You had all kinds of freedom. We had none. There \nwas a great distinction between Russia, the Soviet Union, and the \nUnited States of America and the democracy that you have.''' Today that \nprofessor has come to believe that those young people had it right.\n\n  Ronald Reagan personified that. He personified the collapse of the \ntotalitarian empire. He gave his life to it. He articulated it better \nthan any man that ever lived. His was a Presidency both in terms of \ndomestic policy and foreign policy that ranks among the highest order \nof American Presidents.\n  I think he deserves this recognition. I think it is very fitting that \nit be done on his birthday. I think it is very fitting that we \nrecognize him while we are still blessed with his presence.\n  I want to congratulate the Senator from Georgia for his articulate \nexplanation and promotion of this legislation. I am delighted and \nhonored just to have this moment to share this story with the people in \nthis body and the people in the United States because I think it says \nin a very real way that this man symbolized the American democratic \nfree enterprise victory over the totalitarian atheistic Communist \ngovernment.\n  I appreciate the leadership of Senator Coverdell and thank him for \nyielding me this time.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, it is interesting to hear the good \nSenator from Alabama, and I appreciate the personal experience he had \nconfronting these people that were being made free for the first time.\n  I had the opportunity to do that as well. I will never forget the \nfaces of those people who had never been free or had not been for so \nlong they couldn't remember. If you will bear with me one second, I am \ngoing to yield. One afternoon I was in Soviet Bulgaria. It was on the \neve of this epic realignment of all Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. I \ndecided to break away, and I did and walked about 5 miles back through \nthe neighborhoods. Do you know what struck me? This is before the \nfreedom had hit. I never saw a single adult ever smile. Never, not one, \nnot one person smiled because of the weight of the oppression. \nFortunately, the children were smiling. So you could say, ``There is \nhope here.'' But it had been beaten out of them--the natural nature of \nhuman mind.\n  The man that brought the wall down--the Senator from Alabama said it \nand we will never be able to say it enough--how many people he freed \nthrough that show of force. He didn't do it alone. He would be the \nfirst one to say so. In fact, he would deny it. He would put somebody \nelse far ahead of him in terms of having created that freedom. But when \nyou walk through those streets today and you talk to those people and \nin all of those countries, they know the force of President Ronald \nReagan and they know when he said, ``Gorbachev, you tear this wall \ndown'' that that was not just rhetoric. That wall came down.\n  I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think the Senator from Georgia is so correct. I think \nback on that example and I think that it really sort of symbolizes the \ndifference between a totalitarian government where freedom is denied, \nwhere people are not allowed to worship, and are not allowed to be \nbaptized, and the wonder of the democracy that we are blessed with \nhaving.\n  I think also that it is fitting for us to recognize him in this \nmanner. I have on my desk a plaque which is imprinted with one of \nPresident Reagan's quotes, a quote which I think is most appropriate \nespecially as we discuss naming National Airport after him at this late \npoint in his life. It says, ``There is no limit what a man can do or \nwhere he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.''\n  I think it is time to give Ronald Reagan credit. This is a fitting \ntribute to him. I salute the Senator from Georgia for his efforts, and \nI support his steadfastness in that.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, of course, during the course of the \nafternoon we have been talking about very personal praise for his \nfamily and the First Lady. But for Ronald Reagan there is a lot of \nunlikely praise that needs to be acknowledged here today from \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. While my friends on the other side of \nthe aisle may disagree with him on certain policies, I hope they will \nagree\n\n[[Page S218]]\n\nthat he stood fast on conviction and provided leadership for America at \na very critical time. Ronald Reagan did after all begin his career as a \nDemocrat. He truly was a man of both sides of the aisle. He cast his \nfirst vote for Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose name has been evoked in \nthis debate because when we were talking about the need to have an \nappropriate not designation but memorial for President Roosevelt, we \ndid not enter into any of this kind of bickering. It was done. It \nshould be done. Now citizens from all across the country can be \nreminded of that era of our Nation's history.\n  Here are some words of tribute from some unlikely sources.\n  Former California Governor and Presidential candidate, Jerry Brown, \nsaid, ``He was not just the guy across the table. He had a presence. He \nhad the quality of being able to tell a story. . .'' And, as Senator \nSessions just said, `` . . . and then smile and laugh. There was a sort \nof magic there, and I could see it at work.''\n  Or former majority whip of the House, Representative Coehlo, ``Ronald \nReagan believed a few things and he really stood for them. He was \nPresidential. He did not get down in the gutter.''\n  I want to repeat that. ``He did not get down in the gutter. Indeed, \nhe would let people accuse him of anything. We did. But these things \nnever got a response.''\n  Even Sam Donaldson has good things to say about President Reagan. He \nsaid, ``I don't think we have ever had a President who used the bully \npulpit better than he did. He was its master. Reagan's most outstanding \nleadership quality was that you knew where he stood on a matter. You \ndidn't have to agree with him. He got into some of the most contentious \nissues for our country. I never had to figure out what kind of a speech \nhe would give tomorrow or worry that he would change his mind from the \nviews he expressed today.''\n  That is Sam Donaldson talking about Ronald Reagan.\n  Donaldson, further quoting, ``Reagan is the most dynamic President I \nhave seen.''\n  So, as I said, whether you agreed with him or not, Ronald Reagan \ndefined leadership in our time.\n  Mr. President, I am going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I think \nSenator Hutchinson is here from Arkansas. I will determine whether that \nis so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator already has that right.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, as I listened to the speeches and the \nvarious tributes to Ronald Reagan and the speeches that are in favor of \nthis legislation to name the Washington National Airport after former \nPresident Ronald Reagan, I had not intended to speak today. But I was \nmoved by some of the tributes that I have heard. I was dismayed by \nnoticing the opposition to this legislation--surprised and dismayed. \nAnd I thought there was little I could add to some of the glowing \ntributes that we have heard except my own personal experience because I \nthink in many ways I like many of my generation owe to Ronald Reagan \nthe inspiration and the motivation to go into the whole sphere of the \npolitical arena.\n  In 1964 I was in junior high school living in the northwest corner of \nArkansas. My parents were not particularly political. But I watched the \nnews and followed closely the political events that year and the \nelection campaign between Lyndon Johnson and Barry Goldwater. I \nremember--I think it was about 10 days before the election that year--\nwatching on our black-and-white television in Arkansas a speech by an \nactor by the name of Ronald Reagan. I remember sitting on the floor in \nfront of the black-and-white television mesmerized as I listened to \nwhat later became known to a whole generation of young people as ``The \nSpeech''--``A time for choosing,'' it was called--in which Ronald \nReagan so eloquently laid out for the Nation the choice that faced \nAmerica in that campaign and a philosophic choice that faced Americans \ndown through the ages.\n  And there is a junior high schooler listening to Ronald Reagan make \nthat speech, a speech that historians say was the launching pad, if you \nwill, for his political career, a speech that propelled him to a \nmeteoric rise in politics, from the Governorship of California to the \nPresidency of the United States. I think it also propelled a whole \ngeneration of young people to look at politics as something noble, as \nsomething of a great adventure, as an arena in which truly a difference \ncould be made in the lives of our fellow citizens and the future of our \nNation.\n  And so when young people write me today, and I so frequently get \nasked by elementary students and high school students: Senator, how did \nyou get started in politics and who is your favorite President? I \nanswer it in reverse order. I say, ``My favorite President is Ronald \nReagan, and let me tell you how I got started in politics.'' And then \nwe enclose in that letter a copy of the speech, the 1964 address by \nRonald Reagan that started his political career and that started the \npolitical careers of a host of other individuals as well and made a \ngreat difference in America. I will not take time to read all of the \nspeech, ``A Time for Choosing.'' I ask unanimous consent to have it \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          A Time for Choosing\n\n                           (By Ronald Reagan)\n\n       [Given as a stump speech, at speaking engagements, and on a \n     memorable night in 1964 in support of Barry Goldwater's \n     presidential campaign. This version is from that broadcast.]\n       I am going to talk of controversial things. I make no \n     apology for this.\n       It's time we asked ourselves if we still know the freedoms \n     intended for us by the Founding Fathers. James Madison said, \n     ``We base all our experiments on the capacity of mankind for \n     self government.''\n       This idea that government was beholden to the people, that \n     it had no other source of power is still the newest, most \n     unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. \n     This is the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our \n     capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the \n     American Revolution and confess that a little intellectual \n     elite in a far-distant capital can plan our lives for us \n     better than we can plan them ourselves.\n       You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, \n     but I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. \n     There is only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream--the \n     maximum of individual freedom consistent with order or down \n     to the ant heap of totalitarianism. Regardless of their \n     sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would \n     sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this downward \n     path. Plutarch warned, ``The real destroyer of the liberties \n     of the people is he who spreads among them bounties, \n     donations and benefits.''\n       The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the \n     economy without controlling people. And they knew when a \n     government sets out to do that, it must use force and \n     coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to a time \n     for choosing.\n       Public servants say, always with the best of intentions, \n     ``What greater service we could render if only we had a \n     little more money and a little more power.'' But the truth is \n     that outside of its legitimate function, government does \n     nothing as well or as economically as the private sector.\n       Yet any time you and I question the schemes of the do-\n     gooders, we're denounced as being opposed to their \n     humanitarian goals. It seems impossible to legitimately \n     debate their solutions with the assumption that all of us \n     share the desire to help the less fortunate. They tell us \n     we're always ``against,'' never ``for'' anything.\n       We are for a provision that destitution should not follow \n     unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end we have \n     accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the \n     problem. However, we are against those entrusted with this \n     program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal \n     shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism of the \n     program means that we want to end payments. . . .\n       We are for aiding our allies by sharing our material \n     blessings with nations which share our fundamental beliefs, \n     but we are against doling out money government to government, \n     creating bureaucracy, if not socialism, all over the world.\n       We need true tax reform that will at least make a start \n     toward restoring for our children the American Dream that \n     wealth is denied to no one, that each individual has the\n\n[[Page S219]]\n\n     right to fly as high as his strength and ability will take \n     him. . . . But we can not have such reform while our tax \n     policy is engineered by people who view the tax as a means of \n     achieving changes in our social structure. . . .\n       Have we the courage and the will to face up to the \n     immorality and discrimination of the progressive tax, and \n     demand a return to traditional proportionate taxation? . . . \n     Today in our country the tax collector's share is 37 cents of \n     every dollar earned. Freedom has never been so fragile, so \n     close to slipping from our grasp.\n       Are you willing to spend time studying the issues, making \n     yourself aware, and then conveying that information to family \n     and friends? Will you resist the temptation to get a \n     government handout for your community? Realize that the \n     doctor's fight against socialized medicine is your fight. We \n     can't socialize the doctors without socializing the patients. \n     Recognize that government invasion of public power is \n     eventually an assault upon your own business. If some among \n     you fear taking a stand because you are afraid of reprisals \n     from customers, clients, or even government, recognize that \n     you are just feeding the crocodile hoping he'll eat you last.\n       If all of this seems like a great deal of trouble, think \n     what's at stake. We are faced with the most evil enemy \n     mankind has known in his long climb from the swamp to the \n     stars. There can be no security anywhere in the free world if \n     there is no fiscal and economic stability within the United \n     States. Those who ask us to trade our freedom for the soup \n     kitchen of the welfare state are architects of a policy of \n     accommodation.\n       They say the world has become too complex for simple \n     answers. They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there \n     are simple answers. We must have the courage to do what we \n     know is morally right. Winston Churchill said that ``the \n     destiny of man is not measured by material computation. When \n     great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we are \n     spirits-not animals.'' And he said, ``There is something \n     going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, \n     whether we like it or not, spells duty.''\n       You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve \n     for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or \n     we will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand \n     years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and \n     our children's children say of us we justified our brief \n     moment here. We did all that could be done.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I would like to read just the closing two paragraphs \nof Ronald Reagan's speech in 1964 on behalf of Barry Goldwater, a \nspeech that obviously did not turn the tide in that election but a \nspeech that started his political career, a speech that inspired me to \nbecome involved in the political process. He concluded that speech, the \nspeech in 1964 with these words:\n\n       They say the world has become too complex for simple \n     answers. They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there \n     are simple answers. We must have the courage to do what we \n     know is morally right.\n       You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve \n     for our children this, the last best hope on Earth, or we \n     will sentence them to take the first step into a thousand \n     years of darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and \n     our children's children say of us we justified our brief \n     moment here. We did all that could be done.\n\n  I cannot say it as Ronald Reagan said it, but his words still have \nthe power of great meaning, and what an inspiration it was to a Nation. \nAnd so when he became President of the United States, this great \ncommunicator and great optimist infused in us again the feeling that \nAmerica can be and is a great Nation.\n  With the Reagan tax cuts, the economic recovery that it spawned, with \nhis repair of our neglected defenses, with his courageous and bold \nstand to say the words that everybody criticized him for when he called \ncommunism, ``The Evil Empire,'' as a result of that and his willingness \nto stand at the Berlin wall and say to Mr. Gorbachev, ``Tear this wall \ndown,'' it sewed the seeds for what became the collapse of the old \nSoviet Union and most of communism in the world.\n  And then perhaps no incident I think reflects the greatness of this \nman and his impact upon us and how he buoyed us as a people: \nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents, all Americans how he raised \nour spirits, inspired us and inspired a Nation than when on January 28, \n1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded just after takeoff, \ndisintegrating into a ball of flame before a world television audience. \nThe disaster understandably stunned America. Never before had the \ndangers of space exploration been brought home as graphically and as \nvisibly as they were that day. The intensive prelaunch media attention \nhad caused the world to know these seven crew members as we knew few \nother astronauts. We knew them with an unusual intimacy, and now they \nwere gone. The Nation was staggered.\n  Then Ronald Reagan took to the airwaves. The President of the United \nStates delivered a 5-minute speech, and he concluded his 5-minute \nspeech by quoting the words written by a Royal Air Force pilot shortly \nbefore his death in the battle of Britain, those words that we will \nremember:\n\n       For I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth and touched the \n     face of God.\n\n  President Reagan's short speech of 5 minutes, concluding with those \nwords, unified and uplifted and encouraged a heartbroken America.\n  Tip O'Neill, who was Reagan's political adversary, tough political \nadversary, with whom he had many fierce arguments and disagreements, \nlater that very day described the moment in which Reagan made that \ninspiring speech to America. He said, and I quote Tip O'Neill, ``Reagan \nat his best.'' It was a trying day for all Americans and Ronald Reagan \nspoke to our highest ideals.\n  May I say, Tip O'Neill said it right because Ronald Reagan always \nspoke to our highest ideals. This is a very small tribute but a very \nfitting and appropriate tribute that we name this airport after one of \nour greatest Presidents and one of our greatest living Americans, \nRonald Reagan.\n  I thank Senator Coverdell for his leadership and his willingness to \ntake on this project, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. The Senator from Arkansas was here yesterday and gave \na very inspiring commentary on his legislation to improve American \neducation, but he has matched yesterday. Those were remarkable words, \nand the personal feeling in connection with the former President is \nobvious. I watched the same speech and remember just being stunned by \nit. I didn't really know that much about him, but I remember turning to \nmy mother and saying, ``You ought to have heard that speech.'' Anybody \nwho heard it I think was moved by it. But I really do believe the \nSenator has captured his optimism, and I commend the Senator for it.\n  Mr. President, we have been joined by my good colleague from Nevada, \nwho has other matters to talk about. I am going to yield the floor so \nthat he might proceed with his piece of business.\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning business \nfor a period of time not to exceed 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Let me preface my comments by thanking the senior Senator \nfrom Georgia. I am delighted to have a chance to be down here today to \ntalk on an issue. And his willingness to accommodate me is something I \nappreciate very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S209-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S219-S221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NUCLEAR WASTE POLICY ACT\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, in the Chamber this week and I am sure in \nthe next week a number of my colleagues will be talking about a January \n31, 1998, deadline under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. And as I am sure \nmy colleagues will know, there has been a recent flurry of newspaper \nads and radio commercials indicating that was the deadline under the \nNuclear Waste Policy Act for high-level nuclear waste to be accepted by \nthe Department of Energy. I want to put those comments and those ads in \nsome perspective so that no one should be misled by the assertions of \nthe nuclear utility industry.\n  The genesis of our current policy with respect to disposal of high-\nlevel waste traces its origins to the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. \nIt is true that in that piece of legislation it was contemplated the \nDepartment of Energy would be in a position to accept high-level \nnuclear waste, that a period of characterization and study would \nultimately send three sites to the President of the United States and \nthe President would select one of those sites.\n  I think it is important to mention at the outset that even in 1982 a \nnumber of Department of Energy experts were\n\n[[Page S220]]\n\nuncomfortable, indeed, some were skeptical, that the 1998 deadline \ncould be met, but they were overruled by politicians and the Department \nof Energy and others.\n  My colleagues know from my previous statements in the Chamber that \nthis process, whatever its original intent may have been, was \npoliticized immediately. Within the first few weeks after the \nlegislation was enacted, States such as my own, and at that time the \nState that the distinguished occupant of the Chair represents, the \nState of Washington, the State of Texas, and others, were denied \noversight funds as contemplated in the act and litigation was commenced \nto gather those funds.\n  That was an ominous beginning of what later turned out to be an \nentirely political nonscientific process. The original law contemplated \nthat the entire country would be examined and that, indeed, various \ntypes of geological formations would be considered for high-level \nnuclear waste, and as I have indicated previously that three sites \nwould be chosen and the President of the United States would then make \na final determination.\n  None of that was to be. Shortly after the legislation was enacted, in \nthe following year during the Presidential campaign one region of the \ncountry was assured it would not be considered for high-level nuclear \nwaste. An internal memorandum within the Department of Energy indicated \nthat another region would be excluded because of political opposition, \nand then the ultimate indignity came in 1987 with a piece of \nlegislation that Nevadans will forever regard as the ``screw Nevada'' \nbill which completely altered the thrust of the process and said, look, \nwe will choose one State, one site, and that will be the place that we \nwill concentrate our efforts.\n  That site was at Yucca Mountain. The utilities are now contending \nthat because no site would be available in 1998 to accept all of the \nhigh-level nuclear waste, indeed, a crisis atmosphere exists, that \nthere is a call for action and they have proposed an ill-conceived \npiece of legislation that is S. 104 in our Chamber and H.R. 1270 in the \nother Chamber.\n  Let me emphasize that this is not a proposal favored by the \nscientific community through the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, \na board established by act of Congress; it is not supported by the \nDepartment of Energy. It is the brainchild of the Nuclear Energy \nInstitute, the overarching trade association that purports to advance \nthe interests of nuclear utilities in America.\n\n  There is no science involved in this legislation. The utilities argue \nspeciously that because the nuclear waste will not be available for \nshipment to a repository, indeed, there will be an enormous cost \nincurred by the Federal Government, that damage claims will approximate \nas much as $80 billion. This is totally specious, a fictitious number \nthat is spun out of whole cloth. But the solution that has been \nadvanced is much more disturbing and that is S. 104-H.R. 1270. This is \na piece of legislation that would emasculate most of the environmental \nlaws that have enjoyed bipartisan support for a quarter of a century, \nall in the interest of advancing the nuclear utilities' argument. It \nwould create a temporary nuclear waste dump at the Nevada test site, a \nseparate geographical location from Yucca Mountain which is where the \npermanent storage facility is currently being characterized.\n  Now, make no mistake that if H.R. 1270 and S. 104 were enacted \ntomorrow, under no conceivable scenario could any shipments occur in \nthis year or, indeed, for some years into the future.\n  This interim storage proposal is not only a direct threat to the \nenvironmental legislation in this country. It would establish a health \nand safety standard for us in Nevada with respect to the level of \nradioactive emissions measured in millirems that would be 25 times the \nlevel allowed for safe drinking water. That standard is 4 millirems. By \nstatute this legislation would propose that the acceptable standard for \nNevadans, where this waste would be shipped, would be 25 times that \nlevel or 100 millirems. No conceivable argument in terms of sound \npublic policy or science would justify such a legislative mandate.\n  For those who feel, as I do, that progress is being made in balancing \nthe budget, with the possibility of a budget surplus for the first time \nin nearly three decades, the utilities have crafted a very clever \nbailout provision. Under the terms of the 1982 act, for each kilowatt \nof nuclear power generated, there is a mill tax levied. That mill tax \ngoes into a nuclear waste fund, and out of that fund would be the \nexpenses of maintaining a high-level nuclear waste repository, an \nobligation which would go far beyond the current life expectancy of any \ncurrently operating utilities.\n  Actuarial experts tell us that even under current law that fund is \nunderfunded. That is to say that eventually the taxpayers are going to \nhave to bail that fund out. At no time did the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund \nfinancial formula contemplate that it would also pay for a so-called \ntemporary dump, the one that is contemplated in S. 104 and H.R. 1270, \nso an additional financial burden would be added.\n  The utilities are not content, however, with destroying that part of \nthe financial basis for the legislation. They would impose a cap or a \nlimitation on the amount of money that could be paid into that fund \nthat would approximate the amount of money spent the previous year from \nthe nuclear waste fund for purposes of this act. Remember that \ncurrently that fund, the nuclear waste fund, is underfunded \nactuarially. They would further limit the amount that goes into the \nfund, an amount which is going to be necessary for decades ahead, well \nbeyond the life of any nuclear utility. So, by adding the expense of a \ntemporary waste dump, putting a cap on the amount of the fees that are \npaid into that fund, they guarantee that the American taxpayers will \nhave to come up with tens, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars from \ngeneral taxpayer revenue in the outyears. That is simply financially \nirresponsible. Whatever one thinks of nuclear waste policy, we all \nought to be able to agree that we ought not to build into legislation a \nfinancial time bomb which would begin ticking upon the enactment of \nthis piece of legislation. This is a utility bailout provision and is \nbad policy.\n  The nuclear utilities have litigated this issue. In November 1987 \nthey argue that the Department of Energy must, under the 1982 act, \naccept immediately delivery of the high-level nuclear waste. That was \nrejected by the Court. As I have indicated, the Court in deciding the \ncase indicates that there is an appropriate remedy. I think all of us \nwould fairly recognize that the utilities will incur some additional \nexpense as a result of any additional storage capacity that they need \nto construct on site. So it is conceded by all that the utilities would \nbe entitled to an offset; that is, a reduction in the amount of the \nmill tax levy paid into the nuclear waste trust fund. Indeed, Secretary \nPena has initiated discussion along those lines. But the utilities have \nrejected that. They have rejected that because that's not what they \nwant. They don't want fairness or an offset. What they want is a \nbailout, the provisions contained in this legislation, which shift the \nburden from the utilities to the American taxpayers in staggering \namounts in the outyears.\n  As I have indicated, the Department of Energy does not favor this \nlegislation to establish a temporary waste dump at the Nevada test \nsite. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board created by this \nCongress, comprised of scientists--parenthetically, none of them from \nmy home State--reject the necessity for this action. We would, in \neffect, be transporting 77,000 tons of high-level nuclear waste to \nNevada. That doesn't just get there miraculously. It would pass through \n43 States. Fifty million people live within a mile or less of the \nhighway and rail shipment corridors--some of the largest cities in \nAmerica. Accidents do happen. The potential could be catastrophic. We \ncannot be unmindful of the fact that in America today we face the \nthreat of terrorist activity. Such was the tragedy of the World Trade \nCenter in New York City, and we have seen other evidences of terrorist \nactivity in our country. What an inviting target, 77,000 tons of high-\nlevel nuclear waste being transported across the highways and rail \ncorridors of America.\n  Finally, the kind of storage that is contemplated at the Nevada test \nsite in this so-called ``temporary'' facility is\n\n[[Page S221]]\n\nknown as dry cask storage. That storage is currently available and in \nuse in a number of the utilities in America today, on site, approved by \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission with a storage life of 100 years. So, \nif it is safe for Nevada, why would it not be safe to leave it at its \ncurrent location--that technology has been approved--and to leave it \nthere until such time as the ultimate issue is resolved of how to deal \nwith this most dangerous and toxic substance known to mankind?\n  For those who have followed this debate for a number of years, it \nwill come as no surprise that the utilities again have raised this \ncrisis potential or scenario. Two decades ago, before this Senator came \nto the Chamber, the nuclear power industry was seeking, once again, to \ntry to get the Congress to enact legislation to remove the high-level \nwaste from the reactor sites. That program was then known as the AFR \nprogram, away-from-reactor site. If one looks at the arguments in the \n1980s in which it was forecast that there would be a brownout, there \nwould be a shortage of electricity in America, that all kinds of \ncatastrophic things would happen to our economy--that was predicted by \nthe mid-1980s if this legislation that was being proposed in the early \neighties was not enacted. None of that far-fetched scenario came to be \nfact. In fact, no utility has suffered a brownout or a failure because \nof the absence of storage capacity. Many reactors have gone off line \nbecause they are no longer safe and others because they are not \neconomically viable. That continues to be the case as recently as \nearlier this month with the reactor that is intended to be closed \nwithin the State of Illinois.\n  So, there is storage capacity available on site through dry cask \nstorage that avoids the necessity of moving 77,000 metric tons across \nthe highways and rail systems of America, through 43 States, with all \nof the potential for risk and accident that is inherent in that kind of \nvolume. There is no need to take action. That is the view of the \nscientific community. That is the view of the Department of Energy. And \nthat is the view of the President, who has indicated, should this \nlegislation reach his desk, he will veto it because it makes no sense \nin terms of policy.\n  This is all about nuclear politics, not about nuclear energy policy. \nI urge my colleagues to be very careful when they listen to some of the \nadvertisements that are currently airing on the radio and in the \nnewspaper. The reality is that there is no crisis. We have been to this \nplay before; same arguments, same results. Not necessary. Bad policy. \nAnd we should reject S. 104, H.R. 1270.\n  I again express my appreciation to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Georgia for his courtesy and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S219-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S221-S225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nRENAMING WASHINGTON NATIONAL AIRPORT ``RONALD REAGAN NATIONAL AIRPORT''\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wanted to update my colleagues on this \nissue of the cost of the renaming of Washington National Airport. C-\nSPAN viewership is up today because our phones have been ringing quite \na bit, both in my office and Senator Coverdell's office and others. \nThis is a fax that I received just an hour or so ago. It says:\n\n       Dear Senator, I'm watching today's coverage of the Senate \n     on C-SPAN. I note an objection to renaming Washington \n     National Airport the Ronald Reagan National Airport was the \n     $60,000 cost of new signs. In the way that I honor President \n     Reagan and you, I humbly offer the $60,000 cost of these \n     signs.\n\n  I will repeat that, Mr. President.\n\n       I honor President Reagan. . . . I humbly offer the $60,000 \n     cost of these signs. Having lived in Alexandria for 5 years, \n     I know that the Washington airport has always been considered \n     the Washington, DC, National Airport, and any argument \n     otherwise is simply partisan and specious. I support you and \n     Senator Coverdell in your effort to honor President Reagan on \n     his birthday, which sadly could be his last.\n\n  Mr. President, I am not, obviously, going to give the name of the \nindividual because of privacy considerations. But we are receiving call \nafter call.\n\n  Let's not, as we go through these arguments one by one concerning the \nairport, let's be sure that the cost of renaming the signs--I find it \ninteresting. They just went through a $1-point-some billion remodeling \nwithout a single additional flight going in or out of the airport, yet \nthe question is raised about a $60,000 renaming.\n  Second, I want to point out again, it in no way affects the founder \nof our country, the father of our country, George Washington. I know \nSenator Coverdell and I--Senator Coverdell obviously speaks for \nhimself, but I know of no objection if it was Ronald Reagan Washington \nNational Airport. I'm sure we could work out that difficulty.\n  I yield to the Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. In the original legislation it's the Ronald Reagan \nWashington National Airport. The House removed the ``Washington''--\nRonald Reagan National Airport. My amendment was simply in conjunction \nwith that. Yes, just to make it absolutely clear, the original concept \nof the sponsor was that it was the Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport. If that needed any further clarification, I wanted to add it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me just finally say I am sorry this controversy has \nerupted. I hope we can work it out. I hope we can work it out within \nthe next 24 hours amongst all of our colleagues in the Senate. I would \nlike to move forward with it. As I said earlier, I regret we are \nstarting out this year, the first real day of our session, in this kind \nof a difference of view.\n  Let me just make one additional point. I cannot speak for the Members \non this side of the aisle, but I understand the reverence that many \nAmericans--not just Democrats but also Republicans--have for Robert \nKennedy and Jack Kennedy and the entire Kennedy family. If there is \nsome proposal to name the Justice Department building after Robert \nKennedy, I would strongly support such an effort. And I would support \nsuch a thing in any way. Obviously, he was a former Attorney General of \nthe United States.\n  But let's not set up these straw men to kind of, certainly not poison \nthe atmosphere here, but it's not a good way for us to begin. I know \neveryone knows how those of us who knew Ronald Reagan, and the vast \nmajority of Americans, feel about him. So I hope we can get this thing \nresolved. Again, I thank Senator Coverdell, who served under President \nReagan and knew him as well as anyone and whose idea this was for this \nvery appropriate action. I just hope Senator Coverdell will be able to \nmake a phone call out to California very soon, at the time of President \nReagan's birthday, and inform both President Reagan and Mrs. Reagan \nthat we are honoring him in this very small way. There really is no way \nwe can ever fully honor him for what he has done for the Nation and the \nworld.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for \nreturning to the floor, for reading this very emotional letter. You \nknow, in a sense the remarks that we have heard here this afternoon all \nhave this common thread of admiration running through them, such as is \nexpressed in this letter, almost as if there is--just during that \nperiod of time there was a connection between this man and his call for \noptimism, his belief in the country. And it evokes these kinds of \nemotions that were just expressed to us by Senator McCain.\n  I appreciate the Senator's, in a sense, admonition that if there is \nsome common ground here, that would be useful to pursue. At this point, \nin my view, a statement like this about a figure such as President \nReagan stands on its own. That takes nothing away from anyone else or \nother heroes and heroines. But, if the other side has a goal or \nsomething of this nature, I am sure they would find many Republicans \nwho would join with them in honoring that person. We have.\n  I mention my good friend and colleague from my own State for whom we \nhave named a very prominent new courthouse. I mentioned the Roosevelt \nMemorial and others. This has not been, as Senator McCain indicated, a \nvery good way to begin this session of the Congress.\n  He has mentioned cost. He has mentioned this article that we are \nrenaming an airport that was named for George Washington. That is not \nthe case. These are roadblocks, and they\n\n[[Page S222]]\n\ncan only be viewed as an attempt to either throttle the legislation or \nto extract something from it, which I think diminishes what we are \ntrying to do here.\n  The suggestion that we are naming a building downtown and that \nsomehow that is all that needs to be done to honor this man--if you go \nto Eastern Europe and ask the people if that is enough, they would tell \nyou in a hurry, no.\n  It is surprising to me that, given all that historical period, fewer \nthan a dozen landmarks in our country are dedicated to Ronald Reagan. \nFewer than a dozen. Because of President Reagan's enduring legacy and \nthe American people's continuing respect and affection for him, it is \nfitting that the national airport bear his name for all those who come \nhere, all those from our own country and all those who visit our \ncountry. This is a fitting acknowledgment of a massive role in American \nhistory.\n  Many airports are named after famous people. From San Diego's \nLindbergh to New York's LaGuardia, Chicago's O'Hare, Washington's \nDulles. I might point out that often we refer to it as Washington \nDulles Airport. If you look at the little marker for arrivals and \ndestinations, it doesn't just say ``D,'' it alludes to the city, Dulles \nWashington. It is not because of George Washington, but because of the \nCapital City.\n  The airport is named after former Secretary of State Dulles.\n  Orange County's John Wayne; and currently there is an effort underway \nto rename the Los Angeles airport after actor and World War II aviator \nJimmy Stewart. President John F. Kennedy was honored by having the \nNation's largest international airport named after him in 1964. \nSponsors contend that no American statesman of this century deserve \nthis honor more than former President Reagan, our Nation's 40th \nPresident. The Reagan era, fondly remembered by tens of millions of \nAmericans, marked the turning point in America's declining fortunes \nafter our defeat in Vietnam and the oil crisis of the seventies.\n  Buoyed by the contagious optimism of what they call ``the Great \nCommunicator''--I never really bought into that term. I accept it, but \nI always thought some of the people who communicated it were taken \naback by his ability to overpower them through his communications, and \nthey would write it off that he is just a great communicator. As \nhistory bore out, he was a great leader who had the skill of \ncommunicating--Americans were reawakened to their image of themselves \nand to a great people with a great future. The far-reaching Reagan tax \ncuts ignited what remains the longest post-World War II economic \nrecovery, a sharp reversal from stagflation of the high tax, high \ninflation seventies. How quickly we forget the millions and millions \nand millions of people who secured economic independence because of the \neconomic boom that he unleashed by the argument that if we lower the \ntax burden on the American people, they will respond with \nentrepreneurship and hard work, and it will make America strong again. \nAnd that is exactly what they did.\n  His restoration of America's neglected defenses--of course, the \nPersian Gulf war was led by President George Bush, but I am sure that \nformer President Bush, my good friend, would acknowledge that he had \nthe tools to use that were prepared for by his predecessor for whom he \nserved as Vice President, President Ronald Reagan, the buildup that \noccurred that allowed us to so successfully vanquish Saddam Hussein.\n  His restoration of America's neglected defenses, combined with his \nforceful and eloquent advocacy of American values against the failed \nideology of communism, epitomized by his demand in Berlin, ``Mr. \nGorbachev, tear down this wall,'' set the stage for the collapse of the \nevil empire.\n  How many of us remember the ridicule when he came up with SDI and how \nfearful it made the Soviet Union, probably one of the single greatest \nstrokes to bring down what he characterized as the evil empire?\n  According to Russian sources, the technological challenge of the \nStrategic Defense Initiative, as I just referred to, SDI, envisioned by \nPresident Reagan to defend the American people from nuclear attack \nforced the Soviet regime to adopt policies, like glasnost and \nperestroika, in a vain attempt to keep up, and instead unleashed the \nsocial forces that brought down the system built by Lenin and Stalin.\n\n  In short, President Reagan's commitment to restoring the fundamental \nideals of the Founding Fathers and the traditional beliefs of the \nAmerican people to the helm of American national policy at home and \nabroad marks him as one of America's greatest leaders and a central \nfigure of the 20th century.\n  Mr. President, throughout the day, as this debate has progressed, \nbeginning with Majority Leader Lott, who quoted former Prime Minister \nMargaret Thatcher and her genuine deep-felt respect for President \nReagan, I want to read--there was recently a book published where they \nhad world figures comment on President Reagan's Presidency. It would, \nof course, been incomplete without a statement from Margaret Thatcher. \nShe says:\n\n       I . . . met Governor Reagan shortly after my becoming \n     Conservative leader in 1975.\n\n  This is long before she was Prime Minister and long before Governor \nReagan had been elected President, 5 years.\n\n       Even before then, I knew something about him because \n     Denis--\n\n  Her husband--\n\n     had returned home one evening in the late 1960s full of \n     praise for a remarkable speech Ronald Reagan had just \n     delivered to the Institute of Directors. I read the text \n     myself and quickly saw what Denis meant. When we met in \n     person, I was immediately won over by his charm, sense of \n     humour--\n\n  We have heard references all day long to that disarming sense of \nhumor and the ability to communicate by that disarming smile.\n\n       . . . I was immediately won over by his charm, sense of \n     humour and directness.\n\n  Firmness.\n\n       In the succeeding years I read his speeches, advocating tax \n     cuts as the root to wealth creation and stronger defenses as \n     an alternative to detente.\n\n  You see, SDI, which we have just heard from Russian authorities broke \ntheir back, was not detente. That is not saying we both can obliterate \neach other. We are saying we are going to protect ourselves from you \nand we consider yours to be an evil force and we won't accept it. Look \nhow different the world is.\n  Remember when they met in a summit and the Russians were endeavoring \nto do SDI in, and it had been built up. He was under enormous pressure \nto come to an agreement. But when he realized he could not have the \nagreement, President Reagan, without undoing this new tool to defend \nthe country, said, ``I'm leaving.'' Because despite the embarrassment \nthat might have been to have left without anything productive, the \nprinciple outweighed his own fortunes, and he was ready to get on a \nplane and fly home, having failed but having kept his commitment. That \nis what she is alluding to here.\n\n       In the succeeding years I read his speeches, advocating tax \n     cuts as the root of wealth . . . I also read many of his . . \n     . [radio] broadcasts. . .which his Press Secretary sent over \n     regularly for me. I agreed with them all. In November 1978 we \n     met again in my room in the House of Commons.\n       In the early years Ronald Reagan had been dismissed by much \n     of the American political elite--\n\n  Which, I might add, is probably the reason I read a moment ago that \nthere are fewer than a dozen landmarks to this great American figure--\nfewer than a dozen. I think we are still dealing with America's \npolitical elite.\n\n       . . . though [Ronald Reagan was] not [dismissed] by the \n     American electorate, [the political elite saw him] as a \n     right-wing maverick who could not be taken seriously. Now he \n     was seen by many thoughtful Republicans as their best ticket \n     back to the White House. Whatever Ronald Reagan had gained in \n     experience, he had not done so at the expense of his \n     beliefs--\n\n  Taking you back to the meeting he had with the Russians over SDI. His \nbeliefs were more important to him than his political fortunes, \nreturning without an agreement. Of course, at the end, as you know, he \ngot the agreement.\n\n       I found [his beliefs] stronger than ever. When he left my \n     study, I reflected on how different things might look if such \n     a man [Ronald Reagan] were President of the United States. \n     But, in November 1978, such a prospect seemed a long way off.\n       The so-called Reagan Doctrine, which Ronald Reagan \n     developed in a speech to both\n\n[[Page S223]]\n\n     Houses of Parliament in 1982, demonstrated just how potent a \n     weapon in international politics human rights could be. His \n     view was that we should fight the battle of ideas for freedom \n     against communism throughout the world, and refuse to accept \n     the permanent exclusion of the captive nations from the \n     benefits of freedom.\n\n  Ronald Reagan understood that America's glory was founded in freedom. \nAnd he wanted all the world to be able to enjoy these same benefits.\n\n       This unashamedly philosophical approach and the armed \n     strength supporting it transformed the political world. \n     President Reagan undermined the Soviet Union at home by \n     giving hope to its citizens, directly assisted rebellions \n     against illegitimate Communist regimes in Afghanistan and \n     Nicaragua, and facilitated the peaceful transition to \n     democracy in Latin American countries and the Philippines. Of \n     course, previous American Governments had extolled human \n     rights, and President Carter had even declared that they were \n     the ``soul'' of U.S. foreign policy. Where President Reagan \n     went beyond [he went beyond] these, however, was in making \n     the Soviets the principal target of his human rights \n     campaign, and in moving from rhetorical to material support \n     for anti-Communist guerrillas in countries where Communist \n     regimes had not securely established themselves. The result \n     [the result] was a decisive advance for freedom in the world \n     . . .. In this instance, human rights and wider American \n     purposes were in complete harmony.\n\n  And yet here we are at 4:15 in January 1998, in the twilight of his \nyears, and we are in an argument over whether we ought to name the \nNation's Capital airport for him.\n  How nice it would be if all these new people from Nicaragua to \nPoland, from East Germany to Afghanistan could have a presence here \nthis afternoon. And we could ask them, ``Do you think we ought to name \nthis National Airport for this man of freedom?'' I think the resounding \novation would be so loud as to have been heard around the world.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to come to the floor here for a few \nminutes this afternoon to somewhat join in the debate, but also to add \nmy support to Senate bill S. 1297, that is, renaming the Washington \nNational Airport to the Ronald Reagan National Airport.\n  I have been kind of saddened by the debate that I have been hearing \ntoday on S. 1297 and, again, to rename Washington National Airport as \nthe Ronald Reagan National Airport. I simply cannot believe some of the \nthings I have heard on the floor, that somehow this effort would \nrequire a quid pro quo.\n  Mr. President, in diluting this effort, I think it is insulting that \nthis legislation is being demagoged in this way. This should be a \nnoncontroversial bill. It is a very fitting tribute to a very wonderful \nAmerican hero. He was a President not just for Republicans, but he was \na President for all people. And it should be passed.\n  This bill should be passed before President Reagan's birthday, which \noccurs just a week from tomorrow, that is, February the 6th. What a \ngreat tribute it would be. You know, I am very proud that this Senate \nhas taken the time to propose that such a fitting tribute be paid to \nRonald Reagan. Again, I do not think that it should be turned in any \nway into a petty or partisan tirade.\n  I have heard and had a chance to listen to a few of my other \ncolleagues who have been to the floor. And they have delivered some \nreal eloquent statements on what Ronald Reagan has done, what it has \nmeant to them, what they feel that he has done for America.\n  President Reagan inspired or maybe we could say reinspired a whole \ngeneration of Americans, millions of Americans, much in the same way \nthat John F. Kennedy inspired Americans 20 years earlier in 1960. I \nbelieve that President Reagan is a man who wanted to leave a legacy, \nbut not a legacy to himself. President Reagan was a man who wanted to \nleave a legacy to his children and grandchildren and to all Americans \nthat America can be a better place if we only believe in ourselves and \nwhat we can do and strive to do better.\n  I remember listening to him way back in 1976 when he first appeared \non the national scene. And I listened to him--and this was at a time \nwhen I was not actively involved in politics --but the things he was \nsaying in 1976 were things that I brought to my campaign as late as \n1992 and again in 1994. And that was for a better America, a more \nresponsible America, one that was going to deevolutionize Washington, \nDC, and put more of the control and power back into the hands of State \nand local governments, but most importantly back into the hands of \nindividuals.\n\n  He talked then about a tax cut, balancing the budget, which is all \nkind of the legacy that we now have the great opportunity to be talking \nabout here as we begin the second half of the 105th Congress in 1998. I \nthink he filled a void in many of us with those words and that \ninspiration.\n  I am very proud that this Senate is proposing this fitting tribute. \nAgain, we are not renaming an airport that was originally named in \nhonor of another individual. This is Washington National Airport. It is \nnamed after the City of Washington. Renaming the airport does not \nsomehow politicize it. It would not convey some sort of partisan \nadvantage, but it would simply provide, again, a tribute to a great \nAmerican who has been honored by so many on both sides of the aisle.\n  This isn't a time to count how many Republicans and how many \nDemocrats have buildings or public facilities that are named after \nthem. This legislation has been around for some time. It simply is not \nappropriate to make demands at the last minute to hold up this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, the City of Washington has a new airport terminal. It \nis a magnificent structure that speaks volumes about the pride that \nWashingtonians feel for this city. It is a fitting reflection of the \npride that Americans feel as well for their National Capital.\n  So again, I cannot think of a more appropriate time than now to give \nour airport a new name, especially when it is the name of a man who \nrepresents such hope and inspiration. Ronald Reagan embodies America, \nand by giving his name to that of our Capital City airport I think is \nan honor that he has earned and one that he deserves.\n  So I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this legislation. And I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to end this debate, to come to the floor \nand support this legislation and let us pass it.\n  So I compliment Senator Coverdell on his efforts on this. And again, \nI hope we can move this legislation forward and make sure that it is \npassed by the Senate and the House and signed by the President by next \nweek so we can honor Ronald Reagan on his birthday on February the 6th.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COVERDELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Georgia.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici, be added as a cosponsor of \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from \nMinnesota for his very fitting and gracious remarks.\n  I think Senator McCain of Arizona has properly framed a certain \nsadness about this afternoon. This is a surprising way to start this \nnew session of Congress with the other side constructing roadblocks in \nfront of this type of legislation or trying to exact a quid pro quo, \n``Well, you can name this if we name that,'' as we approach, as he \ncalls it, the sunset of his life. He has a birthday next month.\n  While you might not have always agreed with him, it is clear that \nformer President Reagan was a giant in our time, a giant on the world \nstage. If you are going to fight him even at this moment, don't do it \nby minimalist activity, don't do it by some nuance argument over \nwhether or not the name ``Washington'' is for the city or for former \nPresident George Washington. Don't fight an epic world figure by \ndisputing whether or not it will take $60,000 to repaint the signs. \nWhat a\n\n[[Page S224]]\n\nclassic disconnect. Don't do it by saying, ``There is another building \ndowntown that has his name on it, isn't that enough?''\n  I frankly think the former President would feel as Maggie Thatcher \nsuggested, complimented, if you just said we don't want to do it; we \njust don't want to do that--rather than all these minimalist, \nineffective, of absolutely nonequal standing diminutive assertions. It \nis OK to disagree about doing it or not, but don't do it in this way. \nLet's at least have respect.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nsupporting S. 1297, Senator Coverdell's bill to rename Washington \nNational Airport in honor of former President Ronald Reagan. As we seek \nto pay tribute to him, it is important for us to reflect upon President \nReagan's place in history. Few modern leaders have had such an enduring \nimpact on our lives.\n  President Reagan was elected at a critical time in the history of our \nnation and our world. In the early 1980s, the country was struggling \nwith an economy plagued with high inflation and unemployment. In the \nwake of Watergate, the Vietnam War, and the oil crisis, society at \nlarge was told by President Carter we were subject to a ``national \nmalaise,'' not without reason. In addition, our armed forces were \nunderfunded and low in morale. The Cold War still dominated our view of \nthe world.\n  Into this unsettled environment, Ronald Reagan was elected president. \nHis determined leadership, strength of conviction, positive attitude, \nand faith in his fellow Americans helped change the nation and the \nworld profoundly during his two terms. President Reagan's commitment to \nnational security and the men and women of the armed forces gave our \nmilitary renewed respect and self-confidence. The nation then took a \nstrong stand against the Soviet Union and helped peaceably to bring \nabout the end of the Cold War and the demise of communism.\n  President Reagan's view of the role of government still defines the \ndebates we hold in this chamber on a daily basis. He firmly believed \nthat Americans were far better than the government at running their own \nlives. He also was committed to the free enterprise system and the \ndynamic spirit of the entrepreneur. Today there are few legislators or \nother policymakers who cling to the idea that bigger government and \nmore federal spending is good for our economy or the freedom of our \ncitizens.\n  Mr. President, one of the more important and lasting contributions of \nour 40th president was the way in which he was able to restore the \nconfidence and optimism of the United States. President Reagan \ntransformed the so-called ``malaise'' of the late 1970s into a positive \nattitude that helped give the country faith in its institutions and its \nfuture. That is why he justly remains an immensely popular figure in \nour history.\n  The foregoing account of President Reagan's achievements is only the \nbeginning of a long list of accomplishments that highlight his time as \nleader of the free world. One more effort he undertook, however, is \nworthy of note in this debate. As others have mentioned, it was the \nReagan Administration that was able to remove the federal bureaucracy \nfrom direct control over National and Dulles Airports. By releasing \nthese airports to local control, they were able to go to the private \nsector for funding and begin needed improvements. The idea of devolving \nfederal control to the States and localities was at the very core of \nthe president's political philosophy.\n  For these and many other reasons, I urge my colleagues to support \nSenator Coverdell's proposal to rename Washington National Airport as \n``Ronald Reagan National Airport.'' Visitors who fly to our nation's \ncapital will always be reminded of the lasting and important \ncontributions made to our country and the world by President Ronald \nReagan. I thank the leadership for trying to let us address this bill \nin time for President Reagan's 87th birthday on February 6, 1998.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to the \nchorus calling on us to honor a great American and one of our greatest \nPresidents, Ronald Reagan; a man who in his own words ``meant to change \na nation and instead changed the world.''\n  President Reagan indeed changed the world in which we live, and much \nfor the better. It is only right, in my view, that we add to the many \nhonors bestowed upon him since his leaving office the important \nrecognition involved in renaming Washington National Airport, in an \nimportant sense the nation's airport, the Ronald Reagan National \nAirport.\n  It is, of course, a long-standing tradition for us to name important \nbuildings and facilities after those who have rendered extraordinary \nservice to our country. Indeed, the monuments just outside this Chamber \nwere constructed to show our gratitude toward and to honor the memory \nof great men like George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Thomas \nJefferson, Presidents who helped build America, and led her to safety \nin time of peril.\n  These monuments testify to our recognition, as a people, of the \ngreatness of certain leaders; of their contributions and of their \ncharacter. By these standards, Mr. President, Ronald Reagan well \ndeserves the undoubted honor of having his name affixed to our national \nairport.\n  Born of poor parents in America's heartland, Ronald Wilson Reagan \nworked to put himself through school, to forge for himself a career in \nHollywood, the land of American dreams, and finally to rise to the \nhighest office in the land. By the time he left office in 1989, \nPresident Reagan had shown his dedication to our nation, her people, \nher principles and her dreams. He restored our economic health, revived \nthe American spirit, and won the Cold War.\n  Now in his twilight years, Ronald Reagan can look back on a life of \ngreat success, made all the more worthy because it was imbued with what \nthe eminent statesman Edmund Burke called the moral imagination. Few \ncalled him an intellectual. But he was blessed with an instinctive \nsense of right and wrong and the prudence to apply this instinct for \nhimself and the nation he led.\n  Mr. President, many people find it difficult to fully appreciate the \ndebt we owe Ronald Reagan. But why is this difficult? Because he was so \nsuccessful at facing down the crises of his time.\n  Today we find interest rates of 21 percent almost unimaginable. But \nthat is what we had when Ronald Reagan took office. We think of double \ndigit inflation as something only developing nations must face. But \nRonald Reagan faced it when he became President. Communism seems a \nnightmare from the past, best forgotten. But we should not forget that, \nwhen Ronald Reagan came to office, it enslaved more than half the \npeople of the world.\n  America was in peril in 1981. Buffeted by the blows of economic \nstagflation, mired in spiritual malaise, on the defensive in a hostile \nworld, our nation was in need of a leader with the moral imagination, \nthe faith in himself, our people and God's will necessary to get us \nback on course. And this Ronald Reagan provided.\n\n  With his economic plan emphasizing tax cuts, sound money, \nderegulation, and free trade, he produced the longest peacetime \nexpansion since World War II. He slew the dragon of inflation, reducing \nit to a steady 3 percent through his second term. He brought interest \nrates down into single digits. He put nearly 30 million Americans into \nnew jobs. He increased our national income by nearly a third.\n  He saved family savings from the ravages of inflation, allowed us \nonce again to make real our dreams of owning our own homes, put us to \nwork and renewed our confidence in our future. In the process he \nrenewed America, and by so doing he literally changed the world.\n  Mr. President, now that the United States enjoys the luxury of being \nthe world's only superpower, it is easy to forget the world we faced \nless than two decades ago. But it was a grim prospect, as illustrated \nby the pundits of the era who encouraged us to get used to an era of \n``limits'' in which we would steadily lose power and influence to an \never-expanding ideology of centralized state power.\n  Ronald Reagan was considered foolish, even dangerous, because he \nrefused to accept the inevitable spread of communism. He called the \nSoviet Union an evil empire and predicted its demise within his \nlifetime. Sheer lunacy, said his critics. And in a sense one can \nunderstand this perspective. America's\n\n[[Page S225]]\n\npolicy elites had been accustomed to a ``pragmatic'' approach in \nforeign affairs; one in which America would seek to accommodate Soviet \ndemands and aspirations in the interests of stability. This approach \ncharacterized the 1970's--an era during which democracy and freedom \nwere on the run worldwide. Marxist governments gained power in \nAfghanistan, Nicaragua, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, South Yemen, Angola, \nMozambique, Ethiopia, and Grenada. For the first time the Soviet \nnuclear arsenal surpassed America's. And even our allies seemed leery \nof identifying themselves too closely with us. Surely, if hard-nosed \nrealism had produced such a disastrous decade, a moral crusade aimed at \nfreeing peoples from the chains of communism would produce armageddon.\n  We now know, Mr. President, that moral conviction, combined with \ndetermination and a prudent use of national power, need not produce \narmageddon. Under President Reagan it produced the single greatest \noutpouring of human freedom ever seen on this planet.\n  We live in a freer, safer, more humane world because Ronald Reagan \nwon the Cold War. His insistence, against strong resistance from a \nDemocratic Congress, that we restore our military power rolled back the \nSoviet legions and bankrupted their economy. His tough bargaining and \nhis willingness to call evil by its name disoriented our Soviet \nadversaries and eventually brought their downfall.\n  By 1991, a broken and dispirited Soviet Union collapsed and \ndisintegrated. President Reagan went to Berlin and called on Mikhail \nGorbachev to ``tear down this wall.'' Mr. Gorbachev deserves credit for \nhis role in bringing down the Soviet empire. Unfortunately, he had \nneither the courage nor the foresight to tear down that wall. But the \npeople of Berlin, thanks to Ronald Reagan, had that courage, and they \ntore down that wall, freeing half a continent, and eventually nearly \nhalf the world.\n  Without firing a shot, Ronald Reagan changed our world for the \nbetter. He freed us from fear of nuclear conflagration. He freed us \nfrom the dreary acceptance of declining standards of living and the \nloss of our way of life through slow attrition. He brought America back \nfrom the brink of despair, into the shining light of a new dawn of \nfreedom and prosperity.\n  Ronald Reagan has earned the eternal gratitude of every American, and \nof every lover of freedom the world over. He has earned his place in \nthe history books as a leader of vision and a man of moral imagination. \nHis name should adorn our national airport.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Faircloth).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams).

Mr. President, my purpose today is to discuss a highly \ndisturbing pattern of abuse and professional misconduct by members of \nthe U.S. Foreign Service and a grievance process that does not \nadequately penalize individuals who engage in such actions.\n  This week, Mr. President, I wrote to our friend, the distinguished \nSecretary of State, Madeleine Albright, regarding the investigation \nthat I have instructed the Foreign Relations Committee staff to \nundertake during the coming months.\n  It will be instructive to examine the serious allegations--all \ndocumented by the State Department's Inspector General--that have come \nto my attention during the Foreign Relation Committee's routine review \nof ambassadorial appointments and the Foreign Service promotion lists \nsubmitted to the Senate by the White House.\n  Now, perhaps the most serious allegation that so far has been brought \nto my attention involves a United States Ambassador--a career Foreign \nService officer, who was forced to resign his ambassadorial post for \nrepeated episodes of sexually harassing female employees under his \nsupervision.\n  This case was documented by the State Department Inspector General in \na 26 page report made available to the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  In response, the Secretary of State promptly and properly fired this \nAmbassador this past September. Yet to this day, the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development--our Government's $6 billion foreign aid \ngiveaway agency--continues to employ this former ambassador and, to \ndate, has recommended no reprimand whatsoever for his actions.\n  The abuses, Mr. President, do not end there. In another instance, a \nForeign Service officer in India provided visas to foreign female \napplicants in return for sex. This reprehensible behavior led to the \nofficer's being suspended without pay for five days. However, the \nsuspension was in effect during the Christmas holiday; therefore his \nco-workers were unaware of his having been suspended.\n  Incredibly, Mr. President, despite this gross misconduct and abuse of \ntaxpayers' trust, the Foreign Service officer has been recommended for \npromotion by the President Clinton of the United States.\n  In another case, four Foreign Service officers in Manila carried out \nan elaborate scheme to divert $94,200 in federal government funds to \nbuild a squash and racquetball court. For this fraud--which forced the \nU.S. embassy into violation of U.S. anti-deficiency laws--these Foreign \nService officers each received mere seven day suspensions. (and at \nleast one of them has been recommended for promotion!)\n  In yet another case, a Foreign Service officer remains in the employ \nof the State Department even after having twice pleaded guilty to, and \nbeing convicted of, theft of State Department funds.\n  The Director General of the Foreign Service recommended that the \nofficer be fired but the Foreign Service Grievance Board (made up of \ncolleagues of the guilty employee) overruled the Director General and \noverturned the officer's termination. The Secretary of State at the \ntime rightly sought to overrule the Grievance Board, but the courts \nruled that the Foreign Service Act of 1980 did not give the Secretary \nauthority to overrule the Grievance Board.\n  So something is amiss, and I for one propose to try to do something \nabout it because the list goes on and on. A senior career USIA Foreign \nService officer in Bangkok, Thailand, falsified an $18,000 grant and \nthereby violated agency guidelines by approving an expenditure of \n$19,000 to repair her personal residence. And what do you suppose the \nofficer's penalty was? A one-day suspension! Moreover, after all of \nthat, this FSO was recommended by the President for promotion to the \nhighest ranking Foreign Service position within USIA, despite strong \nobjections from the USIA Inspector General. And to add further insult \nto American taxpayers, this officer, to this day, has never even been \nrequired to repay the stolen $18,000.\n\n  By this point, I suspect most Americans would be appalled by such \noutrageous misbehavior. So, my final example involves a senior career \nUSIA Foreign Service officer nominated by the President to serve as a \nU.S. ambassador even though the officer received two letters of \nadmonishment for violating USIA regulations.\n  Despite these letters of admonishment--one for nepotism in 1990, and \na second, in 1991, for engaging in extramarital affairs with two \njournalists while carrying out official U.S. government activities \nsupported by the taxpayers--USIA did not suspend this officer for his \nactions.\n  I informed the Secretary of State in my letter that I fear these \ncases may be merely the tip of a very corrupt iceberg. The fact is that \nthe Department of State continues to employ, and the White House \ncontinues to recommend to the Senate for promotion, Foreign Service \nofficers who not only have grossly abused the trust placed in them by \nAmerican taxpayers, but who, when judged by their peers, have received \nonly the lightest of punishment.\n  While these abuses themselves are, to say the least, unacceptable, so \ntoo are the Foreign Service's responses to them. As I understand it, \nallowing\n\n[[Page S226]]\n\nthese individuals--who have committed moral, ethical, and/or \nprofessional abuses, or who have defrauded the Federal Government--to \nremain unscathed in their jobs is being tolerated under the arcane, \nself-protecting Foreign Service employment laws. I propose to try to do \nsomething about that.\n  More startling, perhaps, is that the Foreign Service and the \nPresident continue to recommend some of these individuals for \npromotion!\n  I have recommended to Secretary Albright that we work together to \naddress this issue in legislation. Specifically the Foreign Relations \nCommittee will examine the numerous moral, ethical, and professional \nlapses of Foreign Service officers and the personnel grievance process \nto determine whether the cases I have referenced are symptomatic of \nmore severe and pervasive behavior within the Foreign Service. I \nsuspect that deeper investigation will, in fact, show just how \nwidespread these abuses are.\n  I assure you, Mr. President, that the Foreign Relations Committee \nwill review the punishment given to those Foreign Service officers \nviolating U.S. laws and regulations and how that punishment compares to \nthe way in which similar cases are resolved involving military officers \nin the Department of Defense and other career officers in federal \nagencies. The Committee will study the Grievance Board process and \nrecommend necessary amendments to the laws governing the Foreign \nService and its grievance procedures.\n  Mr. President, the point is this, and I shall conclude on this note.\n  Americans deserve the finest diplomatic representation around the \nworld. Our nation is ill-served when the U.S. career diplomatic corps \ntolerates moral, ethical, and professional abuses within its ranks and \nfails adequately to deal with those who are guilty of such abuses.\n  I say again, Mr. President, that it is my intent to find out the full \nscope of all of this and to try to do something about it.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S225-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a treaty, \ntwo withdrawals, and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nCommittee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S226-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second time by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. BREAUX:\n       S. 1583.

A bill to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to reevaluate the equipment in medical kits carried on, \nand to make a decision regarding requiring automatic external \ndefibrillators to be carried on, aircraft operated by air carriers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n              THE AVIATION MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President--I rise today, along with my colleague \nSenator Dorgan from North Dakota, to introduce the Aviation Medical \nAssistance Act of 1998.\n\n  Thirty years ago the first battery powered portable defibrillator was \napproved for use. A defibrillator is a medical device that electrically \nconverts an abnormal heart rhythm to a normal rhythm. It can and does \nsave lives. The time between the onset of abnormal rhythm and the \napplication of electrical defibrillatory current is critical. If the \ntime of first defibrillation is between five and six minutes after the \nonset of abnormal rhythm, the patient survival rate is greater than 40 \npercent.\n  One clear example is that of Graeme Seiber of Tennessee. As my \ncolleagues may recall on September 14, 1995, Mr. Seiber went into full \ncardiac arrest as he stepped off an elevator in the Dirksen building, \nand collapsed in the corridor near my Senate office.\n  After heroic actions by members of Senator Chafee's staff, I \nperformed CPR on Mr. Seiber and when the Capitol Physician's Emergency \nResponse\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nTeam arrived, I was able to insert a tube directly into Mr. Seiber's \nlungs to aid the flow of oxygen. But, most importantly, the team had a \nportable defibrillator that I used to shock his heart back into a \nnormal rhythm. A team of emergency medical technicians arrived shortly \nthereafter, and Mr. Seiber was taken to George Washington University \nHospital by ambulance.\n  Because of the quick action of those involved and the use of a \nportable defibrillator, Graeme Seiber is alive today as one of a very \nsmall percentage of patients who actually survive sudden cardiac \narrest.\n  But that was in the United States Senate, which has a competent \nmedical team that responds quickly with the proper medical equipment, \nlike a defibrillator. What would have happened to Mr. Seiber if he \nsuffered cardiac arrest in a setting in which medical care and a \ndefibrillator was not readily available.\n  This past May, my friend, colleague and fellow Tennessean, \nRepresentative Jimmy Duncan held a hearing before the House \nSubcommittee on Aviation, which he chairs, on the quality of medical \nkits used by the airlines. On November 6, 1997 Representative Duncan \nintroduced the Aviation Medical Assistance Act to address concerns that \narose from the hearing.\n  The Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1997 directs the Administrator \nof the Federal Aviation Administration to reevaluate regulations \nregarding the medical equipment and flight attendant training for \ncommercial airlines.\n  To address the lack of information regarding fatalities on aircraft, \nthe airlines would be required to make an effort to report monthly to \nthe Administrator of the FAA over the course of a year regarding deaths \non aircrafts.\n  The bill also addresses the critical issue of liability arising from \nindividuals assisting in an in-flight medical emergency. The bill \ndeclares that the individual rendering aid shall not be liable when \nattempting to provide medical assistance, except in the case of gross \nnegligence or willful misconduct.\n  Finally, the bill requires the FAA Administrator to decide whether or \nnot to require automatic external defibrillators on aircraft and in \nairports. To their credit, two major airlines, Delta Airlines and \nAmerican Airlines have already initiated a plan to equip their entire \nfleet with defibrillators and upgrade their medical equipment.\n  It is critical that individuals who suffer cardiac arrest or other \nmedical emergencies receive quick and proper attention to increase \ntheir odds of survival. It is my hope that this legislation will \nimprove emergency medical care for all in-flight emergencies. I would \nlike to thank Congressman Duncan for his leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives on this important issue. I am also grateful to Senator \nDorgan for partnering with me on this potentially lifesaving \nlegislation. I am proud to introduce the companion legislation in the \nSenate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1585. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ndistrict judges in the State of Florida, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE FLORIDA FEDERAL JUDGESHIP ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to introduce \nwith my esteemed colleague and friend, Senator Graham, the Florida \nFederal Judgeship Act of 1998. This legislation will provide the Middle \nand Southern Districts of Florida with the judgeships which have been \nrecommended for them by the Judicial Conference of the United States. \nThe Middle District would receive three new permanent judgeships and \none temporary judgeship (the highest number of new judgeships \nrecommended for any district in the country), while the Southern \nDistrict would receive two new permanent judgeships.\n\n  I would not be introducing this bill if I did not believe there is a \nreal need for increased judicial resources in Florida. The pressures \nupon our court system, particularly in the Middle District, are some of \nthe most acute in the entire country. The Middle District currently \ncontains 55% of Florida's population, projected to grow to two-thirds \nof the population by the year 2005; and yet this District has only one-\nthird of Florida's judges. This District also contains the federal \ncorrectional center at Coleman. When construction of this facility is \ncompleted in FY 1999, it will be the largest prison complex in the \ncountry. The increased prisoner petitions which come with this will \nstretch judicial resources even further.\n  To add to the problem, a portion of the Middle District has been \ndesignated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. While I am pleased \nthat Florida will be receiving additional assistance in the war against \ndrugs, we must also recognize and anticipate the increased demands that \nthis will put upon this district as more criminals are apprehended and \nprosecuted.\n  Both districts contain major tourist attractions in frequently \nvisited cities, including Disney World, Universal Studios, and Busch \nGardens in Tampa and Orlando and the international playground of South \nBeach in Miami. This heavy flow of both tourism and winter residents \nserve to make the needs of these two judicial districts unique in our \nnation.\n  The statistics kept by the Administrative Office of the US Courts \ndemonstrate the compelling need for new judges in these districts. The \nnumbers for the latest twelve month period show that the Middle \nDistrict ranks second in the nation in average cases (adjusted for \ncomplexity) filed per judge, with a crushing 855. The Southern District \naverages 605 per judge. To put this in perspective, the national \naverage for this time period was 519. Clearly, both of these districts \nare in need of relief.\n  I urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider and \npass this legislation expeditiously. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to express my gratitude to Chairman Hatch for his swift \nconsideration of all of the judicial nominees from Florida last year. \nThe Southern and Middle Districts of Florida received three excellent \nnew district judges, Donald Middlebrooks of West Palm Beach, Alan Gold \nof Miami, and Richard Lazzara of Tampa. In addition, Judge Stanley \nMarcus was nominated to the federal appeals court and confirmed by the \nfull Senate in only six weeks. I know I speak for both Senator Graham \nand myself in saying that we are grateful for Chairman Hatch's \nresponsiveness to the needs of these districts.\n  It will not be possible to provide Floridians with a safe environment \nand access to justice unless there is a court system in place which can \nhandle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. \nThis legislation is integral to providing that court system.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, in introducing the \nFlorida Federal Judgeship Act of 1998.\n  This legislation will create six additional U.S. District Court \njudgeships in Florida--two in the Southern District and four--three \npermanent and one temporary--in the fast-growing Middle District of \nFlorida.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake: Florida's federal courts are in the \nmidst of a full-blown crisis. Currently, the Miami-based Southern \nDistrict has sixteen judges. The Middle District, which also includes \nthe Jacksonville, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, Sarasota, and Fort \nMyers metropolitan areas, has eleven.\n  Because this number of judgeships is too small to meet the increasing \ndemand of Florida's rapidly growing population, judges face \noverwhelming caseloads, and the public faces a denial of justice.\n  Prosecutors and law-enforcement personnel are stymied in their \nefforts to mete out swift justice.\n  Civil litigants are forced to endure unreasonable waits to bring \ntheir cases to resolution.\n  Prominent legal and judicial officials all over Florida have told us \nthat this is not a tenable situation.\n  For example, Middle District U.S. Attorney Charles Wilson, whose \noffice is responsible for bringing alleged criminals to trial, has said \nthat the judicial shortage has a ``negative and severe'' effect on the \nwork of federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials.\n  Floridians are not alone in their concern about overcrowded court \ndockets.\n  In September 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United States--the \nprincipal policy-making body of the Federal judiciary, which is chaired \nby the\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and comprised \nof Federal judges from throughout the United States--asked Congress to \ncreate four new judgeships in the Middle District and two in the \nSouthern--precisely what our legislation would authorize.\n  Senator Mack and I are introducing our bill so that Congress can meet \nthe urgent request of the Judicial Conference, and provide the \nadditional judicial resources needed for these two U.S. District Courts \nto meet their increasing caseload.\n  We are certain that many States have justifiable concerns about \novercrowded Federal District Court dockets. I hope that this Congress \nthis year will meet those needs by considering and adopting the \nrecommendations that the Judicial Conference of the United States \nsubmitted to us almost a year and a half ago.\n  But we also believe that the urgent nature of Florida's judicial \ncrisis makes our State a special case.\n  I am going to be saying some things about Florida of which I am not \nproud. They are not positive. But they happen to be the facts as to the \ncircumstances that our Federal courts face.\n  First, Florida has one of the highest caseloads per judge in the \nNation.\n  For the last several years, the Judicial Conference has proposed all \nrecommendations for increased judgeship based on weighted filings--a \nnumber that takes into account both the total number of cases filed per \njudge and the level of case complexity.\n  I would like to note that this is a retrospective look. The Judicial \nConference looks at prior history, in terms of evaluating future needs. \nIn the case of the State of Florida, because of the rapid growth, which \nI will soon detail, and because of the time required--a year and a half \nhas already passed since the Judicial Conference did the calculations \nthat I will soon review--Congress has not yet acted on its \nrecommendation to authorize these additional positions. It would then \nrequire the process of actually filling those vacancies. So, there will \nbe a gap of many months between the time that the numbers were \ncalculated based on past history, as to what the need was, before \nrelief in the form of an actual human being sitting at a bench to \nrender justice will be in place.\n  But looking back to the 1996 numbers, the Southern District's \nweighted filings stood at 588 per judge.\n  This was 33 percent above the national average of 435 weighted filing \nper judge.\n  In the Middle District, the story was even worse--623 weighted \nfilings per judge, a figure that represented one of the highest in the \nentire nation.\n  As a result, nearly 1,800 criminal defendants have cases pending in \nthe Middle District.\n  The story is even worse on the civil side of the docket, where more \nthan 6,200 cases have yet to receive final disposition.\n  In fact, the situation is so dire that Middle District Chief Judge \nElizabeth Kovachevich has announced plans to shut down the Federal \ncourthouses in Jacksonville and Orlando for 3 months this summer and \nrecruit their judges, and any others from around the Nation who can \nspare the time, to tackle the growing civil case backlog in the Tampa \nBay area.\n  Innovative measures like this may help to alleviate the problem in \nthe short-term.\n  But the Florida caseload is not going to experience a slowdown in \ngrowth anytime soon, and the judicial backlog will get worse unless \nCongress takes preventative action for the long term.\n  Second, this legislation recognizes that Florida's largest Federal \njudicial districts are responsible for a massive area that includes \nnearly 80 percent of Florida's 15 million residents.\n  The Southern and Middle Districts combined jurisdiction stretches \nfrom Key West--the southernmost city in the continental United States--\nnorth to include Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Melbourne, \nFort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, and Jacksonville.\n  Florida adds over 200,000 new permanent residents every year.\n  Between 1980 and 1995, for example, the middle district grew by 52 \npercent, and it is expected to increase even from this elevated new \nlevel by an additional 21 percent in the next decade.\n  However, since 1990, the last time Congress approved more judges for \nFlorida, our United States district courts have not received any \nadditional resources from the Federal Government to cope with this \ngrowth.\n  Third, this proposal will assist the work of law enforcement \nofficials. If we are committed to assuring that criminals face \npunishment that is both just but swift, we must be willing to provide \nresources to all aspects of the judicial system.\n  In both the southern and middle districts, drug prosecutions and \nother serious criminal cases make up a large percentage of the total \ncase files. For example, both the southern and middle districts have \nbeen designated by this Congress as high-intensity drug trafficking \nareas. These antidrug zones generate a substantial number of lengthy \nmultidefendant prosecutions, and the addition of judges will help law \nenforcement officials and prosecutors in their fight against drug \ncrimes.\n  In addition, the Federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials \nthroughout Florida, but especially in the southern and middle \ndistricts, are being forced to spend more time combating the cheats, \nthe fly-by-night operators and the other criminals who are engaged in a \nsystematic campaign to defraud and plunder our Medicare and other \nhealth care programs.\n  Mr. President, as shocking as it is, it has been estimated that \nnearly 20 percent of all Medicare expenditures in the Southern District \nof Florida are lost to fraud. Nearly 30 percent of all Medicare fraud \nnationwide takes place in the State of Florida.\n  In November of 1997, the new southern district U.S. Attorney Tom \nScott pledged to create a comprehensive antifraud task force made up of \nlocal, State and Federal law enforcement officials to fight health care \nfraud. I am optimistic that this new effort will be successful in \nincreasing the number of fraud offenders brought to justice. I am \nhopeful that it will deter others from entering this pernicious \nactivity. But I am very concerned that unless the southern and middle \ndistricts have the adequate number of judges, many of these charlatans \nwill not receive the swift and severe punishment they deserve.\n  It is vital that we act quickly to resolve this crisis. Since 1991, \nfilings have gone up 21 percent in the middle district; 30 percent in \nthe southern district. Congress and the White House must be vigilant in \ntheir shared responsibility for recommending, nominating and confirming \nFederal judicial nominees.\n  Mr. President, I commend Chairman Orrin Hatch, of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and its membership, including our current Presiding Officer, \nfor their recognition of the overcrowding problems facing Florida's \nFederal district courts.\n  Last year, the Senate confirmed three Federal district judges--Donald \nMiddlebrooks of West Palm Beach, Alan Gold of Miami, and Richard \nLazzara of Tampa--to replace three judges who had retired or taken \nsenior status. From late September of 1997, when Judge Lazzara was \nconfirmed, until yesterday when the President nominated William P. \nDimitrouleas of Fort Lauderdale and Judge Steven Mickle of Gainsville \nto fill openings in the Southern and Northern Districts of Florida, we \nhad no judicial nominations pending before the Senate.\n  Senator Hatch's and Members' leadership and understanding and their \ndetermination to address Florida's special needs are very much \nappreciated by the residents of our State.\n  U.S. Federal district courts are the first stop for most citizens \ninvolved in the Federal judicial system. Most Federal cases are \ndisposed of at the district court level. It is essential that these \ncitizens have their claims heard in a timely manner.\n  As the court caseload increases nationally, the Senate must be \nwilling to expand judicial positions where they are needed.\n  Our legislation is simple, sound and will serve the interest of \nAmerica and will serve the interest of our State of Florida.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Mack, with yourself and with \nthe other members of the Judiciary Committee on this matter, Mr. \nPresident. I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this \nmuch-needed legislation. For thousands of crime victims,\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nfor thousands of civil litigants in Florida's southern and middle \njudicial districts, justice delayed is rapidly becoming justice denied.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to join my colleague, \nSenator Mack, in introducing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters which I have received--one \nfrom the middle district chief judge, Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich, and \none from the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney for the \nMiddle District of Florida, Mr. Charles Wilson--be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                   Middle District of Florida,\n\n                                     Tampa, FL, December 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Mack: Initially, I wish to \n     sincerely thank both of you for your respective \n     participations in several of the events scheduled in Tampa on \n     December 12, 1997. Each of you attended two of the four \n     activities, and it certainly was greatly appreciated, and \n     noted, by the other participants and attendees of those \n     respective celebrations. Your presence was a significant \n     contribution toward the success of that day.\n       Further, your joint letter that was published in the Tampa \n     Tribune last week on December 12 produced great positive \n     reaction on this West Coast of Florida! The Accelerated Trial \n     Calendar is the ``last hurrah'' for Tampa/Fort Myers by the \n     eleven judges of the Middle District of Florida before senior \n     status claims two of our eleven by the year 2000. If we are \n     successful, we must be prepared to utilize the same tactic in \n     the future in Jacksonville and Orlando.\n       Consistent with the foregoing, and our efforts to help \n     ourselves, we enclose a conservative statistical compilation \n     prepared by our Clerk's office in MD/FL, which graphically \n     demonstrates what would occur without the ATC, and, what will \n     happen when we go from eleven to nine active United States \n     District Judges. I remind you that our previous Tampa/Fort \n     Myers chart shows that as of October 31, 1997, our real \n     projections for July 1998, without the ATC, would have been \n     4,400 civil cases and 1,000 criminal cases pending, totaling \n     5,400 cases for the Tampa/Fort Myers judges!\n       These next five years will see a congressional election, \n     with consequences in 1999, and, a presidential and \n     congressional election, with consequences in 2001. If this \n     district must wait for national political machinations, we \n     will collapse! Just the plans for H.I.D.T.A. in Tampa and \n     Orlando, during the next three years, and the funding for \n     same, will generate substantial multi-defendant, multi-month \n     prosecutions of persons ``targeted for federal sentencing \n     guideline implications;'' these are not in any of our present \n     calculations!\n       I would hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will \n     provide us with a hearing to answer any questions regarding \n     your proposed legislation to provide us with new judgeships \n     as soon as reasonably possible, perhaps in February 1998.\n       With warmest personal regards, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                         Elizabeth A. Kovachevich,\n     Chief Judge, Middle District of Florida.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                          Tampa, FL, May 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Mack: You have requested comment \n     from the United States Attorney regarding the impact of the \n     shortage of resident District Court Judges on the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida. I write \n     to report that the impact is negative and severe.\n       For our Criminal Division, the most direct effect of the \n     judicial shortage is the assignment of cases to visiting \n     judges for trial. Although visiting judges provide a great \n     service to the Middle District, the use of them for a \n     substantial number of criminal trials poses several problems. \n     First, the very fact that a case is transferred to a visiting \n     judge's docket often causes unnecessary delay. Secondly, I am \n     advised by Assistant United States Attorneys that visiting \n     judges are, understandably, not as well-versed in Eleventh \n     Circuit case law, requiring the expenditure of additional \n     time by both prosecution and defense attorneys in addressing \n     significant legal issues during the course of a case. \n     Finally, the Middle District of Florida is one of the leaders \n     in the country in the filing of multiple-defendant and \n     complex white collar crime litigation characterized by longer \n     trials. For example, last year, our office prosecuted 16 \n     members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Gang for conspiracy, \n     racketeering and other offenses. The trial lasted for \n     eighteen weeks. During that period of time, the cases \n     assigned to the presiding judge accumulated without the \n     judicial attention that they would have ordinarily received. \n     Given our present prosecution priorities (i.e., drug \n     trafficking, violent  crime, health care fraud and \n     telemarketing fraud), we expect that the number of \n     multiple-defendant and sophisticated white collar criminal \n     cases will continue to increase in the future. In fact, \n     many such cases are awaiting trial at the present time.\n       Thus far in Fiscal Year 1997, 32 per cent of criminal jury \n     trials (8/25) in the Tampa Division of the Middle District of \n     Florida were conducted by visiting judges. Another 20% of \n     these trials (5/25) were conducted by a judge on senior \n     status. In our Ft. Myers Division, where we presently have \n     seven criminal AUSAs but no resident district Court Judge, \n     fully 91% (10/11) of the criminal trials were conducted by a \n     visiting judge.\n       Our Ft. Myers Division is most severely impacted by the \n     judicial shortage. Because of the absence of a resident \n     judge, Ft. Myers cases are assigned to Tampa judges. As a \n     result, some cases that should be tried in Ft. Myers are \n     moved to Tampa to accommodate the judges' busy schedules. \n     This includes many cases that are important to the citizens \n     in and around Ft. Myers. In fact, the bigger the case (and \n     thus the more local attention warranted by it) the more \n     likely it is to be transferred to Tampa for no other reason \n     than the Court's schedule. Transfers are also expensive. Even \n     for relatively insignificant hearings in a case, if there is \n     a disputed issue, all attorneys, parties and witnesses must \n     take an entire day to drive to Tampa and back. If a Ft. Myers \n     case is tried by a Tampa Judge in Tampa, my office must incur \n     the travel and accommodation expense of the Ft. Myers AUSA \n     originally assigned to the case.\n       Our Civil Division is also impacted quite directly by the \n     shortage of Article III judges in our District. First, in \n     light of their heavy caseload, District Court judges \n     typically do not have the time to grant oral argument in \n     connection with sophisticated motions to dismiss or motions \n     for summary judgment in civil cases. The result is that the \n     judges take several months to decide motions that might \n     otherwise be disposed of quite promptly if oral argument were \n     heard. In those cases where the motions are meritorious, the \n     delay results in unnecessary expenditures on expert witnesses \n     and other pretrial matters, all to the great detriment of the \n     parties even if the correct result is ultimately reached. \n     Worse yet, meritorious motions are sometimes denied only to \n     have the court adopt the movant's legal position after trial \n     (the first time the judge has had a real chance to ponder the \n     case), suggesting that trial was in fact unnecessary. We \n     believe that these problems would be avoided by oral argument \n     in many instances, but we recognize that our overburdened \n     judiciary simply does not have the luxury to grant oral \n     argument very often.\n       Second, the lack of a judge in Fort Myers has a serious \n     negative impact on civil cases there. By way of illustration, \n     we are presently prosecuting a complex ``fair housing'' case \n     in the Fort Myers Division. At one point the District Court \n     judge transferred the case to Tampa, notwithstanding that \n     numerous victims reside in south or southwest Florida and \n     would have been substantially inconvenienced by a Tampa \n     trial. On our motion, the case was transferred back to Fort \n     Myers, but it cannot be tried for many months. If a judge \n     were resident there, this case would probably have been tried \n     already.\n       FInally, civil cases which for some reason are not reached \n     on the calendar of one of the visiting judges usually roll to \n     the next month in which a nonresident judge will be visiting, \n     as opposed to the next calendar month. This causes \n     significant unwarranted delay. For example, in a large \n     pending discrimination case, an opposing counsel who appears \n     particularly reluctant to go to trial was able to obtain a \n     continuance, thereby delaying the case not for one month, but \n     for approximately five. This phenomenon would also be \n     eliminated by additional judgeships.\n       I hope the information supplied herein is helpful. If I can \n     be of further assistance, please let me know.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Charles R. Wilson,\n                                                    U.S. Attorney.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 1586. A bill to authorize collection of certain State and local \ntaxes with respect to the sale, delivery, and use of tangible personal \nproperty; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE CONSUMER AND MAIN STREET PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nresolve a serious problem facing consumers and Main Street businesses \nin America. This problem allows consumers to be misled regarding their \ntax liabilities and puts Main Street businesses at a competitive \ndisadvantage vis-a-vis out-of-State companies. The problem of which I \nspeak is the loophole that allows companies to ship goods across State \nlines without collecting the taxes due on those goods.\n  My bill, The Consumer and Main Street Protection Act of 1998, will \ngive States the option if they choose, of removing this unfair \nadvantage enjoyed by out-of-State companies. The legal effect will be \nto authorize a State or\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nlocal jurisdiction to require out-of-State companies to collect use \ntaxes on sales of personal property delivered into that State or local \njurisdiction, if that State taxes its own citizens on retail sales.\n  This bill does not create a new tax. Indeed, it doesn't create a tax \nat all. It merely deals with how existing taxes are collected. \nSpecifically, it would allow States, if they choose, to shift the \nburden of collecting and remitting use taxes from the consumer to the \ncompany.\n  At this point, I should clarify the meaning of the term ``use tax.'' \nA use tax is a tax on goods purchased in one jurisdiction for use in \nanother jurisdiction. For example, goods purchased in Tennessee for use \nin Arkansas are subject to an Arkansas use tax. Use taxes are used to \nkeep people from avoiding sales taxes. If a State doesn't have a use \ntax, its citizens can avoid paying sales taxes by making purchases in \nanother State. By imposing a use tax equal to its sales tax, States can \nremove the incentive to engage in tax circumvention.\n  Therefore, in the 45 States which presently have sales and use taxes, \nconsumers are legally obligated to pay those taxes, whether the \npurchases are made at a local department store, via mail order, or over \nthe internet. Unfortunately, catalog companies typically do not make \ntheir customers aware of this obligation--in fact, some mislead \ncustomers into believing that out-of-State purchases are ``tax free.'' \nThis, of course, is patently false. The company may be exempt from \ncollecting use taxes, but the customer is still liable for paying those \ntaxes directly to the State revenue department on every out-of-State \npurchase.\n  This situation causes three serious problems. First, consumers are \noften shocked to discover that their ``tax-free'' purchase is not \nreally tax free. State revenue departments inform tens of thousands of \nconsumers every year of this sad fact. The consumer finds he is liable \nfor back taxes, interest and penalties.\n  Second, Main Street retailers are placed in an unfair position vis-a-\nvis mail order houses. This occurs because mail order products if no \ntax is collected, are cheaper than if bought in Main Street department \nstores. Not only do most mail order houses not collect use taxes, they \ndon't tell their customers that they are legally liable to pay the tax.\n  Third, State and local governments lose revenues because billions of \ndollars of the taxes are never collected. According to the Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations, State and local governments \nlose over $3.3 billion a year for this reason. This occurs, even as \nmail order companies impose significant costs on State and local \ngovernments by sending an avalanche of catalogs and product packaging \nto municipal landfills. Every year over 3 million tons of third class \nmail, most of which is catalogs, goes to landfills in this country. \nThis is not surprising considering the billions of catalogs which \nconsumers receive in the mail every year. One company alone, Fingerhut, \nInc., mails out nearly 500 million catalogs annually. With mail order \nsales growing by approximately 6 percent per year, this burden on State \nand local government will increase significantly in coming years.\n\n\n                    THE BELLAS HESS AND QUILL CASES\n\n  A short discussion of case law is in order to explain why this matter \nrequires Congressional intervention. The Supreme Court has twice \nconsidered the question of whether a State may impose tax collections \nduties on an out-of-State mail order company. In 1967, the Court ruled \nin National Bellas Hess v. Department of Revenue that such a State \naction violated both the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause of \nthe United States Constitution. Bellas Hess therefore made it \nimpossible for Congress to craft a legislative solution to the problem: \nalthough the Commerce Clause is the exclusive domain of Congress, the \nDue Process Clause is not subject to Congressional discretion. As long \nas the due process holding from Bellas Hess remained good law, \nCongress' hands were tied.\n\n  In 1992, however, the Supreme Court overruled the due process portion \nof Bellas Hess. In Quill Corporation versus North Dakota, the Court \nrevisited the issue of mail order tax collection and, applying a more \nmodern due process analysis, concluded that mail order activities now \nconstitute a sufficient connection to the State to justify the tax \ncollection requirement. In other words, a State's imposition of tax \ncollection requirements on an out-of-State mail order company no longer \noffends due process.\n  The Quill case therefore clears the way for Congress to act on this \nissue.\n  Although Quill did not overrule the Commerce Clause portion of Bellas \nHess, that holding does not preclude Congressional action. As I \nmentioned earlier, because the Commerce Clause grants Congress \nexclusive authority over interstate commerce, Congress may, if it \nchooses, grant the States the authority to require out-of-State tax \ncollection. Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged in Quill \nthat ``Congress is now free to decide whether, when, and to what extent \nthe States may burden interstate mail-order concerns with a duty to \ncollect use taxes.''\n\n\n             Protections Against Undue Burdens on Business\n\n  In writing this bill, I have taken great care to insure that it does \nnot place an undue burden on business--particularly small business. I \nhave included four provisions designed to protect against an \noverburdensome effect: (1) De minimus provision--The Act expressly \nexempts any company whose total U.S. revenue is less than $3 million. \nThe exemption will not apply, however, in any State where the company's \nrevenue exceeds $100,000; (2) One-rate-per-State provision--In \nsituations where an out-of-State company is subject to multiple local \ntax rates in a single State, the company will have the option of paying \neach applicable local rate or paying one standard rate, called an ``in-\nlieu fee;'' (3) Filing frequency limitation--States may not require \nout-of-State companies to file tax returns more than once per quarter; \n(4) Mandatory information service--States must maintain a toll-free \ntelephone service to provide out-of-State companies with necessary tax \ninformation and forms.\n\n\n                       What The Bill Does Not Do\n\n  The intent of this bill is not to injure the mail order industry. \nThere are many fine mail order companies in America which offer many \nuseful products, and I have no quarrel with any of them aside from \ntheir exemption from collecting use taxes. The intent of the bill is \nmerely to insure that consumers are protected and Main Street \nbusinesses are treated equitably in relation to companies located out-\nof-State.\n  Let me repeat, this bill does not create a new tax. It merely allows \nfor the fair and equitable collection of existing taxes. If the \nresidents of a State do not wish to pay a use tax, then they can repeal \nthat use tax. That is their prerogative. But if they choose to have a \nuse tax, the Federal Government should allow them to enforce it. That \nis what this bill does--it authorizes the States to collect taxes \nfairly and evenly from all who conduct business in the State.\n  Finally, this bill is not a preemption of the States' power to tax. \nIn fact, States are not required to take any action as a result of this \nbill. They may completely ignore this legislation and continue their \npresent tax collection methods. This bill merely grants the States a \npower presently denied under the Commerce Clause and imposes the \nlimitations on that power which are necessary to insure that the \nresulting burden on out-of-State companies is not unreasonable.\n\n\n                             Broad Support\n\n  This measure has already gained extensive support. The legislation \nwas crafted with the input of a broad-based coalition of business and \ngovernmental associations.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer and Main Street \n     Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) merchandise purchased from out-of-State firms is \n     subject to State and local sales taxes in the same manner as \n     merchandise purchased from in-State firms,\n       (2) State and local governments generally are unable to \n     compel out-of-State firms to collect and remit such taxes, \n     and consequently, many out-of-State firms choose not to \n     collect State and local taxes on merchandise delivered across \n     State lines,\n       (3) moreover, many out-of-State firms fail to inform their \n     customers that such taxes exist, with some firms even falsely \n     claim that merchandise purchased out-of-State is tax-free, \n     and consequently, many consumers unknowingly incur tax \n     liabilities, including interest and penalty charges,\n       (4) Congress has a duty to protect consumers from explicit \n     or implicit misrepresentations of State and local sales tax \n     obligations,\n       (5) small businesses, which are compelled to collect State \n     and local sales taxes, are subject to unfair competition when \n     out-of-State firms cannot be compelled to collect and remit \n     such taxes on their sales to residents of the State,\n       (6) State and local governments provide a number of \n     resources to out-of-State firms including government services \n     relating to disposal of tons of catalogs, mail delivery, \n     communications, and bank and court systems,\n       (7) the inability of State and local governments to require \n     out-of-State firms to collect and remit sales taxes deprives \n     State and local governments of needed revenue and forces such \n     State and local governments to raise taxes on taxpayers, \n     including consumers and small businesses, in such State,\n       (8) the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North \n     Dakota, 112 S. Ct. 1904 (1992) that the due process clause of \n     the Constitution does not prohibit a State government from \n     imposing personal jurisdiction and tax obligations on out-of-\n     State firms that purposefully solicit sales from residents \n     therein, and that the Congress has the power to authorize \n     State governments to require out-of-State firms to collect \n     State and local sales taxes, and\n       (9) as a matter of federalism, the Federal Government has a \n     duty to assist State and local governments in collecting \n     sales taxes on sales from out-of-State firms.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State is authorized to require a person \n     who is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the State to \n     collect and remit a State sales tax, a local sales tax, or \n     both, with respect to tangible personal property if--\n       (1) the destination of the tangible personal property is in \n     the State,\n       (2) during the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the \n     calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the \n     taxable event occurs, the person has gross receipts from \n     sales of such tangible personal property--\n       (A) in the United States exceeding $3,000,000, or\n       (B) in the State exceeding $100,000, and\n       (3) the State, on behalf of its local jurisdictions, \n     collects and administers all local sales taxes imposed \n     pursuant to this Act.\n       (b) States Must Collect Local Sales Taxes.-- Except as \n     provided in section 4(d), a State in which both State and \n     local sales taxes are imposed may not require State sales \n     taxes to be collected and remitted under subsection (a) \n     unless the State also requires the local sales taxes to be \n     collected and remitted under subsection (a).\n       (c) Aggregation Rules.--All persons that would be treated \n     as a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as one person \n     for purposes of subsection (a).\n       (d) Destination.--For purposes of subsection (a), the \n     destination of tangible personal property is the State or \n     local jurisdiction which is the final location to which the \n     seller ships or delivers the property, or to which the seller \n     causes the property to be shipped or delivered, regardless of \n     the means of shipment or delivery or the location of the \n     buyer.\n\n     SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       (a) Uniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions \n     of a State shall be deemed to be uniform for purposes of this \n     Act and shall be collected under this Act in the same manner \n     as State sales taxes if--\n       (A) such local sales taxes are imposed at the same rate and \n     on identical transactions in all geographic areas in the \n     State, and\n       (B) such local sales taxes imposed on sales by out-of-State \n     persons are collected and administered by the State.\n       (2) Application to border jurisdiction tax rates.--A State \n     shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of \n     paragraph (1)(A) if, with respect to a local jurisdiction \n     which borders on another State, such State or local \n     jurisdiction--\n       (A) either reduces or increases the local sales tax in \n     order to achieve a rate of tax equal to that imposed by the \n     bordering State on identical transactions, or\n       (B) exempts from the tax transactions which are exempt from \n     tax in the bordering State.\n       (b) Nonuniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     nonuniform local sales taxes required to be collected \n     pursuant to this Act shall be collected under one of the \n     options provided under paragraph (2).\n       (2) Election.--For purposes of paragraph (1), any person \n     required under authority of this Act to collect nonuniform \n     local sales taxes shall elect to collect either--\n       (A) all nonuniform local sales taxes applicable to \n     transactions in the State, or\n       (B) a fee (at the rate determined under paragraph (3)) \n     which shall be in lieu of the nonuniform local sales taxes \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n\n     Such election shall require the person to use the method \n     elected for all transactions in the State while the election \n     is in effect.\n       (3) Rate of in-lieu fee.--For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), \n     the rate of the in-lieu fee for any calendar year shall be an \n     amount equal to the product of--\n       (A) the amount determined by dividing total nonuniform \n     local sales tax revenues collected in the State for the most \n     recently completed State fiscal year for which data is \n     available by total State sales tax revenues for the same \n     year, and\n\n       (B) the State sales tax rate.\n     Such amount shall be rounded to the nearest 0.25 percent.\n       (4) Nonuniform local sales taxes.--For purposes of this \n     Act, nonuniform local sales taxes are local sales taxes which \n     do not meet the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) Distribution of Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), a \n     State shall distribute to local jurisdictions a portion of \n     the amounts collected pursuant to this Act determined on the \n     basis of--\n       (A) in the case of uniform local sales taxes, the \n     proportion which each local jurisdiction receives of uniform \n     local sales taxes not collected pursuant to this Act,\n       (B) in the case of in-lieu fees described in subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), the proportion which each local jurisdiction's \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts bears to the total \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts in the State, and\n       (C) in the case of any nonuniform local sales tax collected \n     pursuant to this Act, the geographical location of the \n     transaction on which the tax was imposed.\n\n     The amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall \n     be calculated on the basis of data for the most recently \n     completed State fiscal year for which the data is available.\n       (2) Timing.--Amounts described in paragraph (1) (B) or (C) \n     shall be distributed by a State to its local jurisdictions in \n     accordance with State timetables for distributing local sales \n     taxes, but not less frequently than every calendar quarter. \n     Amounts described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be distributed by \n     a State as provided under State law.\n       (3) Transition rule.--If, upon the effective date of this \n     Act, a State has a State law in effect providing a method for \n     distributing local sales taxes other than the method under \n     this subsection, then this subsection shall not apply to that \n     State until the 91st day following the adjournment sine die \n     of that State's next regular legislative session which \n     convenes after the effective date of this Act (or such \n     earlier date as State law may provide). Local sales taxes \n     collected pursuant to this Act prior to the application of \n     this subsection shall be distributed as provided by State \n     law.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n       (d) Exception Where State Board Collects Taxes.--\n     Notwithstanding section 3(b) and subsections (b) and (c) of \n     this section, if a State had in effect on January 1, 1995, a \n     State law which provides that local sales taxes are collected \n     and remitted by a board of elected States officers, then for \n     any period during which such law continues in effect--\n       (1) the State may require the collection and remittance \n     under this Act of only the State sales taxes and the uniform \n     portion of local sales taxes, and\n       (2) the State may distribute any local sales taxes \n     collected pursuant to this Act in accordance with State law.\n\n     SEC. 5. RETURN AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State may not require any person subject \n     to this Act--\n       (1) to file a return reporting the amount of any tax \n     collected or required to be collected under this Act, or to \n     remit the receipts of such tax, more frequently than once \n     with respect to sales in a calendar quarter, or\n       (2) to file the initial such return, or to make the initial \n     such remittance, before the 90th day after the person's first \n     taxable transaction under this Act.\n       (b) Local Taxes.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     also apply to any person required by a State acting under \n     authority of this Act to collect a local sales tax or in-lieu \n     fee.\n\n     SEC. 6. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Any State which exercises any authority granted under this \n     Act shall allow to all persons subject to this Act all \n     exemptions or other exceptions to State and local sales taxes \n     which are allowed to persons located within the State or \n     local jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 7. APPLICATION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       (a) Persons Required To Collect State or Local Sales Tax.--\n     Any person required by section 3 to collect a State or local \n     sales tax shall be subject to the laws of such State relating \n     to such sales tax to the extent that such laws are consistent \n     with the limitations contained in this Act.\n       (b) Limitations.--Except as provided in subsection (a), \n     nothing in this Act shall be construed to permit a State--\n       (1) to license or regulate any person,\n       (2) to require any person to qualify to transact intrastate \n     business, or\n       (3) to subject any person to State taxes not related to the \n     sales of tangible personnel property.\n       (c) Preemption.--Except as otherwise provided in this Act, \n     this Act shall not be construed to preempt or limit any power \n     exercised or to be exercised by a State or local jurisdiction \n     under the law of such State or local jurisdiction or under \n     any other Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 8. TOLL-FREE INFORMATION SERVICE.\n\n       A State shall not have power under this Act to require any \n     person to collect a State or local sales tax on any sale \n     unless, at the time of such sale, such State has a toll-free \n     telephone service available to provide such person \n     information relating to collection of such State or local \n     sales tax. Such information shall include, at a minimum, all \n     applicable tax rates, return and remittance addresses and \n     deadlines, and penalty and interest information. As part of \n     the service, the State shall also provide all necessary forms \n     and instructions at no cost to any person using the service. \n     The State shall prominently display the toll-free telephone \n     number on all correspondence with any person using the \n     service. This service may be provided jointly with other \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act--\n       (1) the term ``compensating use tax'' means a tax imposed \n     on or incident to the use, storage, consumption, \n     distribution, or other use within a State or local \n     jurisdiction or other area of a State, of tangible personal \n     property;\n       (2) the term ``local sales tax'' means a sales tax imposed \n     in a local jurisdiction or area of a State and includes, but \n     is not limited to--\n       (A) a sales tax or in-lieu fee imposed in a local \n     jurisdiction or area of a State by the State on behalf of \n     such jurisdiction or area, and\n       (B) a sales tax imposed by a local jurisdiction or other \n     State-authorized entity pursuant to the authority of State \n     law, local law, or both;\n       (3) the term ``person'' means an individual, a trust, \n     estate, partnership, society, association, company (including \n     a limited liability company) or corporation, whether or not \n     acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, and any \n     combination of the foregoing;\n       (4) the term ``sales tax'' means a tax, including a \n     compensating use tax, that is--\n       (A) imposed on or incident to the sale, purchase, storage, \n     consumption, distribution, or other use of tangible personal \n     property as may be defined or specified under the laws \n     imposing such tax, and\n       (B) measured by the amount of the sales price, cost, charge \n     or other value of or for such property; and\n       (5) the term ``State'' means any of the several States of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act. In no event shall this Act apply to \n     any sale occurring before such effective date.\n\n\n     OUTLINE OF THE CONSUMER AND MAIN STREET PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n       Effect: Congress would give states the authority to require \n     out-of-state sellers to collect the sales taxes due on goods \n     shipped into the state. Under current law, out-of-state \n     companies are exempt from collecting these taxes, even though \n     consumers must pay them. This places an inappropriate burden \n     on the consumer and places local retailers at a competitive \n     disadvantage.\n       Not a New Tax: The Act does not create a new tax. It merely \n     deals with how existing taxes are collected, shifting the \n     burden of collecting those taxes from the consumer to the \n     company.\n       Small Companies Exempted: A company will be exempt if its \n     nationwide sales are less than $3 million. The exemption will \n     not apply in any state where the company's sales exceed \n     $100,000.\n       One Rate Per State: The Act will not require complicated \n     tax calculations. Rather than dealing with a variety of state \n     and local rates, companies will have the option of collecting \n     a single blended rate for each state into which products are \n     shipped.\n       Filing Frequency: Under the Act, out-of-state companies \n     will only have to file tax returns once per quarter.\n       Toll-Free Information Service: To utilize the Act, states \n     must establish a toll-free information service to provide \n     out-of-state companies with necessary information and forms.\n       Distribution of Local Sales Taxes: State governments must \n     remit to local jurisdictions the appropriate local share of \n     taxes collected from out-of-state companies. To ensure this, \n     the Act requires states to distribute local taxes collected \n     out-of-state in the same proportion as local taxes collected \n     in-state. Distributions must occur at least once every \n     calendar quarter.\n\n           Uncollected Sales Taxes on Mail Order Goods, 1994\n\n                                                               Millions\nAlabama...........................................................$48.6\nArizona............................................................44.4\nArkansas...........................................................19.6\nCalifornia........................................................482.8\nColorado...........................................................47.9\nConnecticut........................................................50.4\nD.C.................................................................9.9\nFlorida...........................................................168.9\nGeorgia............................................................72.9\nHawaii..............................................................9.8\nIdaho...............................................................9.7\nIllinois..........................................................233.1\nIndiana............................................................54.5\nIowa...............................................................28.3\nKansas.............................................................33.5\nKentucky...........................................................41.7\nLouisiana..........................................................61.9\nMaine..............................................................13.3\nMaryland...........................................................60.1\nMassachusetts......................................................69.0\nMichigan..........................................................108.4\nMinnesota..........................................................53.1\nMississippi........................................................28.0\nMissouri...........................................................63.5\nNebraska...........................................................17.4\nNevada.............................................................17.4\nNew Jersey........................................................112.2\nNew Mexico.........................................................16.8\nNew York..........................................................359.4\nNorth Carolina.....................................................71.1\nNorth Dakota........................................................5.8\nOhio..............................................................116.3\nOklahoma...........................................................41.8\nPennsylvania......................................................145.0\nRhode Island.......................................................14.2\nSouth Carolina.....................................................31.3\nSouth Dakota........................................................7.3\nTennessee..........................................................68.8\nTexas.............................................................235.2\nUtah...............................................................16.8\nVermont.............................................................6.0\nVirginia...........................................................59.9\nWashington.........................................................76.2\nWest Virginia......................................................18.6\nWisconsin..........................................................46.6\nWyoming.............................................................4.4\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Total.....................................................3,301.5\n                                                               ==========\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSource: Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1591. A bill entitled the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act \nof 1998''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           THE BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act of 1998, a bill to establish a matching \ngrant program to help State, Tribal and local jurisdictions purchase \narmor vests for the use by law enforcement officers. I also am working \nwith my colleague, Senator Leahy, on an expanded version of body armor \nlegislation.\n  There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our \nstreets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against \nviolent criminals. As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the \nrisks which law enforcement officers face everyday on the front lines \nprotecting our communities.\n  Today, more than ever, violent criminals have bulletproof vests and \ndeadly\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nweapons at their disposal. In fact, figures from the U.S. Department of \nJustice indicate that approximately 150,000 law enforcement officers--\nor 25 percent of the nation's 600,000 state and local officers--do not \nhave access to bulletproof vests.\n  The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most \nimportant pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can \nhave. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives \nof more than 1,500 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In \nfact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers \nwho do not wear bulletproof vests are 14 times more likely to be killed \nby a firearm than those officers who do wear vests. Simply put, \nbulletproof vests save lives.\n  Unfortunately, many police departments do not have the resources to \npurchase vests on their own. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act \nof 1998 would form a partnership with state and local law enforcement \nagencies in order to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof gets one. It would do so by authorizing up to $25 million \nper year for a new grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice. \nThe program would provide 50-50 matching grants to state and local law \nenforcement agencies and Indian tribes to assist in purchasing \nbulletproof vests and body armor. To make sure that no police \ndepartment is left out of the program, the matching requirement could \nbe waived for those jurisdictions that cannot afford it.\n  This bill is a companion to legislation introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Peter J. Visclosky from Indiana. That \nlegislation already has over 200 cosponsors.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, the International Union of Police \nAssociations, the Police Executive Research Forum, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations.\n  While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a \ncareer in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure \nthat officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a \nvest. Body armor is one of the most important pieces of equipment an \nofficer can have and often means the difference between life and death.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United states of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership \n     Grant Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to direct the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration to reevaluate the equipment in medical kits carried on, \nand to make a decision regarding requiring automatic external \ndefibrillators to be carried on, aircraft operated by air carriers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n              THE AVIATION MEDICAL ASSISTANCE ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President--I rise today, along with my colleague \nSenator Dorgan from North Dakota, to introduce the Aviation Medical \nAssistance Act of 1998.\n\n  Thirty years ago the first battery powered portable defibrillator was \napproved for use. A defibrillator is a medical device that electrically \nconverts an abnormal heart rhythm to a normal rhythm. It can and does \nsave lives. The time between the onset of abnormal rhythm and the \napplication of electrical defibrillatory current is critical. If the \ntime of first defibrillation is between five and six minutes after the \nonset of abnormal rhythm, the patient survival rate is greater than 40 \npercent.\n  One clear example is that of Graeme Seiber of Tennessee. As my \ncolleagues may recall on September 14, 1995, Mr. Seiber went into full \ncardiac arrest as he stepped off an elevator in the Dirksen building, \nand collapsed in the corridor near my Senate office.\n  After heroic actions by members of Senator Chafee's staff, I \nperformed CPR on Mr. Seiber and when the Capitol Physician's Emergency \nResponse\n\n[[Page S227]]\n\nTeam arrived, I was able to insert a tube directly into Mr. Seiber's \nlungs to aid the flow of oxygen. But, most importantly, the team had a \nportable defibrillator that I used to shock his heart back into a \nnormal rhythm. A team of emergency medical technicians arrived shortly \nthereafter, and Mr. Seiber was taken to George Washington University \nHospital by ambulance.\n  Because of the quick action of those involved and the use of a \nportable defibrillator, Graeme Seiber is alive today as one of a very \nsmall percentage of patients who actually survive sudden cardiac \narrest.\n  But that was in the United States Senate, which has a competent \nmedical team that responds quickly with the proper medical equipment, \nlike a defibrillator. What would have happened to Mr. Seiber if he \nsuffered cardiac arrest in a setting in which medical care and a \ndefibrillator was not readily available.\n  This past May, my friend, colleague and fellow Tennessean, \nRepresentative Jimmy Duncan held a hearing before the House \nSubcommittee on Aviation, which he chairs, on the quality of medical \nkits used by the airlines. On November 6, 1997 Representative Duncan \nintroduced the Aviation Medical Assistance Act to address concerns that \narose from the hearing.\n  The Aviation Medical Assistance Act of 1997 directs the Administrator \nof the Federal Aviation Administration to reevaluate regulations \nregarding the medical equipment and flight attendant training for \ncommercial airlines.\n  To address the lack of information regarding fatalities on aircraft, \nthe airlines would be required to make an effort to report monthly to \nthe Administrator of the FAA over the course of a year regarding deaths \non aircrafts.\n  The bill also addresses the critical issue of liability arising from \nindividuals assisting in an in-flight medical emergency. The bill \ndeclares that the individual rendering aid shall not be liable when \nattempting to provide medical assistance, except in the case of gross \nnegligence or willful misconduct.\n  Finally, the bill requires the FAA Administrator to decide whether or \nnot to require automatic external defibrillators on aircraft and in \nairports. To their credit, two major airlines, Delta Airlines and \nAmerican Airlines have already initiated a plan to equip their entire \nfleet with defibrillators and upgrade their medical equipment.\n  It is critical that individuals who suffer cardiac arrest or other \nmedical emergencies receive quick and proper attention to increase \ntheir odds of survival. It is my hope that this legislation will \nimprove emergency medical care for all in-flight emergencies. I would \nlike to thank Congressman Duncan for his leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives on this important issue. I am also grateful to Senator \nDorgan for partnering with me on this potentially lifesaving \nlegislation. I am proud to introduce the companion legislation in the \nSenate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 1585. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ndistrict judges in the State of Florida, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n               THE FLORIDA FEDERAL JUDGESHIP ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to introduce \nwith my esteemed colleague and friend, Senator Graham, the Florida \nFederal Judgeship Act of 1998. This legislation will provide the Middle \nand Southern Districts of Florida with the judgeships which have been \nrecommended for them by the Judicial Conference of the United States. \nThe Middle District would receive three new permanent judgeships and \none temporary judgeship (the highest number of new judgeships \nrecommended for any district in the country), while the Southern \nDistrict would receive two new permanent judgeships.\n\n  I would not be introducing this bill if I did not believe there is a \nreal need for increased judicial resources in Florida. The pressures \nupon our court system, particularly in the Middle District, are some of \nthe most acute in the entire country. The Middle District currently \ncontains 55% of Florida's population, projected to grow to two-thirds \nof the population by the year 2005; and yet this District has only one-\nthird of Florida's judges. This District also contains the federal \ncorrectional center at Coleman. When construction of this facility is \ncompleted in FY 1999, it will be the largest prison complex in the \ncountry. The increased prisoner petitions which come with this will \nstretch judicial resources even further.\n  To add to the problem, a portion of the Middle District has been \ndesignated a High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area. While I am pleased \nthat Florida will be receiving additional assistance in the war against \ndrugs, we must also recognize and anticipate the increased demands that \nthis will put upon this district as more criminals are apprehended and \nprosecuted.\n  Both districts contain major tourist attractions in frequently \nvisited cities, including Disney World, Universal Studios, and Busch \nGardens in Tampa and Orlando and the international playground of South \nBeach in Miami. This heavy flow of both tourism and winter residents \nserve to make the needs of these two judicial districts unique in our \nnation.\n  The statistics kept by the Administrative Office of the US Courts \ndemonstrate the compelling need for new judges in these districts. The \nnumbers for the latest twelve month period show that the Middle \nDistrict ranks second in the nation in average cases (adjusted for \ncomplexity) filed per judge, with a crushing 855. The Southern District \naverages 605 per judge. To put this in perspective, the national \naverage for this time period was 519. Clearly, both of these districts \nare in need of relief.\n  I urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to consider and \npass this legislation expeditiously. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to express my gratitude to Chairman Hatch for his swift \nconsideration of all of the judicial nominees from Florida last year. \nThe Southern and Middle Districts of Florida received three excellent \nnew district judges, Donald Middlebrooks of West Palm Beach, Alan Gold \nof Miami, and Richard Lazzara of Tampa. In addition, Judge Stanley \nMarcus was nominated to the federal appeals court and confirmed by the \nfull Senate in only six weeks. I know I speak for both Senator Graham \nand myself in saying that we are grateful for Chairman Hatch's \nresponsiveness to the needs of these districts.\n  It will not be possible to provide Floridians with a safe environment \nand access to justice unless there is a court system in place which can \nhandle the demands of this dynamic and growing part of our country. \nThis legislation is integral to providing that court system.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to join with my \ndistinguished colleague from Florida, Senator Mack, in introducing the \nFlorida Federal Judgeship Act of 1998.\n  This legislation will create six additional U.S. District Court \njudgeships in Florida--two in the Southern District and four--three \npermanent and one temporary--in the fast-growing Middle District of \nFlorida.\n  Mr. President, make no mistake: Florida's federal courts are in the \nmidst of a full-blown crisis. Currently, the Miami-based Southern \nDistrict has sixteen judges. The Middle District, which also includes \nthe Jacksonville, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, Sarasota, and Fort \nMyers metropolitan areas, has eleven.\n  Because this number of judgeships is too small to meet the increasing \ndemand of Florida's rapidly growing population, judges face \noverwhelming caseloads, and the public faces a denial of justice.\n  Prosecutors and law-enforcement personnel are stymied in their \nefforts to mete out swift justice.\n  Civil litigants are forced to endure unreasonable waits to bring \ntheir cases to resolution.\n  Prominent legal and judicial officials all over Florida have told us \nthat this is not a tenable situation.\n  For example, Middle District U.S. Attorney Charles Wilson, whose \noffice is responsible for bringing alleged criminals to trial, has said \nthat the judicial shortage has a ``negative and severe'' effect on the \nwork of federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials.\n  Floridians are not alone in their concern about overcrowded court \ndockets.\n  In September 1996, the Judicial Conference of the United States--the \nprincipal policy-making body of the Federal judiciary, which is chaired \nby the\n\n[[Page S228]]\n\nChief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and comprised \nof Federal judges from throughout the United States--asked Congress to \ncreate four new judgeships in the Middle District and two in the \nSouthern--precisely what our legislation would authorize.\n  Senator Mack and I are introducing our bill so that Congress can meet \nthe urgent request of the Judicial Conference, and provide the \nadditional judicial resources needed for these two U.S. District Courts \nto meet their increasing caseload.\n  We are certain that many States have justifiable concerns about \novercrowded Federal District Court dockets. I hope that this Congress \nthis year will meet those needs by considering and adopting the \nrecommendations that the Judicial Conference of the United States \nsubmitted to us almost a year and a half ago.\n  But we also believe that the urgent nature of Florida's judicial \ncrisis makes our State a special case.\n  I am going to be saying some things about Florida of which I am not \nproud. They are not positive. But they happen to be the facts as to the \ncircumstances that our Federal courts face.\n  First, Florida has one of the highest caseloads per judge in the \nNation.\n  For the last several years, the Judicial Conference has proposed all \nrecommendations for increased judgeship based on weighted filings--a \nnumber that takes into account both the total number of cases filed per \njudge and the level of case complexity.\n  I would like to note that this is a retrospective look. The Judicial \nConference looks at prior history, in terms of evaluating future needs. \nIn the case of the State of Florida, because of the rapid growth, which \nI will soon detail, and because of the time required--a year and a half \nhas already passed since the Judicial Conference did the calculations \nthat I will soon review--Congress has not yet acted on its \nrecommendation to authorize these additional positions. It would then \nrequire the process of actually filling those vacancies. So, there will \nbe a gap of many months between the time that the numbers were \ncalculated based on past history, as to what the need was, before \nrelief in the form of an actual human being sitting at a bench to \nrender justice will be in place.\n  But looking back to the 1996 numbers, the Southern District's \nweighted filings stood at 588 per judge.\n  This was 33 percent above the national average of 435 weighted filing \nper judge.\n  In the Middle District, the story was even worse--623 weighted \nfilings per judge, a figure that represented one of the highest in the \nentire nation.\n  As a result, nearly 1,800 criminal defendants have cases pending in \nthe Middle District.\n  The story is even worse on the civil side of the docket, where more \nthan 6,200 cases have yet to receive final disposition.\n  In fact, the situation is so dire that Middle District Chief Judge \nElizabeth Kovachevich has announced plans to shut down the Federal \ncourthouses in Jacksonville and Orlando for 3 months this summer and \nrecruit their judges, and any others from around the Nation who can \nspare the time, to tackle the growing civil case backlog in the Tampa \nBay area.\n  Innovative measures like this may help to alleviate the problem in \nthe short-term.\n  But the Florida caseload is not going to experience a slowdown in \ngrowth anytime soon, and the judicial backlog will get worse unless \nCongress takes preventative action for the long term.\n  Second, this legislation recognizes that Florida's largest Federal \njudicial districts are responsible for a massive area that includes \nnearly 80 percent of Florida's 15 million residents.\n  The Southern and Middle Districts combined jurisdiction stretches \nfrom Key West--the southernmost city in the continental United States--\nnorth to include Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, West Palm Beach, Melbourne, \nFort Myers, Sarasota, Tampa, St. Petersburg, Orlando, and Jacksonville.\n  Florida adds over 200,000 new permanent residents every year.\n  Between 1980 and 1995, for example, the middle district grew by 52 \npercent, and it is expected to increase even from this elevated new \nlevel by an additional 21 percent in the next decade.\n  However, since 1990, the last time Congress approved more judges for \nFlorida, our United States district courts have not received any \nadditional resources from the Federal Government to cope with this \ngrowth.\n  Third, this proposal will assist the work of law enforcement \nofficials. If we are committed to assuring that criminals face \npunishment that is both just but swift, we must be willing to provide \nresources to all aspects of the judicial system.\n  In both the southern and middle districts, drug prosecutions and \nother serious criminal cases make up a large percentage of the total \ncase files. For example, both the southern and middle districts have \nbeen designated by this Congress as high-intensity drug trafficking \nareas. These antidrug zones generate a substantial number of lengthy \nmultidefendant prosecutions, and the addition of judges will help law \nenforcement officials and prosecutors in their fight against drug \ncrimes.\n  In addition, the Federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials \nthroughout Florida, but especially in the southern and middle \ndistricts, are being forced to spend more time combating the cheats, \nthe fly-by-night operators and the other criminals who are engaged in a \nsystematic campaign to defraud and plunder our Medicare and other \nhealth care programs.\n  Mr. President, as shocking as it is, it has been estimated that \nnearly 20 percent of all Medicare expenditures in the Southern District \nof Florida are lost to fraud. Nearly 30 percent of all Medicare fraud \nnationwide takes place in the State of Florida.\n  In November of 1997, the new southern district U.S. Attorney Tom \nScott pledged to create a comprehensive antifraud task force made up of \nlocal, State and Federal law enforcement officials to fight health care \nfraud. I am optimistic that this new effort will be successful in \nincreasing the number of fraud offenders brought to justice. I am \nhopeful that it will deter others from entering this pernicious \nactivity. But I am very concerned that unless the southern and middle \ndistricts have the adequate number of judges, many of these charlatans \nwill not receive the swift and severe punishment they deserve.\n  It is vital that we act quickly to resolve this crisis. Since 1991, \nfilings have gone up 21 percent in the middle district; 30 percent in \nthe southern district. Congress and the White House must be vigilant in \ntheir shared responsibility for recommending, nominating and confirming \nFederal judicial nominees.\n  Mr. President, I commend Chairman Orrin Hatch, of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and its membership, including our current Presiding Officer, \nfor their recognition of the overcrowding problems facing Florida's \nFederal district courts.\n  Last year, the Senate confirmed three Federal district judges--Donald \nMiddlebrooks of West Palm Beach, Alan Gold of Miami, and Richard \nLazzara of Tampa--to replace three judges who had retired or taken \nsenior status. From late September of 1997, when Judge Lazzara was \nconfirmed, until yesterday when the President nominated William P. \nDimitrouleas of Fort Lauderdale and Judge Steven Mickle of Gainsville \nto fill openings in the Southern and Northern Districts of Florida, we \nhad no judicial nominations pending before the Senate.\n  Senator Hatch's and Members' leadership and understanding and their \ndetermination to address Florida's special needs are very much \nappreciated by the residents of our State.\n  U.S. Federal district courts are the first stop for most citizens \ninvolved in the Federal judicial system. Most Federal cases are \ndisposed of at the district court level. It is essential that these \ncitizens have their claims heard in a timely manner.\n  As the court caseload increases nationally, the Senate must be \nwilling to expand judicial positions where they are needed.\n  Our legislation is simple, sound and will serve the interest of \nAmerica and will serve the interest of our State of Florida.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Mack, with yourself and with \nthe other members of the Judiciary Committee on this matter, Mr. \nPresident. I urge all my colleagues to support the passage of this \nmuch-needed legislation. For thousands of crime victims,\n\n[[Page S229]]\n\nfor thousands of civil litigants in Florida's southern and middle \njudicial districts, justice delayed is rapidly becoming justice denied.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to join my colleague, \nSenator Mack, in introducing this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters which I have received--one \nfrom the middle district chief judge, Judge Elizabeth Kovachevich, and \none from the U.S. Department of Justice, the U.S. Attorney for the \nMiddle District of Florida, Mr. Charles Wilson--be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                   Middle District of Florida,\n\n                                     Tampa, FL, December 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Mack: Initially, I wish to \n     sincerely thank both of you for your respective \n     participations in several of the events scheduled in Tampa on \n     December 12, 1997. Each of you attended two of the four \n     activities, and it certainly was greatly appreciated, and \n     noted, by the other participants and attendees of those \n     respective celebrations. Your presence was a significant \n     contribution toward the success of that day.\n       Further, your joint letter that was published in the Tampa \n     Tribune last week on December 12 produced great positive \n     reaction on this West Coast of Florida! The Accelerated Trial \n     Calendar is the ``last hurrah'' for Tampa/Fort Myers by the \n     eleven judges of the Middle District of Florida before senior \n     status claims two of our eleven by the year 2000. If we are \n     successful, we must be prepared to utilize the same tactic in \n     the future in Jacksonville and Orlando.\n       Consistent with the foregoing, and our efforts to help \n     ourselves, we enclose a conservative statistical compilation \n     prepared by our Clerk's office in MD/FL, which graphically \n     demonstrates what would occur without the ATC, and, what will \n     happen when we go from eleven to nine active United States \n     District Judges. I remind you that our previous Tampa/Fort \n     Myers chart shows that as of October 31, 1997, our real \n     projections for July 1998, without the ATC, would have been \n     4,400 civil cases and 1,000 criminal cases pending, totaling \n     5,400 cases for the Tampa/Fort Myers judges!\n       These next five years will see a congressional election, \n     with consequences in 1999, and, a presidential and \n     congressional election, with consequences in 2001. If this \n     district must wait for national political machinations, we \n     will collapse! Just the plans for H.I.D.T.A. in Tampa and \n     Orlando, during the next three years, and the funding for \n     same, will generate substantial multi-defendant, multi-month \n     prosecutions of persons ``targeted for federal sentencing \n     guideline implications;'' these are not in any of our present \n     calculations!\n       I would hope that the Senate Judiciary Committee will \n     provide us with a hearing to answer any questions regarding \n     your proposed legislation to provide us with new judgeships \n     as soon as reasonably possible, perhaps in February 1998.\n       With warmest personal regards, I am\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                         Elizabeth A. Kovachevich,\n     Chief Judge, Middle District of Florida.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n                                          Tampa, FL, May 21, 1997.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n\n     Hon. Connie Mack,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.\n       Dear Senators Graham and Mack: You have requested comment \n     from the United States Attorney regarding the impact of the \n     shortage of resident District Court Judges on the U.S. \n     Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Florida. I write \n     to report that the impact is negative and severe.\n       For our Criminal Division, the most direct effect of the \n     judicial shortage is the assignment of cases to visiting \n     judges for trial. Although visiting judges provide a great \n     service to the Middle District, the use of them for a \n     substantial number of criminal trials poses several problems. \n     First, the very fact that a case is transferred to a visiting \n     judge's docket often causes unnecessary delay. Secondly, I am \n     advised by Assistant United States Attorneys that visiting \n     judges are, understandably, not as well-versed in Eleventh \n     Circuit case law, requiring the expenditure of additional \n     time by both prosecution and defense attorneys in addressing \n     significant legal issues during the course of a case. \n     Finally, the Middle District of Florida is one of the leaders \n     in the country in the filing of multiple-defendant and \n     complex white collar crime litigation characterized by longer \n     trials. For example, last year, our office prosecuted 16 \n     members of the Outlaws Motorcycle Gang for conspiracy, \n     racketeering and other offenses. The trial lasted for \n     eighteen weeks. During that period of time, the cases \n     assigned to the presiding judge accumulated without the \n     judicial attention that they would have ordinarily received. \n     Given our present prosecution priorities (i.e., drug \n     trafficking, violent  crime, health care fraud and \n     telemarketing fraud), we expect that the number of \n     multiple-defendant and sophisticated white collar criminal \n     cases will continue to increase in the future. In fact, \n     many such cases are awaiting trial at the present time.\n       Thus far in Fiscal Year 1997, 32 per cent of criminal jury \n     trials (8/25) in the Tampa Division of the Middle District of \n     Florida were conducted by visiting judges. Another 20% of \n     these trials (5/25) were conducted by a judge on senior \n     status. In our Ft. Myers Division, where we presently have \n     seven criminal AUSAs but no resident district Court Judge, \n     fully 91% (10/11) of the criminal trials were conducted by a \n     visiting judge.\n       Our Ft. Myers Division is most severely impacted by the \n     judicial shortage. Because of the absence of a resident \n     judge, Ft. Myers cases are assigned to Tampa judges. As a \n     result, some cases that should be tried in Ft. Myers are \n     moved to Tampa to accommodate the judges' busy schedules. \n     This includes many cases that are important to the citizens \n     in and around Ft. Myers. In fact, the bigger the case (and \n     thus the more local attention warranted by it) the more \n     likely it is to be transferred to Tampa for no other reason \n     than the Court's schedule. Transfers are also expensive. Even \n     for relatively insignificant hearings in a case, if there is \n     a disputed issue, all attorneys, parties and witnesses must \n     take an entire day to drive to Tampa and back. If a Ft. Myers \n     case is tried by a Tampa Judge in Tampa, my office must incur \n     the travel and accommodation expense of the Ft. Myers AUSA \n     originally assigned to the case.\n       Our Civil Division is also impacted quite directly by the \n     shortage of Article III judges in our District. First, in \n     light of their heavy caseload, District Court judges \n     typically do not have the time to grant oral argument in \n     connection with sophisticated motions to dismiss or motions \n     for summary judgment in civil cases. The result is that the \n     judges take several months to decide motions that might \n     otherwise be disposed of quite promptly if oral argument were \n     heard. In those cases where the motions are meritorious, the \n     delay results in unnecessary expenditures on expert witnesses \n     and other pretrial matters, all to the great detriment of the \n     parties even if the correct result is ultimately reached. \n     Worse yet, meritorious motions are sometimes denied only to \n     have the court adopt the movant's legal position after trial \n     (the first time the judge has had a real chance to ponder the \n     case), suggesting that trial was in fact unnecessary. We \n     believe that these problems would be avoided by oral argument \n     in many instances, but we recognize that our overburdened \n     judiciary simply does not have the luxury to grant oral \n     argument very often.\n       Second, the lack of a judge in Fort Myers has a serious \n     negative impact on civil cases there. By way of illustration, \n     we are presently prosecuting a complex ``fair housing'' case \n     in the Fort Myers Division. At one point the District Court \n     judge transferred the case to Tampa, notwithstanding that \n     numerous victims reside in south or southwest Florida and \n     would have been substantially inconvenienced by a Tampa \n     trial. On our motion, the case was transferred back to Fort \n     Myers, but it cannot be tried for many months. If a judge \n     were resident there, this case would probably have been tried \n     already.\n       FInally, civil cases which for some reason are not reached \n     on the calendar of one of the visiting judges usually roll to \n     the next month in which a nonresident judge will be visiting, \n     as opposed to the next calendar month. This causes \n     significant unwarranted delay. For example, in a large \n     pending discrimination case, an opposing counsel who appears \n     particularly reluctant to go to trial was able to obtain a \n     continuance, thereby delaying the case not for one month, but \n     for approximately five. This phenomenon would also be \n     eliminated by additional judgeships.\n       I hope the information supplied herein is helpful. If I can \n     be of further assistance, please let me know.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                Charles R. Wilson,\n                                                    U.S. Attorney.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 1586. A bill to authorize collection of certain State and local \ntaxes with respect to the sale, delivery, and use of tangible personal \nproperty; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n          THE CONSUMER AND MAIN STREET PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nresolve a serious problem facing consumers and Main Street businesses \nin America. This problem allows consumers to be misled regarding their \ntax liabilities and puts Main Street businesses at a competitive \ndisadvantage vis-a-vis out-of-State companies. The problem of which I \nspeak is the loophole that allows companies to ship goods across State \nlines without collecting the taxes due on those goods.\n  My bill, The Consumer and Main Street Protection Act of 1998, will \ngive States the option if they choose, of removing this unfair \nadvantage enjoyed by out-of-State companies. The legal effect will be \nto authorize a State or\n\n[[Page S230]]\n\nlocal jurisdiction to require out-of-State companies to collect use \ntaxes on sales of personal property delivered into that State or local \njurisdiction, if that State taxes its own citizens on retail sales.\n  This bill does not create a new tax. Indeed, it doesn't create a tax \nat all. It merely deals with how existing taxes are collected. \nSpecifically, it would allow States, if they choose, to shift the \nburden of collecting and remitting use taxes from the consumer to the \ncompany.\n  At this point, I should clarify the meaning of the term ``use tax.'' \nA use tax is a tax on goods purchased in one jurisdiction for use in \nanother jurisdiction. For example, goods purchased in Tennessee for use \nin Arkansas are subject to an Arkansas use tax. Use taxes are used to \nkeep people from avoiding sales taxes. If a State doesn't have a use \ntax, its citizens can avoid paying sales taxes by making purchases in \nanother State. By imposing a use tax equal to its sales tax, States can \nremove the incentive to engage in tax circumvention.\n  Therefore, in the 45 States which presently have sales and use taxes, \nconsumers are legally obligated to pay those taxes, whether the \npurchases are made at a local department store, via mail order, or over \nthe internet. Unfortunately, catalog companies typically do not make \ntheir customers aware of this obligation--in fact, some mislead \ncustomers into believing that out-of-State purchases are ``tax free.'' \nThis, of course, is patently false. The company may be exempt from \ncollecting use taxes, but the customer is still liable for paying those \ntaxes directly to the State revenue department on every out-of-State \npurchase.\n  This situation causes three serious problems. First, consumers are \noften shocked to discover that their ``tax-free'' purchase is not \nreally tax free. State revenue departments inform tens of thousands of \nconsumers every year of this sad fact. The consumer finds he is liable \nfor back taxes, interest and penalties.\n  Second, Main Street retailers are placed in an unfair position vis-a-\nvis mail order houses. This occurs because mail order products if no \ntax is collected, are cheaper than if bought in Main Street department \nstores. Not only do most mail order houses not collect use taxes, they \ndon't tell their customers that they are legally liable to pay the tax.\n  Third, State and local governments lose revenues because billions of \ndollars of the taxes are never collected. According to the Advisory \nCommission on Intergovernmental Relations, State and local governments \nlose over $3.3 billion a year for this reason. This occurs, even as \nmail order companies impose significant costs on State and local \ngovernments by sending an avalanche of catalogs and product packaging \nto municipal landfills. Every year over 3 million tons of third class \nmail, most of which is catalogs, goes to landfills in this country. \nThis is not surprising considering the billions of catalogs which \nconsumers receive in the mail every year. One company alone, Fingerhut, \nInc., mails out nearly 500 million catalogs annually. With mail order \nsales growing by approximately 6 percent per year, this burden on State \nand local government will increase significantly in coming years.\n\n\n                    THE BELLAS HESS AND QUILL CASES\n\n  A short discussion of case law is in order to explain why this matter \nrequires Congressional intervention. The Supreme Court has twice \nconsidered the question of whether a State may impose tax collections \nduties on an out-of-State mail order company. In 1967, the Court ruled \nin National Bellas Hess v. Department of Revenue that such a State \naction violated both the Due Process Clause and the Commerce Clause of \nthe United States Constitution. Bellas Hess therefore made it \nimpossible for Congress to craft a legislative solution to the problem: \nalthough the Commerce Clause is the exclusive domain of Congress, the \nDue Process Clause is not subject to Congressional discretion. As long \nas the due process holding from Bellas Hess remained good law, \nCongress' hands were tied.\n\n  In 1992, however, the Supreme Court overruled the due process portion \nof Bellas Hess. In Quill Corporation versus North Dakota, the Court \nrevisited the issue of mail order tax collection and, applying a more \nmodern due process analysis, concluded that mail order activities now \nconstitute a sufficient connection to the State to justify the tax \ncollection requirement. In other words, a State's imposition of tax \ncollection requirements on an out-of-State mail order company no longer \noffends due process.\n  The Quill case therefore clears the way for Congress to act on this \nissue.\n  Although Quill did not overrule the Commerce Clause portion of Bellas \nHess, that holding does not preclude Congressional action. As I \nmentioned earlier, because the Commerce Clause grants Congress \nexclusive authority over interstate commerce, Congress may, if it \nchooses, grant the States the authority to require out-of-State tax \ncollection. Indeed, the Supreme Court expressly acknowledged in Quill \nthat ``Congress is now free to decide whether, when, and to what extent \nthe States may burden interstate mail-order concerns with a duty to \ncollect use taxes.''\n\n\n             Protections Against Undue Burdens on Business\n\n  In writing this bill, I have taken great care to insure that it does \nnot place an undue burden on business--particularly small business. I \nhave included four provisions designed to protect against an \noverburdensome effect: (1) De minimus provision--The Act expressly \nexempts any company whose total U.S. revenue is less than $3 million. \nThe exemption will not apply, however, in any State where the company's \nrevenue exceeds $100,000; (2) One-rate-per-State provision--In \nsituations where an out-of-State company is subject to multiple local \ntax rates in a single State, the company will have the option of paying \neach applicable local rate or paying one standard rate, called an ``in-\nlieu fee;'' (3) Filing frequency limitation--States may not require \nout-of-State companies to file tax returns more than once per quarter; \n(4) Mandatory information service--States must maintain a toll-free \ntelephone service to provide out-of-State companies with necessary tax \ninformation and forms.\n\n\n                       What The Bill Does Not Do\n\n  The intent of this bill is not to injure the mail order industry. \nThere are many fine mail order companies in America which offer many \nuseful products, and I have no quarrel with any of them aside from \ntheir exemption from collecting use taxes. The intent of the bill is \nmerely to insure that consumers are protected and Main Street \nbusinesses are treated equitably in relation to companies located out-\nof-State.\n  Let me repeat, this bill does not create a new tax. It merely allows \nfor the fair and equitable collection of existing taxes. If the \nresidents of a State do not wish to pay a use tax, then they can repeal \nthat use tax. That is their prerogative. But if they choose to have a \nuse tax, the Federal Government should allow them to enforce it. That \nis what this bill does--it authorizes the States to collect taxes \nfairly and evenly from all who conduct business in the State.\n  Finally, this bill is not a preemption of the States' power to tax. \nIn fact, States are not required to take any action as a result of this \nbill. They may completely ignore this legislation and continue their \npresent tax collection methods. This bill merely grants the States a \npower presently denied under the Commerce Clause and imposes the \nlimitations on that power which are necessary to insure that the \nresulting burden on out-of-State companies is not unreasonable.\n\n\n                             Broad Support\n\n  This measure has already gained extensive support. The legislation \nwas crafted with the input of a broad-based coalition of business and \ngovernmental associations. They represent large constituencies in every \nState, all of which actively and vocally support the bill. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that a list of these organizations \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n   SUPPORTERS OF THE CONSUMER AND MAIN STREET PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n                         Business Associations\n\n       Home Furnishing International\n       International Council of Shopping Centers\n       Jewelers of America\n       Marine Operators Association of America\n       Marine Retailers Association of America\n       National Floor Covering Association\n       National Home Furnishings Association\n       North American Retail Dealers Association\n\n[[Page S231]]\n\n       Performance Warehouse Association\n       Computing Technology Industry Association\n       National Association of Retail Druggists\n       National Office Products Association\n       National Small Business United\n       International Home Furnishings Representatives Association\n\n\n                State and Local Government Associations\n\n       National Governors' Association\n       National Conference of State Legislatures\n       National Association of Counties\n       National League of Cities\n       U.S. Conference of Mayors\n       Multistate Tax Commission\n       Federation of Tax Administrators\n       Government Finance Officers Association\n       National Association of State Budget Officers\n       National Association of State Auditors, Comptrollers and \n     Treasurers\n       National Association of State Treasurers\n\n\n                   Education and Labor Organizations\n\n       AFL-CIO Public Employees Department\n       American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n     Employees\n       American Federation of Teachers\n       National School Boards Association\n       American Association of School Administrators\n       National Education Association\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Consumer and Main Street \n     Protection Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) merchandise purchased from out-of-State firms is \n     subject to State and local sales taxes in the same manner as \n     merchandise purchased from in-State firms,\n       (2) State and local governments generally are unable to \n     compel out-of-State firms to collect and remit such taxes, \n     and consequently, many out-of-State firms choose not to \n     collect State and local taxes on merchandise delivered across \n     State lines,\n       (3) moreover, many out-of-State firms fail to inform their \n     customers that such taxes exist, with some firms even falsely \n     claim that merchandise purchased out-of-State is tax-free, \n     and consequently, many consumers unknowingly incur tax \n     liabilities, including interest and penalty charges,\n       (4) Congress has a duty to protect consumers from explicit \n     or implicit misrepresentations of State and local sales tax \n     obligations,\n       (5) small businesses, which are compelled to collect State \n     and local sales taxes, are subject to unfair competition when \n     out-of-State firms cannot be compelled to collect and remit \n     such taxes on their sales to residents of the State,\n       (6) State and local governments provide a number of \n     resources to out-of-State firms including government services \n     relating to disposal of tons of catalogs, mail delivery, \n     communications, and bank and court systems,\n       (7) the inability of State and local governments to require \n     out-of-State firms to collect and remit sales taxes deprives \n     State and local governments of needed revenue and forces such \n     State and local governments to raise taxes on taxpayers, \n     including consumers and small businesses, in such State,\n       (8) the Supreme Court ruled in Quill Corporation v. North \n     Dakota, 112 S. Ct. 1904 (1992) that the due process clause of \n     the Constitution does not prohibit a State government from \n     imposing personal jurisdiction and tax obligations on out-of-\n     State firms that purposefully solicit sales from residents \n     therein, and that the Congress has the power to authorize \n     State governments to require out-of-State firms to collect \n     State and local sales taxes, and\n       (9) as a matter of federalism, the Federal Government has a \n     duty to assist State and local governments in collecting \n     sales taxes on sales from out-of-State firms.\n\n     SEC. 3. AUTHORITY FOR COLLECTION OF SALES TAX.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State is authorized to require a person \n     who is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the State to \n     collect and remit a State sales tax, a local sales tax, or \n     both, with respect to tangible personal property if--\n       (1) the destination of the tangible personal property is in \n     the State,\n       (2) during the 1-year period ending on September 30 of the \n     calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the \n     taxable event occurs, the person has gross receipts from \n     sales of such tangible personal property--\n       (A) in the United States exceeding $3,000,000, or\n       (B) in the State exceeding $100,000, and\n       (3) the State, on behalf of its local jurisdictions, \n     collects and administers all local sales taxes imposed \n     pursuant to this Act.\n       (b) States Must Collect Local Sales Taxes.-- Except as \n     provided in section 4(d), a State in which both State and \n     local sales taxes are imposed may not require State sales \n     taxes to be collected and remitted under subsection (a) \n     unless the State also requires the local sales taxes to be \n     collected and remitted under subsection (a).\n       (c) Aggregation Rules.--All persons that would be treated \n     as a single employer under section 52 (a) or (b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall be treated as one person \n     for purposes of subsection (a).\n       (d) Destination.--For purposes of subsection (a), the \n     destination of tangible personal property is the State or \n     local jurisdiction which is the final location to which the \n     seller ships or delivers the property, or to which the seller \n     causes the property to be shipped or delivered, regardless of \n     the means of shipment or delivery or the location of the \n     buyer.\n\n     SEC. 4. TREATMENT OF LOCAL SALES TAXES.\n\n       (a) Uniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Sales taxes imposed by local jurisdictions \n     of a State shall be deemed to be uniform for purposes of this \n     Act and shall be collected under this Act in the same manner \n     as State sales taxes if--\n       (A) such local sales taxes are imposed at the same rate and \n     on identical transactions in all geographic areas in the \n     State, and\n       (B) such local sales taxes imposed on sales by out-of-State \n     persons are collected and administered by the State.\n       (2) Application to border jurisdiction tax rates.--A State \n     shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of \n     paragraph (1)(A) if, with respect to a local jurisdiction \n     which borders on another State, such State or local \n     jurisdiction--\n       (A) either reduces or increases the local sales tax in \n     order to achieve a rate of tax equal to that imposed by the \n     bordering State on identical transactions, or\n       (B) exempts from the tax transactions which are exempt from \n     tax in the bordering State.\n       (b) Nonuniform Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), \n     nonuniform local sales taxes required to be collected \n     pursuant to this Act shall be collected under one of the \n     options provided under paragraph (2).\n       (2) Election.--For purposes of paragraph (1), any person \n     required under authority of this Act to collect nonuniform \n     local sales taxes shall elect to collect either--\n       (A) all nonuniform local sales taxes applicable to \n     transactions in the State, or\n       (B) a fee (at the rate determined under paragraph (3)) \n     which shall be in lieu of the nonuniform local sales taxes \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n\n     Such election shall require the person to use the method \n     elected for all transactions in the State while the election \n     is in effect.\n       (3) Rate of in-lieu fee.--For purposes of paragraph (2)(B), \n     the rate of the in-lieu fee for any calendar year shall be an \n     amount equal to the product of--\n       (A) the amount determined by dividing total nonuniform \n     local sales tax revenues collected in the State for the most \n     recently completed State fiscal year for which data is \n     available by total State sales tax revenues for the same \n     year, and\n\n       (B) the State sales tax rate.\n     Such amount shall be rounded to the nearest 0.25 percent.\n       (4) Nonuniform local sales taxes.--For purposes of this \n     Act, nonuniform local sales taxes are local sales taxes which \n     do not meet the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) Distribution of Local Sales Taxes.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as provided in subsection (d), a \n     State shall distribute to local jurisdictions a portion of \n     the amounts collected pursuant to this Act determined on the \n     basis of--\n       (A) in the case of uniform local sales taxes, the \n     proportion which each local jurisdiction receives of uniform \n     local sales taxes not collected pursuant to this Act,\n       (B) in the case of in-lieu fees described in subsection \n     (b)(2)(B), the proportion which each local jurisdiction's \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts bears to the total \n     nonuniform local sales tax receipts in the State, and\n       (C) in the case of any nonuniform local sales tax collected \n     pursuant to this Act, the geographical location of the \n     transaction on which the tax was imposed.\n\n     The amounts determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall \n     be calculated on the basis of data for the most recently \n     completed State fiscal year for which the data is available.\n       (2) Timing.--Amounts described in paragraph (1) (B) or (C) \n     shall be distributed by a State to its local jurisdictions in \n     accordance with State timetables for distributing local sales \n     taxes, but not less frequently than every calendar quarter. \n     Amounts described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be distributed by \n     a State as provided under State law.\n       (3) Transition rule.--If, upon the effective date of this \n     Act, a State has a State law in effect providing a method for \n     distributing local sales taxes other than the method under \n     this subsection, then this subsection shall not apply to that \n     State until the 91st day following the adjournment sine die \n     of that State's next regular legislative session which \n     convenes after the effective date of this Act (or such \n     earlier date as State law may provide). Local sales taxes \n     collected pursuant to this Act prior to the application of \n     this subsection shall be distributed as provided by State \n     law.\n\n[[Page S232]]\n\n       (d) Exception Where State Board Collects Taxes.--\n     Notwithstanding section 3(b) and subsections (b) and (c) of \n     this section, if a State had in effect on January 1, 1995, a \n     State law which provides that local sales taxes are collected \n     and remitted by a board of elected States officers, then for \n     any period during which such law continues in effect--\n       (1) the State may require the collection and remittance \n     under this Act of only the State sales taxes and the uniform \n     portion of local sales taxes, and\n       (2) the State may distribute any local sales taxes \n     collected pursuant to this Act in accordance with State law.\n\n     SEC. 5. RETURN AND REMITTANCE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--A State may not require any person subject \n     to this Act--\n       (1) to file a return reporting the amount of any tax \n     collected or required to be collected under this Act, or to \n     remit the receipts of such tax, more frequently than once \n     with respect to sales in a calendar quarter, or\n       (2) to file the initial such return, or to make the initial \n     such remittance, before the 90th day after the person's first \n     taxable transaction under this Act.\n       (b) Local Taxes.--The provisions of subsection (a) shall \n     also apply to any person required by a State acting under \n     authority of this Act to collect a local sales tax or in-lieu \n     fee.\n\n     SEC. 6. NONDISCRIMINATION AND EXEMPTIONS.\n\n       Any State which exercises any authority granted under this \n     Act shall allow to all persons subject to this Act all \n     exemptions or other exceptions to State and local sales taxes \n     which are allowed to persons located within the State or \n     local jurisdiction.\n\n     SEC. 7. APPLICATION OF STATE LAW.\n\n       (a) Persons Required To Collect State or Local Sales Tax.--\n     Any person required by section 3 to collect a State or local \n     sales tax shall be subject to the laws of such State relating \n     to such sales tax to the extent that such laws are consistent \n     with the limitations contained in this Act.\n       (b) Limitations.--Except as provided in subsection (a), \n     nothing in this Act shall be construed to permit a State--\n       (1) to license or regulate any person,\n       (2) to require any person to qualify to transact intrastate \n     business, or\n       (3) to subject any person to State taxes not related to the \n     sales of tangible personnel property.\n       (c) Preemption.--Except as otherwise provided in this Act, \n     this Act shall not be construed to preempt or limit any power \n     exercised or to be exercised by a State or local jurisdiction \n     under the law of such State or local jurisdiction or under \n     any other Federal law.\n\n     SEC. 8. TOLL-FREE INFORMATION SERVICE.\n\n       A State shall not have power under this Act to require any \n     person to collect a State or local sales tax on any sale \n     unless, at the time of such sale, such State has a toll-free \n     telephone service available to provide such person \n     information relating to collection of such State or local \n     sales tax. Such information shall include, at a minimum, all \n     applicable tax rates, return and remittance addresses and \n     deadlines, and penalty and interest information. As part of \n     the service, the State shall also provide all necessary forms \n     and instructions at no cost to any person using the service. \n     The State shall prominently display the toll-free telephone \n     number on all correspondence with any person using the \n     service. This service may be provided jointly with other \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 9. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act--\n       (1) the term ``compensating use tax'' means a tax imposed \n     on or incident to the use, storage, consumption, \n     distribution, or other use within a State or local \n     jurisdiction or other area of a State, of tangible personal \n     property;\n       (2) the term ``local sales tax'' means a sales tax imposed \n     in a local jurisdiction or area of a State and includes, but \n     is not limited to--\n       (A) a sales tax or in-lieu fee imposed in a local \n     jurisdiction or area of a State by the State on behalf of \n     such jurisdiction or area, and\n       (B) a sales tax imposed by a local jurisdiction or other \n     State-authorized entity pursuant to the authority of State \n     law, local law, or both;\n       (3) the term ``person'' means an individual, a trust, \n     estate, partnership, society, association, company (including \n     a limited liability company) or corporation, whether or not \n     acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, and any \n     combination of the foregoing;\n       (4) the term ``sales tax'' means a tax, including a \n     compensating use tax, that is--\n       (A) imposed on or incident to the sale, purchase, storage, \n     consumption, distribution, or other use of tangible personal \n     property as may be defined or specified under the laws \n     imposing such tax, and\n       (B) measured by the amount of the sales price, cost, charge \n     or other value of or for such property; and\n       (5) the term ``State'' means any of the several States of \n     the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth \n     of Puerto Rico, and any territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 10. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act. In no event shall this Act apply to \n     any sale occurring before such effective date.\n\n\n     OUTLINE OF THE CONSUMER AND MAIN STREET PROTECTION ACT OF 1998\n\n       Effect: Congress would give states the authority to require \n     out-of-state sellers to collect the sales taxes due on goods \n     shipped into the state. Under current law, out-of-state \n     companies are exempt from collecting these taxes, even though \n     consumers must pay them. This places an inappropriate burden \n     on the consumer and places local retailers at a competitive \n     disadvantage.\n       Not a New Tax: The Act does not create a new tax. It merely \n     deals with how existing taxes are collected, shifting the \n     burden of collecting those taxes from the consumer to the \n     company.\n       Small Companies Exempted: A company will be exempt if its \n     nationwide sales are less than $3 million. The exemption will \n     not apply in any state where the company's sales exceed \n     $100,000.\n       One Rate Per State: The Act will not require complicated \n     tax calculations. Rather than dealing with a variety of state \n     and local rates, companies will have the option of collecting \n     a single blended rate for each state into which products are \n     shipped.\n       Filing Frequency: Under the Act, out-of-state companies \n     will only have to file tax returns once per quarter.\n       Toll-Free Information Service: To utilize the Act, states \n     must establish a toll-free information service to provide \n     out-of-state companies with necessary information and forms.\n       Distribution of Local Sales Taxes: State governments must \n     remit to local jurisdictions the appropriate local share of \n     taxes collected from out-of-state companies. To ensure this, \n     the Act requires states to distribute local taxes collected \n     out-of-state in the same proportion as local taxes collected \n     in-state. Distributions must occur at least once every \n     calendar quarter.\n\n           Uncollected Sales Taxes on Mail Order Goods, 1994\n\n                                                               Millions\nAlabama...........................................................$48.6\nArizona............................................................44.4\nArkansas...........................................................19.6\nCalifornia........................................................482.8\nColorado...........................................................47.9\nConnecticut........................................................50.4\nD.C.................................................................9.9\nFlorida...........................................................168.9\nGeorgia............................................................72.9\nHawaii..............................................................9.8\nIdaho...............................................................9.7\nIllinois..........................................................233.1\nIndiana............................................................54.5\nIowa...............................................................28.3\nKansas.............................................................33.5\nKentucky...........................................................41.7\nLouisiana..........................................................61.9\nMaine..............................................................13.3\nMaryland...........................................................60.1\nMassachusetts......................................................69.0\nMichigan..........................................................108.4\nMinnesota..........................................................53.1\nMississippi........................................................28.0\nMissouri...........................................................63.5\nNebraska...........................................................17.4\nNevada.............................................................17.4\nNew Jersey........................................................112.2\nNew Mexico.........................................................16.8\nNew York..........................................................359.4\nNorth Carolina.....................................................71.1\nNorth Dakota........................................................5.8\nOhio..............................................................116.3\nOklahoma...........................................................41.8\nPennsylvania......................................................145.0\nRhode Island.......................................................14.2\nSouth Carolina.....................................................31.3\nSouth Dakota........................................................7.3\nTennessee..........................................................68.8\nTexas.............................................................235.2\nUtah...............................................................16.8\nVermont.............................................................6.0\nVirginia...........................................................59.9\nWashington.........................................................76.2\nWest Virginia......................................................18.6\nWisconsin..........................................................46.6\nWyoming.............................................................4.4\n                                                             __________\n                                                             \n      Total.....................................................3,301.5\n                                                               ==========\n_______________________________________________________________________\n\n\nSource: Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1591. A bill entitled the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act \nof 1998''; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n           THE BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT OF 1998\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Grant Act of 1998, a bill to establish a matching \ngrant program to help State, Tribal and local jurisdictions purchase \narmor vests for the use by law enforcement officers. I also am working \nwith my colleague, Senator Leahy, on an expanded version of body armor \nlegislation.\n  There are far too many law enforcement officers who patrol our \nstreets and neighborhoods without the proper protective gear against \nviolent criminals. As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the \nrisks which law enforcement officers face everyday on the front lines \nprotecting our communities.\n  Today, more than ever, violent criminals have bulletproof vests and \ndeadly\n\n[[Page S233]]\n\nweapons at their disposal. In fact, figures from the U.S. Department of \nJustice indicate that approximately 150,000 law enforcement officers--\nor 25 percent of the nation's 600,000 state and local officers--do not \nhave access to bulletproof vests.\n  The evidence is clear that a bulletproof vest is one of the most \nimportant pieces of equipment that any law enforcement officer can \nhave. Since the introduction of modern bulletproof material, the lives \nof more than 1,500 officers have been saved by bulletproof vests. In \nfact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation has concluded that officers \nwho do not wear bulletproof vests are 14 times more likely to be killed \nby a firearm than those officers who do wear vests. Simply put, \nbulletproof vests save lives.\n  Unfortunately, many police departments do not have the resources to \npurchase vests on their own. The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act \nof 1998 would form a partnership with state and local law enforcement \nagencies in order to make sure that every police officer who needs a \nbulletproof gets one. It would do so by authorizing up to $25 million \nper year for a new grant program within the U.S. Department of Justice. \nThe program would provide 50-50 matching grants to state and local law \nenforcement agencies and Indian tribes to assist in purchasing \nbulletproof vests and body armor. To make sure that no police \ndepartment is left out of the program, the matching requirement could \nbe waived for those jurisdictions that cannot afford it.\n  This bill is a companion to legislation introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Congressman Peter J. Visclosky from Indiana. That \nlegislation already has over 200 cosponsors.\n  This bill has been endorsed by the Fraternal Order of Police, the \nNational Sheriffs' Association, the International Union of Police \nAssociations, the Police Executive Research Forum, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations.\n  While we know that there is no way to end the risks inherent to a \ncareer in law enforcement, we must do everything possible to ensure \nthat officers who put their lives on the line every day also put on a \nvest. Body armor is one of the most important pieces of equipment an \nofficer can have and often means the difference between life and death.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United states of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bulletproof Vest Partnership \n     Grant Act of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings--Congress finds that--\n       (1) too many law enforcement officers die, while protecting \n     the public, as a result of gunshot wounds;\n       (2) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, 709 law \n     enforcement officers in the United States were feloniously \n     killed in the line of duty;\n       (3) more than 92 percent of such law enforcement officers \n     were killed by firearms;\n       (4) the number of law enforcement officers who die as a \n     result of gunshot wounds has declined significantly since the \n     introduction of modern bulletproof material;\n       (5) according to studies, between 1985 and 1994, bullet \n     resistant materials helped save the lives of more than 2,000 \n     law enforcement officers in the United States;\n       (6) the number of law enforcement officers who were killed \n     in the line of duty would significantly decrease if every law \n     enforcement officer in the United States has access to an \n     armor vest; and\n       (7) the Executive Committee for Indian Country Law \n     Enforcement Improvements reports that violent crime in Indian \n     country has risen sharply, despite decreases in the national \n     crime rate, and has concluded that there is a ``public safety \n     crisis in Indian country.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to save lives of \n     law enforcement officers by helping State and local law \n     enforcement departments provide officers with armor vests.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROGRAM AUTHORIZED.\n\n       (a) Grant Authorization.--The Director of the Bureau of \n     Justice Assistance is authorized to make grants to States, \n     units of local government, and Indian tribes to purchase \n     vests for use by law enforcement officers.\n       (b) Uses of Funds.--Awards shall be distributed directly to \n     the State, unit of local government or Indian tribe and shall \n     be used for the purchase of not more than 1 armor vest for \n     each policy officer in a jurisdiction.\n       (c) Preferential Consideration.--In awarding grants under \n     this Act, the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance \n     may give preferential consideration, where feasible, to \n     applications from jurisdictions that--\n       (1) have the greatest need for armor vests based on the \n     percentage of officers in the department who do not have \n     access to a vest;\n       (2) have a mandatory wear policy that requires on-duty \n     officers to wear armor vests whenever feasible; and\n       (3) have a violent crime rate at or above the national \n     average as determined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       (d) Minimum Amount.--Unless all applications submitted by \n     any State or unit of local government pursuant to subsection \n     (a) have been funded, each qualifying State or unit of local \n     government shall be allocated in each fiscal year pursuant to \n     subsection (a) not less than 0.25 percent of the total amount \n     appropriated in the fiscal year for grants pursuant to \n     that subsection.\n       (e) Maximum Amount.--A qualifying State or unit of local \n     government may not receive more than 5 percent of the total \n     amount appropriated in each fiscal year for grants pursuant \n     to subsection (a).\n       (f) Matching Funds.--The portion of the costs of a program \n     provided by a grant under subsection (a) may not exceed 50 \n     percent, unless the Director of the Bureau of Justice \n     Assistance determines a case of fiscal hardship and waives, \n     wholly or in part, the requirement under this subsection of a \n     non-Federal contribution to the costs of a program.\n       (g) Allocation of Funds.--At least half of the funds \n     awarded under this program shall be allocated to units of \n     local government or Indian tribes with fewer than 100,000 \n     residents.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 170\n\n       Whereas past investments in biomedical research have \n     resulted in better health, an improved quality of life for \n     all Americans and a reduction in national health care \n     expenditures;\n       Whereas the Nation's commitment to biomedical research has \n     expanded the base of\n\n[[Page S235]]\n\n     scientific knowledge about health and disease and \n     revolutionized the practice of medicine;\n       Whereas the federal government represents the single \n     largest contributor to biomedical research conducted in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas biomedical research continues to play a vital role \n     in the growth of this Nation's biotechnology, medical device, \n     and pharmaceutical industries;\n       Whereas the origin of many of the new drugs and medical \n     devices currently in use is based in biomedical research \n     supported by the National Institutes of Health;\n       Whereas women have traditionally been underrepresented in \n     medical research protocols, yet are severely affected by \n     diseases including breast cancer, which will kill over 44,000 \n     women this year; ovarian cancer which will claim another \n     14,800 lives; and, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disorders;\n       Whereas research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health is responsible for the identification of genetic \n     mutations relating to nearly 100 diseases, including \n     Alzheimer's disease, cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, \n     osteoporosis, many forms of cancer, and immune deficiency \n     disorders;\n       Whereas many Americans still face serious and life-\n     threatening health problems, both acute and chronic;\n       Whereas neurodegenerative diseases of the elderly, such as \n     Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease threaten to destroy the \n     lives of millions of Americans, overwhelm the Nation's health \n     care system, and bankrupt the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n       Whereas 33 million Americans annually suffer from injuries \n     resulting from trauma;\n       Whereas 4 million Americans are currently infected with the \n     hepatitis C virus, an insidious liver condition that can lead \n     to inflammation, cirrhosis, and cancer as well as liver \n     failure;\n       Whereas 200,000 Americans are now suffering from AIDS and \n     hundreds of thousands more with HIV infection;\n       Whereas cancer remains a comprehensive threat to any tissue \n     or organ of the body at any age, and remains a top cause of \n     morbidity and morality;\n       Whereas the extent of psychiatric and neurological diseases \n     poses considerable challenges in understanding the workings \n     of the brain and nervous system;\n       Whereas recent advances in the treatment of HIV illustrate \n     the promise research holds for even more effective, \n     accessible, and affordable treatments for persons with HIV;\n       Whereas infants and children are the hope of our future, \n     yet they continue to be the most vulnerable and underserved \n     members of our society;\n       Whereas approximately one out of every five American men \n     will develop prostate cancer and over 40,000 men will die \n     from prostate cancer each year;\n       Whereas diabetes, both insulin and non-insulin forms, \n     afflict 16 million Americans and places them at risk for \n     acute and chronic complications, including blindness, kidney \n     failure, atherosclerosis and nerve degeneration;\n       Whereas the emerging understanding of the principles of \n     biomimetrics have been applied to the development of hard \n     tissue such as bone and teeth as well as soft tissue, and \n     this field of study holds great promise for the design of new \n     classes of biomaterials, pharmaceuticals, diagnostic and \n     analytical reagents;\n       Whereas research sponsored by the National Institutes of \n     Health will map and sequence the entire human genome by 2005, \n     leading to a new era of molecular medicine that will provide \n     unprecedented opportunities for the prevention, diagnoses, \n     treatment, and cure of diseases that currently plague \n     society;\n       Whereas the fundamental way science is conducted is \n     changing at a revolutionary pace, demanding a far greater \n     investment in emerging new technologies, research training \n     programs, and in developing new skills among scientific \n     investigators;\n       Whereas most Americans show overwhelming support for an \n     increased federal investment in biomedical research: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This resolution may be cited as the ``Biomedical \n     Revitalization Resolution of 1998''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that funding for the National \n     Institutes of Health should be increased by $2,000,000,000 in \n     fiscal year 1999 and that the budget resolution appropriately \n     reflect sufficient funds to achieve this objective.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today for the \npurpose of submitting a resolution calling for the Budget Committee to \nadd $2 billion for the National Institutes of Health, and I do so \nbecause of the unanimous view expressed by the Senate last year on a \nresolution that NIH funding should be doubled over the course of the 5 \nyears following the date of the introduction of the resolution by our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Mack. That resolution was introduced \non January 22, 1997. Regrettably, even though that resolution was \npassed 98 to nothing, when the budget resolution was returned, the \nappropriate health account has a reduction of $100 million. So that \neven though the Senate had spoken on its intent to see NIH funding \nraised, doubling over 5 years, and that was from a figure of about $13 \nbillion, the funds simply were not there. That led to the introduction \nof an amendment to the budget resolution by Senator Harkin and myself, \nSenator Harkin being my distinguished colleague and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee which I chair on Labor, Health, Human Services and \nEducation. And we sought to add in $1.1 billion to carry out the \nexpressed sense of the Senate. That was defeated 63 to 37. So that, \nwhile the Senate had expressed its druthers on a resolution, when it \ncame to the dollars they simply were not there.\n  Senator Harkin and I then went to work with our subcommittee and we \nwere able, by making economies and establishing priorities, to add $952 \nmillion to the NIH account for an increase of 7.5 percent. After the \nconference we did increase the figure by some $907 million, so that now \nthe National Institutes of Health has $13,647,843,000. And the National \nInstitutes of Health, I suggest to my colleagues, and the country--\nanybody who is watching on C-SPAN2--is the crown jewel of the Federal \nGovernment. The funding has been increased steadily during my tenure in \nthe Senate, regardless of who was chairing the subcommittee. Although \nthe budgets were always high, frequently had cuts called for by the \nadministration, when the chairman was Senator Weicker, when the \nchairman was Lawton Chiles, when the chairman was Tom Harkin, or more \nrecently under my chairmanship, we have increased the funding \ntremendously. And the National Institutes of Health has responded with \nreally extraordinary advances in research identifying genes. Now the \nwork has to be pushed forward to see exactly what can be accomplished \nin the next century.\n  The President said on Tuesday night that someone born today would \nhave a good chance of living into the 22nd century, 100 years. I think \nthat is a possibility. But only if we maintain the phenomenal advances \nof the NIH.\n  I personally have been the beneficiary of the tremendous advances of \nthe National Institutes of Health. Two decades ago there was no such \nthing as an MRI. That device detected a problem for me. And other \nadvances led to good results for me. I know millions of people have \nbenefited from the research and the investment which we have made in \nthe National Institutes of Health. But that takes money, and that is \nwhy this resolution is being offered by Senator Harkin, Senator Frist, \nSenator Reid, Senator Snowe and myself, to call upon the Budget \nCommittee to add in $2 billion so we can carry forward the important \nwork of the National Institutes of Health.\n  Last year I attended the dedication of a building named in honor of \nSenator Hatfield, who has been a tremendous leader on NIH, and many \nother items, the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nfor many years. When I was there, I talked to Dr. Varmus, who is the \nhead of NIH. I said, ``Dr. Varmus, what would it really take?'' As I \nasked Dr. Klausner, who heads the cancer research, ``Tell us what you \ncan really appropriately use?'' Because many grant applications are \nturned down. He said, ``Well, Senator, I can't really tell you that \nbecause we have to file the wish list with the Office of Management and \nBudget.'' He didn't quite put it that way. But there are limitations.\n  I said to Dr. Varmus, ``This year the Senate is going to want to know \nin an unvarnished form what you really think could be appropriately \nused for the National Institutes of Health.'' Then I made a comment \nthat we still have the subpoena power, to really find out what it would \ntake. And I suspect that it is a very large figure. But when you have a \nFederal budget of $1.7 trillion, I believe it is possible to establish \npriorities to make NIH a top priority.\n  In the last few years, Senator Harkin and I have consolidated and \neliminated 135 programs to enable us to save $1.5 billion. It's pretty \nhard to eliminate a program in Washington, DC, but we have been able to \ndo that. With that $1.5 billion we have allocated those funds to NIH, \nguaranteed student loans, and many, many other important projects.\n  So, with those brief comments I send this resolution to the desk. I \nask it be held at the desk. I ask my colleagues who are listening on C-\nSPAN2, or their\n\n[[Page S236]]\n\nstaffs, to take a look at the resolution because I would like to see \ncosponsors. I think we ought to have the 98 who voted last year for the \nresolution which I cosponsored with Senator Mack, and perhaps the two \nabsentees as well.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise in support of the \nresolution before us today to express the Sense of the Senate that the \nFederal commitment to biomedical research at the National Institutes of \nHealth is one of our highest priorities in fiscal year 1999. This \nresolution states that Congress should increase the NIH budget by $2 \nbillion next year.\n  I would like to commend my colleague, Senator Specter, for his \nleadership in bringing this resolution forward today to ensure our \ncommitment to biomedical research. I was an original cosponsor with \nSenator Mack of similar legislation, Senate Resolution 15, introduced \non the first day of the 105th Congress. The ``Biomedical Research \nCommitment Resolution of 1997,'' expressed the Sense of the Senate that \nthe NIH budget should be doubled over the next five years. The \nresolution before us today puts us one step closer to achieving that \ngoal.\n  I have struggled with the effort to balance the budget and preserve a \nstrong federal role in biomedical research during times of fiscal \nrestraint. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, it will be my \ngoal to increase the NIH budget within the context of the overall \nbudget agreement reached by Congress last year.\n  Historically, Congress has demonstrated strong support for increased \nfunding for the important work of the National Institutes of Health. \nThe scientific and medical breakthroughs supported by the National \nInstitutes of Health in the last 50 years have improved vastly our \ncapacity to prevent, diagnose, and treat human disease. As a heart and \nlung transplant surgeon, I know that biomedical research is \nfundamentally important in our battle against disease. As Americans, we \nhave the benefit of one of the finest health care systems in the world, \nand it is vital that we continue to invest in our research efforts to \nmaintain this health care system.\n  As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety \nwith jurisdiction over the NIH, I believe that one of the federal \ngovernment's primary duties is to ensure our investment in long-term \nbiomedical research as a public good. The commitment to this investment \nallows us to reap many benefits in improving the quality of life for \nour citizens. It is in this spirit that I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support the passage of this resolution in \nrecognition that the future of our nation's health is dependent on our \nstrong investment in biomedical research.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S234-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S236]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n                      committee on armed services\n\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of Senator Dodd's legislation, the ``Cuban Women and Children \nHumanitarian Relief Act.''\n  This bill, which is long overdue, authorizes the President to permit \nthe sale of food, medicine, and medical equipment to the Cuban people. \nOne would think that this would not be necessary. The United States has \na long history of providing humanitarian assistance to needy people \neven when we differ with their government. North Korea is an example. \nYet, because of our obsessive antipathy toward Fidel Castro, we have \napplied a different standard to Cuba. Unfortunately, it is the Cuban \npeople who have suffered as a result, not their government. In fact, it \nhas given Fidel Castro a convenient excuse to blame the United States \nfor whatever goes wrong there.\n  The American Association for World Health reports that malnutrition, \ndeterioration of water quality, and serious deficiencies in medicines, \nequipment and medical information have resulted from American \nrestrictions severely limit the sale of medicines they actually \nprohibit the sale of food. Not even the sanctions against Libya, Iran, \nand Iraq contain such extreme measures. This outright ban on food has \nbeen especially harmful to women and children, contributing to \nnutritional deficits among pregnant women and low birth-weight babies, \nas well as a high incidence of neurological disease.\n  I have long believed that the way to encourage democratic reforms and \nrespect for human rights in Cuba is not through isolation of this tiny \nisland nation, but through the normalization of our relationship by \nrelaxing the embargo. One would think that after thirty-seven years, \nwith Castro still in power, we would try another approach. Many \nAmericans share this view. Over $60 million in medicine and medical \nsupplies have been donated by U.S. citizens over the past five years. \nUnfortunately, this great display of generosity represents only a tiny \nportion of the over $400 million in medicines and food that Cuba \nimported from the United States prior to the passage of the restrictive \n1992 Cuban Democracy Act.\n  I urge all Members of Congress to reconsider the reasons behind our \nembargo against Cuba. The Cold War ended years ago. Easing the \nrestrictions on the sale and donation of medicines and food to Cuba \nwill not, in any way, compromise our nation's security. While Pope John \nPaul's visit may not signal a political change in Cuba, it does \nillustrate a new opening by the Castro regime for religious expression \nthat the United States should encourage. Passage of the Cuban Women and \nChildren Humanitarian Relief Act would not only ease the suffering of \nthe Cuban population, it would reaffirm to the world that the United \nStates is the humanitarian nation we hold ourselves out to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S236-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S236-S237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO CHARLES H. CUFFELD\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a \ndistinguished public servant upon his retirement as President Judge of \nthe Philadelphia Traffic Court. Born and raised in Philadelphia, \nCharles Cuffeld devoted his life to the city. Charles will be sincerely \nmissed not only for the vision and leadership he brought to his office, \nbut also for his integrity and character.\n\n[[Page S237]]\n\n  On December 24, 1991, Governor Robert Casey appointed Charles \nPresident Judge of the Philadelphia Traffic Court. Charles became the \nfirst African-American President Judge to serve in either the Traffic \nCourt or the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Prior to this appointment, \nhe had served as an elected Traffic Court judge since 1982.\n  Early in his tenure, President Judge Cuffeld established goals to \nimprove the Court's productivity, increase public accessibility, and \nfoster public respect for the law. Most would agree that great strides \nwere achieved in each of these areas. For instance, President Judge \nCuffeld modernized the Court's operations. Internal communication was \nenhanced through technological improvements. A clear chain of command \nwas established for the Traffic Court departments. Supervisors were \neducated on personnel regulations. Several departments were \nreorganized, and employees were cross-trained in all departments. Even \nthe judges were sent to annual training and recertification programs. \nLikewise, the Traffic Court under President Judge Cuffeld developed \nworking relationships with other law enforcement agencies, \ninterdepartmental units, and the local media. Other initiatives made \nTraffic Court more accessible. Expanded payment operations, night \ncourt, motion court, and outreach court, in which surrounding \nneighborhood police stations hosted Traffic Court, were among these \nimportant programs. Finally, President Judge Cuffeld strengthened \ntraffic law enforcement programs. In fact, some initiatives have been \nso successful that Canadian and other foreign officials have expressed \ninterest in duplicating them.\n  Beyond his judicial service, Charles has participated in many \ncommunity-oriented organizations. He has served on the Mayor's Office \nof Community Services Advisory Board and the Boy Scouts Unity District \nCouncil. Currently, Charles is a member of the Salvation Army Advisory \nBoard and a Director of Concerned Black Men, Inc. I am also very proud \nto note that Charles serves on my own Military Academy Review Board.\n  An even more revealing testament of Charles' commitment to public \nservice is the fact that organizations across the political and \nideological spectrum have honored him. Both the V.F.W. and the \nN.A.A.C.P. named him Man of the Year. For outstanding community \nservice, he received a Congressional Certificate of Merit. He is a two-\ntime recipient of the Governor of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \nHighway Safety Award. WCAU-TV Channel 10 presented him the Spirit of \nPhiladelphia News Award. He has received a Certificate of Appreciation \nfrom the Philadelphia Police Department. Finally, Charles has also been \nhonored with the North Philadelphia Youth Investment Award.\n  In closing, Mr. President, Charles Cuffeld set a new standard for the \nPhiladelphia Traffic Court. He worked to raise awareness of the law, to \nenforce the law, and to bring justice to the people. During his tenure \nas President Judge, Charles bought the same passion for the law to his \nwork as an administrator. He skillfully modernized the court, handled \npersonnel matters, ensured his judges kept up to date on legal \ndevelopments, and improved communication operations. Equally important \nis the care and compassion he has shown for the community. Charles is \nthe product of hard work, focused determination, and a strong sense of \ncivic responsibility. He is a fine role model for those who have been \nfortunate enough to know him. As President Judge Charles Cuffeld \nretires from public life, I ask my colleagues to join me in extending \nthe Senate's best wishes to him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S236-3", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TOUGH, SMART WOMEN WORKING TO BETTER IRAN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has been almost twenty years since the \noverthrow of the Shah of Iran and the year-long ordeal of the American \nhostages in Tehran. The U.S. swiftly responded to those incidents by \nisolating Iran diplomatically, militarily, and economically. Today our \npolicy of isolation continues.\n  The U.S. has legitimate, serious concerns about the Iranian \nGovernment's support for international terrorism, its efforts to \nundermine the Arab-Israeli peace process, and its acquisition of \nweapons of mass destruction. We must continue to vigorously pressure \nIran to modify its conduct in each of these areas.\n  However, rather than adhere blindly to all aspects of a policy that \nwas conceived in response to events in 1979, it is time to reevaluate \nour relationship with Iran and its people and consider the advantages \nthat might result from a more open dialogue.\n  Too often our antagonism toward Iran obscures the fact that many \nIranian citizens desire better relations with the United States. On \nJanuary 7, 1998 Iranian President Mohammad Khatemi said in an interview \nwith CNN that he wanted people-to-people exchanges to ``crack the wall \nof mistrust'' between the United States and Iran. A December 10, 1997 \narticle in the ``International Herald Tribune'' by Ms. Catherine \nO'Neill, who recently visited Iran on behalf of UNICEF, entitled, \n``Tough, Smart Women, Working to Better Iran,'' illustrates that there \nare many similarities between us and the Iranian people and that \ncitizens of both countries could benefit from the regular sharing of \nideas and academic and professional advances if only the opportunity \nwere there.\n  Mr. President, I ask that excerpts from Ms. O'Neill's article be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The excerpts follow:\n\n                [From the Herald Tribune, Dec. 10, 1997]\n\n               Tough, Smart Women, Working to Better Iran\n\n                         (By Catherine O'Neill)\n\n       Tehran.--Somehow I had always felt that women who adopted \n     the chador had shut me out. That black cloak seemed a way of \n     saying: ``Don't approach! My values are different.''\n       A recent visit to Iran has proved how wrong I was. It also \n     has taught me something about not imposing my values on \n     tough, smart women who are working to make changes in their \n     country.\n       At the invitation of Unicef, I went to Tehran to attend a \n     conference on the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. \n     The conference was organized by a group of Iranian women who \n     want to change some of Iran's laws affecting children and \n     women.\n       Almost no non-Iranians were present in the hotel ballroom \n     as several hundred chador-clad women, and some men, \n     discussed, debated and criticized aspects of Iran's laws.\n       One speaker criticized Iranian companies that profit from \n     cheap child labor.\n       Another talked about the illogic of a 30-year-old woman \n     professor's being unable to choose a spouse without the \n     approval of a father or grandfather--while a 15-year-old boy \n     needs no approval to get married.\n       Speakers noted Iran's effective village health care \n     programs, universal immunization for children and the high \n     percentage of girls and boys attending school.\n       But the speakers wanted more for Iran's children and women.\n       During breaks, women approached me to talk. They were \n     doctors, lawyers, teachers, psychologists, professors, child \n     education experts and mothers. We cared about the same \n     things: drug abuse among young people, child custody issues, \n     child abuse, juvenile delinquency, homeless children, foster \n     care and child labor.\n       My experiences in Iran should not be so rare for Americans. \n     A new generation has arrived and almost two decades have \n     passed since the hostage crisis of 1979-80. The United States \n     is the only major power with no contact with Iran. But the \n     Iranian people have given a signal: They voted in a new \n     president against the recommendations of their religious \n     leaders.\n       It's time for us in the United States to reach out to the \n     70 million children, men and women in Iran, who, I've found, \n     have much in common with us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S237-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S237-S238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL RADIO MONTH\n\n   Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the role \nof the radio broadcasting community in my home state of Minnesota. I \ncannot think of a more appropriate time to reflect upon how radio \naffects our daily lives than during ``National Radio Month.''\n  This year marks the 78th anniversary of radio in the United States. \nThroughout this time, radio has become an influential medium in the \nlives of most Americans. Today, there are over 12,200 radios in the \nU.S. According to the Radio Advertising Bureau, people listen to radio \nan average of 3 hours and 12 minutes on weekdays, and 4 hours and 42 \nminutes on weekends. Four out of five motorists are listening to the \nradio while driving, and 61.7 percent are tuned into radio during TV's \nprime-time hours.\n  As a former broadcaster, I certainly understand the extraordinary \ninfluence\n\n[[Page S238]]\n\nand unselfish nature of radio. Radio broadcasts serve a variety of \npurposes. Radio communicates with listeners during time of emergency, \ninforms them of noteworthy community events such as fundraising drives, \neducates them about developing stories and current events, entertains \nduring long drives across our states, and serves as a calming influence \nduring the most trying times in our lives. Finally, radio plays a key \nrole in preserving our vibrant democracy by encouraging their audiences \nto vote, and running special segments about candidates and their \nplatforms.\n  The public affairs activities of Minnesota's radio stations have been \nunderscored by a recent Minnesota Broadcasters Association survey of \nradio executives in which 50 percent of radio stations responded. \nFirst, 95 percent of radio stations have helped charities, charitable \ncauses or needy individuals through fundraising and other types of \nsupport. Second, radio stations run a median of 100 public service \nannouncements each week, highlighting issues such as flood and disaster \nrelief efforts, AIDS awareness, safety campaigns, drunk driving, and \ndrug and crime education programs. Finally, 71 percent of radio \nstations aired a local political affairs program or segment dealing \nwith the 1996 elections.\n  Mr. President, there are 242 radio stations in Minnesota. Each of \nthese stations has made unique and vital contributions toward serving \ntheir communities and interacting with listeners. I am proud to say \nthat in some instances, these efforts have been recognized by the \nMinnesota Broadcasters Association through their ``Media Best Awards'' \nand by the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) annual ``Crystal \nRadio Awards.''\n  The ``Crystal Radio Awards'' have been issued by NAB since 1987 to \nshine the national spotlight on those radio stations that have \ndemonstrated a year-round commitment to providing responsive, \nindividual service to the cities, counties and towns they serve. I am \npleased to note that since 1989, Minnesota radio stations have received \nthis great honor on eleven different occasions. These stations are \nWJON-AM in St. Cloud, KBHP-FM in Bedmidji (twice), KSJN-FM in St. Paul, \nWWTC-AM, WCCO-AM, KQRS-FM/AM in Minneapolis (twice), KCUE-AM in Red \nWing, KWOA-AM in Worthington, and WLTE-FM in Minneapolis.\n  The Minnesota Broadcasters Association recently recognized public \nservice announcements broadcast by KAUS and KDWB, the ``Flood of '97'' \ncommunity service program by KDMA/KMGM, and MNN Radio Networks hard \nnews coverage during this past years' floods which disrupted the lives \nof hundreds of thousands of Minnesotans. And for those fans who have \nagonized over a potential departure of our beloved Twins, WMNN provided \nan important venue for people to voice their opinions through the \nstation's ``Twins Stadium Open Forum.''\n  Additional past noteworthy accomplishments include efforts by WJON-AM \nand its two sister stations in St. Cloud to raise money to buy \nbulletproof vests for the police departments. Its goal was $50,000, but \nultimately raised $75,000. And stations 92 KQRS-FM and 93.7 KEGE-FM in \nMinneapolis have worked with Minnesota Job Services to set up a free \ninteractive telephone hotline to connect employers with qualified \napplicants. Amazingly, this service registers 10,000 calls each month. \nLast year, Minnesota radio and television stations raised $1.6 million \nfor flood relief efforts and produced a video titled ``Beyond the \nFlood'' donating the profits to flood victims.\n  Through disaster relief efforts, holiday safety initiatives, fund-\nraising drives, school announcements, and weather emergencies, \nMinnesota radio broadcasters have demonstrated their commitment and \ndedication to public service. I am proud of the leadership shown by \neach of these stations, and am pleased to have shared their \naccomplishments with the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S237-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S238]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH DAKOTA MEN'S CROSS COUNTRY TEAM WINS NATIONAL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n   Mr. JOHNSON.

The University of South \nDakota Men's Cross Country Team recently won the 1997 NCAA Division II \nMen's Cross Country Championship held on Saturday, November 22, 1997 in \nKenosha, Wisconsin.

Mr. President, today's New York Times has \nconfirmed what many on the forefront of fixing the Year 2000 Computer \nProblem have already learned. Namely, that the problem is not just a \nprogramming glitch within software (programs run on the computer), but \na larger crisis of identifying and renovating hardware (the computer \nitself).\n  As the Times story relates: ``The problem was first thought to be a \nprogramming glitch. But as the F.A.A. is demonstrating, the line \nbetween hardware and software is not so clear, because of computer \ninstructions, called micro-code, that are built in and are more basic \nthan the programs the computer runs. In some instances, the answer may \nbe the wholesale replacement of computers that might otherwise have run \nfor years. Early indications are that many airlines will also throw out \nnumerous computers.''\n  Like many private sector businesses, the FAA is finding that it may \nhave to replace the interrelated computer systems themselves--in this \ncase, systems that provide for the safety of air flight in America. \nWhile some programmers at the FAA believe the systems can be debugged \nwithout replacing them, the company which built the hardware,\n\n[[Page S239]]\n\nIBM, has recommended replacing the machines.\n  There is a lesson to be learned here. Consultants confronted with \nthis problem have told me this all along. The problem is deeper than \nthe programs. It deals with the micro-code beneath the programs. This \nmicro-code is in everything from our telecommunications systems to the \npersonal computer on your desk--essentially the infrastructure of the \ncompany or agency.\n  Thus, we peel back another layer of the onion. The FAA is taking \nmultiple approaches to its fix: a combination of debugging and \nreplacement. On the one hand, debugging old systems risks that they \nwon't be fully tested until after the year 2000. On the other hand, \nreplacing them costs millions upon millions. When the maker of the \nmachines--in this case IBM--recommends replacement, and a failed effort \nto debug the machines could mean lives lost in air accidents across the \ncountry, I would prefer we lean heavily on the replacement approach.\n  With fewer than two years until January 1, 2000, this lesson must be \nlearned quickly and throughout the Federal Government. A few Chief \nInformation Officers who are ahead of the curve on this issue are \nsimilarly discovering they not only have to fix the application codes, \nbut they also have to make their infrastructure--telecommunication \nsystems, micro-computers, and electrical components--year 2000 \ncompliant.\n  In the few months ahead, agencies must be ready and willing to admit \nthe extent of their problems, and find solutions that will be balanced \nbetween debugging and replacement. At the same time, we in Congress \nmust be ready and willing to assist agencies in what is beginning to \nlook a lot like a matter of damage control.\n  I ask that today's Times article, ``F.A.A. to Fix and Replace Aging \nComputers,'' be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 29, 1998]\n\n               F.A.A. to Fix and Replace Aging Computers\n\n                          (By Matthew L. Wald)\n\n       Washington, Jan. 28--The Federal Aviation Administration \n     said today that it would hunt down and remove the ``year \n     2000'' bugs from 40 crucial, aging air traffic control \n     computers, and then throw out the computers themselves.\n       One team at the F.A.A. has promised to have the bugs fixed \n     within 90 days. The leader of a second team announced today \n     that the agency would replace the computers anyway, at a cost \n     of about $100 million, because of uncertainty over whether \n     the software changes can ever be tested adequately. But since \n     there is also uncertainty over whether all the computers can \n     be replaced within the next 23 months, the de-bugging will \n     continue.\n       Around the world, the issue, known in data processing as \n     ``Y2K,'' is perplexing companies because computers that \n     record the date as a 2-digit number will conclude that the \n     year after 1999 is 1900.\n       The problem was first thought to be a programming glitch. \n     But as the F.A.A. is demonstrating, the line between hardware \n     and software is not so clear, because of computer \n     instructions, called micro-code, that are built in and are \n     more basic than the programs the computer runs.\n       In some instances, the answer may be the wholesale \n     replacement of computers that might otherwise have run for \n     years. Early indications are that many airlines will also \n     throw out numerous computers.\n       George L. Donohue, associate administrator of the F.A.A. \n     for research and acquisitions, said, ``Some of the software \n     people now say that even if you think you've fixed all the \n     micro-code, there's no way to be sure.''\n       But, speaking today at an air traffic control conference, \n     Dr. Donohue said that trying simultaneously to de-bug the \n     system and replace it was a good ``belt and suspenders \n     approach,'' because it was impossible to be sure the F.A.A. \n     could replace the aging computers in the next 23 months.\n       Drucella Andersen, a spokeswoman for the agency, said, \n     ``We're trying to do both because it gives us the highest \n     assurance and insurance.''\n       Just last week the F.A.A. invited reporters to tour a ``war \n     room'' where a team of software engineers is coordinating the \n     de-bugging of 297 interrelated computer systems that make up \n     the National Airspace System.\n       The machines are at the heart of the 20 air traffic control \n     centers that handle high-altitude, long-distance flights, and \n     officials said they were confident that their replacement \n     would not be necessary. The software changes are projected to \n     cost $91 million, and involve 22 million lines of software.\n       The International Business Machines Corporation, which made \n     the computers, warned the F.A.A. last fall that it no longer \n     had the engineers or software tools to find the bugs, and \n     recommended replacing the machines.\n       Dr. Donohue said the computers were about 14 years old, \n     which he termed old by the standards of private industry but \n     young for the F.A.A.\n       The agency's budget does not include the estimated $100 \n     million to replace the computers, but officials said they \n     could delay other modernization projects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S238-3", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S239]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONDEMNING IRAQ'S THREAT TO INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the crisis in Iraq has been created because \nof the appalling behavior of a man bent on defying the legitimate \ndirectives he agreed to as the defeated leader of a ruthless and rogue \narmy. For months, if not years, Saddam Hussein has been developing and \nhiding the very weapons he explicitly vowed to excise from his \ncountry's arsenal. These are weapons which he has demonstrated the will \nto use and which, in a slightly more sophisticated delivery system, may \nthreaten the entire world. He has starved his people in order to gain \nsympathy from a compassionate world community, he has gassed his own \ncitizens to silence their cries for freedom, he has ruthlessly attacked \nhis neighbors, massacring thousands through chemical warfare, and he \nhas threatened to incinerate an entire people of a neighboring \nsovereign nation.\n  This crisis needs to be ingrained into our psyche as a case study of \nhow a bellicose and unrepentant government can circumvent its \nobligations to the world community and world peace, and avoid the \nreasonable consequences for those actions. Even more so, this is an \nobject lesson of how our ``allies'' will respond to such behavior. They \nseem willing to curry favor with a dictator by compromising and \nredefining critical enforcement procedures. Compromise? What is there \nto compromise? Saddam has broken his covenant with the world. We know \nit. The world knows it, and our collective governments have been \nineffectual in dealing with him. To the President and the leaders of \nthe other nations of the world, I ask three very basic questions and \ngive you three very basic ``heartland of America'' responses.\n  First, has Saddam honored his commitment to the world in freely and \nopenly ridding Iraq of weapons of mass destruction? No.\n  Second, will he? Not if we don't have the courage to force him, with \nextreme prejudice to his military, if necessary.\n  And third, is he more dangerous today than yesterday because of a \nbasic weakness and willingness to compromise something which should be \nenforced without compromise? And that answer is, yes he is more \ndangerous.\n  We have wasted critical time. We have allowed Saddam the opportunity \nto develop the very things he has sworn not to and the very things we \nswore we wouldn't permit. The current situation must not continue. We \nmust and I believe we can, convince a nervous and wary cadre of allied \nnations to stand up for what is right and what is demanded to preserve \nthe stability of the world. But if not Mr. President we may have to go \nit alone or with but a few courageous colleagues from the league of \nnations.\n  I am sure we will support the President's decision for decisive \naction, whatever it may be. Therefore, I join with the majority and \nminority leaders of this great body and ask that they would consider \nadding me to the list of co-sponsors of their concurrent resolution \nnumber 71 concerning the current crisis in Iraq.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S239-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S239-S240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VIOLENT AND REPEAT JUVENILE OFFENDER ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about \njuvenile crime legislation pending before the Senate. The ``Violent and \nRepeat Juvenile Offender Act,'' S.10, was reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee last year and may be among the bills we consider early in \nthis session. While the measure was improved during the course of the \nJudiciary Committee markup, unfortunately, as explained more fully in \nthe minority views to the Committee report, there is much work that \nstill needs to be done and much that still needs to be improved.\n  The bill reported by the Committee to the Senate would mandate \nmassive changes in the juvenile justice systems in each of our States, \nand would allow an influx of juvenile cases in Federal courts around \nthe country. The repercussions of this legislation would be severe for \nany State seeking federal juvenile justice assistance.\n\n[[Page S240]]\n\n  I look forward to the Senate taking up these matters and to a full \nand open debate on exactly what this bill will do. Those aspects that \nwill do more harm than good ought to be rejected. Those aspects that \ncan be improved, should be. Those aspects that fail to respect the role \nand judgment of the States, their legislatures and their people ought \nbe changed. This can only be done if the Senate is willing to do the \nwork still unfinished and do so in our greatest tradition of full, fair \nand open debate.\n  Washington Does Not Know Best. I am very concerned about the \nstringent mandates with which States must comply before they qualify \nfor the $500 million per year in new funding under S.10. This new block \ngrant program sounds great until you look closely. The extensive new \nrequirements created by this program make this money inaccessible to \nthe States. In fact, no State currently qualifies for the new grant \nmoney. Consequently, while this bill is touted as helping the nation's \njuvenile justice systems, States that accept the help will have to \nsurrender their State legislative judgment and change their laws to \ncomport with Washington mandates.\n  For example, to qualify for this new source of funds, States would \nhave to change their laws to ensure, for example, that they make \naccessible to the FBI all juvenile disposition or adjudication records, \nwhether the juvenile was brought in for shoplifting, graffiti or more \nserious felonies. In addition, the States must make sure they make \nthose records available, not only to elementary or high schools in \nwhich the juvenile is enrolled, but also to any college to which the \njuvenile may later apply. Many of our home States will find these \nrequirements too intrusive and costly to make it worth their while to \nchange their laws.\n  We Should Avoid the ``Federalization'' of Juvenile Crime. By imposing \non the States a one-size-fits-all approach to juvenile crime, this bill \nturns federalism on its head. As reported, S.10 would repeal the \npresumption in current Federal law that the State has primary \nresponsibility for dealing with juvenile offenders. Changing that \npresumption to get the federal government and the federal courts \ninvolved is neither necessary nor wise.\n  Chief Justice Rehnquist and the Administrative Office of the U.S. \nCourts have expressed serious concerns about the efforts in S.10 to \nshift juveniles to the federal court system. As the Chief Justice noted \nin his 1997 Year-End Report:\n\n       The Judicial Conference of the United States has raised \n     concerns about legislation pending in Congress to \n     `federalize' certain juvenile crimes, maintaining its \n     longstanding position that federal prosecutions should be \n     limited to those offenses that cannot or should not be \n     prosecuted in state courts.\n\n  The Chief Justice clearly recognizes what so many other law \nenforcement and court personnel know: The federal courts are not \nequipped to handle the expected increase in federal juvenile cases if \nS.10 is not modified.\n  We should preserve the core protections for juveniles in custody. \nRegrettably, S.10 would gut the core protections that have been in \nplace for over 20 years to protect children who come in contact with \nthe criminal justice system and to keep abused, neglected and \nmistreated children out of detention altogether. Every Vermonter who \nhas contacted me about this issue has said the same thing: dismantling \nthese core protections is an ill-conceived move.\n  Back-sliding on the protections against putting children in adult \njails flies in the face of research showing that children who spend \ntime around bad influences, like adult criminals, have a higher \nrecidivism rate. The co-chair of Vermont's Children and Family Council \nfor Prevention Programs has explained: ``If even intermittent contact \nis allowed, youth will certainly learn more and better ways to act out \ninappropriately and aggressively.''\n  We should focus on prevention. Right now, S.10 lacks balance. The \nbill is chock full of punitive measures to prosecute and lock-up \nchildren, but skimps on efforts to stop children from getting into \ntrouble in the first place. Focusing on the back end of the juvenile \njustice system--after children get into trouble--is short-sighted. Any \npolice chief or cop-on-the-beat will tell you that. We should also \nfocus efforts on preventing kids from getting into trouble and \nintervening at the first warning signs before they enter into criminal \nactivity.\n  I have heard from numerous law enforcement officials who support a \nclear earmark for juvenile delinquency prevention programs. They know \nthat prevention programs are key to reducing our Nation's juvenile \ncrime rates. This bill earmarks new federal grant money for a number of \nenforcement uses, including increasing sanctions, improving juvenile \nrecord keeping, mandating drug testing, and juvenile prison \nconstruction. No earmark is made for prevention. This is a mistake and \nwill turn out to be a costly one unless we can modify the bill to bring \nit into balance. If we are going to have earmarks, we must dedicate \nmoney for prevention. Prevention programs enhance the skills and \ncompetency of troubled juveniles. Such programs help teenagers stay in \nschool and stay out of trouble. Without an earmark, in the competition \nfor dollars, prevention programs will surely lose out.\n  I urge my colleagues to talk to the police and prosecutors in their \nhome states. I am confident you will hear, as I have, that well-crafted \ncrime prevention and youth development programs do make a difference. I \nam also sure that you will hear how critical it is to keep juveniles \nseparate from adult inmates and to allow teenagers who have committed a \nminor offense a real chance to improve their lives.\n  We should work together in an open and bipartisan manner to consider \nand improve this juvenile crime legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S239-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SALUTE TO RON WILSON AND THE 1998 UNITED STATES OLYMPIC HOCKEY TEAM\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the 1998 United States Olympic Team will \nsoon depart for Nagano, Japan for the 18th Winter Olympic Games. I know \nI join my colleagues in saluting the American men and women who have \nworked so hard to compete at this highest level of international \ncompetition.\n  I rise today to salute a son of Rhode Island, Ron Wilson, who will \nserve as head coach of the American Men's Hockey team. Hockey is not a \nsport in Rhode Island, it is a passion. That passion enabled Ron Wilson \nto achieve All-Star status at East Providence High School, and two-time \nAll-American honors at Providence College, where, as a senior, he led \nthe nation in scoring. His college coach, coincidentally, is also a \nRhode Islander. Then-coach Lou Lamoriello is now president of the New \nJersey Devils and will also serve as general manager of the U.S. \nOlympic Men's Hockey team.\n  Ron Wilson went on to a successful professional playing career in the \nNational Hockey League and Europe. Today, he is the very successful \ncoach of the local entry in the National Hockey League, the Washington \nCapitals. He is well equipped to lead our team next month in Japan, \nhaving successfully coached the U.S. Team in the 1996 World Cup to a \nmajor upset of Canada to win that prestigious competition. The victory \nwas the biggest win for the United States since the 1980 Winter \nOlympics.\n  Hockey is, as I said, a passion in Rhode Island. Indeed, Coach Wilson \nwill look down his bench and see three other Rhode Islanders on his \nteam - Bryan Berard, Keith Carney, and Matthew Schneider. And the U.S. \nWomen's Hockey team will include a majority of players who played their \nhigh school or college hockey in Rhode Island.\n  The Nagano Games will soon begin, and I extend the heartiest best \nwishes for success to Coach Wilson, his fellow Rhode Islanders, and all \nAmericans wearing our uniform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S240-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S240-S241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STEVEN N. ADUBATO\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to extend my best \nwishes to Stephen N. Adubato on his 65th birthday. Steve's belief in \nhis community and dedication to improving the education standards in \nNew Jersey are just two examples of his lifelong commitment to public \nservice. On his birthday, I would like to convey my thoughts to a good \nfriend and valued colleague.\n  As the founder and Executive Director of the North Ward Center, Inc., \nhe has created a central location for more\n\n[[Page S241]]\n\nthan fifteen social service, community education and economic \ndevelopment programs for the Newark community. With the recent opening \nof the Newark Business Training Institute, Steve has continued his \ncommitment to the community by assisting men and women in the \ntransition from welfare to work.\n  Steve has made innumerable contributions to the education of New \nJersey students. As a teacher and counselor in Newark, his leadership \nin education reform and superior teaching skills insured that children \nreceived the kind of education they deserved. Steve's commitment to \neducation is a true testament to his compassion and desire to help \nstudents in the State of New Jersey.\n  As we search for ways to revitalize the once flourishing city of \nNewark, I have been impressed by Steve's ideas and goals for the area. \nThe economic and social progress we have seen in Newark's North Ward is \na direct result of Steve's efforts. He has single-handedly improved \nthis area of the city so that it now serves as a model for urban \ndevelopment. This is a great deal to have accomplished in 65 short \nyears, but Steve is clearly no stranger to hard work.\n  Steve Adubato's dedication to the Newark community and the State of \nNew Jersey make it an honor for me to be able to recognize him as he \ncelebrates his birthday. I wish him the best on this special day, and I \nhope he will enjoy 65 more years of happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S240-2", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            70TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE INVENTION OF SCOTCH TAPE\n\n Mr. GRAMS.

And as with Scotch tape, society \nwonders how we ever got along without them.\n  So on January 31, we will be recognizing the achievements of Richard \nDrew's achievements, but we also honor the spirit of ingenuity he \nsparked for all of 3M's employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/01/29/senate-section/article/S241-1", "month": "01", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "29", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
