Mr. President, today will be a defining day in \nWashington, DC. It will be a defining day in the Congress of the United \nStates. More specifically, it will be a defining day in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  This is a day on which we will make very important decisions, \ndecisions that will reflect whether or not we believe that government--\ninvasive, bigger, stronger, more consumptive government--is something \nto be fostered and encouraged, or we are going to say that we believe \nthe people have the ability to make good decisions on their own and \nthat we will not promote a government which will take more and more \nfrom the people, leaving them with less and less, not only in terms of \nresources but leaving them with less and less freedom.\n  We are going to be talking about the so-called tobacco bill today, \nwhich unfortunately is more of a smokescreen for a tax increase and big \ngovernment than it is anything else.\n  The Democrats have rightly suggested, have appropriately stated, that \nthe fate of this bill really rests in the hands of Republicans. And I \nbelieve that those of us who are on the Republican side of this Senate \nwill make decisions, and we will either decide to pass this massive tax \nincrease, to pass and institute this set of bureaucracies, the scale of \nwhich has not been seen in a long time in a bill in Washington, DC--we \nwill either decide to pass an invasive sort of intermeddling by the \nFederal Government in a wide variety of the affairs of individuals, or \nwe will decide that we believe that the appropriate action is not to \ntax the American people with another $868 billion in tax, is not to \ncreate 17 new boards, commissions, and agencies to try to micromanage \neverything from convenience stores and gas stations up to grocery \nstores and larger institutions that sell merchandise.\n  But the Democrats are right in suggesting that the decision will be \nmade on the Republican side of the aisle. We will make a decision about \nwhether or not to go forward with the tobacco bill, the smokescreen for \nthe world's biggest tax increase this year. I don't know of any \nproposed tax increase this year that can match this proposed tax \nincrease. And the direction we take will be a test of the way in which \nwe lead, and it will be a test of the Republican leadership of the \nSenate.\n  Republican leadership has a responsibility to lead to Republican \nideals and call us to our highest and best as people, and to give us \nthe opportunity to be responsible as individuals and to shrink the size \nof government, not to\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\nexpand it, to leave resources in the hands of the people, not sweep \nthem into the coffers of government.\n  Our leadership has called upon Don Nickles to manage this bill \nbecause the leader of the Republicans and the leader of the Senate has \nrecused himself in large measure from this consideration. I thank \nSenator Nickles for his outstanding efforts in this respect. I want to \ncommend him for his opposition to this kind of invasion into the lives \nand pocketbooks of Americans and invasion into the liberties of \nAmericans.\n  I want to commend him for his understanding that this is a bill about \nbig government and big taxes, not a bill about teen smoking. I think he \nhas understood from the very beginning that lots of things that might \nbe done to curtail teen smoking aren't even mentioned. There is not \neven a whiff or a hint; there is not even the smoke that would follow \nthe evidence of that kind of item in the bill. This is not a bill that \nmakes the possession of tobacco by teens illegal, or provides \nincentives to do the same, or makes illegal the possession of tobacco \nby people in the District of Columbia.\n  If we are really serious about curtailing teen smoking, we might just \nsay to the teens, ``You can't have it if it is that evil and that \ninappropriate.'' We have done that with alcohol. We have provided lots \nof ways in which we provide incentives from the Federal Government for \nStates and others to make sure that young people do not have access to \nalcohol. That is not a part of this bill.\n  Don Nickles has understood this bill, I believe, as a massive tax \nincrease, a big-government explosion, which I think is appropriate in \nterms of the identification. I want to commend him for his leadership \nhere.\n  There is a choice to be made in this bill, and the choice is simple: \nIs the Senate going to return to tax and spend? Is it going to identify \nitself with the history of the Congress when it was under Democratic \ncontrol and authority that the way we handle America is to tax more and \nspend more and tax more and spend more? Are we going to extend the line \nof taxation and spending beyond where it already is?\n  It is important to note where we have come. We have not just arrived \nat a place where we are taxing and spending. We have arrived at a place \nwhere we are now taxing and spending more than we have ever taxed and \nspent in the history of the United States of America. Governments take \nmore of the income of Americans at this time in history than ever \nbefore. We have to ask ourselves as we look behind the smokescreen of \nthis so-called tobacco bill to see what the real components are. And we \nfind $868 billion--$868 billion--in new taxes. That is not million \ndollars, that is billion dollars. This is massive, three-quarters of a \ntrillion dollars plus in new taxes. We have to ask ourselves, do we \nwant to extend tax and spend, or do we want to decide that we don't \nbelieve that government, with its invasive micromanaging of the lives \nof individuals and its invasive confiscation of the resources of the \nindividuals--we have to decide, do we really want that to be the way in \nwhich we operate?\n  This is a defining moment for the Republican-controlled Senate. How \nwill we respond to this question which is squarely before us today? Are \nwe going to be tax-and-spend respecting government, or are we going to \nsay to the American people we protect the people more than we respect \ngovernment?\n  We are not going to allow government to come and sweep out of the \nresources and freedom of American citizens the kind of resources that \nare provided for in this bill.\n  I think we need to look forward to an era of lower taxes. I think we \nneed to look forward to an era of smaller government. I think we need \nto look forward to an era of personal responsibility and freedom rather \nthan government intervention and government spending and government \ntaxes. I think we need to look forward to a time when States and \ncommunities make decisions and not when we have dictates and mandates \nand impositions from Washington, DC.\n  This is a defining moment. This is a defining moment for us all. If \nthe choice is whether or not we will discontinue consideration, set \naside, defeat this massive tax bill, I believe that is exactly what we \nshould do.\n  Most Americans have an understanding of what is happening here. They \nmay not have had an understanding when we first started this debate, \nand you will remember, I think, as I do, when this debate was begun, it \nwas suggested that this entire thing would be just sped through the \nSenate; that we were going to bring it up the first of the week, and it \nwas going to be over with by the time we left for the Memorial Day \nrecess.\n  I looked at the bill, and I was shocked. I said, Wait a second; $868 \nbillion in new taxes, 52 new powers for HHS in Title I alone, Health \nand Human Services, one Department, 52 new powers, authorities, and \nresponsibilities; 178 new Federal Government powers, far-reaching \npowers, some with the ability to define and regulate literally whether \nyou could sell cigarettes on the top of the counter, whether they could \nbe in sight, whether they had to be out of sight. And, of course, with \nsmall operations like gas stations, when you have a one-room operation, \nyou are just standing out there in the cold, literally in a little \nglass box. It is hard to have everything out of sight--all those kinds \nof things. It really stung me that to try and make that consideration \nin the span of a week was totally inappropriate, and I came to the \nfloor only to find out that there was a plan to table my motion \nregarding taxes after less than an hour of real consideration, and it \nwas supposed to be disposed of; we were going to sort of dispose of the \nfinancial considerations of an $868 billion tax on the American people \nin an hour. Then we were going to table it and move on to just slam \nthis into a position to say that it was going to be the fate of the \nAmerican people to accept it.\n  That is when I really said to myself, I have to do something to slow \nthis down so that the American people have a chance to see what this \nis.\n  Real leadership is more than just reading the initial poll. The spin \ndoctors of this whole tobacco settlement came in to say how this was \nreally going to punish the tobacco companies. Then you got to reading \nthe fine print, and you found out that there is part of this law which \nforbids the tobacco companies to make the payments themselves. They \nmust, under the law, pass these charges on to the low-income families \nthat use tobacco. And I say low-income families. I mean it is \nincredible; this $868 billion tax will fall primarily, massively, \nheavily on individuals who are very low income. According to the best \nauthorities, 59.4 percent of this $868 billion tax will fall on people \nwho make less than $30,000 a year.\n  You say, Well, what is a little more tax to those people? A little \nmore tax. If the family is a two-pack-a day family, it is going to \nresult in something close to $1,500 a year by the time you figure out \nall the taxes.\n  Now, the specific tax that is contained in the bill is $1.10 a pack, \nbut the bipartisan Joint Committee on Tax put it this way: The price \nwill go up from $1.98 to $3.83. Now, if it was just $1.98 plus $1.10, \nthat would take it to $3.08. So what we are talking about is a far \nbigger increase in the price than just the taxes. And by the time it \nworks its way through the system, the Joint Committee on Tax basically \nsays that individuals will be paying $4.84 a pack as opposed to $1.98 a \npack. So we are talking about what is just almost a $3 increase per \npack. Now, two packs a day is 700 packs a year, roughly, for the \nfamily--700 times 3. By the end of this program, we are talking about \nover a $2,000 tax per year on a two-pack-a-day family. That is \nsubstantial.\n\n  Now, who does this fall on? People making less than $30,000 a year. \nWhat does this do to their children? What does this do to them? These \npeople are addicted. The whole idea is predicated on addiction. You get \nthis kind of price increase, and you get this kind of revenue only if \npeople are not sensitive to the price, only if they can't quit, only if \nthey maintain their habit. You can't project $868 billion in revenue if \nyou think people are going to quit. So here you have these low-income \nindividuals maybe having as much as $3 per pack by the year 2007, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Tax, $3 per pack extra to pay. That \nis $1,500 to $2,000 more taken out of the budget of that family, and \nthese are people, 60 percent of them, who earn less than $30,000 a \nyear.\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\n  And the most repugnant of the figures that they provide is that 44\\1/\n2\\ percent of the people paying this tax will earn less than $10,000 a \nyear. This is a tax to fall upon those who are least capable of paying.\n  When Ronald Reagan was President, he was known to attract to the \nRepublican side of the equation individuals called Reagan Democrats, \nhard-working people who wanted to help their families, individuals who \nworked in trades or worked as laborers, who just worked hard. They \nworked and they earned less than $30,000 a year, but they had values. \nThey wanted to take care of their families. They wanted to be able to \nprovide for them. And here is the question: Today is a defining moment \nfor the Republican Party. Is the Republican Party going to say to those \nkinds of individuals, if you made a choice to smoke at some time in \nyour life and now you are addicted, we are going to tax you so that it \nis going to be virtually impossible for you to have the kind of \nstandard of living you previously had, and we are going to do this \nbecause you have been victimized by the tobacco companies. We are not \npunishing the tobacco companies. We are going to make them pass the tax \non to you. We are going make sure the statute provides a penalty that \nyou have to be the person who pays the tax.\n  It is a defining moment for the Republican Party, in my view. I do \nnot want the Republican Party to be defined as more taxes and more \nspending and more government and less responsibility for individuals \nand less freedom. It seems to me that there is the potential for us to \nbe defined that way. We are not talking about this $868 billion tax \nincrease in a vacuum. We have a Republican Senate with this bill in its \nhands as to whether or not we are going to tax people by an additional \namount, and we are talking about this in the context of a surplus.\n  It is stunning to me to think that instead of debating how we can \nreturn resources to the American people, we find that we are focusing \non a bill on how to take another $868 billion from the American people. \nAnd it does define the Republican Party. It defines the Republican \nSenate. I think this is a day which will define us very clearly.\n  Are we in favor, when faced with a $39 billion surplus, of taxing \npeople with $868 billion more in taxes, to fall heavily on those who \nare least capable of paying for it, or are we in favor of saying no \nmore new taxes; that we do not believe in a big tax-and-spend \nphilosophy; that we are against invasive micromanaging, an \nintermeddling Federal involvement in everything; that we are in favor \nof personal freedom, personal responsibility, State and local \ngovernment potentials, and we reject the idea that in the face of a $39 \nbillion surplus we have to go and add to the tax bill of the American \npeople another $868 billion over the course of this legislation.\n  I think we need to debate how to give people a tax break. We should \nnot be debating how we are going to tax people hundreds and hundreds \nand hundreds of billions, three-quarters of a trillion dollars more \nthan we have already taxed them.\n  People talk about the addictive quality of nicotine. I think tax and \nspend in the Congress is more addicting than nicotine. I think the \nclear question the American people are going to ask this Senate, they \nare going to ask the Republicans in the Senate: Did you break the \nhabit? Did you break the tax-and-spend addiction of Government? Did you \ncome to respect people or to protect the bureaucracy? Did you come to \nsay that we are going to let people continue to have freedom, we are \ngoing to ask them to be responsible, we are going to let them have \ntheir resources and spend their resources on their families? Or did you \ncome to say the Government is so capable, in Washington, that it is \ngoing to sweep these resources out of the pockets of Americans?\n\n  We simply cannot have the largest proposed increase in Government \nsince the Clinton national health care plan--17 new boards, agencies, \ncommissions. Here are some of the things that are going to happen: Mr. \nPresident, $350 million a year is going to be taken from these \nAmericans, hard-working, low-income Americans--$350 million. That \naverages $7 million per State; large States, small States. It is going \nto be swept out of their pockets and gone for what?\n  Mr. President, $350 million a year goes to foreign governments \noverseas so they can conduct studies on what it costs to smoke \noverseas. I cannot believe the Republican Party wants to be identified \nwith that kind of expropriation. We take the money out of the pockets \nof Republicans and Democrats--Americans, low-income workers, and we \nsend it overseas so they can conduct studies about smoking.\n  This bill contains a special provision that relates to smoking in the \nNative American population. If you figure reasonable rates of smoking \nfor them, it is $18,000 per Native American that we are going to spend \nin this program. It does not make sense, to be taking money from low-\nincome Americans in order to do that.\n  These are just examples of the way this is a lavish bill, of spend \nand spend and more government and more government. It is only possible \nif you tax and tax $868 billion for 178 new Federal Government powers.\n  It is time for Congress to do what we know to be right, what we know \nto be true, what we know to be noble; that is, to respect the American \npeople, not protect the Government bureaucracy. The majority leader has \ncalled this bill too complicated and too expensive. I call upon the \nmajority leader to lead the American people to the right conclusion by \nleading the Republican Senate to the right identification with the \npeople against big government rather than with the bureaucracy and \nagainst the people. We should pull this bill off the Senate floor. It \nis a massive tax-and-spend bill. Perhaps more addictive than nicotine \nis the urge of Government to tax and spend and regulate. It is time for \nus to break the habit.\n  I call upon our leadership to lead, to lead us to do that which is \nright for the American people. Mr. President, $868 billion in new taxes \nare not going to help American families. They are going to distress a \nnumber of families to the extent that they lose their independence and \ntheir capacity to provide for themselves. If we end up making wards of \nthe State and Federal Government of more low-income families in \nAmerica, we will have done this Nation a massive disservice. It is time \nfor us to set aside the smokescreen, to identify this bill as tax and \nspend, and for us to reject it thoroughly.\n  I call upon our leadership to lead us in that respect.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon).

Mr. President, I am hopeful that today we will come to \nsome conclusion and come to an end in the tobacco controversy that has \ngone on for a very long time now. I think there are several things \nwhich seem to have a consensus. One is that we should make effective \nefforts to reduce teenage smoking. After all, that was the beginning. \nThat was the purpose. That, to me, is still the overriding objective of \nwhatever we do in terms of tobacco.\n  I think there is a consensus that the tobacco companies should be \nheld accountable for the kinds of advertising that they do, for the \nthings they say. The FDA rules should accomplish that.\n  I think that most people believe we should enforce the laws against \nthe purchase of cigarettes by teenagers.\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\n  I think there is also consensus, quite frankly, that we have talked \nquite long enough about this issue. It is time to come to the snubbing \npost, and do something about it. I hope we do.\n  I am discouraged, frankly, with the direction that this bill is \nmoving. It is no longer focused on the real issues for which it came to \npublic attention, teen smoking and public health. Instead, it has \nbecome a platform for talking about all kinds of things, such as \nreplacing one tax with another, such as increasing programs over the \nnext 25 years to the tune of maybe $800 billion, programs that will \nalmost surely become entitlements, and when this funding has run out, \nwill have to be replaced by other funding. Those are not the reasons we \nbegan to do this.\n  There are things in the bill that I don't think anyone has even \nthought about or talked about. For example, $1,700 per year in college \ntuition for tobacco farmers and their family members, including \nbrothers and sisters and stepbrothers and stepsisters and sons in law \nand daughters in law. I doubt that is what we talked about. Providing \n$7.5 billion to help American Indians stop smoking, or about $18,000 \nper person--those are not the kind of initiatives we had in mind.\n  Secondly, I am opposed to the tobacco industry's marketing techniques \naimed at teens, either through regulation, through law or through \npublic opinion. That should stop. My position has been clear on these \nissues. But to expand the size of our federal agencies or create new \nones--some reports indicate--as many as 17 new agencies will be \nestablished by this bill, is not what we had in mind, is not where we \nbegan.\n  Unfortunately, we find promoters of the bill accuse those who are not \nenthusiastic about it of being against doing something about teenage \nsmoking. That is not true. Everyone is for curbing the use of youth \nsmoking. Everyone wants to do that. So we ought not to be confused by \nsuch accusations. After all, one of the real philosophies and \noverriding efforts in this Congress ought to be to reduce the size of \nthe Federal Government and uphold States rights. Those things are very \nimportant. Instead, this bill goes the opposite direction, creating new \ngovernment boards, guaranteed annual spending increases and a wide \nrange of State mandates--just the opposite in terms of the principals \nwe support.\n  Fortunately, there will be two alternatives. We will have an \nopportunity to vote on substitutes if that is the choice of the \nleadership. One will be offered by Senator Gramm and Senator Domenici. \nThat is sort of a basic bill aimed at the purpose of controlling \nteenage smoking. Again, that should be our primary purpose. The second \none, of course, is sponsored by Senator Hatch and Senator Feinstein \nwhich goes back pretty much to the original agreement.\n  So I am not going to extend the tobacco debate any longer than it \nalready has been for 3\\1/2\\ weeks, but I do just simply want to say \nthat we ought to focus on the issue for which we began. We ought to do \nsomething about teen smoking, get away from this idea of bringing in \neverything that we can possibly think of in terms of taxes, money, and \nbureaucracy. It is time to deal with the issue and move on. We have a \ngreat deal to do before this session ends. We haven't even begun to \ndiscuss the appropriations bills. We have the Armed Forces \nauthorization bill to finish. We have sorts of other legislative \nmatters that are just as important.\n  Mr. President, I simply wanted to express my view in terms of the \nfact that I think it is time to come to some consensus, to some \nconclusion, and move forward. I think this can be achieved if we would \nonly focus on the real issue--curbing teenage smoking.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, during the course of the last year as \na member of the Judiciary Committee and the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, I have felt that part of my responsibilities are to follow \nthe investigation of independent counsel Kenneth Starr in some \nparticular detail.\n\n  I, like many Americans during the course of this last year, have been \ntroubled about Mr. Starr's investigation and the sensitivity to the \nrights of individual Americans in any sense of balance or fairness with \nwhich he is pursuing his responsibilities. During the course of this \nyear, I have, on six different occasions, written to Attorney General \nReno, noting problems with the investigation or particular areas of \nconcern. These have included possible conflicts of interest on the part \nof Mr. Starr and his deputy, Mr. Ewing, and that Mr. Starr continues to \ndraw a salary from his law firm in excess of $1 million--a law firm \nthat represents important interests, including tobacco companies whose \nfuture interests may be at variance with policy positions of the \nClinton administration while Mr. Starr is investigating President \nClinton.\n  Second, Mr. Starr's association with people and organizations that \nappear intent on discrediting President Clinton. These, of course, \nwould include Mr. Scaife, Mr. Starr's association with Pepperdine \nUniversity, his promise of employment while being funded by an \nindividual who is committed to the destruction of President Clinton \npersonally and politically.\n  Third, the question of possible witness tampering. This, Mr. \nPresident, goes to the question of allegations of payments to David \nHale by individuals associated with some of these organizations that \nmay have undermined the credibility of testimony given in the \nWhitewater investigation.\n  All these issues for the moment aside, each individually troubling, \nwe are now confronted with a new and potentially more serious question, \nand that is the apparently purposeful releasing, or to use the \nvernacular, ``the leaking,'' of the sensitive nonpublic and possible \ngrand jury information by Mr. Starr and his associates. During this \ninvestigation, various newspapers and television accounts have \nrepeatedly used ``unnamed sources'' to report information that made it \nappear likely, if unmistakable, that the Office of Independent Counsel \nwas providing information to reporters that was otherwise protected as \na matter of law, if not just department policy.\n  Now in an exhaustively detailed account, a new publication, Brill's \nContent, has reviewed the independent counsel investigation of the \nPresident and found clear and unmistakable evidence that Mr. Starr and \nhis associates have purposefully leaked information about the \ninvestigation of President Clinton. If these reports are true, Mr. \nStarr's activities are not only a violation of the ethical standards of \nthe legal profession, they are a direct possible violation of rule 6E \nof the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and an obvious violation of \nDepartment of Justice guidelines.\n  This leaking would obviously have been objectionable if undertaken by \nan individual U.S. attorney or another Department of Justice official. \nThe precedence of the Department of Justice almost certainly would have \nled to an investigation by the Office of Professional Responsibility \nwith sanctions or firing by the individual responsible. But undertaken \nby someone in the Office of Independent Counsel, it is, in my judgment, \nan offense of a far greater nature because the independent counsel has \nbeen given unparalleled, even unprecedented powers, to investigate the \nPresident of the United States without much of the oversight and \naccountability that is required of career prosecutors or others in the \nJustice Department itself.\n  It obviously poses a direct and fundamental threat to the credibility \nand effectiveness of the Office of Independent Counsel. Before this \ngoes any further and the Office of Independent Counsel and the statute \nupon which it rests is further undermined, there is an obvious and \noverwhelming need for either the Federal courts, in their direct \nresponsibility to oversee this investigation, or Attorney General Reno \nin her responsibility in the administration of the Department of \nJustice, to undertake an immediate and thorough investigation of the \nOffice of Independent Counsel, because if these allegations that \nKenneth Starr is leaking protected grand jury information are true, \nthen the Office of Independent Counsel is spinning seriously out of \ncontrol and operating outside of the law.\n  Mr. President, the evidence today, if not conclusive, is \noverwhelming. On February 6, 1998, David Kendall, the President's \npersonal attorney, wrote a\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\n15-page letter to the Federal district court detailing dozens of \ninstances of obviously improper disclosure of grand jury information.\n  In response, Mr. Starr told numerous media outlets that these leaks \nwere not coming from anyone in his office. In a letter to Mr. Kendall, \nMr. Starr wrote, ``From the beginning, I have made the prohibition of \nleaks a principal priority of the office.'' Starr continued, ``It is a \nfiring offense, as well as one that will lead to criminal \nprosecution.'' Mr. Starr continues, ``I have undertaken an \ninvestigation to determine whether, despite my persistent admonition, \nsomeone in this office may be culpable.''\n  Despite calls from the Department of Justice and the Office of \nProfessional Responsibility to investigate, the Attorney General of the \nUnited States, Ms. Reno took Kenneth Starr at his word and allowed him \nto proceed with an internal investigation of his own office. Although \nMr. Starr pledged to end these leaks and investigate any wrongdoing, it \nis obvious that he neither investigated nor changed the conduct of his \noffice, or as now we know, even himself.\n  This week, Steven Brill in his magazine Content provided even further \nevidence of these transgressions. Mr. Brill reports that he has \npersonally seen internal memoranda from 3 different national news \norganizations that cite Mr. Starr's office as the source of many of \nthese stories of grand jury leaks.\n  He discloses an internal publication of the New York Times, in which \nits Washington editor is quoted as saying, ``This story was very much \ndriven in the beginning on sensitive information that was coming out of \nthe prosecutor's office. And the sourcing had to be vague because it \nwas * * * given with the understanding that it would not be sourced.''\n  But if this sourcing, this reporting and analysis was not enough, \nthese disclosures have been confirmed directly by Mr. Starr himself.\n  On April 15 of this year, Brill reports that Starr acknowledged that \nhe and his office have provided non-public information to reporters. \nMr. Starr said, ``I have talked with reporters on background on some \noccasions, but Jackie [Bennett, his deputy] has been the primary person \ninvolved in that. He has spent much of his time talking to individual \nreporters.''\n  Mr. President, in his statement, Mr. Starr confirms what many of us \nhave suspected all along: the Office of Independent Counsel has not \nonly violated department guidelines on providing information, but it \nmay have violated Rule 6E of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \nand committed a criminal offense in its own investigation.\n  Mr. President, I need not remind my colleagues of the seriousness of \nthis possible criminal offense by Mr. Starr's office.\n  It has been a founding principle of Anglo-American law that \nconfidentiality of grand jury investigations is central to the \nadministration of justice.\n  Mr. Starr has defended his media leaks by saying they were not a Rule \n6E violation. He says, ``* * * if you are talking about what witnesses \ntell FBI agents or us before they testify before the grand jury or \nabout related matters,'' they are not violations.\n\n  Mr. President, Mr. Starr's defense may be that he violated the \nspirit, but not the letter of the law. Tragically, Mr. President, that \nis not the case under the precedents of this country.\n  On May 5, 1998, in In Re: Motions of Dow Jones and Company, the Court \nof Appeals of the District of Columbia--the court which, ironically, \nhas jurisdiction over Mr. Starr's current grand jury investigation--\nruled that leaking information about prospective witnesses who might \ntestify at a grand jury, about expected testimony, about negotiations \nregarding possible immunity, and about the strategy of grand jury \nproceedings, all violate Rule 6E.\n  The court wrote, ``Matters occurring before the grand jury'' that \ncannot be disclosed ``* * * include not only what has occurred and what \nis occurring, but what also is likely to occur.''\n  What is therefore so shocking about Mr. Starr's own defense of his \nactivities, his disclosures, is not that there is a precedent to the \ncontrary to which one can be referred, it is that Mr. Starr himself is \nfully aware of this restriction. They are in the law. He knows them and \nhe violated them.\n  In one of his impromptu sidewalk press conferences, held February 5 \nof this year, Mr. Starr told reporters that he could not talk ``* * * \nabout the status of someone who might be a witness [because] that goes \nto the heart of the grand jury process.''\n  Exactly, Mr. Starr. Disclosing potential testimony, likely testimony \nof someone who might appear before a grand jury, is not outside the \nFederal statute or its precedence; in your own words, Mr. Starr, it \ngoes to the heart of the process and the protection afforded citizens \nof this country. There is a reason. This being a Nation that is ruled \nunder the precedence of law, there is a reason why this Congress, the \nJustice Department, and the courts have protected grand jury \ninformation.\n  If Mr. Starr's violation goes unanswered and he is not held \naccountable, there are consequences for all Americans, in all \ninvestigations, by all prosecutors, in all years to follow, because \nwithout it we could not guarantee that witnesses would ever feel free \nto disclose information to an investigator. They would live in fear \nthat it would always potentially be disclosed. We could not ensure that \ngrand jurors would be able to deliberate free from the influence of \ninterested parties who would manipulate their investigation in public \ndebate. We could not preserve the reputation of witnesses called before \nthe grand jury, but found not guilty of any crime.\n  Mr. Starr's activities are not simply a violation of the rights of \nPresident Clinton or grand jury witnesses, they are a violation of the \nadministration of justice in this country.\n  Mr. President, all crimes in the United States are not equal or \nserious. But crimes committed by Government in the administration of \njustice against individual Americans, given the vast and enormous and \ndisparate power of Government in the administration of justice can be \nthe most serious crime of all. It is that to which Mr. Starr stands \naccused today.\n  Mr. President, I do not know how Attorney General Janet Reno is \ndealing with these allegations. One can only imagine, because when the \npublic debate began about possible grand jury leaks and the violations \nof Federal criminal statutes with regard to disclosing information, Mr. \nStarr stood silent. He permitted the Attorney General of the United \nStates to allow him to proceed with an internal investigation of these \ngrand jury leaks of his own office when all the time he knew that he \nwas the source of some of the leaks, potentially undermining not only \npublic confidence in the investigation but almost assuredly the \nconfidence of the Attorney General herself.\n  Mr. President, I don't know what Janet Reno is thinking. But Kenneth \nStarr made a fool of the Attorney General of the United States having \nher proceed with Mr. Starr investigating his own transgressions.\n  This maneuvering, however, to many in this institution will not come \nas a surprise. The problems with the independent counsel have been \ncoming for some time, and, indeed, almost incredibly Justice Scalia \npredicted in his dissent in Morrison v. Olson exactly what has now \noccurred.\n  A prosecutor so focused on one suspect under the laws of the \nindependent counsel would, and he wrote, and I quote, ``What would \nnormally be regarded as a technical violation * * * may in his or her \nworld assume the proportions of an indictable offense.''\n  Mr. President, this is exactly what has occurred. Mr. Starr has been \ntransformed from one who is supposed to be an objective prosecutor into \na partisan political actor without oversight from the Department of \nJustice, control of the Federal courts, and no longer even operating \nwithin Federal law.\n  Mr. President, I call upon my colleagues to join me in urging the \nAttorney General to once again assume her lawful responsibilities in \nthe administration of justice, recognizing that the Office of \nIndependent Counsel cannot operate outside of Federal law. Mr. \nPresident, it is high time at last to restore the credibility of this \ninvestigation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6436-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6437-S6440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ENCRYPTION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for our nation's \ncomputer and electronic industries. As you are well aware, the \nAdministration's\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\nexport policies prohibit American companies from selling state-of-the-\nart encryption technology abroad without recovery keys and back door \naccess. Encryption is a series of mathematical formulas that scramble \nand unscramble data and communications. It is used to thwart computer \nhackers, industrial and foreign espionage agents, and criminals from \ngaining access to and reading sensitive personal, business, and \nmilitary communications. The higher the bit-key length, the more \ndifficult it is for unauthorized persons to break the code. Technically \nadvanced encryption ensures that an individual's medical, financial, \nbusiness, personal records and electronic-mail cannot be accessed \nwithout their consent. The Administration is now promoting the \ndeployment of recovery keys so designated third parties would be able \nto access and share with law enforcement the computer data and \ncommunications of American citizens without their knowledge. Currently, \ngovernment mandated key escrow is not required and is opposed by the \ncomputer industry, privacy advocates, legal scholars, and by many \nmembers of Congress.\n  Mr. LEAHY. While current law does not mandate any key recovery, the \ncurrent Administration, just as past Administrations, uses the export \ncontrol regime to ``dumb down'' the encryption available for widespread \nintegration into high-tech products intended for both domestic use and \nfor export to foreign customers. Export regulations in place now are \nbeing used expressly to coerce the development and use of encryption \nproducts capable of giving law enforcement surreptitious access to \nplaintext by conditioning the export of 56-bit DES encryption on \ndevelopment of key recovery features.\n  These regulations are scheduled to sunset in December 1998, at which \ntime export of even 56-bit strength encryption will no longer be \npermitted. I understand that the Administration is already undertaking \ndiscussions with industry on what will happen upon sunset of these \nregulations. I have long contended that taking unilateral steps will \nnot resolve this issue, but instead could delay building the consensus \nwe so urgently need. This issue simply cannot by resolved by Executive \nfiat.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, I have been involved in the debate \nregarding encryption technology and privacy for more than three years \nnow. In the course of that time I have not seen any real attempt by the \nWhite House to resolve this problem. In fact, over the course of that \ntime the Administration has moved further from negotiation by taking \nincreasingly extreme positions on this critical national issue.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you have heard, current U.S. policy \nallows only encryption below the 56-bit key length to be sold abroad. \nFor a long time now, software companies have argued that this level of \nencryption is so low it provides little security for the information \nbeing transmitted over the ``super highway.'' This policy also states \nthat, in the production of encryption stronger than 56-bit, software \ncompanies must provide some type of ``backdoor'' access to ensure law \nenforcement can decode encrypted material.\n  Addressing this from an economic perspective, customers--especially \nforeign customers--are unwilling to purchase American encryption \nproducts with backdoors and third-party access. This is particularly \ntrue since they can buy stronger encryption overseas from either \nforeign-owned companies or American owned companies on foreign soil \nwithout these invasive features.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Since coming to the Senate, I have worked side-by-side \nwith Senators Burns, Ashcroft, Leahy and others on the critical issue \nof encryption. Our common goal has been to craft a policy that puts the \nUnited States squarely out front of the crypto-curve, rather than locks \nus permanently behind it. A one-size-fits-all government policy simply \nwon't work in this digital era. We all recognize and acknowledge the \nlegitimate needs of law enforcement and the national security \ncommunities, but tying the hands of America's high technology industry \nin the process will serve neither those needs, nor the national \ninterest in maintaining our competitive edge in the fiercely \ncompetitive global marketplace. It's time to move forward with \ncomprehensive encryption reform legislation.\n  Mr. BURNS. I would like to point out that the government's plan for \nencryption--whether they call it ``key escrow'' or ``key recovery'' or \n``plaintext access''--simply won't work. Eleven of the world's most \nprominent computer security experts have told us government mandated \nkey recovery won't work because it won't be secure, as explained in a \nstudy published this week by the Center for Democracy and Technology. \nKey escrow also won't work because it will cost billions, as revealed \nin a recent study published by the Business Software Alliance. We have \nalso been told that the kind of system the Administration wants is not \ntechnically feasible. Additionally, constitutional scholars testified \nthat government mandated key escrow, third party recovery probably \nviolates the Bill of Rights.\n  Mr. LOTT. Even though a national recovery system would be technically \nunfeasible, costly, and violates an individual's privacy rights, the \nAdministration continues to require key escrow as a precondition for \nrelaxing America's encryption policy. Again, Mr. President, I would \npoint out that state-of-the-art encryption is available in the \ninternational marketplace without key recovery and without backdoor \naccess. This backdoor door requirement is simply backward thinking \npolicy. It does not make sense to hold the computer industry hostage to \nforce the creation of such an unworkable system.\n  Mr. BURNS. The Majority Leader is absolutely right. We do not need \nexperts to tell us key recovery will not work. All that is needed is a \nlittle common sense to understand that no one will buy systems with \nbackdoor access. Criminals will not escrow their keys and terrorists \nwill find keyless systems from America's foreign competitors. There is \nnothing we can do to stop undesirables from using strong, unescrowed \nencryption.\n  Mr. LOTT. Even though advanced encryption products are widely \navailable across the globe, the White House continues to stall \nCongressional and industry attempts to reach a sensible market oriented \nsolution to the nation's outdated encryption export regime. This \nstonewalling tactic will only cede even more of our nation's technology \nmarket to foreign competitors and America will lose forever its ability \nto sell encryption technology at home and abroad.\n  It is time to change America's export policy before it is too late. \nIf the Administration will not do what is right, reform its export \nregime, then Congress must enact encryption reform during this session.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Majority Leader is correct that reform of our \nencryption policy is needed. The Attorney General came to the Hill in \nMarch and asked for a legislative moratorium on encryption matters. \nThis request was made because the Administration wanted to talk with \nthe information technology industry about developing means for law \nenforcement to gain surreptitious access to plaintext scrambled by \nstrong encryption. According to eleven of the world's leading \ncryptographers in a report reissued on June 8, the technical risks and \ncosts of such backdoors ``will exacerbate, not alleviate, the potential \nfor crime and information terrorism'' for America's computer users and \nour critical infrastructures.\n  In the Senate we have a name for debate that delays action on \nlegislative matters. We call it a filibuster. On encryption policy, the \nAdministration has been willing to talk, but not to forge a real \nsolution. That amounts to a filibuster. The longer we go without a \nsensible policy, the more jobs will be lost, the more we risk eroding \nour privacy rights on the Internet, and the more we leave our critical \ninfrastructures vulnerable.\n  Mr. BURNS. We can readily see that the current U.S. policy on \nencryption jeopardizes the privacy of individuals, the security of the \nInternet, and the competitiveness of U.S. industry. We have been \ndebating this issue since the Administration's introduction of the ill-\nfated Clipper chip proposal over five years ago. Yet no substantial \nchange in Administration policy has taken place. It is time for us to \ntake action.\n  I first introduced comprehensive encryption reform legislation in the\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\nform of the Pro-CODE bill over two years ago, then reintroduced it in \nthis Congress with the cosponsorship of the Majority Leader, Senators \nAshcroft, Leahy, Wyden, and others. Along with Senators Ashcroft, \nLeahy, and others, I am also an original cosponsor of the E-PRIVACY \nbill, which would foster the use of strong encryption and global \ncompetitiveness. We have held numerous hearings on the issue. Yet \ndespite the increasingly desperate drumbeat of criticism from industry, \nindividuals, and privacy groups, from across the political spectrum, \nthe Administration's policy has remained fundamentally unchanged.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Since the hearing I chaired in May 1994 on the \nAdministration's ``Clipper Chip'' proposal, the Administration has \ntaken some steps in the right direction. Clipper Chip is now dead, and \nthe Administration has transferred authority over the export of \nencryption products from the State Department to the Commerce \nDepartment, as called for in legislation I introduced in the last \nCongress with Senators Burns, Wyden and others. Furthermore, the \nAdministration has permitted the export of up to 56-bit DES encryption, \nat least until the end of this year. But these actions are simply not \nenough for our high-tech industries to maintain their leading edge in \nthe global marketplace.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Our technology companies need to be able to compete \neffectively. Without reasonable export laws our technology sector will \nbe seriously harmed. More encryption companies will leave the country \nso they are free to sell their products around the globe as well as \nwithin the United States. Make no mistake, the market will not be \ndenied. Today, robust encryption products from Canada, Japan, Germany \nand elsewhere are being sold on the world market. You have heard of the \ncompanies that are manufacturing and selling encryption. They are \nNortel, Nippon and Seimens. These are not upstart companies. They are \nsubstantial players on the international scene, and they offer \nencryption products that are technically and financially competitive \nwith those produced in the U.S.\n\n  Mr. LOTT. That's right. In fact, a recent survey conducted by Trusted \nInformation Systems found that hundreds of foreign companies sell over \n600 encryption products from 29 countries. It is even possible to \ndownload some of the strongest technology available, 128-bit key length \nencryption, off of the Internet. Clearly, America's policy of \nrestricting the sale of American encryption software and hardware has \nnot impacted the availability and use of this technology throughout the \nglobe.\n  No one disputes the fact that the development and use of robust \nencryption worldwide will continue with or without U.S. business \nparticipation. What is particularly disturbing to me is that export \ncontrols, instead of achieving their intended purpose, have only served \nto deny America's premier computer industry the opportunity to compete \non a level playing field with foreign competitors. Costing our economy \nand our nation billions of dollars and the loss of countless American \njobs in the process. Given the wide availability of encryption \ntechnology, continuing to restrict U.S. access to foreign markets makes \nno sense.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. That is absolutely correct. The Administration's \nencryption policy is, in effect, a tax on American consumers. We owe it \nto these customers and the innovators in the software industry to \nreform this encryption policy now. From the birth of the United States, \nthis country has been a world leader in innovation, creativity, \nentrepreneurship, vision and opportunity. Today all of these American \nattributes are on display in our technology sector. Whether in \ntelecommunications, or computer hardware or software, the United States \nhas maintained a leadership position because of the opportunities \nafforded to people with the vision, determination and responsibility to \nreach for their highest and best. We must work diligently to ensure \nthat ample opportunities are maintained in this country for our \ntechnology sector to continue to thrive and innovate. If companies are \nstifled and cannot compete, then the people, the ideas, the jobs, and \nthe economic growth will simply go elsewhere.\n  Mr. BURNS. In the computer business these days, they talk about \n``Internet time.'' In the Internet industry, where product life cycles \ncan be as low as 6 months, the world changes rapidly. Yet we have been \ndebating this issue for over five years now, while America's sensitive \ncommunications go unsecured, our critical information infrastructures \ngo unprotected, and our electronic commerce jobs get shipped overseas. \nIt is time for the Congress to act.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. If this issue is not resolved, and resolved soon, we \nwill lose this industry, we will lose our leadership position in \ntechnology, and our national security will suffer. We have a choice to \nmake as policy makers--do we allow our companies to compete \ninternationally or do we force them, by our antiquated and ill-\nconceived government policy, to move overseas. We cannot simply ignore \nthe reality that robust encryption exists in the international \nmarketplace now. Instead, we must allow our companies to compete, and \ndo so now. We cannot allow extraneous issues to stand in the way of \nremedying the deficiencies with our current approach to encryption. We \nmust recognize that keeping the encryption industry on American shores \nis the best way to ensure national security. We would not think of \nallowing all our defense industries to move abroad. By the same token, \nwe should not force the encryption industry abroad through outdated \npolicies. Simply put, strong encryption means a strong economy and a \nstrong country. This concern is just one of the many reasons we need to \npass effective encryption legislation this year and just one of the \nreasons that Senator Leahy and I recently drafted the E-PRIVACY bill, \nS. 2067.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I join with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in \ncalling for passage of good encryption legislation that promotes \ncomputer privacy, fosters the global competitiveness of our high-tech \nindustries, and encourages the widespread use of strong encryption as \nan online crime prevention and anti-terrorism tool. The E-PRIVACY bill \nthat I have sponsored with Senator Ashcroft, Senator Burns and others, \nsatisfies these goals. Prompt Senate consideration of encryption \nlegislation is sorely needed to protect America's economy and security.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, the E-PRIVACY bill seeks to protect \nindividual privacy, while at the same time addressing national security \nand law enforcement interests. It would also modernize export controls \non commercial encryption products.\n  The E-Privacy Act specifically addresses the concerns of law \nenforcement. First and foremost, it makes it a crime to intentionally \nuse encryption to conceal incriminating communications or information. \nIt also provides that with an official subpoena, existing wiretap \nauthority can be used to obtain communications decryption keys/\nassistance from third parties.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Leahy, Senator \nBurns and Senator Ashcroft as well as Senator Lott and Senator Daschle \nfor their work and leadership on the issue of encryption. I am proud to \nbe an original cosponsor of S. 2067, the E-PRIVACY Act.\n  This is my sixth year as a member of the Senate and the sixth year I \nhave advocated for reasonable legislation on encryption. Sadly, the \nAdministration has not been a constructive player in this debate. It is \ntime for the United States to acknowledge that we no longer exclusively \ncontrol the pace of technology. Purchasers around the world can \ndownload software off of the Internet from any country by simply \naccessing a website. Foreign purchasers have turned to Russian, German, \nSwiss and other foreign vendors for their encryption needs.\n  Washington state and American companies deserve the opportunity to \ncompete free from unreasonable government restrictions. Their role in \nthe international marketplace should be determined by their ingenuity \nand creativity rather than an outdated, ineffectual system of export \ncontrols. The time to act is now. I urge the Senate to consider the E-\nPRIVACY Act at the earliest opportunity.\n  Mr. BURNS. The basic facts remain the same. People need strong, \nunescrowed encryption to protect themselves online in the information\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\nage. Law enforcement has legitimate concerns about the spread of this \ntechnology, and we must work to provide them the tools and expertise \nthey need to keep up with advances in encryption technology. We cannot \nstop time, however. The genie is out of the bottle. As Bill Gates, the \nCEO of Microsoft, recently said, ``Encryption technology is widely \navailable outside the United States and inside the United States, and \nthat's just a fact of life.''\n  Mr. CRAIG. With the rapid expansion of the ``super highway'' and \nInternet commerce it is crucial we bring encryption legislation to the \nforefront. A secure, private and trusted national and global \ninformation infrastructure is essential to promote citizens' privacy \nand economic growth.\n  Mr. BURNS. As my colleagues recognize, technically advanced and \nunobtrusive encryption is fundamental to ensuring the kind of privacy \nAmericans will need and desire in the years to come. Congress must \nchoose a future where individuals and companies will have the tools \nthey need to protect their privacy, not a future where people fear the \nuse electronic commerce because they have no security.\n  I commend the Majority Leader, Senators Ashcroft, Leahy, Craig, \nWyden, and Murray for their vision and bipartisan leadership on this \nissue. I hope that Congress will be able to move forward with real \nencryption reform legislation that protects the privacy and security of \nAmericans in the Information Age, before it is too late.\n  Mr. LOTT. I think it is worth repeating to my colleagues that the \nAdministration's approach to encryption makes no sense. It is not good \npolicy. Continuing to restrict the foreign sale of American encryption \ntechnology that is already available abroad, or will soon be available, \nis anti-business, anti-consumer, anti-jobs, and anti-innovation.\n  The time for a change in America's export regime is long overdue. \nUnfortunately, the Administration continues to support its outmoded and \ncompetition-adverse encryption control policy. That is why this \nCongress needs to find a legislative solution to this issue.\n  If America's export controls are not relaxed now, then Congress \nplaces in peril our entire technology industry. Not just those \ncompanies that create and market encryption products and services, but \nvirtually every company involved in the development and sale of \ncomputer hardware and software.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man who \nnearly lost his life in the pursuit of Justice, Mr. Ronald Waters, of \nColumbia, South Carolina.\n  Waters was driving along Interstate 95 in North Carolina around noon \non September 23, 1997 when he noticed a North Carolina Highway Patrol \ncar on the side of the road and a Cumberland County Sheriff's car in \nthe median. Upon approaching the scene, he observed one of the officers \nlaying face down next to his patrol car. He then noticed two \nunidentified men moving between the patrol car and a green Toyota, also \nparked on the side of the road. Waters called 911 emergency on his \ncellular phone and informed the operator of the situation. He then \npulled off the road to investigate, and upon getting out of his car he \nheard several gun shots.\n  The two unidentified men then drove off in the Toyota and Waters \nfollowed the suspects, all the while relaying their position to the 911 \ndispatcher. The two men then exited the interstate and traveled down a \ndirt road. Waters, out of concern for the victim's families, pulled to \nthe side and waited for their return.\n  About five minutes later the Toyota returned and Waters drove in the \nopposite direction, hoping the suspects would assume he was just \nanother motorist. Once they were out of sight he moved towards the \nentrance ramp of the interstate, mistakenly under the impression that \nthe two men were in front of him. Not seeing them on the ramp, Waters \nlooked in his mirror and noticed that they were parked on the overpass \nbehind him. Waters then pulled off the ramp and stopped, once again \ninforming the dispatcher of their location.\n  About that time the Toyota began closing in on him at a high rate of \nspeed. As Waters pulled out the two men began to fire at him with an \nAK-47 assault rifle. The suspects fired several rounds which struck a \ncritical portion of his vehicle, leaving it disabled. Now stranded on \nthe side of the road, Waters watched as the two men pulled up along \nside him. Then one of the men pointed the assault rifle directly at \nWaters and pulled the trigger. Waters felt at this point that he would \nnever see his wife or infant son again, but for some unexplained \nreason, the rifle jammed and would not fire. The two men then sped off, \nonly to be arrested by officers shortly thereafter, due in large part \nto the constant contact Waters had with the dispatcher in relaying \ntheir position to the authorities.\n  Unfortunately, the two police officers who were shot in this \nincident, Highway Patrol Trooper Ed Lowry and Cumberland County \nSheriff's Deputy David Hathcock, were both killed as a result of gun \nshot wounds inflicted by the two suspects. While it may not serve to \nmake this tragic loss of life any easier for the victim's families, it \ncertainly goes to show that crime does not pay, and those who commit \nthese atrocities will be apprehended.\n  This display of courage by Waters exemplifies the characteristics of \ntrue heroism, and serves to reassure the many law abiding citizens that \ngood really does triumph over evil. So often acts of selflessness such \nas this go unnoticed simply because the danger faced is of a lesser \ndegree, but Ronald Waters is one of many who have risked their lives \nfor what they know to be right.\n  I am pleased to stand before you today, Mr. President, to relay this \nstory of courage and valor personified to its greatest degree. I join \nthe State of South Carolina in honoring Ronald Waters for his adamant \nservice and devotion to Justice, and I thank you for allowing me the \ntime to speak.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nstand in recess, subject to the call of the Chair, following 10 minutes \nof debate of Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I believe it is very clear that the tobacco industry \nand their allies will pull out all of the stops to kill legislation \nthat protects our children. It is very clear how the tobacco industry \nhopes to bring about this legislation's demise. The tobacco lobbyists \nwant to produce a death by distraction. It is very easy to see why the \ntobacco lobbyists are pursuing this strategy. They cannot derail our \ncause of protecting children from starting to smoke on the merits. The \ncase for passing legislation to protect our kids is too powerful. It is \ntoo strong. It is too moral.\n  So the tobacco lobby hopes to throw everything but the proverbial \nkitchen sink into this debate, hope that it doesn't stink the place up \ntoo much, and then hope that the American people lose sight of what \nthis is really all about. But the fact is that the American people get \nit. They know that this is about protecting children. They are not \ngoing to fall for this strategy of trying to produce enough distraction \nthat somehow the Senate will have to move on to other issues or somehow \nsome other question will have to be addressed on this floor. I believe \nthat allowing this bill to die by all of these distractions would be \none of the most shocking abdications of our public responsibilities \nthat has been seen in years.\n  If this body stays focused on the goal of protecting children, works \nthrough the relevant amendments, and passes this important legislation, \nthis Congress would have a lasting legacy of accomplishment in the \ncause of keeping our children healthy in the 21st century.\n  There are a variety of legitimate issues that have come up in this \ndebate. The question of education policy,\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nof income taxes, a whole host of questions.\n  I happen to agree with a number of our colleagues on the other side \nwho want to make it tough, for example, to raise taxes. I am one of the \nDemocrats who voted to do that. But this is not the proper bill on \nwhich to have a debate about tax policy. This is not the proper vehicle \nto have a comprehensive discussion about tax reform. This is about \ntobacco.\n  I see our friend and colleague, Senator Ford. He and I serve on the \nCommerce Committee. We produced a bill that came out of committee by 19 \nto 1 because we stayed focused on the relevant issues. We didn't always \nagree.\n  I have enormous respect for Senator Ford. He has done yeoman's work \non the question of making sure our farmers get a fair shake. He knows I \nfeel strongly on key issues: for example, making sure that these \ntobacco companies don't pay for a settlement in this country by \ntargeting youngsters around the globe. But together, and with our \ncolleague, Senator Hollings of South Carolina, we produced what we \nthink is a fair package. There can be further discussion of those \nissues. But we stayed focused on the question of tobacco. We didn't \nraise a whole host of other issues that are important to both of us. We \nstayed focused on the cause of trying to protect children, recognizing \nthat we would have further discussion of that subject here on the \nfloor. But we stayed focused on the topic at hand.\n  The fight to stop the cigarette industry from marketing to children \ndid not begin this year. But this is the year we have an opportunity to \nmake real progress. I was a Member of the other body and participated \nin the hearings held by then-Chairman Henry Waxman. The tobacco \nexecutives told me under oath that nicotine isn't addictive. The \nAmerican people didn't believe them. The Surgeon General of the last 20 \nyears didn't believe them. As a result of that hearing, and the \ndocuments that have come out over these many years, we have been in a \nposition to make great progress--progress, for example, that lead to \nthat 19-to-1 vote in the Senate Commerce Committee.\n  So this debate is the culmination of years of work by those who have \nbeen trying to promote the cause of better health for the children in \nour Nation. We are trying to do it in a way that is going to help kids \naround the world be healthier. For the first time, we are going to say \nthat you have to protect kids in Oregon and in Texas, and across this \ncountry. But we are going to get the Government out of the business of \ntrying to help these tobacco companies sell cigarettes overseas to hook \nkids in Bangkok and Bangladesh.\n  That is important. But we are up against tremendous lobbying. The \ntobacco companies have spent millions. Maybe what we need is a \n``Million Child March'' on Washington, DC, with families, with health \nprofessionals, to show that we are not going to be derailed by these \nlobbyists. These lobbyists are not going to be allowed to derail the \ncause of public health in this body. We are going to come back again \nand again and again in the days ahead.\n  So this issue is focused on what really counts; that is, protecting \nchildren. There is not going to be a death by distraction. There is not \ngoing to be a precipitous and unfortunate demise for this bill by \nvirtue of so many other issues coming up and being debated on this \nfloor. We are going to stay focused.\n  Mr. President, I know of the good work that you have done on this \nissue. We have fought together on a bipartisan basis to try to protect \nchildren in our State. I am looking forward to seeing the kind of \nspirit that you and I have brought to this issue come to this body as a \nwhole to make sure that we stay focused on the issue of protecting \nchildren.\n  I yield my time, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6440-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ASSISTANCE FOR PRODUCERS EXPERIENCING LOSSES OF FARM \n                   INCOME.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, from amounts made available under section \n     1012(3)(A), the Secretary shall use up to $250,000,000 for \n     each of fiscal years 1999 through 2004 to establish a program \n     to indemnify eligible producers that have experienced, or are \n     experiencing, catastrophic losses in farm income during any \n     of the 1997 through 2004 crop years, as determined by the \n     Secretary.\n       (b) Gross Income and Payment Limitations.--In carrying out \n     this section, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent \n     practicable, use gross income and payment limitations \n     established for the Disaster Reserve Assistance Program under \n     section 813 of the Agricultural Act of 1970 (7 U.S.C. 1427a).\n       (c) Effect on Other Payments.--The amount available in \n     section 1012(3)(A) for tobacco community economic development \n     grants under section 1023 shall be reduced by any amount \n     appropriated under this section.

I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me speak for a moment to the question \nof where we appear to be, although no final decision I know has been \nmade by leaders.\n  But it is clear that at some point today, if events flow the way they \nhave been discussed, the majority of the members of the Republican \nParty are going to try to kill this bill. And they are going to try to \nkill this bill either through a cloture motion--depending on what \ndecision is made as to when that vote might be able to take place--\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\nor through a tricky little budget point of order parliamentary \nprocedure that should have, in fact, taken place at the outset when \nthis bill came on the floor. The notion that, 3 and a half weeks into a \ndebate, to try to reduce our kids from smoking, that all of a sudden \nsomebody thinks, ``Oh, my gosh, there is a budget point of order we \nought to bring,'' is rather extraordinary in and of itself. There is no \nway to hide. The old saying is, ``You can run, but you can't hide.'' \nYou can run from the tobacco bill, but you can't hide from the effect \nof the vote.\n  The effect of the vote today, or tomorrow, or whenever it occurs, \nwill be either to side with children in order to reduce smoking in this \ncountry or to side with the tobacco companies. I know that there are \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who are running around with \npolls that have been taken, and those polls show, ``Gee whiz, some \npeople in the country are beginning to see this bill differently.'' And \nthat is because millions of dollars have been spent by the tobacco \ncompanies to present a rather one-sided point of view.\n  But the fact is that most people in America understand that they want \ntheir kids to be able to stop smoking. They want their kids to not be \nexposed to the increasing number of pressures that are applied to young \npeople with respect to smoking, and they know that in States like \nMassachusetts, Arizona, California, and others there are very effective \noutreach efforts that are being made with young people that are \nreducing smoking.\n  In the State of Massachusetts, we have seen a reduction of some 30 \npercent over the last few years because of a very intensive State \nprogram which needs more help. The people in the State know that they \ncan change that 30 percent into 70 percent or 80 percent if they have \nadequate capacity to be able to do that, adequate resources for \nmaterials, for outreach, adequate cessation programs, and adequate \ncounteradvertising to the impact of the millions of dollars that the \ntobacco companies spend. All of these things are critical to the \nability of kids to be able to make up their mind.\n  I think most of us in the Senate understand that kids are most \nimpressionable with respect to something like smoking at the ages of \n11, 12, 13, all the way through their teens. No one here disputes the \nfact that every single analysis shows that 86 percent of all the \nsmokers in America began when they were teenagers. Eighty-six percent \nof the adults who today are hooked on nicotine, on tobacco, began as \nteenagers. Ninety percent of the kids in America recognize Joe Camel \nmore than they do--or equivalent to--Mickey Mouse. And the statistics \nshow that of those cigarettes advertised, Newport, Marlboro, and so \nforth, the brands that have the highest level of advertising, are the \nbrands that kids smoke but not the brands that adults smoke, which \ntells you a story--that when they become adults, they make a different \nset of choices than just the bombardment of advertising. But when they \nare kids, the cigarette they pick up is the cigarette that is most put \nand shoved in front of them by the advertising. There isn't anybody who \ndoesn't understand.\n  The Senator from Arizona has talked about the impact on his 13-year-\nold daughter of movies--the ``Titanic,'' for instance, Leonardo \nDiCaprio, who spends his whole time in the movie smoking when he isn't \nfighting water. I mean that is basically the heart of what the Senator \nfrom Arizona has said affected his child.\n  And all across this country, Mr. President, those are the kinds of \ninfluences. There isn't a parent in America who doesn't understand \nthat. There isn't a person of reasonable common sense who doesn't \nunderstand that.\n  So why don't we try to do something about affecting the impact of \nthose role models and the impact of the pressures of young people. We \nhave had testimony from a young woman--and she is not alone, this is \njust one example--who talked about when she was a teenager, she thought \nit was going to make her look older if she smoked. She thought it was \ngoing to make her more acceptable to teenagers who were older than her; \nshe could run in a group that somehow made her feel better. So she \nstarted smoking. Today she is in a wheelchair and raising a couple of \nkids because she developed a smoking-related disease in her lungs. She \nhas had a lung transplant, and she looks older. She tells people of the \nimpact of smoking on her life.\n  Are we going to just ignore that in the Senate--all of the evidence \nof what the tobacco companies have done through the years saying they \ntargeted kids? They know they have got to have replacement smokers. \nHere we have an opportunity to vote, and our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have decided they are going to side with the tobacco \ncompanies.\n  That is what the vote before the Senate will be, plainly and clearly. \nYou cannot make it into some sort of subterfuge. You cannot run and \nhide by a budget waiver. You cannot create some parliamentary trick. \nAnd you certainly cannot duck with one cloture vote and suggest that \nthis issue, which we have spent 3\\1/2\\ weeks on, is going to go away.\n  Who is for this bill, Mr. President? Well, there are more than 40 \nDemocrats prepared to vote for this bill now. So there will be no \nquestion if this bill doesn't move forward as to why it can't move \nforward. But every single public health group in America is for this \nbill. The lung and cancer associations are for this bill. All of the \nsurgeon generals of our country are for this bill. Teachers are for \nthis bill. Child care and day care specialists are for this bill. Forty \nattorneys general across the country want this bill.\n  Who is opposed? Who is opposed? The tobacco companies. The tobacco \ncompanies and some number of Republicans who choose to be with them. \nThat is who is opposed to this bill--the tobacco companies. No one else \nis spending millions of dollars trying to characterize this bill on a \ndaily basis in the Nation. No one else is out there suggesting that \nsomehow what the tobacco companies agreed to do, which is raise the \nprice of cigarettes, is a tax increase.\n  I hear these Senators who come to the floor and say, oh, this is a \ntax increase; we can't do that. That is a phony argument, Mr. \nPresident. That is looking for an umbrella to hide under. That is a way \nof running around and trying to find something to hang your hat on, not \nwanting to do what most health care advocates--teachers, child care \nspecialists, surgeon generals, attorneys general, and others of this \ncountry--want to do. The only beneficiaries if this bill does not go \nthrough are the tobacco companies, plain and simple.\n  The fact is that we have never heard anybody be able to dispute the \nnotion that of the 60,000-plus kids who in the course of this debate \nhave begun smoking, somewhere in the vicinity of 20,000 of them are \ngoing to die early. And they are going to die at the expense of every \nother citizen in America. We have heard a lot of concern by the people \nwho come to the floor and talk about how terrible the raising of a pack \nof cigarettes is going to be for the blue-collar worker who is going to \nbuy the pack of cigarettes, but no one in the Government is telling \nthem they have to go buy the pack of cigarettes. But that very same \nperson who is buying the pack of cigarettes, or all of those families \nwho do not buy a pack of cigarettes are paying a lot more of their \nhard-earned tax dollars to cover the costs of those people who get \nsick-- Medicare and Medicaid, Government dollars paid, tax dollars paid \nout to the tune of $25 billion a year because of people who are sick \nbecause of smoking. The cost of smoking is far greater to the average \ntaxpayer than the cost of the rise in the price of cigarettes.\n\n  You cannot hide under that one. That is not what is happening here. \nThat is not what this is all about. What we are seeing is a fear by \nsome in the House of Representatives that they might have to actually \nvote on this bill. What we are seeing here is that Newt Gingrich and \nsome of those in the House have put a contract out on this bill. They \ndo not want this bill. They want their friends in the Senate to kill \nthis bill so they do not have to vote on it.\n  But this bill will not go away. It will not go away for the next \nmonths in the election. It will not go away even on the floor of the \nSenate, because somewhere, sometime, somehow it is going to keep coming \nback. You cannot run away from a bill that has most of the people in \nthis country believing it is a good bill, who believe it is an \nimportant objective.\n  Now, if it isn't good--I heard one Senator say, ``I can't vote for \nthat bill;\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nit's all loaded up.'' Who loaded it up? Mostly Republican amendments \nthat have been passed for things that have nothing to do with smoking. \nThere were Republicans who came to the floor and said, ``We have to \nhave a bill that has a tax cut in it; we can't vote for a bill without \na tax cut.'' So almost one-third of the money of this bill has now been \nvoted to go to a tax cut. So the Republicans got their tax cut.\n  Then a Republican came to the floor and said, ``I can't vote for a \nbill that doesn't have a drug plan in it.'' So we had a big debate and \nnow the bill has a drug plan in it.\n  And then we have three different attempts to try to curb attorneys' \nfees. People said, ``I can't vote for a bill that is going to have a \nwhole lot of money that wasn't earned going out to attorneys,'' \nnotwithstanding the fact that not one penny has been paid to attorneys, \nnor will the money be paid out of the bill because it is being paid by \nthe companies.\n  But leaving that reality aside, the Senate nevertheless passed a curb \non attorneys' fees. So our friends on the Republican side of the aisle \nare not going to say no to this bill because it does not have a tax \ncut. They are not going to say no to this bill because it doesn't have \na fat and firm clamp on attorneys' fees. They are not going to say no \nto this bill because it doesn't have a drug plan. They are going to \nwind up saying no to this bill because that is what the tobacco \ncompanies want them to do.\n  So that is the choice. That will be the choice today--very, very \nclear--a choice between kids and the tobacco companies. And anybody who \nsuggests, oh, no, I am not for the tobacco companies; I just want to \nmake a good bill, let's make a good bill. Let's vote on the amendments \nthe way we have been doing to make a good bill. And there is not \nanybody in the Senate who does not understand that this bill is going \nto go to a conference committee if the House ever voted on it, and it \nhas the ability to be rewritten in that conference committee and to \ncome back to the Senate differently.\n  In the 14 years I have been here, I have seen plenty of legislation \nleave this floor where one side or the other disagreed bitterly with \nsome component of it but everybody knew it would be fixed in conference \ncommittee. Why is it suddenly they do not want this bill, of all the \nbills, to go to the conference committee? They do not want to let it be \nfixed. They do not want to give it the opportunity to come back to the \nSenate in a shape that might be voted on, because that is not what the \ntobacco companies want. They do not want a bill. They walked away from \nall of this. It was fine.\n  I know there are Senators on the other side of the aisle who were \nready to vote for this bill only a few weeks ago, or even a few months \nago, when the tobacco companies were part of the process. It was a good \nidea. Oh, yes, it is inevitable; we are going to do that; we are going \nto fix it up for our kids.\n  But all of a sudden after the money has been spent, after all of the \nflow of those tobacco dollars, there is a different attitude in the \nSenate about what is possible and what is not possible. I respectfully \nsuggest that no one is able to pull a curtain down over that reality. \nIf people want to fix this bill, we can fix this bill.\n  Every piece of legislation that came to the floor this year came to \nthe floor with a Republican cloture motion attached to it--every bill. \nEvery bill has had limited debate, except for this bill. Every bill we \nhad to push through here rapidly, except for this bill. This is the one \nbill where there is one identifiable group that does not want it, and \nthat identifiable group has enlisted soldiers in its army. The question \nis going to be whether or not the Senate has the courage to stand up \nand say: We are going to fix this bill; we are going to work on this \nbill; we can bring this bill together.\n  We could have had any number of discussions about how to fix any \nnumber of difficult components of the bill, but the bottom line reality \nis that every study shows in order to keep kids from smoking, you have \nto raise the price of cigarettes. Even the tobacco companies agreed to \nthat. Even the tobacco companies agreed to that.\n  They came to an agreement in a global settlement, where they agreed \nto raise the price of cigarettes. But it is only when that rise in the \nprice of cigarettes was geared to be something meaningful, that would \nactually have an impact on kids smoking, and only when they began to \nsee that there were still going to be some lawsuits they would have to \ndefend, that they began to see the balance differently.\n  Frankly, there were some of us in the Senate who thought we \nunderstood that there was a legitimacy to trying to create that balance \nand hold it differently. But I think most people in the Senate \nunderstand that anything that is to go to the conference committee will \ncome back with an ability to try to find that balance again and find \nthe ability to pass a good piece of legislation.\n  I know there are some colleagues on the other side of the aisle who \nare very uncomfortable with what is happening. There are friends of \nmine, members of the Republican Party, who want to vote for a bill, who \nwant to do something for kids, who want to be able to help out. I know \nthere are some feeling the difficulty of what is happening right now. \nMy hope is that people will simply recognize the reality. This is not \nan issue that grew up spontaneously within the Democratic caucus. This \nis not an issue that became the brainchild of some political strategy \non behalf of Democrats. This is something that grew up out of kids and \nparents and teachers and doctors and health care specialists and \nsurgeons general and scientific evidence, and even the tobacco \ncompanies' own documents, which gave birth to the notion that raising \nthe price of cigarettes is a critical component of reducing teenage \nsmoking.\n  I read those documents on the floor of the Senate a number of weeks \nago--I guess maybe last week. It is all somewhat of a blur at this \npoint. But the Senate knows the tobacco companies have acknowledged \nthat they lost business when they raised the price of cigarettes. They \nknow, as all evidence shows, that no group in America is more price \nsensitive, more subject to the pressures of how much cash they have in \ntheir pockets and what they spend it on, than young people.\n  So we have the ability to make a difference. The choice before the \nSenate is really going to be very clear. My hope, obviously, is that \nthe Senate will act responsibly. If we are not happy with the bill in \nits current form, notwithstanding the fact that there are 40-plus \nDemocrats prepared to vote for it in its current form, then we should \ncontinue to work and continue to be serious, rather than to continue an \neffort that just wants to kill it for the victory for those individuals \nand entities who want that victory, rather than putting together a \nmeaningful piece of legislation.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Massachusetts \nfor his remarks. I thought maybe it would be useful to come to the \nfloor and just review how we got to where we are, why this legislation \nis important, and why it matters to American families.\n  Months ago, I was called by our leader, Senator Daschle, and he asked \nme to head up the task force for Democratic Senators on the issue of \ntobacco. He did so after the settlement was agreed to in June of last \nyear between the attorneys general, representing about 40 States, and \nthe tobacco industry. That settlement, which was advertised as a \nsettlement of close to $400 billion over a 25-year period, was also a \nsettlement which was designed to not only raise prices to discourage \nconsumption, but was also designed to have countertobacco advertising, \nsmoking cessation, smoking prevention programs--all of it designed, \nreally, to safeguard the public health and to reduce youth smoking.\n\n  The focus was on reducing youth smoking, because we all know the vast \nmajority of smokers take it up as teenagers; about 90 percent of \nsmokers start before they are age 19. Nearly half start smoking before \nthe age of 14. As the tobacco industry has revealed in the documents \nthat have come out in the court cases, if somebody is not hooked when \nthey are young, they do not get hooked. That is why the tobacco \nindustry has put such a focus on young people. That is why they have \nmarketed to young people. That is why they have advertised to young \npeople.\n\n[[Page S6444]]\n\n Because they know that is the future of their business.\n  I have read on the floor of the Senate quote after quote of the \nindustry itself that have demonstrated that was the rationale behind \nthe tobacco industry strategy. It was a business strategy: You target \nyoung people because people don't start smoking when they are older. \nThey don't start smoking later in life because they have seen enough to \nknow that it is not a very pretty habit, and they also get a sense of \nthe health risk involved.\n  So this is really a question of trying to encourage young people not \nto take up the habit. The industry has to get some people to be \nreplacement smokers because they are losing over 400,000 customers a \nyear. They are losing them to death. This is the only legal product \nsold in America that, when used as intended by its manufacturers, \naddicts and kills its customers. That is strong language. Those are \nstrong words. But they are the truth.\n  After accepting Senator Daschle's assignment to head up the task \nforce on tobacco, we held about 25 hearings across the country. Many of \nthem were here in Washington. We listened to every point of view from \nany people who wanted to have a chance to express themselves. We \nlistened to the tobacco industry. We listened to those who are in the \ndistribution chain. We listened to the convenience store owners. We \nlistened to the vending machine operators. We listened to tobacco \nfarmers. We listened to Dr. Koop and Dr. Kessler. And we listened to \nthe public health community: The Cancer Society, the Lung Association, \nand many more. We listened to those who are advocates of strong \nlegislation. We listened to those who said Government ought not to be \ninvolved, let this go through the courts.\n  We concluded that it was best if the Government did take action, that \nit was best not to leave it to a free-for-all in the courts that might \nultimately bankrupt these companies. Nobody is out here advocating that \nwe stop the use of tobacco products in this country. After all, there \nare nearly 50 million smokers in America. We have had a bitter \nexperience with prohibition. It does not work. But what could we do \nthat would discourage youth smoking and protect public health?\n  In holding these hearings and listening to the experts and listening \nto just common citizens all across the country, over and over they \nsaid: Look, you need a comprehensive package. Don't just leave this to \nthe courts. If you do, you wind up perhaps bankrupting these companies. \nThat will not end the use of tobacco products in America. Simply, what \nwill happen is we will wind up with a circumstance in which new \ncompanies come and fill in the gap, and the companies that are \nbankrupted will have no capability to cover the costs that they have \nimposed on society. Those are very, very significant costs. Those costs \nare variously estimated at $130 billion of costs being imposed on this \nsociety--$130 billion a year.\n  The legislation before us would require the industry to pay $18 or \n$20 billion a year when fully phased in. That in no way covers the \ncosts they are imposing on society. But that is not all the people who \ncame before our task force told us. They said: You have to have a \ncomprehensive plan. Yes, you have to raise prices to discourage \nconsumption, but you need to do much more than that. You have to have \nthe Food and Drug Administration have regulatory authority over this \nproduct, just like they have regulatory authority over other drugs in \nthis society. But you have to go further than that. You have to have a \ncomprehensive plan of public health. You have to have countertobacco \nadvertising, so people hear a message other than the message they get \nfrom the tobacco industry, with the billions of dollars a year they \nspend in advertising and marketing. And you also have to have smoking \ncessation and smoking prevention programs to help those who are about \nto start, to give them a chance not to be hooked; and for those who are \naddicted, to give them every assistance in stopping.\n\n  (Mr. GREGG assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, obviously, there is more to the program \nthan those elements, because we have to remember how this all started. \nIt started with the States bringing legal actions against the tobacco \nindustry. They are the ones that had the initial settlement with the \ntobacco industry. So, obviously, the States have to be compensated for \nthe legal actions that they have pending.\n  In addition, the Federal Government has potential actions against the \ntobacco industry, because Federal taxpayers are paying for Medicare and \nMedicaid and veterans' health programs, all of them that have had costs \nimposed on them because of the use of tobacco products.\n  Mr. President, it was those concerns that led this Congress to take \naction. It was those concerns that led the Commerce Committee to \nconsider the legislation sponsored by Senator McCain, and they reported \nout a bill on a 19-to-1 vote, an overwhelming vote.\n  In the Senate, we have considered a series of amendments that have \nsomewhat altered the work that they did in the Commerce Committee. We \nhave considered amendments to provide a significant tax reduction in \naddition to the other provisions that were in the bill. About a third \nof the money now will go for a tax reduction.\n  But there is more than that. There has also been amendments added \nthat deal with the question of illegal drug use in this country. The \nCoverdell amendment that was adopted here on a very strong vote is \nincluded in this legislation.\n  What we now have before us is really a comprehensive package. A lot \nof people say, ``Gee, this isn't my idea of a perfect bill.'' It is not \nmy idea of a perfect bill either, but we have not yet completed action \non it. That is the legislative process--to take a package, to work on \nit, to offer amendments and to have the votes of Senators dictate the \noutcome. That is the way it works. So far, that process has gone \nreasonably well.\n  Again, we certainly don't have a perfect bill, but it is one which is \ncomprehensive in nature and does offer the prospects of protecting the \npublic health and reducing youth smoking. We have 420,000 people dying \nevery year in this country because of tobacco-related illness. That is \na statistic, but it is a statistic that has 420,000 different stories \nbehind it. In hearing after hearing, we heard those stories. We heard \nthe suffering of families and of individuals who have been hooked on \ntobacco products and have suffered the consequences.\n  I remember so well a Pierce Fravenheim, big tough guy in Newark, NJ, \na former football player, football coach, assistant principal. When he \ncame to testify, you could barely hear him speak. You could barely hear \nhim speak because after a lifetime of smoking, he developed cancer of \nthe larynx. He had undergone a laryngectomy. He told us of the terror \nhe felt when the doctor told him he was going to die unless they did \nthis procedure, and even if they did it, he might not survive.\n  In a way, he is lucky because he did survive, and he is there to tell \nthe story. He told us how deeply he hoped that others could be \ndissuaded from taking up the habit, how deeply he hoped that others \nwould not experience the terror he felt when the doctor told him he \nmight die.\n\n  There are hundreds and thousands of stories just like Pierce \nFravenheim's that we heard as we went around the country listening to \npeople, many of them begging us to pass legislation that would do \nsomething to deter others from taking up a habit that would addict \nthem, that would create disease in them and that would ultimately kill \nthem.\n  Again, nobody is out here proposing that we have prohibition, make \nthe product illegal. Nobody is proposing that. But we are proposing \ncomprehensive legislation to try to do something to lessen the hurt, \nthe pain, the suffering and the loss of life that occurs directly \nbecause of the use of these products.\n  Mr. President, there are those who will take this bill and flyspeck \nit, and they will have 100 reasons to be against it, maybe several \nhundred reasons to be against it. That is the nature of a comprehensive \nbill. I could probably point to dozens of different provisions that I \ndon't particularly like in this bill, but that isn't the question.\n  The question before this body is whether or not we are going to \nadvance, whether or not we are going to move forward, whether or not we \nare going to give this legislation a chance\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\nor whether or not we are going to snuff it out right here today on the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate and say, ``No, we give in; the big tobacco \nindustry advocates and defenders win.''\n  I hope that is not the outcome here today, Mr. President. The tobacco \nindustry does not exactly come to this Chamber with its credibility \nintact. The tobacco industry came before Congress and said, ``Oh, no, \nour products don't cause health problems.'' At the time they said it, \nthey knew, and the documents reveal that their products cause serious \nhealth problems. And that same industry came before this Congress and \nsaid, ``Oh, no, we don't target children; we wouldn't do that. It is \nillegal to sell to children.''\n  We now know from the documents of the industry itself that, in fact, \nthey have targeted children. In fact, they have targeted kids as young \nas 12 years old, and I have shown the charts and the quotes day after \nday on the floor of the Senate that demonstrate conclusively that they \nhave targeted our kids. This industry has come before the Congress and \nsaid, ``We don't have nicotine in there to addict people. It is not \naddictive.'' And yet, again, their own documents reveal that nicotine \nis addictive. In fact, their own documents compare it to cocaine and to \nmorphine. These are their words, not my words.\n  This same industry has come before Congress, and they have told us, \n``Look, we have not manipulated nicotine levels to further addict our \ncustomers,'' and when you look at the record, when you look at the \ndocuments, what you find is that is precisely what they have done.\n  This industry does not come with a great deal of credibility to this \nChamber in arguing on behalf of this legislation. Rather, I should say \nin opposition to this legislation, because they have made it clear, \nalthough they supported a version early on that would have basically \ntaken their settlement and made that into a legislative vehicle, they \nsupported that, but as soon as we started stripping away the special \nprotection that was in that proposed settlement, an amendment by the \noccupant of the Chair, an amendment that was adopted overwhelmingly in \nthe U.S. Senate and stripped out all the special protection that this \nindustry was seeking, special protection that was unprecedented, \nspecial protection never provided any other industry in the history of \nour country, all of a sudden they said, ``Oh, no, we don't want \nanything to do with this legislation. If we can't get special, \nunprecedented protection, we're out of here.'' That is what the tobacco \nindustry said. Now the tobacco industry is in total opposition. And day \nafter day, hour after hour, we hear their adds in the national media \nopposing this legislation, attacking this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, it is important, I think, for us to understand what is \nhere and what is not. We have, I think, the best indication: The recent \npolling that has been done that shows the American people strongly \nsupport this bill. It is different than saying this legislation is \ntheir top priority, because it is not.\n  The American people have lots of things to be concerned about. They \nare concerned about their jobs; they are concerned about getting their \nkids into college and paying for it; they are concerned about having \ntheir families safe and secure in their neighborhoods; they are \nconcerned about the health care of their parents and of themselves and \nof their children.\n  Mr. President, they are also concerned about doing something to \nprotect their kids from the addiction, disease, and death brought by \nthe use of tobacco products. Most recent polling shows very clearly the \nAmerican people support this legislation. When they are asked to choose \nbetween this legislation and no legislation, they say, ``Pass this \nbill.'' By 2-to-1 margins they say, ``Pass this bill.''\n  This is a poll that was just taken by the ENACT Coalition. It shows \nthe voters in the United States support this bill by 66 percent to 32 \npercent.\n  It is interesting, because we are going to have a vote, perhaps \ntoday, on the question of whether or not we move forward. Some will \nsay, ``Let's just kill the bill.'' That is what the tobacco industry \nwants. That is their argument. And their defenders and their apologists \nwill be making that argument. The American people say, ``Pass this \nbill.'' Let us have a chance to protect the public health and reduce \nyouth smoking.\n  Mr. President, I am very hopeful that my colleagues will let us move \nto conclusion on this legislation. We are now in the fourth week of \nconsideration on the floor of the Senate--4 weeks. We ought to complete \nour work. We ought to send this bill to the House of Representatives, \ngive them a chance to do their work, and then go to the conference \ncommittee to work out the differences and produce legislation that can \nbe brought back to both Chambers for a final decision. But we should \nnot end the process now. We should not kill this bill before it has \neven cleared the first hurdle.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will say yes to protecting our \nkids' health and say no to the tobacco industry that has waged a \ncampaign of deception and diversion in an attempt to delay and \nultimately derail this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this bill. And I \ntake offense to some of the comments that were made by some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle who said, that anybody who \nwants to kill this bill is an instrument of big tobacco.\n  That s simply not true. I did not support this deal when the tobacco \nindustry and the administration and attorneys general got together and \nmade a deal. They didn't consult this Senator. I was never in favor of \nthe deal they were in favor of that some people have tried to promote \nand some people have tried to push, including, this administration. So \nlet me just make that very clear.\n  Now, I have many reasons to oppose this bill, and I am going to \nenumerate these. Not one of them has anything to do with the way the \ntobacco industry wants this Senator to vote. And so people making \nallegations--I wonder if that can be turned the other way around, but I \nam not going to do that. I do not impugn people's motives or their \nintegrity. I think people have the right to make decisions on whether \nor not legislation is good legislation or bad.\n\n  I spent a little bit of time studying this legislation. And everybody \nis entitled to their own opinion. They can brag on the legislation; \nthey can be critical of it. I am going to be critical of it. I have \nread the legislation.\n  First, let me just comment on a comment that the President made. It \nwas reported in the Washington Post recently, Monday June 15. This past \nMonday, President Clinton said his critics contend that ``this [is a] \ndark scheme in Washington to build some new federal bureaucracy, and \nit's the biggest load of hooey I ever heard in my life.''\n  So President Clinton thinks that those of us who are critical of this \nlegislation, who say this is just a big bureaucracy, that that is just \na big bunch of hooey--as a matter of fact, ``the biggest load of hooey \nI ever heard in my life.''\n  I told my colleagues this is one of the worst pieces of legislation I \nhave seen in my Senate career. The only thing I can think of that was \nworse was the health care legislation promoted by President and Mrs. \nClinton.\n  Mr. President, this chart that was put together by the Budget \nCommittee, showing where the money was coming from, where the money \ngoes, on Commerce I--and that was the bill that was reported out of the \nCommerce Committee--shows that the President was incorrect. This is a \nlot of new government. There are about 30 new programs, spending \nhundreds of billions of dollars, all above budget, all outside the \nbudget. So I just think the President is incorrect. And I wanted to \nmake that comment. He is entitled to his own opinion, but I think we \nare entitled to look at the bill and we are entitled to look at the \nfacts.\n  This is Commerce II. This is the bill that the administration \nbasically had rewritten--the bill. And this is the bill that we have on \nthe floor, although it has been added to. And we have new mandates and \nnew spending, and a tax cut and a drug provision. I don't show those on \nthis chart. But this is the current bill that we have before us.\n  There is a lot of new government in this. So the President calls its\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\n``hooey.'' My comment is, these just happen to be the facts. That is \nwhat this bill has in it. This bill has a lot of money in it. It has a \nlot of spending in it. And I want to get into that because a lot of \npeople have said, ``Well, this bill, it is really only a $65 billion \nbill. It only raises taxes by $65 billion.'' And this Senator, for one, \nhas been saying, ``Wait a minute. It's a lot more than that.''\n  Where does this thing say in this bill, if you look at the bill and \nlook at the language of the bill--and I would encourage my colleagues \nto do so, and anybody else. I had to ask unanimous consent to get the \nbill printed. The committee printed the Commerce I. They did not print \nCommerce II. This is the bill we have before us that is now printed on \nthe Senators' desks.\n  If they would look at the bill, maybe look at page 183 of the bill, \nit talks about annual payments. The bill does not say anything about 65 \ncents a pack; it does not say anything about $1.10 a pack. It does say \nconsumers pay $10 billion the first year, $14 billion the second year, \n$15 billion the third year, $17 billion the fourth year, and $21 \nbillion in the fifth year, without even considering look-back \npenalties.\n  So if you total that, that is all $102 billion. That is what the bill \nsays--$23.6 billion in the fifth year. And after that, those amounts \nare adjusted by inflation. That is on page 183 of the bill.\n  If you put those figures in and you adjust them for inflation--it \nsays 3 percent or inflation, whichever is greater. I just plugged in 3 \npercent. You do that, and you come out with $755 billion over 25 years. \nWhat is this nonsense we hear, ``Well, we think it's only $516 \nbillion''? This is $755 billion. That is in the bill. That is what we \nare considering, not $516 billion.\n  And then the look-back potential. I show $130 billion of look-back \npotential. I say ``potential'' because it can be assessed. No one knows \nexactly how much that will be. But evidently a lot of people felt it \nshould be much more, because this chart is obsolete.\n  My colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, had an amendment to \nincrease this to $7.7 billion and then index that for inflation. As a \nmatter of fact, if you put the new figures into the chart, this $130 \nbillion goes to a maximum of $241 billion. So you add that to the $755 \nbillion and you get really right at $1 trillion--$1 trillion potential \ntax on consumers. And I say ``tax on consumers'' advisedly, because \nthis bill mandates that 100 percent of this money be paid for by \nconsumers. It does not say, ``Tobacco companies, you pay this.'' \nBasically, it says, ``Tobacco companies, you pass this cost on. You \npass every dime of this on.''\n  So I make the point we are talking about, President Clinton may think \nit is a bunch of hooey, but this is a big government bill.\n  It has lots of new agencies and hundreds of billions of dollars of \nnew spending. With the new look-back potential, up to $1 trillion in \nmoney transferred from consumers to government.\n  I make those points because I think it is important that we know the \nfacts. Some people say this is not a budget buster, this is \nresponsible, we are raising taxes. This bill doesn't say anything about \ntaxes. It says these funds shall be paid, and 100 percent of the funds \nshall be passed on to consumers. It is not clear. It is not direct. It \nis confusing. And it is hard to tell exactly who is taxed how much.\n  I will give an example. If a person looked at page 186 of the bill, \nwe find out there are exclusions for some companies. To give an \nexample--I looked this up--Marlboro, a Philip Morris brand, would have \nto pay presumably a price per pack of $1.10 more; this brand, \nChesterfield, by the Ligget Group, pays zero. Now, both companies \npresently pay 24 cents per pack. Both of them do. Under this bill, \nsupposedly, the price per pack on this item goes up $1.10; the price on \nthis item goes up zero. So they will have a $1.10 advantage over all \nother competitors. Why? Because their sale volume isn't so large? Wait \na minute; is that good tax policy? They have the same excise taxes \ntoday, but we are going to give a $1.10 advantage to one company versus \nanother company? We do that in this bill? That doesn't make sense.\n  We did the same thing in other tobacco products. Looking at smokeless \ntobacco, again if a person looked at page 186, we find out some \ncompanies have a significant differential. This product, Copenhagen, is \nmade by U.S. Tobacco Company. This product is Kodiak, made by Conwood \nCompany. Both have a current excise tax of 2.7 cents per product.\n  This product made by U.S. Tobacco, the new tax increase is 82.5 \ncents; that is a 3,056-percent increase. This product, the tax increase \nis 57.8 cents; that is a 2,141-percent increase. This has a 25-cent \nadvantage under this bill. This product has a 25-cent advantage. Why \nshould we be choosing winners and losers in this bill? Is that good tax \npolicy? Is that good consumer policy? We will encourage some people to \nbuy this product over another product, but in the language in this bill \non page 186, it gives certain items a competitive advantage over their \ncompetitors. Is that right? Is that in this bill? Sure it is in this \nbill. It is on page 186. I mentioned it on the floor before, and at \nsome point I plan on addressing it if this bill stays on the floor.\n  So the President said it wasn't a bunch of new government and I \nshowed the charts. There is a lot of new government, tons of new \ngovernment. There are new taxes that run into almost $1 trillion over \n25 years. The money is all off budget, and that bothers me.\n  Somebody was complaining Republicans may make a budget point of \norder. We well should. If a person looked at page 181 of the bill, \ntalking about the national trust fund, it says, ``The amount of such \nappropriations shall not be included in the estimates required under \nsection 251 of the act,'' talking about the Budget Act. So all the \nappropriations that were mandated out of this trust fund shall not be \nincluded in the budget, the budget that the President signed just last \nyear with both Houses, the House and the Senate, and I will say with \nbipartisan support. We finally did get a budget that was supported by \nDemocrats and Republicans. The President said we will stay by these \ncaps. Even at the State of the Union, we will not spend one dime, not \none dime unless we don't cut taxes. We want to save Social Security.\n  But what he does in this bill is basically ignore the budget. The \nbudget makes no difference. All this spending, hundreds of billions of \ndollars, are over and above the budget. They don't count towards the \ncap. They don't count toward the budget. It is over and above. All the \ntaxes are above, all the expenditures are outside the budget realm. So \ncertainly a budget point of order lies against this bill. As a matter \nof fact, if we don't make a budget point of order, I think we just \nmight as well say we don't have a budget. There is no need to have a \nbudget. There is not a budget.\n  Why should the conferees, and I am a conferee on the budget for this \nyear's budget, why should we worry about a budget if we are going to \npass a bill that has tax increases and expenditures larger than any tax \ncut that anybody else is talking about in the budget that the President \nsigned last year or in the budget that we are talking about this year? \nThis has a larger tax increase, larger spending increase, than either \nthe budget that was passed last year or the one that is contemplated \nfor this year. So why have a budget, if it will all be outside the \nbudget as stipulated on page 181 of the bill?\n  So my colleague who earlier said we have taken a poll and now the \npeople by some majority support this bill--they don't know what is in \nthis bill. If you told the people that we are giving one brand of \ncigarettes an advantage of at least $1.10 over another brand, would \nthey say that is fair? Don't we have a constitutional responsibility to \nbe fair? Or if you are giving one smokeless tobacco product a \ncompetitive advantage over another one, does that make sense?\n  What about some of the other tax provisions--if a person looked at \npage 104 of the bill, it talks about the look-back assessment. The \nlook-back penalties, which I mentioned in the earlier charts \noriginally, were $2 billion under the settlement, $4 billion under the \nCommerce Committee bill, Commerce II, the last bill we had on the \nfloor, and then we had an amendment to increase the look-backs to $7.7 \nbillion a year and index those for inflation. Who determines whether \nthere is a look-back penalty or assessment or tax? The Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services.\n\n[[Page S6447]]\n\n How does she determine it? She takes a poll; she does a survey. It is \nin this legislation. She does a survey. I am talking about Secretary \nShalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services. She does a survey, \nand from the survey she has the power to assess fines, penalties or \ntaxes equal to $7.7 billion a year. That is an unbelievable transfer of \nauthority, of taxation authority, to the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices.\n  In her survey, under the legislation, the survey-using methodology \nrequired by this subsection is deemed ``conclusively to be proper, \ncorrect, and accurate for purposes of this act.'' So her survey is \ndeemed by this act, deemed to be correct, deemed to be accurate. And \nshe has the capability to assess fines and penalties up to $7.7 billion \nper year, an unbelievable power of taxation by her survey which \nCongress is deeming to be correct. So they can assess companies $1,000 \nfor whoever answered the survey wrong or inappropriately according to \nher wishes. Unbelievable power.\n  Then we passed an amendment, I believe it is Senator Reed's \namendment, that said we will deny deductibility of advertising to \ntobacco companies if they don't comply with FDA advertising \nrestrictions. That is now part of this bill. What does that mean? FDA \npromulgated a long list of rules which, incidentally, I will comment on \nin a minute. This legislation deems to be law. That is interesting. But \nin the amendment Senator Reed says if they don't comply with FDA \nadvertising restrictions, then they will lose deductions of their \nadvertising. Basically, what we have done now is turned the power to \ntax over to the FDA. Now, that is unconscionable for those who think \nthe power to tax belongs to Congress, not to a bureaucrat, a bureaucrat \nthat may or may not have an agenda.\n  And if one thinks that all the FDA regs are accurate and make sense, \none of the regs is that you can't have any tobacco sponsorship for \nsporting events. The Indianapolis 500 comes to mind. An automobile runs \naround with ``Marlboro'' painted on the side. If you had that, or the \ndriver had ``Marlboro'' on the side, it would be a violation. They \nwould lose deductibility of all their advertising expenses. Or even if \nyou had a hat that said ``Marlboro'' on it, or ``Winston'' or ``Salem'' \nor whatever, any tobacco product, if you had a hat or T-shirt or car \nthat had that emblem, you are violating the FDA advertising \nrestrictions and therefore you would lose your deductibility.\n  So we would have tax policy being set, one, by the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, and another by FDA. The combination of that \nis probably the worst tax policy I can imagine. Unbelievable.\n  On page 99 of the bill, we do something else dealing with FDA \nregulations, and Congress is a legislative body. We are supposed to \nlegislate. If we want to ban advertising of tobacco products, we should \ndo it. Somebody should introduce a bill to ban advertising. We didn't \ndo that. FDA promulgated some rules restricting tobacco sales, labeling \nand advertising.\n\n  On page 99, it talks about the rules, and it says, ``The code of \nFederal regulations dealing with tobacco are hereby deemed to be lawful \nand to have been lawfully promulgated by the secretary under Chapter 9 \nin Section 701 of the Food and Drug Act.'' Here is a whole list of FDA \nregulations. This bill deems them to be the law, makes them the law. I \nam bothered by that. If somebody wants to make it the law, let them try \nto pass a bill--we are the legislative body, not FDA--not taking a \nwhole section of FDA regs, some of which make no sense whatsoever, some \nof which are not workable.\n  Here is one example. One reg deals with checking IDs, identification \non people when they purchase tobacco products. Every State in the \nNation has a law, and it is against the law to sell tobacco products to \nteenagers, people less than 18. Some States have higher age limits. \nThey said we need to check that, and the rule said they are going to \ncheck the identification of people up to age 27. And if a convenience \nstore, or something, doesn't comply, they are subjected to fines and \npenalties, which range, for the fifth violation, up to $10,000. Wait a \nminute, that isn't in the bill. But the bill says they are all deemed \nto be lawful. So we are making it law by this one paragraph on page 99.\n  Now, if we stay on this bill, I am going to have an amendment saying, \nwait a minute, should it be against the law for a convenience store not \nto check the identification of people up to age 27? The law is 18. You \ncould have a combat veteran of the Persian Gulf who is 26 years old and \nhas four kids, and somebody could be fined up to $10,000 if they don't \ncheck his ID. Obviously, he is older than 18. Yet, the FDA reg says you \ncheck their identification, and if they are less than 26 or 27 and you \ndidn't check the ID, you are subject to fines and penalties up to \n$10,000. And we are codifying that; we are deeming that to be lawful. \nThat bothers me. That is crummy legislating. That is not good \nlegislation.\n  We have another provision that I don't even know many of our \ncolleagues are aware of. They had better become aware of it if, Heaven \nforbid, this becomes law. This bill prohibits smoking of cigarettes in \nalmost any building in the United States. I will read you the language. \nIt prohibits the ``smoking of cigarettes, cigars, pipes, and any other \ncombustion of tobacco within a facility or on a facility or property \nwithin the immediate vicinity of the entrance to the facility.'' I \ncould go on. How is ``facility'' defined? It means ``any building used \nfor purposes that effect interstate or foreign commerce, regularly \nentered by 10 or more individuals at least one day per week.''\n  Unbelievable. Unless you have a real small building, you are going to \nbe covered by this ban. So we are banning smoking on almost every \nsingle building--certainly every business building in the United \nStates, or significant business building. Are people aware of that? \nWhat kind of fines and penalties will be imposed if you don't comply \nwith that? I could go on and on.\n  My point is, when I heard my colleague say, ``We think the public \nsupports this bill,'' maybe a lot of the public really haven't looked \nat what is in this bill. There are a couple of sections I will point \nout just for the information of our colleagues. I heard somebody say, \n``You can't be opposed to this bill now on attorney's fees,'' because \nwe passed an amendment by one vote that had a limitation on attorney's \nfees. They can only make $4,000 an hour for the old cases and, for \nfuture cases, $500 an hour. Well, Mr. President, there is language in \nthis bill that is an invitation for litigation that would not stop, \nthat would be probably the most expensive litigation piece I have ever \nseen. There is a presumption. I will just read this part on page 233 of \nthe bill. It is just a couple of paragraphs, but the paragraphs would \ncost consumers hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\n       General Causation Presumption. In any civil action to which \n     this title applies involving a tobacco claim, there shall be \n     evidentiary presumption that nicotine is addictive and that \n     the diseases identified as being caused by use of tobacco \n     products in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     Reducing the Health Consequences of Smoking: 25 Years of \n     Progress: A Report of the Surgeon General [back in 1989], The \n     Health Consequences of Smoking: Involuntary Smoking [done in \n     1986]; and The Health Consequences of Using Smokeless Tobacco \n     [Health Service in 1986], are caused in whole or in part by \n     the use of tobacco products . . .\n\n  There is an evidentiary presumption that nicotine is addictive and \ndiseases are identified as being caused by using tobacco products. In \nother words: Come sue. Come sue for anything. There are three books, \nand they touch on all kinds of diseases, including diabetes. It can \nhave some little relationship to smoking, and we made a presumption \nthat: tobacco is the fault; come sue. This is an invitation for \nlitigation. Here you go, the trial lawyers will love this. They came \nout with a big one. They may have snuck it in, I don't know. This is a \nbig invitation to sue. I heard Senator Domenici talking about this. I \ncompliment him for raising it on the floor. Other people acted like \nthey didn't know it is in the bill. It is still in the bill. So I make \nthose comments.\n  I will make a couple of other comments. I see my friend from Kentucky \nhere. I have already related the inequity of some of the taxation \nprovisions in this bill dealing with either cigarettes or other tobacco \nproducts. We have currently pending an amendment by my colleague to \nstrike out what some people have referred to as the Lugar provision, \nand I expect that\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\nthere will be an amendment pending to strike out the Ford provision. \nBoth of them deal with compensation for tobacco farmers. I think both \nare too generous. One has a total cost, over 25 years, of $28 billion; \none has a cost of $18 billion. Both would compensate tobacco farmers \nfar in excess of the value of the land--value of the land that you \ncould buy today on the open market, but we would pay several times the \nvalue. I think that is a mistake. I am troubled by that provision.\n  Mr. President, I don't know if this has been entered into the Record. \nI have a letter from the Governors urging opposition to this bill. \nThese are the Governors whose attorneys general originally put together \nthe package that said: Yes, we want to make a deal; we won't sue the \ntobacco companies if you will give us a couple hundred billion dollars \nover the next 25 years--about 8 billion a year. If you give us $8 \nbillion a year, collectively, then we will drop our class action suits. \nThey have now looked at this bill and said: Don't pass it. It is not \nacceptable in its current form.\n  I happen to agree with the Governors--maybe for different reasons--\nbut I don't think this bill is salvageable. I don't think we should \npass it. Does that mean I am against doing something to reduce the \nteenage consumption and addiction of tobacco and drugs? Absolutely not. \nI want to do something. I have indicated that I am willing to pass a \nbill that would be directed, targeted, at reducing teenage consumption \nand addiction to tobacco. Do you have to spend hundreds of billions to \ndo that, as we have in this legislation before us? The answer is no, \nabsolutely not. As a matter of fact, I think what we are doing is \nfunding an addiction of government to more government and doing very \nlittle on tobacco.\n  If we want to do some things to reduce teenage consumption and \naddiction to tobacco, let's do it. We have the HHS appropriation bill. \nWe can put in more money for NIH, for cancer research, for money to \nhave programs to discourage drug consumption, tobacco consumption. \nLet's do that, increase it, and cancel some other programs. We are \nspending now $1.7 trillion per year. Let's move some of that around and \nput it into functions that would actually be targeted at our youth, to \nreduce their addiction and consumption of tobacco. I think that would \nbe a giant step in the right direction.\n  I think passing this legislation is not really targeted to kids; it \nis targeted more to government. The President was absolutely wrong when \nhe said those people who oppose this bill and think it is more \ngovernment, that is a bunch of hooey. I think we did something. We read \nthe bill. This bill is a bunch of hooey. This does not deserve to be \npassed.\n  I think this bill is a serious, serious mistake. If our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle want to increase tobacco taxes, they can do \nso. This bill is, in my opinion, one of the worst pieces of legislation \nthis Congress has considered in my legislative career. It should not \npass. We should defeat this bill. We should defeat it either in the \nform of not agreeing to cloture--we have already had three cloture \nvotes. We may well have one more. I hope my colleagues will not vote \nfor cloture. I hope that a budget point of order, if that is made, will \nbe sustained.\n  This bill is clearly outside the budget. It says so in its language. \nDo we agree with the budget that we passed last year, or are we just \ngoing to ignore it on this issue? We ignored it on the urgent \nsupplemental. We violated the budget on those. There were some \nemergencies. There were some floods and other emergencies required \nfunding and we have done that for before.\n  But to ignore the budget on these programs, all of which are in \ngovernmental entities, or creating governmental entities for new \nprograms--for example, international tobacco control. That is $350 \nmillion a year for the first 5 years, and such sums as necessary for \nthe future years. That is a brand new program. I don't know that we \nneed to fund it. But if we do, let's fund it under the budget. Why have \nit be outside the budget?\n  I look at a lot of these other programs. My colleagues were \nsuccessful in saying, let's spend a couple billion dollars more in \nchild care. We mandated that in this side of the equation. We have the \ntobacco community grants; opportunity grants. We have got a lot of new \nspending. I say that spending should be in the budget. It shouldn't be \noutside the budget.\n  So I urge my colleagues, let's defeat this bill. Let's come back to \nsomething that is responsible, something that is within the realm of \nthe budget agreement.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from of \nGovernors' Association, as well as an article from the Washington Times \non Monday, June 15 that says the tobacco bill is packed with programs \nand agencies be printed in the Record, as well as two charts that I \nreferred to in my speech, one of which is the national tobacco \nsettlement trust fund that shows the total cost of this bill could \neasily well reach $997 billion. That is $745 billion under the annual \nindustry payments; maximum look-back. Maybe that would happen, part of \nit would happen; maybe not.\n  There are some who would say, ``Wait a minute. You didn't take into \nconsideration the volume adjustment.'' The bill said, if volume comes \ndown below 20 percent, there will be some reduction in these industry \npayments. Maybe tobacco consumption would fall by more than 20 percent. \nMaybe it wouldn't. I don't know. It is hard to guess. There might be \nsome reduction on that figure. I don't know. For cost analysis \npurposes, though, I note that the OMB did not figure volume adjustments \ndown within their original proposals. The attorneys general did not in \ntheir original proposal. Since it is impossible to do, I haven't done \nit in mine, either.\n  I make mention of that for the Record, and also ask to have included \na chart that shows the disparity between products of companies.\n  I absolute don't think it is right for us to have different excise \ntaxes on cigarette products because one company sells more than another \ncompany. That doesn't make sense to me. We have that throughout this \nbill. That needs to be remedied. If we stay on the bill, I will have an \namendment to do.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that two charts, a letter, and newspaper \narticles be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 1998.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Thomas A. Daschle,\n     Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Lott and Daschle: When the Senate began floor \n     consideration of S. 1415, Senator McCain's tobacco settlement \n     legislation, the bill included $196.5 billion over twenty-\n     five years for the states and territories to settle their \n     lawsuits against the tobacco industry. Those state lawsuits \n     made possible the development of comprehensive federal \n     tobacco legislation.\n       Governors have made clear from the beginning of the \n     Senate's legislative debate that preserving and protecting \n     state settlement funds would be one of our highest \n     priorities. We agreed to support the state financing section \n     of the McCain-Lott manager's amendment, which included some \n     restrictions on the use of half of the state funds, in \n     exchange for a guarantee that the states would receive at \n     least $196.5 billion over twenty-five years This funding \n     level is consistent wit the amount negotiated between the \n     state attorneys general and the tobacco industry in the \n     original June 20, 1997, agreement. At the same time, the \n     amount of money available to the federal government through \n     the tobacco bill has expanded significantly.\n       Over the past few days, the Senate adopted several \n     amendments that dramatically reduce the amount of money \n     available to the states to settle state lawsuits and restrict \n     state flexibility related to the use of those funds that \n     remain. Some Governors support the goals of the amendments \n     that have been considered by the Senate, but federal \n     priorities should be financed through the federal portion of \n     the bill, rather than through state tobacco settlement funds.\n       The state funding pool has been reduced dramatically below \n     the level to which Governors agreed. At such low levels, \n     Governors must weight the potential of new state tobacco \n     settlement revenues against the reality that a federal \n     increase in the price per pack of cigarettes will result in \n     an offsetting decrease in state cigarette excise tax \n     revenues.\n       Accordingly, the nation's Governors are not able to support \n     the state financing section of S. 1415 as amended. Given the \n     experiences of the four states that have negotiated \n     settlements of their individual lawsuits and the original \n     state attorneys general agreement, the bill no longer places \n     appropriate\n\n[[Page S6449]]\n\n     priority on successfully settling state lawsuits. We urge you \n     to restore the $196.5 billion reserved for the states while \n     the bill is still on the floor of the Senate.\n       In addition, the states must be free to continue to pursue \n     their own lawsuits against the tobacco industry. We strongly \n     urge the Senate to ensure that the language included in S. \n     1415, to clarify that state settlement funds are not subject \n     to federal recoupment, is applied to all states, including \n     those that choose not to participate in the federal \n     settlement.\n       If we, the Executive Committee of the National Governors' \n     Association, can provide you with clarification of our \n     position, please do not hesitate to let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n         Gov. George V. Voinovich, State of Ohio; Gov. Roy Romer, \n           State of Colorado; Gov. Bob Miller, State of Nevada; \n           Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, State of Utah; Gov. Howard \n           Dean, M.D., State of Vermont; Gov. Thomas R. Carper, \n           State of Delaware; Gov. Lawton Chiles, State of \n           Florida; Gov. David M. Beasley, State of South \n           Carolina; Gov. Tommy G. Thompson, State of Wisconsin.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, June 15, 1998]\n\n             Tobacco Bill Is Packed With Programs, Agencies\n\n                          (By Nancy E. Roman)\n\n       The tobacco bill moving through Congress would spend $350 \n     million per year for the first five years and as much ``as \n     may be necessary'' for each year after that to promote \n     smoking awareness abroad.\n       The foreign-aid program is one of many new government \n     functions created in a tobacco bill that raises $92 billion \n     over five years by taxing cigarettes by $1.10 per pack, and \n     uses about $65 billion of that over five years to pay for \n     things ranging from child care to college tuition.\n       The bill would also create new Medicare pilot projects, ban \n     smoking outside public entrances, create new causes for \n     litigation and spend up to $18,000 per American Indian to \n     help them stop smoking.\n       Under the latest printed version of the tobacco bill, a \n     whopping 480-page to me that few have read, the secretary of \n     health and human services is directed to ``promote efforts to \n     share information and provide education internationally about \n     the health, economic, social and other costs of tobacco use . \n     . .''\n       Part of the $350 million for each year through 2004 would \n     be used to ``support the development of appropriate \n     governmental control activities in foreign countries.''\n       The bill would also:\n       Ban smoking inside--and even outside--of public buildings \n     involved in interstate commerce, including almost all retail \n     facilities except restaurants. The bill prohibits smoking \n     ``within the immediate vicinity of the entrance to the \n     facility.'' The only alternative is for facilities that set \n     up a separate smoking section where the air is ``directly \n     exhausted to the outside.''\n       Create a right to sue in federal court for individuals who \n     believe that owners of buildings where they work or live \n     violate this provision. Under the bill, individuals must \n     notify the building owner of his or her intention to sue. \n     After 60 days, if the owner has not corrected the situation, \n     the individual may sue. Civil penalties of up to $5,000 per \n     day may be awarded under the bill. That would be a $1.65 \n     million fine for a one-year violation.\n       Provide up to $1,700 per year in college tuition for \n     tobacco farmers and their family members, including brothers, \n     sisters, stepbrother's, stepsisters, sons-in-law, and \n     daughters-in-law. There are currently two sections of the \n     bill dealing with farmers, and one will have to be struck.\n       Provide as much as $7.6 billion to help American Indians \n     stop smoking, or about $18,000 per American Indian smoker.\n       Under the bill, between 3 percent and 7 percent of the \n     public health trust fund, or as much as $7.6 billion, is set \n     aside for smoking-cessation programs for American Indians, as \n     defined by the Department of the Interior.\n       Under that definition, there are about 1.4 million American \n     Indians, about 406,000 of whom are adult smokers who would \n     qualify. Assuming 39.2 percent of them smoke (the average \n     rate of smoking among American Indians), that would be about \n     $18,800 for each.\n       The original tobacco bill created about 17 new agencies, \n     boards and commissions.\n       New functions for government include setting up a national \n     tobacco document depository, creating tobacco smuggling \n     prevention programs and countering advertising programs.\n       The bill would spend about $13.6 million over five years to \n     consider topics like the effects of smoke on pregnant women \n     and further research on second-hand smoke.\n       A Senate aide who helped draft the bill said research has \n     demonstrated that smoking damages fetuses and that secondhand \n     smoke is dangerous, but it has not shown how it damages \n     fetuses.\n       The bill would require states to license retailers that \n     sell tobacco and bar those retailers form selling cigarettes \n     to minors.\n       All 50 states have already out-lawed selling tobacco to \n     minors. However, this bill requires them to conduct ``monthly \n     random, unannounced inspections of sales or distribution \n     outlets in the state.''\n       The states must then submit annual reports to the federal \n     government detailing how it enforced the laws, the extent of \n     the success achieved, how the inspections were conducted and \n     the methods used to identify outlets.\n       One-quarter of the $24.6 billion the state receive under \n     the bill must be spent on child care programs, including \n     those for school-age children.\n       The bill sets targets to reduce teen smoking--by 15 percent \n     after four years, by 30 percent after six years, by 50 \n     percent after eight years and by 60 percent after 10 years.\n       Tobacco companies are charged a surcharge if those targets \n     are not met and it is the government that determines whether \n     those targets are met, based on ``prevalence of tobacco \n     products for the industry.''\n       If the bill passes, the federal government will determine \n     whether the targets have been met.\n                                  ____\n\n\n

Mr. President, I have come to the Senate floor to \ntalk about, as others have, something of fundamental importance to the \npeople that I represent in my State of West Virginia, and that is equal \ntreatment for all Americans with respect to health care. I am not just \ntalking about Congressmen, and I am not just talking about coal miners \nor CEOs or custodians, I am talking about all Americans and all the \ntime.\n  I want to talk about what I think is an urgent need here in Congress \nto pass legislation on the quality of health care, and that this \nlegislation should apply to every single American. When enough of us \nrecognize these needs, I am convinced we are going to enact \nlegislation, and it is going to be called patient protection. It may \nhave some other name. It may be modified, it may be expanded, who \nknows? But the need for it is undeniable, and it has to happen. Every \nsingle day that passes without the enactment of some kind of patient \nprotection legislation is another day that millions of Americans, \nthousands of people I represent in West Virginia, are subject to the \ndenial of needed treatments by insurance companies who are looking out \nfor their bottom lines.\n  Every single day that we as a Congress fail to act on the Patients' \nBill of Rights Act, if we want to call it that, is another day that \nAmericans are left vulnerable to health care decisions made by people \nwho are not doctors--in fact, doctors complain about this all the \ntime--but who are, in fact, business professionals. Every day that we \ndo not act, Americans are refused the specialty treatment they need and \ndeserve. I am going to give two examples of this which I think are \nscary, and which are very real. Make no mistake, if we do not respond \nand if we do not respond forcefully, more Americans are going to lose \nconfidence in our health care system.\n\n  It is interesting to me, having observed health care now for quite a \nnumber of years, that it used to be it was only patients, or only \nconsumers of health care who were worried about the cost of health \ncare, the quality of health care, the problems of health care, the \npaperwork of health care. Now, the people who really are coming on \nboard in this angst are physicians themselves and nurses and people who \nwork in hospitals who have to deal with the realities of what the \nhealth care system has become in this country.\n  West Virginia is no exception. West Virginia may have some more \nproblems than some other States, but we are no exception with regard to \nthe need for patient protection. I constantly run into West Virginians \nwhen I am at home who complain to me--not at my invitation, but at \ntheirs--about being denied the treatment they felt they were promised, \nor that they knew they were promised from plans, health care plans \nwhere they thought their premiums entitled them to something called \nquality health care and fair treatment.\n  One complaint I hear all too often is being denied specialty care. \nThat is a very big deal. General practitioners can take care of a lot \nof problems, but sometimes you come to a point where you have to have \nmore. Under most managed care plans, a patient's primary care physician \nmay in fact refer, as the gatekeeper or whatever, a patient to a \nspecialist, if the primary care physician determines that specialty \ncare is necessary. That makes a lot of sense to me. Primary care \nphysicians are in a very good position to do that. That is a \nprofessional decision involving going to another professional. However, \nthings may change if the specialist is not on the list often called the \nplan's network.\n  Let me explain. Suddenly, someone then comes from the administrative \noffice, or from some other division, and may take over. Suddenly, the \npatient who, along with the primary care physician, is anxious for that \npatient to see a specialist because of some health problem, finds out \nthat the executives, not the physician, but the executives in charge of \nthe managed care plan, people who are not doctors, not medical \nproviders, reserve the right to refuse payment for the specialist \nrecommended by his or her original doctor. In fact, this is a frequent \noccurrence for people who have insurance companies that push their \nemployees to steer patients to only the physicians listed within their \nplan.\n  That is not the way it is meant to work. Insurance companies do not \nalways make the best medical choices because they are not trained in \nthat business. They are trained in a different business. Too often \nmotivated by their bottom line, which is understandable, and not often \nenough motivated by the patient's health care needs, many specialty \nreferrals are refused. Now, I go to my examples and I hope my \ncolleagues will listen.\n  I think of a little 6-year-old boy from West Virginia who became \nseriously ill. Concerned, his mother rushed him to the doctor's office, \nhis doctor's office, in fact, where he was quickly diagnosed with \ndiabetes. His primary care physician referred him to an out-of-plan \npediatric endocrinologist; a specialist in childhood diseases, that is. \nThat was the referral, to a specialist in childhood diseases. The \nspecialist placed this young child on insulin to control his condition. \nBut when the child's primary care doctor referred him back to the \nspecialist for a follow-up visit--which makes a lot of sense--the \nreferral was denied, stating, ``* * * service available with in-plan \nendocrinologist.''\n\n  That doesn't sound so bad, does it? In other words, go to the in-\nhouse, in-plan endocrinologist. So while it sounds like the child could \nget the care that was needed from the in-plan physician, the reality is \nthat he could not get that health care for a very subtle but basic \nreason. The in-plan specialist was an adult endocrinologist, not a \nchild endocrinologist, specializing in adult diabetes. But diabetes is \nnot the same in children and adults, and there are different \nspecialties for adults and for children in that field. The treatment is \ndifferent. There is serious risks of developing future health problems \nwhen the childhood diabetes is not dealt with properly by a proper \nphysician. The insurance company in this case was gambling, in effect \nrisking this child's future health for the few dollars they saved by \nsaying: Oh, you have to go to an in-plan doctor.\n  As bad as that case is--and I wish it were the only one, but it is \nnot--I was recently told the story of a 14-day-old baby girl. Mr. \nPresident, 14 days old, this precious little child's health was already \njeopardized by her health plan. What do I mean by that? This poor\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\nchild was brought to her doctor 14 days after birth because of a \nurinary tract infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection at that \nage requires an evaluation for urinary tract abnormalities. But the \nreferral from the pediatrician to an out-of-plan specialist was denied, \nagain saying services are available in-plan, an in-plan urologist. OK, \nif she could get the right treatment in-plan, that is what HMOs are \nfor; right?\n  But she could not. She could not get the help because the urologist \nthe plan would have had her see was, once again, an adult urologist. Am \nI picking here? Am I just being petty? No. The problem lies in \ndiscovering and treating urinary tract abnormalities which is vital to \npreventing serious and permanent kidney damage, and the appropriate \nspecialist for such a situation is a pediatric urologist.\n  I have working in my office, thanks to the Robert Wood Johnson \nFoundation, a pediatric cardiologist. A pediatric cardiologist is \ndifferent from an adult cardiologist. In other words, an adult and \nchild are different and they require different specialists with \ndifferent skills. It is a basic and important fact. Simply to say you \nhave a urologist in-house is not to say that if that urologist deals \nwith adult urology problems, that it is sufficient for a 14-day-old \nbaby girl.\n  This decision by the HMO was based on having an adult urologist, \nwhich urologist did not have speciality training in pediatric disorders \nand, therefore, was not capable of caring sufficiently for an infant. \nWhy? Because keeping her within the plan's network of doctors costs \nless.\n  I understand business, and business is important, but this business \nof quality of health care treatment is very serious and very scary, and \nthat is what we have to focus on when we are thinking about what we are \ngoing to do. These are our children, the most helpless and vulnerable \nof all of American citizens. They have no way of defending themselves. \nThey depend on their parents, they depend on their communities to take \ncare of them, and these people, in turn, depend on us in Congress to \nensure that they are not taken advantage of, that games are not played \nwith their health and the health of their children.\n  The time has come for us to pass a bill which guarantees certain \ncommonsense protections for every single patient in America, young or \nold, rich or poor. This legislation--which we have the opportunity to \npass, an obligation, I think, to enact this year, the Patients' Bill of \nRights Act of 1998--will do exactly that.\n  I am interested in good health care for our people, Mr. President. I \ndon't think it is a game, and I don't think it has anything to do with \npolitics. I think it is a very, very serious consideration.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  Mr. FORD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing members of my staff be given the privilege of the floor for \nthe duration of the debate on the current bill: Hunter Bates, Robin \nBowen, David Hovermale, and Kyle Simmons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we have been on the tobacco bill now \nfor four weeks. What is abundantly clear to this Senator is that the \nbest favor we can do for the American people and, in particular, for \nKentuckians who are tobacco producers is to defeat this bill. President \nClinton and the majority of the Democrats have been pushing this bill \nfor some time, going back to the 1996 campaign. A typical American \nfamily today already pays 38.2 percent of its total income in taxes at \nall levels of government. This tobacco tax bill before us will increase \ntaxes by more than $600 billion, some argue even up to $800 billion \nover the life of the bill, and 60 percent of that tax will fall on \nworking people who make less than $30,000 a year.\n  Let me repeat: 60 percent of the taxes that we are raising will fall \non Americans making $30,000 per year. Mr. President, more than anything \nelse, what the tobacco bill is about is tax and spend.\n  The original cause is a noble cause around which I guess virtually \nall of the Senate is unified, and that is the question of confronting \nthe problem of teenagers and smoking. We know, of course, that only 2 \npercent of smokers are teenagers. We wish they would not engage in this \nhabit, and we ought to do everything we can to deter that behavior. But \nthis bill, this $600 billion or $700 billion or $800 billion bill, this \ntax increase targeted at people in America making $30,000 or less is \nabout big government and big spending and big taxes.\n  A good starting place would be to defeat this bill, which is not in \nthe best interest of the American people and certainly not in the best \ninterest of the people of Kentucky for whom this is a particularly \nsensitive issue. The biggest beneficiaries of the bill before us, in \naddition to the Government and literally legions of new agencies, are a \nnumber of lawyers who are going to make a substantial amount of money \neven with the Gorton amendment yesterday.\n  So a good starting place in discussing this issue is what ought to be \ndone with the overall bill, and it has been the view of this Senator \nfrom Kentucky that the appropriate fate for this bill is defeat, the \nsooner the better.\n  Should the bill not be defeated, it creates a catastrophe for the \nCommonwealth of Kentucky. We have over 60,000 farm families who derive \nsome or all of their income from the annual growing of a legal crop.\n  They are engaged in an honorable activity. They are raising their \nfamilies, educating their children, obeying the law. And here comes the \nFederal Government with an effort to destroy this legal industry. And \nmake no mistake about it, this bill is designed to bring the tobacco \nindustry to its knees. And that goal and design is pretty clear, with \nthe amendments that have been passed so far, including providing no \nimmunity from lawsuits whatsoever for the tobacco companies, which, as \nwe all know, was part of the original settlement agreed to last \nsummer--no immunity is going to be provided in this bill for any kind \nof lawsuit of any sort.\n  We doubled the so-called look-back provision--clearly, in this \nSenator's view, an unconstitutional attempt to make the company \nresponsible for anyone who chooses to use its product. I do not know \nany reputable lawyer, Mr. President, either in or out of the Senate, \nwho thinks that provision is constitutional. And, of course, there are \nadvertising restrictions in this bill. Nobody that I know thinks those \ncan be imposed by the Government either.\n  The industry pulled out of this a long time ago--several months ago--\nwhen they saw what form it was taking. So make no mistake about it, Mr. \nPresident, this bill before the Senate, in its current form, is \ndesigned to destroy the tobacco industry.\n  Now, the victims of that are the 60,000 farm families in Kentucky who \nraise this legal crop every year. And in the wake of this effort to \ndestroy this industry, it has produced a significant debate in our \nState about what to do.\n\n[[Page S6452]]\n\n  Now, if El Nino hits, the Federal Government steps in and helps the \nvictims. In this particular instance, the Federal Government itself is \ncausing the disaster. And it seemed to this Senator appropriate, if the \nGovernment were going to create this disaster, then the government \nought to provide a lifeline or assistance or help to those victims of \nthis Government-made disaster.\n  And after a good deal of thought over many months, Mr. President, I \nconcluded that if the Government were going to try to destroy this \nindustry, the appropriate response was for the Government to provide \nassistance to the farm families who grow this legal commodity, and to \ndo it as generously as possible over the shortest period of time.\n  So it was my conclusion, Mr. President, that the Senator from \nIndiana--certainly no friend of tobacco, as he himself would readily \nadmit--was prepared to engage in what I thought was a generous act in \nthe context of this impending disaster.\n  Where I differ with the Senator from Indiana is, I think the tobacco \nprogram has served us well. It has served us very well in Kentucky. It \nhas allowed us to hold on to smaller farms a lot longer than we would \notherwise have been able to hold on to them, even though, Mr. \nPresident, I must confess, in all candor, there has been consolidation \neven with the program.\n  When I came to the Senate in January of 1985, the average tobacco \ngrower in Kentucky had about an acre--roughly 2,500 pounds, which is \nabout an acre. Today, the average tobacco grower in Kentucky has 4.5 \nacres. So you can see that even with the program, consolidation is \noccurring. Without the program, unquestionably, consolidation would \noccur very rapidly. And the tragedy of the loss of the program is that \nthe income, which has been divided up among an awful lot of medium- and \nlow-income people, would in all likelihood consolidate into large \nfarms. And I do not applaud that. I would rather keep the tobacco \nprogram. And we can keep the tobacco program if we can beat this bill.\n  So, Mr. President, let me say, the first order for this Senator is to \ndefeat this bill. I have done nothing to promote this bill at any point \nalong the way. I opposed it in 1997, 1998, 2 months ago, last month, a \nweek ago, yesterday, and today. This is a terrible bill for America and \na particularly bad bill for Kentucky.\n  But if it is to become law, the question you have to ask is, What is \nthe best approach for the victims of this law, the tobacco growers of \nKentucky? It is my view, in that context, that the Senator from Indiana \nhas it right, that if the Government is trying to destroy this \nindustry, the best thing the Government can do is to provide a generous \ntransition payment to these growers on the way to the free market--not \nmy first choice, but my choice in the context of the bill that \nPresident Clinton and the vast majority of Democrats in this body want \nto see become law.\n  Mr. President, there are two competing proposals. One proposal, \nsponsored by my colleague from Kentucky, seeks to hold on to the \ntobacco program for the next 25 years. If it were not for this bill, we \nwould have a chance of holding on to the tobacco program without any \nlegislation, because this bill is what creates the problem, not that \ninstantly tobacco becomes less controversial. But any time this kind of \nbill is seriously contemplated in Congress, it seems to me the only \nsolution to that is to provide as generous a compensation as possible \nfor our growers over the shortest period of time, because the program \nis going to end in the context of this kind of Government pile-on \ndesigned to destroy the industry.\n  So, Mr. President, I stated my case as best I could and, if I may say \nso, I think pretty well, in a recent op-ed in the Lexington Herald-\nLeader at home, which I ask unanimous consent to be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  We Don't Have 25 Years for LEAF Act\n\n                          (By Mitch McConnell)\n\n       One of President Bill Clinton's signature political \n     maneuvers occurred early in his administration when he and \n     Vice President Al Gore declared war on tobacco--portraying \n     Kentucky's leading agricultural commodity as a modern-day \n     plague. The anti-tobacco zealots and an army of greedy \n     plaintiffs' lawyers eager to prey on the tobacco industry \n     created the most serious threat ever arrayed against tobacco \n     farmers.\n       Disaster has loomed for Kentucky's tobacco farmers since \n     Clinton took office and is now manifested in the form of the \n     $850 billion McCain bill which sailed out of the Senate \n     Commerce Committee 19-1, with Sen. Wendell Ford's support. \n     Thus was the death knell sounded for tobacco.\n       Liberal Democrats in Congress have eagerly piled on, vowing \n     to slay the tobacco industry generally and the farmers' \n     price-support program in particular. Senator Dick Durbin (D-\n     IL) venomously wails that tobacco is the only government-\n     supported crop ``with a body count,'' and lambasts the \n     tobacco program as ``. . . subsidizing the growth, \n     production, and processing of a product which kills hundreds \n     of thousands . . . .''\n       Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-MA), the most influential Democrat in \n     the Senate, decries tobacco with characteristic hyperbole, \n     charging the industry with ``the insidious and shameful \n     poisoning of generations of children.'' Durbin and Kennedy \n     sentiment, shared by nearly all their liberal Democrat \n     colleagues, does not auger for any easing up in the war \n     against tobacco. Quite the contrary.\n       Kentucky's farmers are in this anti-tobacco squad's \n     crosshairs. Senator Ford and I, as always, are unified in our \n     goal of fighting for Kentucky farmers. Regrettably, we \n     disagree over the best means for achieving this protection \n     and security.\n       Kentucky farmers stand at a critical crossroads, presented \n     with two alternatives for survival. Senate Agriculture \n     Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN) offers farmers a \n     three-year phase-out of the tobacco program that would \n     provide the average quota owner with meaningful annual \n     transition payments of $26,500 and the freedom to continue to \n     grow tobacco in a free market, forever.\n       The LEAF Act, proposed by retiring Senator Ford, offers \n     farmers two very different paths: a buyout path or a gamble \n     that the program could continue for another quarter-century. \n     If the average quota owner chooses to go down the Ford buyout \n     path, he would receive a 10-year buyout with annual payments \n     of only $8,000--with the added proviso that he would be \n     barred from growing tobacco for the next 25 years! With such \n     an unpalatable buy-out option, farmers would likely buy into \n     the LEAF Act's contention that the tobacco program could be \n     preserved until the year 2023--even though the government is \n     currently phasing out other agriculture commodity programs \n     like corn, wheat and soybeans.\n       After extensive consideration and consultation with \n     Kentucky growers, I firmly believe that the Lugar plan is the \n     wiser course because the LEAF Act is ultimately \n     unsustainable--a nice idea, but an unwarranted gamble in what \n     promises to be an increasingly hostile anti-tobacco \n     environment. In short, the Lugar plan is the best option in a \n     bad situation, the optimal approach to ensure that our \n     farming families and their communities are not grievously \n     wounded in the escalating anti-tobacco war being led by \n     Commander-in-Chief Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and \n     their eager lieutenants in the liberal Democratic \n     congressional caucus.\n       This unprecedented assault on tobacco--a legal product--has \n     permanently altered the political landscape to the extreme \n     detriment of tobacco farmers. As difficult as it is to \n     understand in Kentucky, where tobacco is a way-of-life, the \n     liberals in Washington most closely associate tobacco with a \n     cause of death.\n       Nevertheless, Senator Ford and I, joined by precious few \n     colleagues, have for years been fighting a rear-guard action \n     in defense of tobacco farmers, staving off the anti-tobacco \n     zealots with every parliamentary maneuver we could muster. \n     But Clinton gave the green light to punish the tobacco \n     industry into extinction; and virtually every governmental \n     and private-sector force--outside of Kentucky and North \n     Carolina--has followed suit.\n       On the home front, politicians like Scotty Baesler and farm \n     bureaucrats like the Burley Co-op's Rod Kuegel and Danny \n     McKinney are exploiting the tobacco growers' terrible plight \n     with shrill rhetoric, unproductive attacks and politics as \n     usual. Contrary to these attacks, I firmly believe Kentucky \n     farmers understand the political and economic ramifications \n     of the highly-charged anti-tobacco environment. A Herald-\n     Leader poll found that 70 percent of Kentucky farmers who \n     expressed an opinion said that the program would be gone in \n     less than five years. Similarly, the Tobacco Fairness \n     Coalition has reported that 63 percent of growers in Kentucky \n     and Tennessee favor Senator Lugar's front-loaded phase-out of \n     the tobacco program that pays farmers $8 a pound.\n       The LEAF Act has been criticized from all sides on a number \n     of different issues. Even Sen. Ford's long-time Democratic \n     friends in the Senate have expressed serious doubt about the \n     viability of his plan. Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-NE) recently stated \n     that he is ``troubled by'' the cost of Senator Ford's plan \n     and declared on the Senate floor: ``I have a very difficult \n     time voting for something that has $28 billion for tobacco \n     farmers . . . .''\n       Moreover, I am terribly troubled by the fact that LEAF \n     discriminates against Kentucky farmers, inexplicably treating \n     them worse than North Carolina farmers. For example, if a \n     Kentucky farmer takes the LEAF\n\n[[Page S6453]]\n\n     buyout, he is forbidden from growing tobacco for the next 25 \n     years. Since the average age of a Kentucky tobacco farmer is \n     60, the LEAF buyout is effectively a lifetime ban. On the \n     other hand, a North Carolina quota owner receives a \n     guaranteed buyout under LEAF and is still allowed to continue \n     growing tobacco. This is simply not fair.\n       Thoughtful newspapers in the heart of tobacco country have \n     surveyed the tobacco landscape and concluded that the tobacco \n     program is mortally wounded. In the words of the Paducah Sun: \n     ``[The] ultimate fate [of the tobacco program] seems sealed. \n     How can [the] program survive indefinitely when the \n     administration, Congress, health groups and public opinion \n     are arrayed so solidly against smoking?''\n       Or as the Daily News in Bowling Green concluded: ``Hating \n     tobacco is popular. This national mood spells an end--and \n     soon--to federal programs seen as supportive of the `evil \n     weed.' McConnell has stated the facts. They are hard. But \n     they are the facts.'' The Courier-Journal also acknowledged \n     that my decision to support the Lugar plan was ``a reasonable \n     and defensible course.''\n       As much as I would like to promise farmers 25 more years of \n     a federal tobacco program, I cannot in good conscience be \n     complicitous in handing out such a false promise to the \n     thousands of Kentucky families whose lives would thereafter \n     hang in the balance and twist in hostile political winds. The \n     combined forces of Clinton, Gore, opportunistic Democrats in \n     Congress and the nation's liberal media, have made tobacco \n     public enemy No. 1. In sum, I simply refuse to sell farmers \n     on the dreamy illusion of a new 25-year tobacco program.\n       Contrary to the caricature of my position by the \n     politically-motivated and woefully ill-informed former \n     Democrat State Sen. John Berry and his poet brother, my \n     ``sole prerogative'' is to provide certainty and protection \n     to Kentucky's farming families. We should allow our farmers \n     and communities to take the cash-in-hand and not force them \n     into a high-stakes crapshoot. In the words of the Owensboro \n     Messenger-Inquirer: ``This may be the last chance farmers \n     have before it all goes up in smoke.'' Nostalgia for the past \n     may be good for poets, but not for policymakers.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as you can imagine, this is a much \ndiscussed issue in Kentucky. Some people think the LEAF Act is the way \nto go; some people think the Lugar proposal is the way to go. \nInterestingly enough, a number of newspapers, having surveyed the \nlandscape and having looked at the issue, have concluded that the \nSenator from Indiana--not, again, thought of as any friend of tobacco--\nand the Senator from Kentucky, who has spent most of his career \nfighting, along with the senior Senator from Kentucky, for tobacco, \nhave it right, that in the context of this kind of bill, the only \nrational response is to try to provide as much compensation as \npossible.\n  In fact, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, the daily paper in \nOwensboro--one of our major cities and one of our major papers--had an \neditorial on May 24, the headline of which was, ``McConnell may have \nright idea, Lugar's plan could ultimately benefit tobacco farmers more \nthan Ford's.''\n  Now, reasonable people can differ about what is the appropriate thing \nto do in the face of impending disaster. You can go down with the ship \nor you can go for the lifeboats. And what the Senator from Indiana is \ndoing here is offering a lifeboat; and, interestingly enough, after you \nget in the lifeboat, you are still free to row.\n  In other words, under the Lugar proposal, when you go on to the free \nmarket, it is indeed free; people are still entitled to grow tobacco, a \nlegal product, if they want to. Under the competing proposal, the LEAF \nproposal, there is a so-called voluntary buyout, but, candidly, it is \nnot very attractive. If you take the voluntary buyout, it takes you 10 \nyears to get your money. In the first year, the $8 presumably would \nstill be worth $8; in the tenth year, the ag economist on the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, of which I am a member, says it is worth about \n$5.13. So your money erodes over a 10-year period.\n  In addition to that, if you accept the voluntary buyout, you cannot \ngrow tobacco. Even though you are in a free market, the Government \ntells you, you cannot grow tobacco. And, even more mysterious, under \nthe same LEAF proposal, there is a mandatory buyout for flue-cured \ntobacco--that kind of tobacco grown in the Carolinas and Virginia--a \nmandatory buyout. But after it is over, you are free to grow tobacco.\n  So I think, clearly, the purpose of the LEAF Act was to discourage \nany exit from the tobacco business. The buyout is not attractive, and \nit is designed to sort of hitch you up to a declining market created by \na Government pile-on.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the editorial in the \nOwensboro Messenger-Inquirer be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Messenger-Inquirer, May 24, 1998]\n\n                     McConnell May Have Right Idea\n\n\n lugar's plan could ultimately benefit tobacco farmers more than Ford's\n\n       Tobacco farmers may be upset with U.S. Sen. Mitch \n     McConnell, but ultimately he may be doing them more good than \n     harm.\n       McConnell did the once unthinkable last week--he sided with \n     Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar on a plan to end the federal \n     tobacco price support system.\n       McConnell said when he first came to the Senate in 1985, \n     there were seven tobacco-related votes. ``Tobacco was a \n     sleepy, regional issue to which most members of Congress did \n     not pay much attention,'' McConnell said.\n       The politics of tobacco have changed. In the current \n     Congress there have been 29 tobacco-related votes, McConnell \n     said, including one last summer in which crop insurance for \n     tobacco farmers barely passed.\n       McConnell cited a statewide poll that found 70 percent of \n     the respondents thought the tobacco support program would be \n     dead in less than five years.\n       Siding with Lugar is in direct opposition with Kentucky's \n     senior senator Wendell Ford of Owensboro. Ford's plan would \n     continue price supports, offer $8 per pound to cover farmers' \n     losses and would provide $28.5 billion over 25 years to \n     assist tobacco farmers and communities who suffer because of \n     decline in tobacco demand and jobs.\n       Ford is doing what he is supposed to do--taking care of the \n     concerns of his constituents. In a different way McConnell is \n     doing the same, although tobacco farmers may not yet see it.\n       Just a few years ago, Ford's plan would have been better \n     for Kentucky tobacco farmers. But tobacco is in trouble, and \n     with Ford leaving Washington at the end of this year, there \n     will be one less experienced voice in favor of the support \n     program.\n       McConnell recognizes this and is trying to bridge the gap \n     between the two sides on price supports.\n       McConnell is not simply cozying up to Lugar's initial plan, \n     which we still believe was overly punitive. Lugar's initial \n     plan was to pay those who hold quotas to grow tobacco $8 per \n     pound to get out of the business. Those who wanted to \n     continue to grow would do so under free market conditions, \n     but Lugar proposed transitional payments over three years to \n     wean farmers off the program.\n       At McConnell's request, the Lugar plan now allows farmers \n     to continue growing tobacco during the phase-out program. And \n     sharecroppers and those who lease quotas to grow tobacco--\n     initially left out of Lugar's plan--would receive $4 per \n     pound during the buyout.\n       Also new at McConnell's urging was $1 billion over five \n     years for rural communities hit hard by the reduction in \n     tobacco revenue. That money would be invested in education \n     and retraining, and to assist warehouse owners and operators.\n       We share a legitimate conflict of opinion on this issue \n     with, we expect, many Kentuckians. The global economy has \n     turned to a free market on tobacco, and some would surely \n     claim it wrong for the American government to continue \n     artificially maintaining higher prices.\n       It would be easier to embrace that position if we lived in \n     Montana, Ohio or New Hampshire. But we live in Kentucky, a \n     farming state in which 25 percent of total farm income is \n     from tobacco sales. Any movement that would ultimately cut \n     prices more than in half for tobacco must be met with \n     concern.\n       But McConnell obviously feels that this may be the best \n     chance for tobacco farmers to recoup some lucrative prices. \n     It is conceivable tobacco opponents will simply end the price \n     support program in a few years without any sort of \n     transitional buyout.\n       This makes it imperative that both alternative crops and \n     new markets for tobacco be found for Kentucky farmers. \n     Biosource Technologies is working on exciting research using \n     tobacco in the development of pharmaceuticals.\n       McConnell is too savvy a politician to make this move \n     without a firm belief that the majority of his constituents \n     favor it. Tobacco is in trouble no matter what McConnell \n     supports. This may be the last chance farmers have before it \n     all goes up in smoke.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And the Paducah Sun, Mr. President, in the far western \npart of our State, in taking a look at the situation, reached the \nconclusion that the Senator from Indiana and the junior Senator from \nKentucky probably had it right, that in the context of this kind of \nbill, the rational response is to provide a generous buyout as rapidly \nas possible on to the free market.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the editorial in the Paducah \nSun of May 23 of this year be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6454]]\n\n                  [From the Paducah Sun, May 23, 1998]\n\n                              Smoking Bomb\n\n\n                   Tobacco buy-out a reasonable idea\n\n       Mitch McConnell's tobacco bomb has exploded with stunning \n     force throughout the state he represents. Nearly in unison, \n     Democrats and farm groups have denounced his buyout proposal \n     in the strongest terms, and his fellow Kentucky Republicans \n     are keeping quiet. Conservatives from outside the tobacco \n     belt are criticizing the Kentuckian's plan as too generous. \n     So politically, the senator's idea looks like a loser. As a \n     matter of policy, it is worth a cooler appraisal.\n       Sen. McConnell has signed onto Indiana colleague Richard \n     Lugar's legislation to close out the federal tobacco support \n     program over three years by buying up the production quotas \n     at $8 a pound. Participation would be mandatory, but in the \n     end, farmers would be free to grow as much leaf as they \n     wished and sell it in an unregulated market.\n       The alternative by his Democratic counterpart, Sen. Wendell \n     Ford, would give farmers the option of selling their quotas, \n     also for $8 a pound, over 10 years, but those who take the \n     money would have to quit growing the crop. For others, the \n     price subsidies would remain in place.\n       Gov. Paul Patton, the three Democratic senatorial \n     candidates, the burley tobacco organization, and the Kentucky \n     Farm Bureau all embrace the Ford proposal. So does Republican \n     Rep. Jim Bunning, his party's likely nominee for the U.S. \n     Senate seat this year, which is a fair indication of the \n     political lay of the land in Kentucky.\n       The competing plans are substantially different, but have \n     at least one major goal in common. Both are designed to \n     cushion the impending blow for tobacco growers in a social \n     and political environment that is increasingly hostile to \n     cigarettes and smoking.\n       Which proposal is superior as national policy--or better \n     for the growers (which is not necessarily the same thing)--\n     depends largely on the future of the tobacco program.\n       The Lugar-McConnell plan is premised on the belief that the \n     tobacco subsidy is on its way out no matter what and the best \n     deal for farmers is a short-term cash buyout.\n       State Democrats are far more optimistic about the leaf \n     program. The accuse Sen. McConnell of premature surrender and \n     seem to resent particularly his break from a previously \n     united front among the Kentucky delegation.\n       We believe Sen. McConnell has reason on his side. Whether \n     the tobacco price support program lasts another three, five \n     or 10 years is not the main point. Its ultimate fate seems \n     sealed. How can the program survive indefinitely when the \n     administration, Congress, health groups and public opinion \n     are arrayed so solidly against smoking?\n       Even now, lawmakers mainly are arguing about how punitive \n     the federal legislation will be against the tobacco industry. \n     At last report, the U.S. Senate is prepared to impose a $1.10 \n     per pack tax hike on cigarettes, which incensed Sen. Ted \n     Kennedy because it wasn't $1.50. The contradictory notion--\n     manufacturers bad, growers good--will not wear well forever.\n       Moreover, tobacco, of all commodities, hardly would be the \n     exception in the overall movement of agriculture away from \n     support programs and toward a market system. Price supports \n     for corn are not surviving; why should tobacco's?\n       In plain fact, the tobacco program was never defensible in \n     a government that is trying to discourage smoking by every \n     means. Ending it now at least would allow government to purge \n     itself of hypocrisy.\n       The prospect of handing $80,000 to the typical tobacco \n     farmer who cultivates four acres, as the Lugar-McConnell \n     proposal would do, does not strike us as victimizing him \n     excessively. The out-of-state conservative critics of that \n     bill's generosity may have a point. The payoff would be \n     $20,000 an acre, as compared to about $200 an acre for corn \n     growers.\n       The relative merits of Sen. McConnell's and Sen. Ford's \n     competing approaches are still up for debate, and much is yet \n     to be decided. We fail to see how the Republican's proposal \n     is so inimical to state or national interest as to justify \n     the furor it has created.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the State Journal in Frankfort, our \nState capital, on May 21 of 1998, essentially agreed, as well as did \nthe Owensboro paper and the Paducah paper, that in this particular \nsituation the buyout proposal offered by the chairman of the \nAgriculture Committee makes the most sense. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the State Journal editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 [From the State Journal, May 21, 1998]\n\n                             Mortal Wounds\n\n       U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell ignited a firestorm in Kentucky \n     this week when he threw his support to Indiana Sen. Richard \n     Lugar's legislation that would end federal price supports on \n     burley tobacco by 2002.\n       In doing so, McConnell deserted his fellow Kentuckian Sen. \n     Wendell Ford, who is trying desperately to salvage the \n     tobacco price support program as the Senate debates historic \n     legislation targeting the tobacco industry as a whole.\n       It goes without saying Ford is furious. Tobacco farmers are \n     irate. Agriculture groups are in a frenzy. And Democrats \n     running to replace Ford are on the political warpath.\n       McConnell says he made the decision to desert Ford's \n     legislation, which McConnell originally co-sponsored, because \n     he saw the handwriting on the wall. Tobacco is so universally \n     despised in Congress that there is no hope the price support \n     program can survive at a time when federal agriculture price \n     support programs are being jettisoned all over the place.\n       The tobacco price support program, McConnell says, is \n     ``mortally wounded.''\n       If everyone will calm down and think about it, they will \n     realize that McConnell is right. Tobacco in all its forms is \n     anathema in Congress and much of the nation outside a handful \n     of states where it is grown. The anti-tobacco sentiment has \n     reached a level of zealotry rarely if ever seen involving a \n     single issue.\n       Ford, McConnell and Kentucky's congressional delegation \n     have waged the good fight, but they are going to lose on the \n     issue of price supports. The issue now must be what they can \n     salvage to help farmers who rely on burley tobacco for their \n     incomes and the communities that rely on those farmers for \n     their prosperity.\n       The Lugar legislation would pay the owners of tobacco \n     quotas $8 a pound over three years. Tenants and those who \n     lease tobacco quotas would be paid $4 per pound over three \n     years. Tobacco states would receive $1 billion over five \n     years to aid affected communities and to pay for job \n     retraining and crop diversification programs.\n       Once the support program ends in 2002, farmers could \n     continue growing tobacco, but the price would be subject to a \n     free market.\n       In that free market, Kentucky burley undoubtedly would be \n     worth far less and, in time, most small growers would get out \n     of the business because it no longer would be profitable.\n       Whether the Lugar bill is fair compensation to burley \n     growers is open to debate. Certainly, it will take far more \n     than $1 billion to insulate communities and farmers from the \n     potentially devastating economic impact of tobacco's \n     disappearance as a major crop. But Kentuckians need to join \n     the debate, not insist blindly that something ``mortally \n     wounded'' can survive, especially when that something is \n     associated with tobacco.\n\n  Mr. MCCONNELL. Mr. President, the Bowling Green Daily News in the \nheart of our tobacco-growing part of the State--an area of the State \nrepresented by Congressman Ron Lewis who is on the House Agriculture \nCommittee, who also endorses the Lugar approach as the only logical \nthing to do in the context of this bill designed to destroy this \nindustry. The Bowling Green paper, also says that this is a realistic \nand appropriate response to the kind of catastrophe we are confronting.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the editorial from the Daily News in \nBowling Green of May 21 be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Daily News, May 21, 1998]\n\n                    Tobacco Plan Is Merely Realistic\n\n       U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford and Democratic Senatorial candidates \n     Scotty Baesler, Charlie Owen and Steve Henry can say it isn't \n     so, but the support system for tobacco is doomed.\n       It is best to get out quickly while tobacco farmers still \n     have some political capital to expend.\n       That is what U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. \n     Richard Lugar, R-Ind., are advocating. McConnell has joined \n     Lugar in promoting a buyout plan that would pay tobacco \n     farmers $18 billion and help tobacco-impacted communities \n     adjust to cessation of the support system.\n       However politicians from Kentucky and other tobacco-raising \n     states may deplore it, tobacco has become a favorite \n     political kickball, and termination of the support system is \n     inevitable. It is just a matter of time. Surely, Kentucky \n     politicians now raising such a flap over McConnell's \n     ``defection'' know this as well as does he.\n       No tobacco farmer has to be told that there is a rising \n     swell of anti-tobacco sentiment. Proponents of the system may \n     argue honestly that the program is mostly paid for by \n     farmers, but that argument will fall on deaf ears. Tobacco is \n     politically incorrect.\n       Facing up to that reality, McConnell and Lugar offer a way \n     out. But there is scant time for debating whether this buyout \n     plan or that buyout plan might prove best for Kentucky \n     farmers. Tobacco has been called to judgment in the court of \n     American public opinion and has been found guilty.\n       The Lugar-McConnell approach is the best of several poor \n     choices.\n       It would allow Kentucky farmers to do what many want to \n     do--get out of the frustrating business of raising tobacco \n     with some hope of saving the farm. It would pay tobacco \n     farmers $8 a pound over three years, pay tenants and those \n     who lease their tobacco quotas $4 a pound over three years \n     and provide $1 billion in community assistance for tobacco \n     states. The support system would be eliminated by 2002.\n       These are not harsh terms given the reality of the nation's \n     anti-tobacco mood. In fact, they probably represent the best \n     conditions that Kentucky tobacco farmers can hope to get.\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\n       Few people in Kentucky, including McConnell, want the \n     destruction of the tobacco support system. But it is \n     foolhardy to believe that the tobacco states can muster \n     sufficient political power to long continue the program.\n       Hating tobacco is popular.\n       This national mood spells an end--and soon--to federal \n     programs seen as supportive of the ``evil weed.''\n       McConnell has stated the facts. They are hard. But they are \n     the facts.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The Louisville Courier-Journal is conflicted on this \nissue. David Hawpe, the editor, a twice-a-week columnist, agrees with \nmy senior colleague that the LEAF Act is the way to go, but the \neditorial page in the same paper, looking at the same issue, comes to \nthe opposite conclusion.\n  Just reading in part from the Louisville Courier-journal of May 20:\n\n       [T]he LEAF Act would be in trouble in any event. This, \n     after all, is a Congress that passed the Freedom to Farm Act, \n     which ended price support programs for such noncontroversial \n     crops as wheat, corn and soybeans. Why would lawmakers, \n     especially now, make an exception for tobacco, which is \n     blamed for 400,000 deaths a year?\n       Of course, some anti-smoking groups have formed an alliance \n     with tobacco farm organizations who support the Tobacco \n     Program on the grounds that cheaper tobacco would lead to \n     more smoking. But the cost of tobacco is a tiny fraction of a \n     pack of cigarettes, and it will get smaller as Congress piles \n     on new taxes.\n       The grim fact is, the tobacco growers have a stake in \n     people continuing to smoke, while the government, with broad \n     public support, is determined to discourage smoking.\n       Sooner or later, a way of life in Kentucky [according to \n     the Courier] is going to end, and it is going to be painful. \n     Senator McConnell would get it over quickly. Senator Ford \n     will stretch it out. Neither can save a rural economy based \n     on burley.\n\n  That is from the Louisville Courier-Journal on May 20 of this year.\n  There have been numerous letters to the editors of various papers. I \nwill not read them all, but I think one is interesting in particular. \nIt appeared June 11, 1998, in the Courier-Journal, from H.H. Barlow \nIII, Cave City, KY.\n\n       I am a 47-year-old lifelong tobacco farmer in Barren \n     County, the largest tobacco-producing county in tobacco. The \n     media, Senator Wendell Ford and Representative Scotty Baesler \n     [according to this grower] are not telling the whole truth on \n     tobacco.\n\n  That is he--the writer of the letter--not I, I say to my senior \ncolleague from Kentucky.\n\n       Senator Mitch McConnell has taken a bold step to protect \n     the tobacco farmers of Kentucky by proposing an $8-per-pound \n     buyout that would allow farmers to continue to grow tobacco \n     in the free market. For me and my neighbors who are older and \n     have spent our life raising tobacco, McConnell's proposal \n     gives us a retirement plan and compensation for the loss of \n     income. Most important is that under the McConnell plan, \n     tobacco farmers would receive payments over a 3-year period \n     as opposed to 10 years as Ford has proposed. Payments over 3 \n     years would be significant enough to enable farmers to reduce \n     debt and to invest in retirement or to develop other \n     agricultural enterprises on the farm.\n       There are seven tobacco states fighting 43 non-tobacco \n     states, and tobacco votes in Congress get closer every year. \n     Ford proposes to establish another government-run program \n     that can be voted out by tobacco opponents at any time, \n     leaving tobacco farmers to bleed a slow death with nothing to \n     show for our quotas. McConnell has risked a lot to be honest \n     about the true future of the tobacco program. You be the \n     judge, but for me and my neighbors, having the buyout money \n     for our quota is like having a bird in hand instead of two in \n     the bush, as Ford and Baesler want.\n\n  Another letter appeared in that same edition of The Courier-Journal. \nThis letter was by Ms. Megan Cobb of Henderson, Kentucky. Here are some \nof the thoughts offered by Ms. Cobb:\n\n       As a young, non-smoking Kentuckian, I have been reading the \n     information and misinformation surrounding the tobacco price \n     support issues. Being apolitical, I have no interest in the \n     politics of the issue, but I am concerned that our political \n     candidates . . . are using the issue for their own benefit \n     and really have no concern for the issue itself or the people \n     who are affected.\n       I will say it takes great courage for our Senator Mitch \n     McConnell to stand up and tell the cold truth. That is, the \n     price support system for most farm products is over for all \n     intents and purposes. And that tobacco, and its production, \n     is going through radical changes not caused by the political \n     process but, rather, by the social process that causes \n     societies to change dramatically.\n       It is unfortunate that some of our farmers are looking for \n     a scapegoat rather than solutions. It is unfortunate that our \n     Senate candidates are pandering to the issues rather than \n     boldly charting new courses like McConnell. And to say \n     McConnell's position is anti-farm is not only distortion but \n     irresponsible.\n\n  So these are just a few of the thoughtful Kentuckians in the heart of \ntobacco country who have surveyed the landscape and agree with me on \nthis difficult issue.\n  I also ask unanimous consent a letter to the editor in the Lexington \nHerald-Leader from Alben B. Mills in London be printed in the Record, \nand another letter in the Courier-Journal from a Larry Bond be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               McConnell Right About Tobacco Buyout Plan\n\n                      (By Alben B. Mills, London)\n\n       As a tobacco farmer, I want to thank Sen. Mitch McConnell, \n     R-Ky., for his courageous stance for a tobacco base buyout. \n     While it may not be the most politically popular position \n     McConnell could have taken, it was the most realistic and \n     responsible solution to the uncertainty that Kentucky burley \n     growers have faced since President Clinton declared war on \n     tobacco. Like McConnell, I will be saddened to see the \n     program go, but I have known for several years that tobacco's \n     days in the federal government were numbered. At least, \n     McConnell's plan will allow my colleagues and me to receive a \n     secured payment for our quotas. I have not enjoyed security \n     in my tobacco farming for a long time, thanks to Clinton and \n     Vice President Al Gore.\n       Those who say that the program can survive the ever \n     increasing anti-tobacco sentiment in Congress are taking a \n     huge gamble, and they are wagering irresponsibility with the \n     farmer's future. McConnell has made the tough call. He has \n     told us the painful truth that the program is unsalvageable \n     and that we should cut our losses while we still have the \n     chance for fair compensation for our tobacco bases. His \n     opinions have the ring of statesmanship, and the tobacco \n     farming community will be forever indebted to him for his \n     candor. I am grateful to McConnell for placing our interests \n     before his own.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Backs McConnell's Plan\n\n                    (By Larry O. Bond, Sanders, Ky.)\n\n       I am very displeased with the attacks made on Sen. Mitch \n     McConnell by the Democrats regrading his stand on the tobacco \n     buyout.\n       I am a farm owner and have raised tobacco for 21 years. \n     When we went to the no-net program in 1982, we were doomed. \n     Sen. Wendell Ford helped pass that law. By 1985, the tobacco \n     companies had forced so much tobacco into our pool that they \n     broke us. Ford helped negotiate a tobacco company buyout of \n     the pool stocks. Farmers took a cut in an allotment and a cut \n     in price. My tobacco income was reduced by 50 percent. I grew \n     tired of being abused by the tobacco companies, and 1989 was \n     my last crop.\n       It seems to me that when Ford does the negotiating, the \n     companies get the ``gold,'' and the farmers get the \n     ``shaft.''\n       The provisions of Ford's LEAF Act have changed several \n     times over the last six months. The language is so complex \n     that it appears to have been written to deliberately confuse \n     the reader. Our experience since 1982 indicates that no \n     tobacco agreement can last unchanged for 10 years.\n       I believe that when people want to change society it is \n     only fair that they should pay for the change. If Sen. \n     Richard Lugar and McConnell's buyout takes place, I will be \n     satisfied that has happened. Farmers' lives will be radically \n     changed, but at least they won't be completely dispossessed.\n       I would like to mention a critical point to my city \n     cousins: The Lugar-McConnell buyout pays the farmer $8 a \n     pound for his government allotment, and it goes out of \n     existence. Ford's LEAF Act will pay those who choose to sell \n     $8 per pound for the government allotment; however, those \n     pounds will not cease to exist but will be redistributed to \n     farmers who choose not to sell. Ford will spend America's \n     money and give no benefit to American society. The Ford LEAF \n     Act will not solve any of the problems that face tobacco \n     farmers or society at large.\n       The three-year Lugar-McConnell plan is easy to understand, \n     will solve the tobacco program problem once and for all, and \n     relieves the government from being responsible for the \n     tobacco farmer. It reimburses the farmer for property that \n     society wants done away with. The farmer can pay down his \n     debts and move on with his life.\n       McConnell has taken a bold and courageous stand on this \n     issue, and I back him 100 percent. Nothing can shake me from \n     that position.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Now, Mr. President, let me just, in conclusion, sum up \nwhat the point is here.\n  What is proposed before the Senate is a bill designed to destroy the \ntobacco industry. As a matter of fact, one CEO of one of the companies \nsaid this bill in this form would put them into bankruptcy. There is no \nimmunity provided for the companies. There is a Draconian look-back \nprovision of certain unconstitutionality, various and assorted \nadvertising restrictions also of dubious constitutionality, and a $1.10 \ncigarette tax increase over 3 years designed to net for the government \nsome $500 to\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\n$800 billion in revenue, depending on whose estimates you listen to. \nThe net effect of all that is a government designed to destroy this \nindustry.\n  It is in that context that I believe the appropriate thing for the \ngovernment to do is to throw a lifeline to the 60,000 hard-working \nKentucky tobacco growers who make their living off of this legal crop.\n  Now, Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes and frame this issue \nfrom a larger perspective and walk through how our farmers found \nthemselves in the current predicament.\n  One of President Clinton's signature political maneuvers occurred \nearly in his administration when he and Vice President Gore declared \nwar on tobacco--portraying Kentucky's leading agricultural commodity as \na modern-day plague. The anti-tobacco zealots and an army of greedy \nplaintiffs' lawyers eager to prey on the tobacco industry created the \nmost serious threat ever arrayed against tobacco farmers. Disaster has \nloomed for Kentucky's tobacco farmers since Clinton took office and is \nnow manifested in the form of this half-trillion dollar McCain bill \nwhich sailed out of the Senate Commerce Committee 19-1, with Senator \nWendell Ford's support. Thus was the death knell sounded for tobacco.\n  With our tobacco farmers now caught in the crossfire of this war, we \nare being asked to make a monumental decision. That decision is simply \nthis: despite all we know about tobacco's desperately weakened state--\n  (1) do we ignore the warning signs and commit ourselves to a path \nthat leads to uncertainty and a diminished standard of living for our \nfarmers, or\n  (2) do we recognize that change is coming to the farm and there is a \nbetter way to prepare for it than by blindly pursuing the policies of \nthe past?\n  Mr. President, after months of thought, countless conversations with \nmy colleagues, and a continual dialogue with Kentucky growers, I \nbelieve there is only one road for us to travel if we decide to pass \nthis monstrous McCain bill. Let me explain why.\n  The politics of tobacco have changed. Throughout most of American \nhistory, we have paid tribute to tobacco and tobacco farmers. Nowhere \nis this national tribute more evident than right here in our nation's \ncapitol. As I sat in my office this morning, I glanced at the small \ncolumns on my fireplace and took note of the tobacco leaves which adorn \nthose columns.\n  And, then as I left my office and walked to the Senate floor, I \npassed various pillars here in the Capitol and looked upward to see, \nonce again, the sculpted tobacco leaves bursting forth at the top of \nthese pillars.\n  No longer do we pay tribute to the golden leaf or the farmer whose \nsweat and toil produces that leaf. The leaf is now seen as dark and \nbrown and dirty. And, it is targeted for extinction and eradication by \nvirtually every governmental and private-sector force in America.\n  Although tobacco leaves still adorn the halls of Congress, the leaf \nis no longer sacred. What was once seen as sacred, is now looked upon \nwith contempt and outright hostility.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1985, there were only 7 tobacco-related \nvotes. But, the times have changed--dramatically--and for the worse, \nwhere our tobacco farmers are concerned.\n  In the 105th Congress alone, there have been 29 tobacco-related \nvotes--notwithstanding all the votes on the woefully misguided bill \ncurrently before the Senate. Twenty-nine votes--even prior to the \nMcCain bill--that is three times more votes than there were when I \narrived here in 1985. In fact, we've had more votes on tobacco in the \n105th Congress alone than we had in all the years between 1985 and \n1996. And each of these votes has the effect of putting a bull's eye on \nthe tobacco farmer's back.\n  No vote points up tobacco's weakened position more vividly than a \nvote last summer (Durbin, July 23) to end crop insurance for farmers. \nCan you imagine? The amendment's sponsor was saying, in effect, ``if \nyou grow corn, wheat, soybeans, etc., you are entitled to insurance. \nBut not if you grow tobacco. Even though you have never sold your \nproduct to a minor, or committed any of the transgressions we accuse \ntobacco companies of, you do not deserve basic protection from natural \ncatastrophe.''\n  On an issue that blatantly unfair, the vote, shockingly, was 53-47. \nThat's three votes shy of elimination.\n  Tobacco interests have been under a constant, daily barrage of scorn \nand derision. Tobacco has become the enemy of choice among politicians. \nIt is the darling of the attack set. Politicians across the political \nspectrum believe that attacking anything ``tobacco'' pays political \ndividends. And attack they do.\n  But these are not precision strikes. These are broadsides against the \nentire tobacco industry that wreak devastating collateral damage on \ntobacco farmers.\n  Let me tell you what Senator Ford's colleagues on the left are saying \nabout the tobacco program and the tobacco farmer.\n  Here's Senator Durbin: ``Tobacco growers have to know the party's \nover.'' And again: ``Uncle Sam ought to get out of the tobacco \nbusiness. We have no business subsidizing the growth, production, and \nprocessing of a product which kills hundreds of thousands of Americans \neach year.''\n  And, if the views of the left still aren't clear to you, Mr. \nPresident, let me share with you yet another quote from Senator Durbin: \n``There is only one agricultural product in America that has a body \ncount, and it is tobacco. That is why it is different, and that is why \nit is treated differently.''\n  And what about Senator Lautenberg? He summed the anti-tobacco views \nof Bill Clinton, Al Gore and the Congressional left by offering this \nadvice to tobacco growers: ``Grow soybeans.''\n  Now we have gotten to the point where, in the name of stopping teen \nsmoking, we have created a half-trillion-plus dollar bill--more than \ntwice the size of the Pentagon's budget--designed to stop what \nresearchers have told us is 2 percent of all smokers.\n  And is addressing teen smoking really the goal? The American people \ndon't think so. An April Wall Street Journal poll found that only 20 \npercent believed this tobacco bill is about stopping teen smoking. A \nresounding 70 percent say this effort is merely a back door way to go \nafter tobacco and take in more money for the government to spend.\n  In this mad dash for cash, 124,000 tobacco farm families are caught \nin the crossfire of political ambition and partisan competition--60,000 \nof them from Kentucky. They did not start this war. And they should not \nbe casualties. But casualties they will be if we do not act.\n  Senator Ford--whose work on behalf of all tobacco farmers is well \nknown and rightly applauded--and I agree that these growers should be \ncompensated. After all, they have done nothing wrong. Tobacco is a \nlegal commodity. Whatever the larger arguments may be about Joe Camel, \ntobacco farmers are not a party to that debate.\n  So Senator Ford and I agree that they need to be taken care of, we \ndisagree as to how. That disagreement arises from a fundamentally \ndifferent interpretation of the political and economic terrain in which \ntobacco grows.\n  Senator Ford has surveyed the scene and concluded that the federal \ntobacco program is healthy and will enjoy another 25 years of support \nfrom the United States Congress. In his estimation, the best thing to \ndo is continue the program and compensate farmers for the drop in \ndemand that this bill is specifically designed to produce.\n  Let me repeat. The single greatest danger to Kentucky tobacco farmers \nis the passage of the McCain bill. You cannot suck more than a half-\ntrillion dollars out of the tobacco industry without also ruining the \ntobacco farmer in the process.\n  As for me, I look at the same landscape as Senator Ford and come to \nthe same conclusion that the farmers in my state have reached. In a \nstatewide poll taken by the Lexington Herald-Leader in March, 70 \npercent of those who expressed an opinion said the program would be \ndead in less than five years. Let me restate that: 70 percent of \nfarmers think the tobacco program is on its deathbed. Seventy percent \nof farmers think they will be forced to earn a living doing something \nelse in just five years!\n  Like me, they look at the constant assault and realize a simple fact. \nElected representatives in our country fundamentally reflect the \nprevailing view of their constituents.\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\n  Let me remind us all that the vast majority of Americans polled are \nagainst smoking tobacco. A near majority of U.S. Senators think that \ntobacco farmers don't even deserve our support for basic crop \ninsurance. In the heart of tobacco country, the growers themselves are \npredicting the program's demise. And, finally, influential members of \nCongress have publicly declared that the tobacco program must die.\n  Mr. President, under the McCain bill or any other bill like it, the \ntobacco program is mortally wounded. It's struggling through the \nunderbrush, hemorrhaging and slowing with every step. The question is \nnot whether the tobacco program will end, it's when it will end if the \nMcCain bill becomes law?\n  In the face of the deep, widespread unpopularity of tobacco, does \nanyone seriously think that the government that is trying to kill \ntobacco TODAY in this very bill will then turn around and support a \ntaxpayer-funded program for a product widely-presumed to be \ncarcinogenic?\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the vast majority view in this \nCongress, in tobacco country, and in America generally is that, if the \nMcCain bill passes, the tobacco program will not survive. Knowing these \nfacts, the challenge before us is to make sure tobacco farmers do.\n  Senator Lugar's buy-out plan is tobacco growers' best hope to \ntransition to a new farm existence with the resources necessary to make \nit, or to retire with sufficient funds if they so choose.\n  Under Chairman Lugar's approach, quota owners will receive $8 per \npound for their tobacco spread out over three years. The average grower \nin my state farms a little over 4 acres, yielding roughly 10,000 pounds \nof tobacco annually. That means that the average Kentucky quota owner \nwill receive $80,000 over the next three years in buy-out payments.\n  In contrast, under the LEAF Act, the average farmer who wants to \nadapt to the changing world and take a buy-out, will only receive \n$24,000 pre-tax after three years.\n  The Lugar plan also invests $1 billion in rural economic assistance \nover 5 years for those communities hit hardest by the loss of tobacco \nincome. This money will help invest in education, retraining, \ndiversification, and give assistance to tobacco warehouse owners and \noperators.\n  Most importantly, under the Lugar plan tobacco growers may continue \nto grow and sell their product.\n  Let me repeat, under the Lugar plan every grower may continue to grow \nif they choose.\n  That is not the case under the LEAF Act. The LEAF Act specifically \nforbids Kentucky burley growers from growing tobacco for 25 years. \nSince the average age of a tobacco grower in my state is 60, that is \neffectively a lifetime ban on growing tobacco.\n  But that's not all. Under the LEAF Act, if you are a North Carolina \nflue-cured quota owner, you get a buy-out and then you get to keep on \ngrowing tobacco. That is simply unfair, and on that basis alone I \ncannot support a system that treats Kentucky growers worse than North \nCarolina growers.\n  As we move through this debate, there are other concerns related to \nthe LEAF Act's buy-out funding that I will address, but for now, let me \nclose by saying that I believe the Lugar approach is the best for our \npeople in tobacco country. It provides a generous flow of money over a \nshort time period that allows our growers to invest, retire, diversify, \nget into a new line of work, or keep on farming tobacco. It provides \ncommunity investment dollars to help hard hit rural areas. And, it is \nthe best deal I believe we can get for tobacco growers if the McCain \nbill becomes law.\n  Let me conclude by summing up the decision before us. The Titanic has \ncome into the harbor for the moment. We have two choices. One, we can \nsend her back into the Atlantic with more lifeboats strapped to her \nside--but not enough boats to save everyone aboard. Or, we can unload \nall passengers while she's in safe harbor. I think the choice is clear.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to this important debate over the best \ncourse to follow for our tobacco farmers.\n  I conclude by saying I sincerely hope that the Senate will find a way \nto put this bill out of its misery.\n  I want to particularly commend the senior Senator from Texas for the \noutstanding work he has done on this bill over the last 3\\1/2\\ weeks. \nHe has been tenacious and effective in pointing out the flaws in this \nbill conceptually. The whole concept, I say to my friend from Texas, is \nfatally flawed and no one has pointed that out better than he has. I \nwant to thank him on behalf of the 60,000 farm families in my State \nthat, but for the leadership and tenacity of the senior Senator from \nTexas, would be destroyed because the ultimate threat to my people is \nthis bill. This is what is designed to destroy their livelihood.\n  I think until the Senator from Texas decided to put the bit in his \nteeth and come over here and fight this thing, there was widespread \nfeeling that it was just going to happen. I am hoping we may have \nreached a point in the Senate where it isn't going to happen. If we can \nfind a way to put this horrible proposal out of its misery, I will \nalways thank the Senator from Texas for his extraordinary leadership \nand good work in pointing out the fundamental flaws in this proposal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we always love it when someone has \nsomething nice to say about us, but I am especially grateful when one \nas thoughtful as the Senator from Kentucky has something nice to say, \nespecially when it is about me. I have been grateful to the Senator \nfrom Kentucky for his leadership on many, many tough issues and his \ncomments today, therefore, are doubly appreciated. I thank him for his \ncomments.\n  I have a little housekeeping before I speak. This has been cleared on \nboth sides. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate continue \nconsideration of S. 1415 for debate only until the hour of 4 p.m. \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I believe that we are reaching the final \nhours of the debate, and rather than try to go back and replow ground \nthat we have now plowed over and over again--in fact, we have been on \nthis bill since May 18. Looking at my watch with the date on it, unless \nI missed a month that has 30 days instead of 31, today is the 17th of \nJune. We have, for a month, debated this issue.\n  Quite frankly, I would like to say as we enter the final hours of the \ndebate, I am proud of this debate. I am very proud of the Senate. When \nJefferson came home from France, where he had been minister to France, \nas many of my colleagues will recall, while the Constitution was being \nwritten, he went to Mount Vernon to visit with General Washington. They \nwere discussing the Constitution and Jefferson said to Washington, \n``What is the Senate for if the House of Representatives is to be the \nbody that represents the people, if it is to be the people's House, if \nit is to be the legislative body?'' ``What is the Senate for?'' \nJefferson asked. Washington, who, of course, was a southerner, had \npoured his tea out of the cup into his saucer to cool, and he explained \nto Jefferson that the cup would be like the House of Representatives; \nit would be caught up in the passions of the moment--with Members \nelected every 2 years--and that passions would flare and the House \nwould justifiably respond to those passions. But the Senate would be \nthe saucer, where the tea would cool before it was consumed. That was \nthe purpose of the Senate, and I think the Senate's rules, which \nobviously have evolved from that constitutional system, have in this \ncase, as they have on many occasions, served the public well.\n\n  I believe this bill will die today. I believe that we will see the \nbill sent back to committee. Now, another bill on the same subject, \nwithin the parameters of reason and responsibility and limited \ngovernment and within the budget might come alive another day. But I \nbelieve that this bill will justifiably come to a legislative end \ntoday. I believe that the system has worked well.\n  This bill, in many ways, reminds me of another bill--the Clinton \nhealth care bill. I remember that debate vividly; I was very much \ninvolved in it. I remember the President was talking about this bill \nthat ``the public wanted,'' that it was unstoppable. Even those who\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\nwere offering substitutes for it were adopting its basic principle. It \nlooked as if it were 200 feet tall, and no one was willing to come \nforward and even say they were against it. But like the mighty Goliath \nof old, when someone did step forward with a few small stones and flung \nthe first stone, the giant tumbled. Probably a better analogy would be \nwhen someone took a very small pin and just pricked its belly and it \nwent boom; it was a lot of hot air.\n  The American people were never for the government taking over and \nrunning the health care system. And in reality, the American people \nwere never for this bill. Had we been forced to vote on this bill the \nfirst day it came to the Senate, it no doubt would have passed by an \noverwhelming margin. Had we been forced to vote on this bill the first \nweek it came to the Senate, at the end of that debate, it would have \npassed by a smaller margin. Each day, support for this bill--or fear of \nit, depending on your perspective--has declined dramatically. Today, it \nis my hope and my opinion that the bill will be taken from the floor \nbecause, in the final analysis, there never was any support for this \nbill.\n  I don't know where this bill came from. I don't know whether it was a \nfocus group conducted by the Democratic National Committee, or whether \nit was a poll. But the bottom line is, the bill never had any real \nsupport from the American people. In reality, this bill was always a \ngiant bait and switch. The bait was the tobacco companies. We have \nheard our colleagues justifiably try, convict, and hang or lynch--\ndepending on your perspective--the tobacco companies, and justifiably \nso in many cases. But while our colleagues sought to get us to focus on \nthese tobacco companies, the reality of their bill, if you read it, is \nthat it does not impose a penny of taxes on the tobacco companies. In \nreality, it has an extraordinary provision, and that extraordinary \nprovision is that it makes it illegal for the tobacco companies to not \npass through every penny of taxes to the consumer.\n\n  So in reality, while the proponents of this bill were forever trying \nto divert our attention to the tobacco companies--and facts are \npersistent things--the reality of this bill is that it doesn't tax \ntobacco companies. The reality of this bill is that it basically taxes \nblue-collar workers, because smoking--obviously, with many exceptions \nwhen you count people, but a very small number of exceptions when you \nlook at averages--smoking in America is basically a blue-collar \nphenomenon. So our colleagues have vilified the tobacco companies and \nthey created sympathy in the country.\n  It must be like the old story of this tiger who comes out of the \nforest and eats people in the village, so they send to the provincial \ncapital for a great warrior to come forward. He comes forth and pulls \nout his sword and dances around. The tiger comes out, and instead of \nkilling the tiger, which would produce a tremendous eruption of \napplause, he starts beating the tiger with the side of his sword. \nFinally, the people become so outraged, they stone the warrior. In a \nvery strange way, the proponents of this bill have so overdone it that \nthey have created some sympathy, as the polls show very clearly, for \nthe tobacco companies--one of the most incredible reversals of public \nopinion that I, as somewhat of a minor student of it, have observed. \nBut the reality is that with all the talk of the tobacco companies, \nthey pay none of the tax. The tax is borne by blue-collar Americans.\n  The stubborn facts are that 34 percent of the taxes that will be \ncollected by this bill will be paid for by Americans who make less than \n$15,000 a year; 47.1 percent of the taxes will be paid for by Americans \nwho make less than $22,000 a year; 59.1 percent of the taxes will be \npaid for by Americans who make less than $30,000 a year.\n  So no matter how many times the proponents of this bill vilify the \ntobacco companies, the cold reality which the American people, as we \ndebated this issue for a month, came to understand was that with all of \nthe things that the tobacco companies did, were verbally convicted of, \nand punished for right here on the floor of the Senate, was that they \nweren't being taxed; we were taxing blue-collar Americans. That is the \nfirst thing that Americans came to understand as we debated this bill \nfor a month.\n  The second thing they came to understand was the incredible amount of \nmoney that was going to be raised in these taxes, and not only the \nburden that would impose--a massive burden--but how that money was \ngoing to be largely squandered. I remind my colleagues that, for \nexample, in my State, we have 3.1 million Texans who smoke. Under this \nbill, if those 3.1 million Texans--we have 3,137,723 people in my State \nwho smoke--would have continued to smoke a pack of cigarettes a day \nafter the passage of this bill, given the estimate that this bill, in \nthe end, when you figure everything in, would have driven up the price \nby $2.78 a pack, they would have paid an additional $1,015 a year in \nFederal taxes.\n  Now, I remind my colleagues that 34 percent of that tax would have \nbeen paid for by people that made $15,000 or less. So we were talking \nabout a confiscatory tax on blue-collar America. The American people, \nover a month, despite all the efforts to confuse the subject, came to \nunderstand that point. That is a major reason why this bill is about to \ncome to the end of its legislative life.\n\n  The second thing the American people came to understand was how money \nwas squandered in this bill, how in this bill we were ratifying \nagreements where plaintiffs' attorneys were going to earn $92,000 an \nhour, how in this bill we were providing money for smoker cessation for \nNative Americans who live on or near Indian reservations. If they smoke \nat the same rate the general public does, we would be spending $39,000 \nper beneficiary, with the goal of trying to promote the cessation of \nsmoking--$39,000 a person.\n  They came to realize that under the provisions of the bill related to \ntobacco growers, one of those provisions would have ended up paying \ntobacco growers an incredible $22,297.29 an acre, and they could still \nown the land and still grow the tobacco.\n  People came to realize that this program literally gave tens of \nbillions of dollars to various advocacy groups that would be advocating \nmany things other than just smoking.\n  So in the end, the American people came to see this bill as having \nrelatively little to do with teenage smoking and everything to do with \ntaxing and spending, but doing so at a grander scale than anything we \nhave seen in government in a long time.\n  I would have to say that I know it is popular now for people who are \ncovering the debate and discussing it to talk about ads that the \ntobacco companies have run. But I would like to give a dissenting view. \nI do not believe that this bill is going to come to a legislative end \ntoday because tobacco companies have run ads against it. I think in the \nend that the American people never bought into the idea that this bill \nwas going to have any substantial impact on teenage smoking. I think \nthe American people never bought into the idea that this was anything \nother than a tax-and-spend bill, and the more they knew about the bill, \nthe more conviction they had in that basic belief.\n  So despite the master work of spend and manipulation, which the White \nHouse, and I say admiringly, has and can engage in, despite an effort \nby all of the groups who supported the bill, and those groups \nultimately came down to groups that wanted the money, despite all of \nthat effort, in the end the Dicky Flatts of the world, the people who \ndo the work and pay the taxes and pull the wagon, listen to our \nPresident, listen to the advocates of this bill, heard its high and \nnoble stated objectives, but in reality in the end, after a month of \ndebate, they finally saw this bill for what it really is--an effort to \ntake money away from blue-collar workers and to have the government \nspend it, and spend it in a way that is obscene. There is no other word \nfor it than that. The level of spending in this bill and the way the \nmoney is thrown around is almost beyond imagination, and in the end the \nAmerican people recognized it.\n  So I don't know that you can ever pat anybody on the back when you \nend up not doing a bad thing. I guess part of any legislative process \nis to try to do good things and to try to stop bad things from \nhappening. And when you defeat a bad bill, you have done a good thing.\n  But I think in the end this bill failed because the American people \nrejected\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\nit. And it was an amazing thing. Maybe there is a lesson for all of us \nin this. It was exactly like the Clinton health bill. In Washington it \nlooked like everybody in the world was for this bill. In Washington it \nlooked as if this bill was totally and completely irresistable. But yet \nwhen you get outside of Washington, back in America, the public either \nwas totally disinterested in this issue or they were against it. So in \nthe end the American people knew more than we knew, and as a result, \nfor the good of the Nation, this bill is going to die.\n\n  Let me conclude, because I know my dear colleague from Delaware is \nhere, and I want to maintain his friendship, which I value and \ntreasure. I would like to make the following point.\n  I do believe there are things we can do to deal with teenage smoking. \nI think we have to start by holding teenagers accountable for what they \ndo. I think there are ways that we can tighten up the law to penalize \npeople who knowingly sell tobacco products to teenagers and knowingly \nsell alcohol to teenagers and sell illegal drugs to teenagers. I think \nthere are many things we can do. But the focus ought to be on the \nproblem, which is teenage smoking.\n  I also believe that a fundamental premise of this bill is false; that \nis, that people are not responsible for what they do, that somehow \nsomebody smokes and it is the tobacco company that made them smoke.\n  I used to, as this debate was underway, love to tease my 85-year-old \nmother, that she had not smoked for 70 years because she wanted to, \nthat it was this Joe Camel that made her smoke. She hardly knew who Joe \nCamel was. But she had a telling point, which was my first indication \nthat in the end this bill probably was not going to make it. Her point \nwas a simple question, which the proponents of this bill tried their \nbest--and they were very talented--but they could never answer the \nquestion. Her point was: ``If I am the victim, if the tobacco companies \nhave conspired to force me to smoke and I am still doing it at 85, how \ncome you are raising my taxes? If I am the victim, how come I am being \npunished?''\n  In the end, that was the question that not only was not answered, but \ncould not be answered.\n  I want to congratulate our colleagues who were leaders on this issue. \nI don't think anybody ever questioned their sincerity.\n  I especially want to say about Senator McCain, that under very \ndifficult circumstances with his dearest friends in opposition on an \nissue where there were very, very strong emotional feelings on both \nsides of the debate, I especially want to congratulate Senator McCain \nfor the way he was able to separate issues from personalities. He was a \nperson who was asked to do a hard job; and that is to get the best bill \nhe could out of committee. He did that. But when the bill got to the \nfloor and we got a chance to look at it, the basic conclusion was the \nbest bill that could be gotten out of committee was not good enough. So \nbasically that is where we are.\n  We will see a vote on a point of order. And the point of order is not \na trivial matter. The point of order that we will vote on today is a \npoint of order that has to do with the fact that this bill circumvents \nthe balanced budget agreement. This bill raises spending above the \nlimits that we set out in the budget. This bill would bust the budget, \nbust the spending caps, and violate all of the fiscal restraints that \nwe have imposed.\n  So Members of the Senate will be asked in the vote--and I assume that \nthe minority leader will move to waive the Budget Act. There will be a \npoint of order that makes the point of order that this bill violates \nthe budget, violates the spending caps, and would violate the balanced \nbudget amendment. Then I assume that the minority leader, or someone, \nwill move to waive that point of order. In doing so, they are saying, \npass the tobacco bill even if it means busting the budget agreement.\n  I hope and believe that enough of our colleagues will vote ``no'' on \nthat so that we can sustain the Budget Act. The bill would then go back \nto the Commerce Committee.\n  If all of these problems can be fixed, if a consensus could be built, \nthere would be nothing to prevent this issue in another form, with \nanother bill, with another approach, from coming to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  But if we send the bill back by sustaining the point of order, we are \nsaying that this approach in this bill is not good enough. I hope that \nis what we will do.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I was about to ask that we move into \nmorning business to speak. My friend from Kentucky wants to speak on \nthis matter, and I will in 10 seconds yield to him.\n  I say to my friend from Texas, it is always a joy to listen to him. \nThe fairy tales he remembers always warm my heart. But I think he \nsometimes gets it mixed up. I think the Goliath here was the tobacco \ncompanies with their millions of dollars, and in the health care fight \nit was the insurance companies with their millions of dollars. I have \nno doubt my friend, with a small sling and a small stone, with his \nskill could take down Goliath, but in this case he had a few cruise \nmissiles. The cruise missiles were the $40 million the tobacco \ncompanies are spending on advertising to kill this bill and the $14 \nbillion that Harry and Louise spent on television to kill health care \nreform.\n  I don't doubt his prowess, but I acknowledge he probably had a little \nbit of help. It was a nuclear bomb in that little sling that David had, \nand it was worth tens of millions of dollars. It works every time in \nthis town, and I just find it absolutely fascinating.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I would be delighted to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I guess I ought to remind my colleagues that David was not \nalone on that battlefield either.\n  Mr. BIDEN. No, I know he wasn't. But I just want to point out that in \nthat case David had several hundred--\n  Mr. FORD. The Senator is not suggesting he is with you.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Perhaps the same force is on this side on this issue. Who \nknows.\n  Mr. BIDEN. David was not alone, nor was my colleague with the sling. \nHe had a force behind him of noble tobacco merchants who stood shoulder \nto shoulder making sure that their ultimate threat was, if they didn't \nget a bill they wanted, they were going to continue to advertise. Isn't \nthat kind of fascinating. These no-good sons of guns talking about how \nthey care about the health of America. Much of the criticism this bill \nhad leveled at it I agree with. I agree with much of the criticism.\n  But the idea that at the end of the day--at the end of the day--we \nare going to have no bill and these young pages sitting here in front \nof me, their peer group is going to end up, every single day, being \nlured by specifically teenage-based advertising done by companies that \nlied straight out, right through their teeth, about what they have been \ndoing. These companies are going to continue to consciously--\nconsciously--attempt to addict them to nicotine, a conscious effort \nwhere they will spend tens of millions of dollars this year, next year, \nand the following years in advertising to addict them--addict them--and \nthey are going to do it.\n  Notwithstanding the fact I had criticisms with some parts of this \nbill, at the end of the day, they win. They win big, and our children \nlose. Our children lose. And so David in this case had some cruise \nmissiles. They were all paid for by big tobacco --big tobacco, period. \nI am not talking about tobacco farmers. They grow it. They get a small \npiece of this action. They don't do the advertising. I am talking about \nthe tobacco executives.\n  And so it is going to be business as usual. But mark my words--let me \nend with this--the tobacco companies, from the advertising they have \nbeen out with now about how bad this bill is, if they are serious, I \nask them in good conscience, for the health of the Nation--which they \nhave now finally had to acknowledge has been put in peril by their \naction--I ask them publicly: voluntarily refrain from advertising, \nvoluntarily refrain from advertising in any way that appeals to our \nchildren --if they have one ounce of moral fiber in them. We don't need \na bill. They can\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\ntake care of this if they have any decency. Just voluntarily stop. No \nGovernment, no tax, no nothing. They know what they are doing to our \nchildren, and they are intending to do it.\n  So if they want to solve the problem, it is real simple. Voluntarily \nstop. As was said years ago in a committee by a witness to a former \nSenator named McCarthy--at one point the witness looked up and said, \n``Have you no decency, sir?'' My question to the tobacco executives of \nAmerica today is, Have you no decency? If you do, stop, stop luring our \nchildren.\n  I yield to my friend from Kentucky, and then later I am going to come \nback and ask to speak to Kosovo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. FORD. I ask unanimous consent that I might speak for 5 minutes \nand that at the end of that period of time my friend from Delaware be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FORD. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, a few moments ago, my colleague from Kentucky \ninserted some editorials in the Record--a few, and selective letters to \nthe editor concerning our debate over the future of tobacco farmers.\n  I do not want to take a lot of time on this matter, but I do not want \nanyone to get the mistaken impression that these articles represent the \nprevailing view in my State. I have 30 pages or more here, Madam \nPresident, of articles of my own, editorials with headlines like--and \nthis is the Owensboro Messenger and Inquirer that my colleague \nmentioned a few moments ago. It says, ``Lugar Tobacco Bill Punishes \nFarmers.'' I think that tells a lot and that there are opinions at home \nthat are somewhat different.\n  Rather than take a lot of time, Madam President, I will simply ask \nunanimous consent that some of these articles be printed in the Record, \nand anyone with any doubt can simply read them, and they will \nunderstand how average tobacco farmers feel about the Lugar proposal.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n         [From the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, Apr. 26, 1998]\n\n                  Lugar Tobacco Bill Punishes Farmers\n\n       Spending the long, hot summers of Kentucky in the tobacco \n     field has been a way of life for many farm families this \n     century, and farmers hope it continues another 100 years.\n       But tobacco's fate has never been as shaky as it is today, \n     as lawmakers battle over a way to curb teenage smoking at the \n     tobacco industry's expense.\n       One of those battles is in our own backyard, between \n     Kentucky's U.S. Sen. Wendell Ford and Indiana's U.S. Sen. \n     Richard Lugar. We believe it is a fight Ford should win.\n       Ford, a Democrat from Daviess County, proposes a plan that \n     will protect tobacco families harmed financially by tougher \n     anti-smoking legislation. Ford's plan would provide $28.5 \n     billion over 25 years to assist tobacco farmers, communities \n     and workers who suffer because of decline in tobacco demand \n     and jobs. The quota holder--farmers who have an allotted \n     amount of tobacco they can sell--along with those who \n     sharecrop and lease those quotas would receive up to $8 a \n     pound for their losses.\n       Ford's bill also calls for the continuation of the tobacco \n     program created in the post-Depression days that sets prices \n     and limits production.\n       Lugar, a Republican, thinks government price supports for \n     tobacco are wrong and ought to end.\n       Those who hold quotas to grow tobacco but want to get out \n     of the business would receive $8 per pound under Lugar's \n     plan. Those who want to continue to grow would do so under \n     free market conditions, but Lugar proposes transitional \n     payment to wean farmers off the program. Grain farmers are \n     receiving similar payments that decrease each year to ease \n     their departure from price supports.\n       Lugar's bill would cost less, an estimated $15 billion, but \n     its effect on Kentuckians would be punitive.\n       We agree that Lugar's argument has merit. The global \n     economy has turned to a free market on tobacco, and much of \n     the reasoning for protecting the U.S. system is in conflict \n     with that fact.\n       We also think the length of Ford's plan is too generous. We \n     believe supplanting lost income for 10 years is more fiscally \n     responsible than 25 years, while still easing the burden on \n     farmers.\n       But it is important not to lose the intangibles involved in \n     tobacco production. Generations of Kentuckians have built \n     their lives around growing a perfectly legal, and at times, \n     revered crop. Any effort to strip the protections that \n     farmers have grown up with could only hurt those families and \n     the commonwealth as a whole.\n       While Lugar compares his phaseout plan to the grain \n     program, the effects on tobacco would be exponentially \n     greater. While only 1.2 percent of Kentucky farm acreage is \n     used for growing tobacco, the crop produces 25 percent of \n     Kentucky's farm income.\n       Tobacco farmers already are threatened by American \n     companies increasing the amount of imported tobacco. Lugar's \n     bill effectively bullies more family farmers out of business.\n       That would be a sad statement as we enter the next century.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, May 27, 1998]\n\n           Rural Areas Must Survive, Even if Tobacco Doesn't\n\n                      (By Wendell and John Berry)\n\n       In the midst of the Depression of the 1930's the tobacco \n     farmers, who had experienced a long history of exploitation \n     by the tobacco companies and who were in want as a result, \n     asked their government for help. The result was the tobacco \n     program. This program, run at practically no cost to the \n     government, has kept a lot of small farmers in business for a \n     long time. The program enacted a kind of economic justice, \n     helping the farmers to survive by assuring them a fair price \n     for their products.\n       Virtually from the beginning, the program has been under \n     attack from proponents of the so-called free market. In more \n     recent years, tobacco itself has come under attack because of \n     its adverse effects on the health of smokers and other users. \n     And so we have come to the moral dilemma of a good program \n     protecting the producers of an unhealthy product. We have \n     come at the same time to the need to make a political \n     distinction between the program and the product, and this is \n     difficult.\n       The defenders of the tobacco program are not arguing that \n     tobacco is healthful. They are arguing that the program is \n     necessary to maintain the rural economy while we make a \n     large-scale transition from tobacco to other crops. They and \n     their allies are arguing that to allow the rural economy of \n     Kentucky and other tobacco states to crash will not eliminate \n     smoking and is not a sane way to end our farmers' dependence \n     on tobacco. On the contrary, it will do great harm in order \n     to do no good whatsoever.\n       Sen. Mitch McConnell would like to claim (and he may be \n     expected to claim when he runs for office again) that by \n     washing his hands of his state's rural economy he has helped \n     the farmers. In fact, as soon as it appeared expedient, he \n     had done what he has always wanted to do, for he disagrees \n     with the principle that the government should protect the \n     economically weak from exploitation by the economically \n     strong. He has demonstrated his true allegiance by consenting \n     to Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar's estimate that the livelihoods \n     of Kentucky farm families are worth only $80,000 apiece, and \n     that the livelihoods of all the other participants in the \n     rural economy are worth nothing.\n       The political philosophy underlying this betrayal does not \n     concern itself with the question of what is right, but merely \n     subordinates all issues to the crudest sort of economic \n     determination. Lugar put it plainly: the tobacco program is \n     not defensible, he said, because ``In many markets, U.S. \n     tobacco is not competitive on price.''\n       In other words, if farmers in the United States cannot \n     undersell farmers working at slave wages in the Third World, \n     then they deserve to fail. This is a different kind of \n     economic justice. Asking the farmer (like the industrial \n     worker) to produce more for less has always been the \n     objective of the ``free market'' politicians, because farmers \n     and wage earners don't give as large political donations as \n     do the interests that exploit them.\n       McConnell and Lugar propose to scatter several billions of \n     government dollars among many thousands of farmers \n     individually. This money will be taxed by government when it \n     is paid out and again when it is spent. Obviously, nobody \n     knows yet how it will be spent, but it will not necessarily \n     be spent in ways that will help the farmers to keep on \n     farming or the state's rural economy to remain intact.\n       It is, at any rate, hard to imagine how a farm family's \n     prospects might be significantly improved by $80,000 paid to \n     them in compensation for the loss of a staple crop that, with \n     the program, would have been worth far more.\n       The only other available way to help our state's rural \n     economy in this crisis would be to preserve the tobacco \n     program as the agent of a gradual transition from dependence \n     on tobacco to dependence on other crops--a transition which \n     the Burley Co-op, in fact, has been working on for the past \n     six years, in co-operation with allies both within and \n     outside agriculture, urban as well as rural.\n       This rural is based on the recognition of the tobacco \n     farmers' demonstrated and potential capacity for food \n     production. Though this transition is still in its infancy, \n     there is already much evidence that it can be made--and also \n     that it cannot be made within the next three years. To pay \n     farmers an average of $80,000 over three years for their \n     tobacco quotas, without having in place some alternative to \n     tobacco, is about the same as paying them to quit farmers.\n       Obviously, there are some who would like to see all the \n     same farmers put out of business, specifically for the \n     benefit of big farmers but that aim makes no agricultural \n     sense anywhere, and the loss of the small-farm economy would \n     be especially devastating in Kentucky. We have a lot of small \n     farmers,\n\n[[Page S6461]]\n\n     and much of our landscape, to be properly conserved, needs to \n     be farmed in small acreages.\n       If the farmers fail, then other members of the rural \n     communities whose businesses or professions depend on farm \n     income must also fail. Where are these people to go? How are \n     they to earn a living? What will be the impact of their \n     failure on the economies of our cities? Do McConnell and \n     Lugar think that failed farmers and rural merchants will be \n     so obliging as to simply disappear?\n       To develop new crops and other agricultural sources of \n     income for farmers requires that we must find the markets and \n     solve the problems of production, transportation, storage and \n     processing. People now involved in this effort estimate that \n     it will take at least 15 years. Tobacco farmers have always \n     assumed that even their worst enemies in Washington would not \n     pull the rug from under them, and that any plan to eliminate \n     the program would be gradual, allowing time for the \n     development of alternatives. After all, ending the tobacco \n     program will not end tobacco production any more than it will \n     end smoking.\n       What it will do is enable the tobacco companies to buy \n     their tobacco at a much lower price, and thus shift a \n     significant part of the cost of the ``tobacco settlement'' \n     onto the growers. This, not help to farmers, will be the \n     certain result--and we suspect it was the motive--of \n     McConnell's sudden alliance with Lugar.\n       There are many people in Kentucky and the nation who \n     believe that our rural people and places are worth saving, \n     and that our small farmers are better producers and stewards \n     than the industrialized agribusiness firms that are trying to \n     replace them.\n       The wishes of those people are reflected in Sen. Wendell \n     Ford's LEAF Act--which McConnell, for reasons now unclear, \n     once co-sponsored. To put an end to the hopes of so many and \n     to jeopardize the economy of an entire region ought not to be \n     the sole prerogative of McConnell.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, May 20, 1998]\n\n The Best Deal?--Plan McConnell Backs Brings in Quick Cash, but Would \n                    Ultimately Kill Off Small Farms\n\n       In purely pecuniary terms, Sen. Mitch McConnell might be \n     right. Maybe the best deal Kentucky can get is a quick cash \n     buyout of tobacco quotas. We know many landowners are \n     salivating at the prospect of collecting $8 a pound over \n     three years under the proposal McConnell endorsed Monday.\n       But McConnell's dollars-and-cents calculation ignores the \n     inevitable losses. The greatest of these losses would be \n     farming as we know it in Kentucky.\n       Cigarette makers would benefit from cheaper tobacco grown \n     on fewer but larger farms, while rural communities up and \n     down both sides of the Appalachians would be torn by the \n     upheaval.\n       Without the government's tobacco price support program, \n     thousands of small family farms from Maryland to Georgia, \n     would cease to be. some would be paved over and subdivided. \n     Banks would take some. Cedar trees and marijuana patches \n     would take some, too.\n       The communities these farms support also would cease to be, \n     replaced by commuters and pensioners.\n       As the Senate debates the tobacco bill this week, the \n     spotlight's glare will be on teen smoking and how much relief \n     from lawsuits the cigarette companies should get. The fate of \n     hand-tended hill farms is likely to get lost in the glare, or \n     subsumed buy a Republican ideology that insists on a pure \n     free market in agriculture.\n       It seems to us, though, the fate of tobacco farms has more \n     to do with issues of land stewardship and national \n     agricultural policy than with smoking and product liability.\n       Do we want American agriculture to be nothing but \n     industrial-scale operations and corporate contractors? Are we \n     ready to do all our shopping at the Supermarket to the World? \n     Or should we save a place for family farms that pasture \n     cattle, sell produce at the farmers market, grow a few acres \n     of tobacco and depend on government planning to smooth out \n     the ups and downs of the invisible hand?\n       It's a vital question, and one that shouldn't wait until \n     the tobacco program, like the rest of America's farm \n     programs, is dismantled.\n       For 60 years, the government has kept tobacco production in \n     line with demand and guaranteed growers a good minimum price. \n     Growers bear all but a little of the program's cost; there is \n     no tobacco subsidy, contrary to popular belief.\n       As a result, Kentucky has more farms than all but three \n     states. The tobacco program has immunized tobacco-growing \n     regions against the consolidation of land and the loss of \n     farmers that is fast remaking the rest of rural America.\n       The plan that McConnell endorsed, introduced by Senate \n     Agriculture Chairman Richard Lugar, R-Indiana, should be \n     viewed in its proper context--as the logical extension of the \n     Freedom to Farm Act that ended the federal role in \n     agricultural planning. In this new free market, farms on the \n     Northern Plains already are going under, according to the \n     Wall Street Journal, because the climate there is too cold \n     for farmers to play the global market by growing anything but \n     wheat. U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman says Freedom \n     to Farm should be revisited.\n       Until Monday, McConnell was co-sponsor of Sen. Wendell \n     Ford's LEAF Act, which would preserve the price support \n     program and provide tobacco communities with a much softer \n     landing than the Lugar-McConnell plan.\n       That Kentucky's two senators have split on this most \n     important tobacco question shows how very difficult it is.\n       Neither the Ford nor McConnell approach is perfect. Some \n     hybrid of the two would be a better alternative. But if it \n     comes to an either-or-choice, we're for the conservative \n     approach, which oddly enough, is the one espoused by Democrat \n     Ford.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, May 21, 1998]\n\n     Untimely Demise--McConnell Plan Kills Tobacco Program Too Fast\n\n       Some see Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's shift to \n     supporting an abrupt end to the tobacco price-support program \n     as a political ploy aimed at sinking Arizona Sen. John \n     McCain's anti-smoking bill.\n       Whether or not that's McConnell's strategy, he is putting \n     rural Kentucky at too much risk. At the very least, the \n     Republican from Louisville should demand tobacco farmers get \n     as much time as grain farmers to make the transition to a \n     free market.\n       Under the timeline McConnell endorsed just this week, \n     tobacco-dependent communities would have way too little time \n     to prepare for the economic upheaval. Likewise, farmers and \n     farm cooperatives wouldn't have time to build up markets for \n     other crops and products.\n       McConnell says the 68-year-old system of production \n     controls and guaranteed minimum prices for tobacco is doomed. \n     He says a mandatory buyout at $8 a pound is the best deal \n     Kentucky farmers can get. If that's so, give farmers a \n     certain date when the program will end. But make it a \n     reasonable date.\n       What McConnell and Senate Agriculture Chairman Richard \n     Lugar propose is not reasonable. Their three-year phaseout of \n     the program is too quick. Payments to grain farmers under the \n     Freedom to Farm Act, by contrast, are lasting seven years. \n     And some people think Freedom to Farm will be overhauled when \n     the payments end in 2002.\n       We're not necessarily saying spread out the tobacco \n     payments, since there are advantages to getting the money in \n     a lump. We are saying give farmers more time to grow tobacco \n     under production controls before jerking the safety net from \n     under them.\n       The McConnell-Lugar plan is just as stingy with financial \n     aid to tobacco communities. The competing proposal by Sen. \n     Wendell Ford would pump $8.3 billion over 25 years into \n     educational grants and economic assistance to tobacco-growing \n     areas. The Lugar-McConnell plan provides $1 billion, which is \n     not enough to have much impact. Ford's proposal also \n     continues the price support program.\n       We doubt the tobacco program's prognosis is as dire as \n     McConnell claims. The politics of tobacco have changed \n     drastically in the last few months. Anti-smoking forces have \n     come out in support of keeping some form of a tobacco \n     program. So has President Clinton. They realize that in an \n     uncontrolled environment, the cigarette makers get a \n     projected $1 billion a year windfall from cheaper and more \n     plentiful American tobacco, while many rural communities get \n     the shaft.\n       That McConnell has embraced such an unbending approach \n     reinforces the notion that he's really out to kill the \n     tobacco bill. By staking out an extreme position, he lessens \n     the chance of compromise with Southern Democrats defending \n     the program.\n       We can't forget McConnell heads political fund-raising for \n     Senate Republicans. The death of the McCain bill would make \n     the cigarette companies happy, and happy cigarette companies \n     would pump even more millions into Republican campaign \n     coffers. A lot of Kentucky farmers would love to see the \n     anti-smoking legislation disappear, too.\n       But that seems unlikely, given the public's revulsion at \n     the cigarette companies' shameless efforts through the years \n     to hook kids.\n       When it becomes clear he can't stop the inevitable, we \n     trust McConnell will use his clout as a member of the \n     Senate's majority to undo the Lugar plan, and give rural \n     Kentucky a fighting chance. We hope it won't be too late.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Kentucky Post, May 22, 1998]\n\n        McConnell's About-Face Might Mark End of Tobacco Quotas\n\n                            (By Bill Straub)\n\n       Mayfield, Ky.--Over the past decade, Sen Mitch McConnell \n     has proved himself to be the most astute politician in \n     Kentucky and certainly one of the smartest in the nation.\n       Under his guidance, the state Republican Party, once a \n     laughing stock, has emerged to not only dominate the \n     Bluegrass congressional delegation but challenge the \n     Democratic Party's traditional hold on Frankfort. Were it not \n     for McConnell's touch and tactics, folks like Rep. Ron Lewis \n     would be back selling Bibles in Salvisa.\n       Even when it seemed like McConnell tripped up there was a \n     method to his madness.\n       He has, for instance, earned the enmity of do-gooders \n     everywhere for his no-holds-barred opposition to campaign \n     finance reform. Yet, as he delights in pointing out, no one \n     has ever won or lost an election based on electoral process \n     issues, and the GOP is reaping the benefits of his \n     recalcitrance by pulling in contributions as if it were \n     printing money.\n\n[[Page S6462]]\n\n       The time, however, it just seems like madness.\n       On Monday, the Louisville Republican announced he was \n     abandoning his support for the tobacco program and siding \n     with Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., chairman of the Senate \n     Agriculture Committee, in seeking to have it abolished.\n       It could be the biggest political story of the decade. \n     Imagine a Texas lawmaker suggesting that vehicles propelled \n     by fossil fuel cause too much pollution and embracing a \n     proposal to convert to cars that run on electricity. That's \n     what McConnell has done--in spades.\n       Burley is Kentucky's number one cash crop, pulling in $1 \n     billion per year. But it's more than that. It's grown on \n     60,000 farms, permitting uncounted numbers of men and women \n     to retain their beloved rural way of life.\n       This is not Nebraska or Kansas, where thousands of acres of \n     wheat and soybeans are grown as far as the eye can see on \n     huge spreads. Kentucky's farms are small, family owned and \n     operated, and the hilly and rocky terrain prohibits a lot of \n     row crops.\n       That's why tobacco has proved invaluable over the decades. \n     Folks on these small farms take city jobs but tend to a \n     tobacco crop that brings in enough money to permit them to \n     stay on the land. It is, in every sense, Kentucky's cultural \n     legacy.\n       That heritage has been protected by the tobacco program. \n     The amount of burley produced every year is limited by a \n     quota system. It elevates the price and stops farmers from \n     other states from planting their own tobacco crop from fence \n     row to fence row.\n       Without the tobacco program, which operates at no net cost \n     to the federal government, its's hard to imagine small family \n     farms surviving for very long in Kentucky. It's that simple. \n     There's no crop that pays enough to take its place. Folks \n     don't earn enough in the factory to maintain their small plot \n     of heaven without it.\n       McConnell insists he is acting in the interest of these \n     farmers by killing the program. Its demise is inevitable, he \n     says, noting that support programs for wheat, corn and other \n     commodities have already been eliminated. Considering the \n     anti-tobacco fervor that seems to be overwhelming Washington \n     these days, he maintains that the responsible political \n     position is to join in the slaughter and broker the best deal \n     possible.\n       The rationale makes absolutely no sense.\n       For one thing, there remain some commodities, such as \n     peanuts, that continue to operate under a support system. \n     Many anti-tobacco activists support the tobacco program \n     because it limits production and keeps prices higher than \n     they otherwise might be--working as deterrent to smoking.\n       President Clinton, who has hopped on the anti-tobacco band \n     wagon with both feet, has expressed support for keeping the \n     price-support program.\n       The tobacco bill that passed out of committee contained a \n     provision offered by Senate Minority Whip Wendell Ford, the \n     Democrat from Owensboro, Ky., that offers a voluntary buyout \n     while keeping the price-support program.\n       There is absolutely no detectable groundswell to kill the \n     program despite the continuing animus for the tobacco \n     industry itself.\n       McConnell, suddenly, is leading the charge against what is \n     arguably the most important federal program in the entire \n     state when there is no army to lead.\n       But consider it politically. The Lugar plan calls for a \n     three-year phase out at a cost of $18 billion. Each farmer, \n     under the proposal, will receive $8 per quota pound.\n       What exactly has McConnell gained for Kentucky's small \n     farmers by colluding with the senator from Indiana?\n       Prior to what some are portraying as McConnell's betrayal, \n     the worst-case scenario for Kentucky farmers had the Senate \n     killing the price support program over objections from Ford, \n     McConnell and other tobacco state lawmakers--under the terms \n     of the Lugar bill, which hasn't changed significantly in \n     recent months.\n       McConnell's defection hasn't changed the terms of the \n     abolition debate, only provided cover to those who may have \n     been on the fence.\n       McConnell is a power in Washington these days and he \n     generally has served in the state's best interest.\n       But this move is inexplicable and the Republican Party he \n     has built and served with distinction could ultimately \n     suffer.\n\n  Mr. FORD. Madam President, let me just pick out a couple of headlines \nhere. ``The best deal? Plan McConnell backs brings in quick cash, but \nwould ultimately kill off small farms.'' ``Untimely demise. McConnell \nplan kills tobacco program too fast.''\n  These are in the Record.\n  My colleague, Senator McConnell, referred to Congressman Ron Lewis \nwho is for his position. Well, let me just say this, that Congressman \nRon Lewis said that blood would run through Congress before he would \ngive up the fight for the quota system. Then all of a sudden he now is \nfor selling out. The Republican nominee to replace me for the U.S. \nSenate is for the LEAF program, not for the side that Senator McConnell \nis on. So it raises a lot of suspicion in the minds of my folks back \nhome. Are Senator McConnell and Senator Lugar supporting the \nmanufacturers or are they supporting the farmer? Because if the Lugar \nplan would go into effect, it would save the tobacco manufacturers a \nminimum of $1 billion a year over the next 25 years.\n  And so when you have one major statewide official in Kentucky, \nelected official, representing the tobacco farmers in Kentucky for one \nposition, the others the other way--our Governor supports the LEAF \nplan--I just do not understand. Maybe it is the big bucks for the \nRepublican Senatorial Campaign Committee to kill this bill and, in \nfact, killing the bill, then can say that the farmers continue to grow \nas they are. But then everybody is worried about their demise. And if \nyou have a demise of the tobacco program, then we are in mighty bad \nshape without funding.\n  I was criticized for supporting Senator McCain and $1.10, but then we \nfind the Lugar-McConnell plan is using that money to pay the farmers. \nIf we didn't have the money, we would not be able to pay the farmers.\n  So, this thing gets awful mixed up. I will be very hopeful about \nthose who read this and those who understand what is happening.\n  I have a lot here I could talk about, but we have ENACT, that \nsupports the Ford-Hollings plan; an open letter from the tobacco \nStates, from all of the health groups and the tobacco groups supporting \nour plan. It just seems some way, somehow, there is something more than \ntrying to do something for farmers here and those who are trying to \ndefeat the program.\n  I might just say in closing, here is the Chicago Tribune today: \n``Health Funds Lose In Tobacco Talks: Everybody else gets their project \non and youth are forgotten.'' If we are going to forget youth in this \nbill, maybe it is time we send it back to the Commerce Committee and \ntry to write a bill that will be on target, that will save the youth \nfrom smoking.\n  I think these young pages, after they hear the debate here, will \nnever want to smoke, and I hope that is true. But when they become 21, \nthey can do basically whatever they want to do. At that point, if they \nhave not started smoking, they probably will not. But at the same time, \nwe have a lot of folks who depend on this program. What we have done is \nhelp phase it out rather than cut it off at the knees.\n  One of the things my friends on the other side, Senator Lugar and \nSenator McConnell, fail to say is when they do away with the program \nand the farmers get some money, they lose the value of their land. By \nsome $7 billion in Kentucky alone, the value of farmland will be \nreduced, because the farmland is based on the tobacco quota. When you \nadvertise a farm for sale, you put what the tobacco quota is in that \nfarm sale.\n  So, if we lose the farm program, as they would try to do, then we \nlose $7 billion in farmland value almost immediately. Some farmers \ncould go to bed at night with their farm at one price, get up in the \nnext morning and their farmland is at a lower price and it doesn't \ncover the mortgage, and the bank will foreclose on those farmers.\n  People have not thought this through: ``Pay them some money, and get \nout of the business.'' Pay them a little bit of money, help them \nthrough the transition period here so we might be able to save their \nway of life.\n  If my 5 minutes is up, I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from \nDelaware. He is always gracious, and I appreciate him as a friend very \nmuch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN.

Madam President, I rise at this moment to deplore the \nongoing, brutal Serbian repression of the people of Kosovo and to lay \nout principles for American policy to deal with the crisis.\n  Analysts have known for years that the Serbian province of Kosovo is \na potential tinderbox for the entire southern Balkans. Approximately \nninety percent of Kosovo's population is ethnic Albanian, known as \nKosovars. Because of emigration to--not from--to other parts of Serbia \nand because of a\n\n[[Page S6463]]\n\nlow birth rate, ethnic Serbs now constitutute only about 7 percent of \nthe province's population, down from a quarter of the population in the \nearly 1970's.\n  Kosovo is revered, as you know, Madam President, by Serbs as the \ncradle of their culture. Near the provincial capital Pristina lies \nKosovo Plain, the site of the epic battle of June 28, 1389 in which \nmedieval Serb knights and other Europeans were defeated by the Ottoman \nTurks, who remained in control of much of the Balkans into this \ncentury. Many of the holiest monasteries of the Serbian Orthodox Church \nlie within Kosovo's borders.\n  The ethnic Albanians also have long historical ties to Kosovo, \ntracing, in fact, their origins to the Illyrians who inhabited the area \nin ancient times. Senator Byrd often talks of this heritage when he \nrecites, as he does better than anyone, the history of Rome and its \nimpact on the region.\n  In 1974, Yugoslav President Tito made Kosovo, along with Vojvodina in \nthe north, an autonomous region within Serbia.\n  After Tito's death as the old Yugoslav Federation was beginning to \ndisintegrate, an ambitious, demagogic Serbian politician named Slobodan \nMilosevic used Serbian nationalism and resentment of the Kosovo \nAlbanians as a springboard to national power.\n  In 1989, Milosevic abrogated Kosovo's constitutional autonomy, \nconcurrently launching a purge of ethnic Albanians from the province's \ncivil service and curtailing government funding for public \ninstitutions, including the schools.\n  In response, the Kosovars, led by Dr. Ibrahim Rugova, a Sorbonne-\neducated intellectual, set up a shadow government and began a campaign \nof non-violent resistance to the Serbian oppression. The Kosovars set \nup and ran a system of public schools and maintained other public \nservices. Rugova advocated attaining independence for Kosovo through \nGandhian tactics. For most of this decade he was able to keep the lid \non popular resentment and prevent violence.\n  Rugova's position began to be undermined when the Kosovo Question was \nleft off the agenda at the Dayton Peace talks in November 1995. Younger \nKosovars increasingly began to ask why they should hold fast to \nnonviolence when the Bosnian Serbs were rewarded for their violence and \nbrutality with their own quasi-state within Bosnia.\n  In 1996 the beginnings of armed resistance to the Serbs appeared. A \nclandestine group calling itself the Kosova Liberation Army--KLA in \nEnglish acronym or UCK in the Albanian acronym--carried out isolated \nattacks on Serbian police.\n  By this past winter the frequency of KLA attacks increased, and \nMilosevic decided to respond. In late February his special police \nunits, backed up by the Yugoslav Army, stormed into the Drenica area, \nkilling and mutilating civilians who they said were harboring KLA \nmilitants.\n  Some of you will remember, some of the people listening will \nremember, that's the circumstance in which the Yugoslav authorities \nwould not allow the international community to examine the bodies. They \nrapidly buried them in mass graves and would not let outsiders come in \nand see what they had done.\n  But, Madam President, it is essential not to fall into the trap that \nsome have done by making false parallels to Milosevic's vicious \nmilitary repression.\n  These people, either for want of logic or perhaps as Serbian \napologists, assert that Milosevic's storm troopers were only doing what \nany state would do against rebels.\n  But, Madam President, if Milosevic had not robbed Kosovo of its legal \nautonomy, had not closed its schools and other institutions, and had \nnot summarily brutalized and fired thousands of Kosovars, the armed \nresistance never would have materialized.\n  Just yesterday in Moscow, Milosevic refused to deal with the KLA \nsaying, ``I see no reason to conduct negotiations with terrorists.'' I \nwill return to these prospects for negotiations in a minute, but let me \njust respond to Milosevic's comment by saying that acting just as he \ndid in Croatia and Bosnia, as he is acting in Kosovo, I ask the \nrhetorical question: Who is the terrorist? Milosevic is a terrorist and \na war criminal. He has demonstrated that over the past 5 to 6 years in \nBosnia, and he is revealing it again in Kosovo.\n  Since the February and early March massacres by his troops, Milosevic \nhas diddled the Western world, utilizing his classic ``bait-and-\nswitch'' tactics.\n  First, he agreed to negotiate with Dr. Rugova and, thereby, earned \nfrom the United States an ill-advised postponement of a ban on foreign \ninvestments in Serbia.\n  While talking, but not seriously negotiating with Rugova, Milosevic \nwas busy setting in motion the next step in his state of terrorism. \nLate last month, his notorious special police sealed off western Kosovo \nand began a murderous campaign of ethnic cleansing, driving some 65,000 \nrefugees into neighboring Albania and others into Montenegro. After \nkilling hundreds and burning entire towns to the ground, Milosevic's \nforces have reportedly even resorted to strafing fleeing refugees from \nYugoslav helicopters.\n  One would hope that the West has learned something from its pathetic \ntemporizing in Bosnia earlier in this decade. Perhaps we have, but \nmaybe we have not. The so-called Contact Group, made up of the United \nStates, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Italy, and Russia, has met \nregularly to try to hammer out a unified policy on Kosovo before it \nspins out of control. In spite of the fact that it operates by \nconsensus, which means the ``lowest common denominator,'' the Contact \nGroup has agreed upon economic sanctions which, given time, will worsen \nthe already catastrophic conditions of the Serbian economy.\n  But, Madam President, time is of the essence. Not only are thousands \nof innocent civilians--most of them Kosovars, but also some ethnic \nSerbs--being killed or driven from their homes, but the continuing \nfighting threatens the stability of neighboring Albania and also of the \nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which itself has restive ethnic \nAlbanians who constitute between one-quarter and one-third of its \npopulation.\n  Maintaining the integrity of Macedonia--a fragile democracy with a \nSlavic leadership genuinely committed to interethnic reconciliation--\nmust be the cornerstone of U.S. policy. Above all, however, is the \nstark obvious fact that everyone should have learned from Bosnia, and \nthat is, Slobodan Milosevic will only react to superior force being \nemployed against him. He will not react otherwise.\n  Lest anyone forget, while economic sanctions against Yugoslavia may \nhave modified Milosevic's position in Bosnia, it was only the use of \nAmerican airpower for 3 weeks in the fall of 1995 that brought \nMilosevic and his Bosnian Serb puppets to the bargaining table in \nDayton. So now, Madam President, we, once again, are faced with an \nunpalatable fact that force may have to be employed in order to prevent \nthe need for even greater force later. But there is no decision more \ndifficult than considering whether to send American troops into action.\n  I have been a Senator for 25 years. I started here when the Vietnam \nwar was still underway, and I am here today. I find the single most \nintimidating decision that need be made by any of us is when we vote, \nas we have in the past, to put American forces in harm's way, and \nKosovo is no exception.\n  Let me outline some of the basic principles that have to be part of \nthat decision, outline whether or not that the decision, although \ndifficult, will have to be made.\n  First, I believe that, except for those who prefer to withdraw to a \n``Fortress America'' posture, no one doubts the strategic importance of \nthe south Balkans to the United States.\n  Second, before we embark upon any military or political action, we \nmust have our goals firmly established.\n\n  Third, I also believe that most of my colleagues will agree that NATO \nremains the cornerstone of American policy in Europe and should be the \nvehicle by which we act in Kosovo.\n  Fourth, it goes without saying that a primary concern in any military \nplanning is to minimize the risk of American lives while ensuring the \nsuccess of the mission.\n  With these principles in mind, let me examine our options in the \nKosovo crisis now.\n  The United States has declared itself against independence for \nKosovo,\n\n[[Page S6464]]\n\nthereby putting itself at odds with the Kosovar leadership and people, \nthe very ones who are currently being brutalized.\n  Madam President, I agree with the position our nation is taking. \nWhatever one may think of a broader decision made at the beginning of \nthe 20th century as the Turks were pushed out of most of the Balkans, \nthe ethnographic mix of the area simply precludes homogenous states, \nexcept through ethnic cleansing, which we must oppose. To put it \nbluntly, I would use force to stop massacres of innocent civilians. I \nwould use force to prevent cross-border invasions. I would use \npeacekeepers backed up by force to guarantee the rights of minorities. \nBut I would not risk American lives in a cause of a ``greater Albania'' \nwhich would probably destroy the Macedonian state and set off a chain \nreaction of incalculable proportions in the south Balkans.\n  On the other hand, I cannot imagine asking the Kosovars to accept a \nreturn to the pre-1989 autonomy with Serbia. If Milosevic could \nsummarily revoke the autonomy one time, he can do it again.\n  Therefore, my own preference as a political goal would be giving \nKosovo full republic status within the Yugoslav federation, on an equal \nfooting with Serbia and Montenegro. Perhaps we would also have to have \nrepublic status for other parts of Serbia.\n  I recognize there are problems with such a solution. Milosevic will \nbe dead set against it, since a Kosovo Republic would ipso facto \nconsign Serbia to a minority role in the upper house of the Yugoslav \nParliament and probably mean the end of Milosevic's quasi-dictatorial \nrule.\n  My response is that we and the Kosovars and the democratic leadership \nof Montenegro and the remaining democrats in Serbia should look at the \nprobable outcome as an opportunity, not a problem.\n  Both Dr. Rugova and the KLA have insisted upon independence for \nKosovo, but if they keep in mind the scenario I just outlined, they \nmight, in the course of negotiations, agree to a ``third republic'' or \n``fourth republic'' compromise.\n  But how about Milosevic? It is clear to me that only one principle \ncontinues to guide his policy, and that is clinging to power. In fact, \nsince he took power in Serbia, Milosevic has been a dismal failure at \neverything, except staying in power.\n  His wars of aggression in pursuit of a goal of a ``greater Serbia'' \nhave resulted in the extinguishing of hundreds of years of Serbian \nculture in the Krajina and in Slavonia, and hundreds of thousands of \nSerbian refugees, and in the impoverishment of most Bosnian Serbs, and \nall this at a cost of over 300,000 persons killed.\n  Meanwhile, under Milosevic's stewardship Serbia itself has plummeted \nfrom having been one of the wealthiest countries of Central and Eastern \nEurope to a near basket-case.\n  But Milosevic clings to power. And it is, I regret to have to repeat, \nonly the use of countervailing policy and force, power, that will \nremove Milosevic.\n  And this is the central point. While there is no panacea for the \nBalkan ills, the necessary precondition for restoration of peace is a \ndemocratic government in Belgrade that is prepared to coexist with the \nnon-Serb peoples of the area.\n  In order to move events in that direction the Clinton administration \nhas wisely supported the democratic reformist regime in Montenegro--of \nwhich Milo Djukanovic is the president--which is already posing a \nserious challenge to Milosevic within the Yugoslav parliament.\n  We must now apply all necessary pressure on Milosevic in Kosovo.\n  The Contact Group has issued four demands: a cessation of fighting; \nthe unconditional withdrawal of Serbian special police forces and \nYugoslav Army forces from Kosovo; a return of refugees; and unlimited \naccess for international monitors.\n  Milosevic's statement on Tuesday in Moscow after his talks with \nRussian President Yeltsin did not go far enough. He refused to withdraw \nhis troops or to talk with the KLA--two conditions the Contact Group is \nasking for.\n  Milosevic's usual half-way tactics must not dilute the West's resolve \nto force him to meet all the demands.\n  NATO has already tasked its military experts to come up with military \noptions for moving against the Serbs and Milosevic.\n  Reportedly, nine preliminary options have been submitted. They range \nfrom stationing troops along Kosovo's borders, to imposing a new ``no-\nfly zone'' and a ``weapons-exclusion zone'' over part of Yugoslavia, to \nair strikes, and even ground invasions.\n  In this planning, the possible political ramifications of any \nmilitary action are, I am sure, being factored in by this \nadministration.\n  In the immediate future, though, the NATO military planners will \nflesh out the details of these options. So, I think it would be \nimprudent for me or for any other Senator to second-guess the NATO \nmilitary planners who have the relevant expertise and are in possession \nof the vital intelligence data needed to make a judgment.\n  What I can say is that the use of force must remain on the table, and \nthat, if at all possible, it must be exercised through NATO.\n  Within NATO, however, there exists a serious problem. It does not \nrevolve so much around whether or not to use force; for most of our \nEuropean allies seem to have learned from our Bosnian experience that \nthe use of force in Kosovo may well be necessary.\n  The dispute is rather over the question of whether approval by the \nU.N. Security Council is necessary before NATO acts outside the \nterritory of its members. The United States has always maintained that \nit is not. As recently as our expansion vote on NATO we insisted that \nthat is not a neessary precondition. A U.N. Security Council mandate is \nnot a necessary precondition to use NATO forces.\n  This is a position reinforced, as I said, by the U.S. Senate in the \nResolution of Ratification of NATO enlargement overwhelmingly passed on \nApril 30 of this year.\n  Most--perhaps all--of our European NATO allies, including the \nBritish, assert that U.N. approval is necessary.\n  Madam President, this difference of opinion strikes at the heart of \nthe Alliance, for if the European allies' position wins out, the \nRussians--and even the Chinese--will have a veto power over NATO action \nin Central and Eastern Europe. This is precisely where Bosnia and \nKosovo-like ethnic conflicts are likely to pose the biggest threats to \nregional security in the coming decades. As much as I support the U.N., \nI, for one, am not about to yield to the Security Council, the \nRussians, and the Chinese the decision of whether or not we are able to \nprotect the interests of Europe--requiring their approval ahead of \ntime.\n  We must make clear to our European allies, and to the Russians, that \nwhile we prefer to act within NATO, we see Kosovo as a vital national \nsecurity interest of the United States and, hence, are prepared to act \nalone if necessary.\n  This is an unpleasant exercise, but it is preferable to face it now, \nrather than to postpone the issue. In fact, it would be good to resolve \nthis intra-alliance dispute in the newest revision of NATO's Strategic \nConcept, which is now being discussed.\n  Finally, Madam President, I believe it is absolutely essential for \nthe United States immediately to make contact with the Kosovo \nLiberation Army.\n  A withdrawal of Serbian special forces and Yugoslav Army troops, or a \nNATO bombing campaign, must not be done unless the KLA first agrees to \na ceasefire. For I must repeat--the object of U.S. policy is not only \nto stop the movement toward a greater Serbia on the part of Mr. \nMilosevic, but it is also not to become a tool for a greater Albania in \nthe South Balkans. It is to halt the fighting and then to start serious \nnegotiations involving all the parties. I have already made clear my \npreferred political solution, but the outcome is for the parties to \nthrash out.\n  We are approaching the moment of truth in Kosovo. As usual, the \nindispensible element in solving the crisis is the active involvement \nof the United States, just as it was in Bosnia.\n  As the U.S. Government continues its negotiations with its allies and \nits Contact Group partners, and as NATO military planners continue to \nrefine possible military options, I urge my colleagues to recognize the \ngravity of the situation and to make clear their support for resolute \nAmerican leadership.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S6465]]\n\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I hear all kinds of rumblings that the \nRepublican side of the aisle, at some time today, is going to try to \nkill or will effectively kill the tobacco bill. I want to take a few \nminutes to talk about that and try to recap, if I can, why we are here \nand why we have spent so much time on the tobacco bill.\n  Three thousand kids every day take up smoking; 1,000 of them will die \nprematurely. Teenage use of tobacco products is at a 17-year high. And \n42.7 percent of high school kids are now using some form of tobacco \nproducts. Ninety-one percent of 3-year-olds in this country recognize \nJoe Camel, and recognize him in a friendly manner. And thanks to the \ncourt cases that we have had in several States, we now have the \nindustry documents that reveal years and years and years of lying and \ndeception by the tobacco companies.\n  That is why we are here. That is why we have a tobacco bill--to put \nan end to teen smoking, to put an end to the lies and deceptions of the \ntobacco companies, to save kids' lives.\n  The Republican leader was on the floor here a week and a half or so \nago. I happened to be on the floor at the same time. And Senator Lott \nof Mississippi, why, he said, we have to remember what the end game is. \nWell, I got to the floor shortly after, and I said, yes, we do have to \nremember what the end game is. The end game is to put an end to what I \njust talked about and to reduce teen smoking. That is the end game. \nThat is why we are here--to cut down on teen smoking.\n  But Senators on the other side of the aisle here today, and in the \npast 4 weeks, have had another agenda. They have had tax cuts, drug \nmoney, and limits on attorneys' fees, et cetera, et cetera, and on and \non.\n  Let us look at the Record. On Friday, June 5, the majority leader, \nSenator Lott, said, and I quote, ``If we don't add something on \nmarriage penalty, tax relief, and on drugs, there won't be a bill. \nThere will not be a bill.'' In other words, the majority leader is \nsaying, if we do not load a lot of stuff onto this bill--marriage \npenalty, tax relief, drugs--there will not be a bill. That is what he \nsaid on June 5.\n  On June 7, on one of the talk shows, CNN's Sunday Night ``Late \nEdition'' interview with Wolf Blitzer, here is Senator Lott again, 2 \ndays afterward:\n\n       Instead of focusing on trying to get something constructive \n     done, what we have now is game playing and rhetoric. What we \n     need is leadership.\n\n  Mr. Blitzer said, ``When will there be a vote''--talking about the \nMcCain bill.\n  Senator Lott, 2 days before on June 5--Senator Lott had said, ``. . . \nthere won't be a bill until we add the marriage penalty, tax relief and \ndrugs.''\n  Now, two days later, Mr. Lott says:\n\n       Well, at this point, it is dead in the water and there may \n     never be a vote on the McCain bill. The problem is greed has \n     set in. It is the usual addiction in Washington to taxes and \n     spend. This has gone way beyond trying to do something about \n     teenage smoking. This is now about money grubbing. This is \n     about taxing people and spending on a myriad of programs. . \n     ..We have lost our focus.\n\n  What kind of brave new world are we living in around here? On June 5, \nthe majority leader says there won't be a bill unless we load it up. \nTwo days later, he says we have loaded the bill up, we can't have a \nbill because we have lost our focus, because it ought to be about teen \nsmoking.\n  Game playing. You want game playing? That is where the game playing \nis coming from. It is coming from the leadership in the Senate. That is \nwhere the game playing is coming from.\n  I will say it loud and clear right here. The leadership has never \nwanted this bill, and they want to kill it. What we want--and I don't \njust mean Democrats, I mean a lot of Republicans, too, we want to put \nan end to teen smoking, and we want this bill. But, unfortunately, the \nRepublican leadership and some on that side are going to try to make \ngood on their threats to kill the bill.\n  I understand the Senator from Texas, Senator Gramm, was on the floor \na few minutes ago sort of crowing about killing the bill. Well, I hope \nthose reports are wrong. I hope we have the bipartisan support to pass \nthe bill.\n  But it seems to me at this point in time the choice is very clear: \nYou are either for tobacco company profits or you are for our kids. You \nare either for cutting down on the lies and deceptions of the tobacco \ncompanies, or you are for saving our kids' lives and keeping them from \nsmoking. That is what it has come down to. Don't let anybody kid you.\n  Now I heard the Senator from Kentucky, Senator McConnell, a while \nago--I happened to be listening--talking about all the taxes, all the \ntaxes the people are going to have to spend if we raise the price of \ncigarettes. I got to thinking about that. Guess what. Not one person in \nthis country has to pay those taxes. What an interesting set of taxes--\ntaxes you don't have to pay. If you don't smoke, you don't pay the \ntaxes--simple as that. It doesn't tax everybody. You have the freedom \nto choose. If you want to pay the taxes, smoke; if you don't want to \npay the taxes, don't smoke. Yet to listen to the other side talk about \nit, why, you would think that everyone in this country was going to \nhave to pay taxes. Absolutely not true. Only if you want to smoke. Then \nyou ought to be more than happy to help pay for those who get sick and \nto help do something about keeping teenagers from smoking.\n  I don't think I yet have met one adult who has smoked a long time--\n10, 15, 20 years--I haven't met one yet who has said, ``I would \nrecommend a young person take up smoking.'' I haven't met one yet. \nEvery single one of them says, ``Don't do what I did. Don't get in the \nhabit. Don't become an addict like I am.''\n  That is what this bill is about--keeping kids from becoming addicts, \naddicts every bit as bad as if they took up cocaine or heroin--nicotine \naddiction. And it is the gateway drug to the others. You want to cut \ndown on marijuana? Cut down on teen smoking of cigarettes. You want to \ncut down on teen use of smoking crack? Cut down on their smoking \ncigarettes first. You want to cut down on kids who get into the drug \nculture? Go after cigarettes first. It is a gateway drug. It is a drug, \nmake no mistake about it, and a highly addictive drug. And it just so \nhappens to be legal.\n\n  But we know from industry documents today that they have known for \nyears that nicotine is addictive. They have known for years that it is \ncarcinogenic. They have known for years about the medical costs of \naddiction to tobacco. Yet through all their advertising, they have lied \nabout it. All this fancy advertising of Joe Camel and that rugged \nMarlboro Man on that horse and all these young people--do you ever see \na tobacco ad that has a lot of old people hacking and smoking and \nspitting in it? No. All the tobacco ads have nice young people, and \nthey are healthy, and they are vibrant. They look like they are having \na great time, and if it weren't for tobacco, they probably wouldn't be \nhaving a great time. That is the kind of deception used by the tobacco \ncompanies. That is what we are trying to put an end to.\n  Taxes? No one has to pay these taxes. I see the Senator from Kentucky \nis on the floor. No one has to pay these taxes, not one single person, \nif they choose not to smoke. But if they do, then, yes, we want you to \npay more for cigarettes, because we want to use that money to stop kids \nfrom smoking, which is what you want, too.\n  Every adult I have known who is addicted to nicotine says kids \nshouldn't take it up. But these tobacco companies will continue to hook \nkids because they know that is their replacement smoker. They know that \n90 percent of adult smokers who are hooked on nicotine start smoking \nbefore the age of 18. If they don't start smoking by that time, chances \nare they will never take it up and become addicted. That is why we are \nhere. That is the end game--to keep our kids from smoking.\n  Killing this bill is a death sentence for millions of kids. Killing \nthis bill would be a historic cave-in to the special interests of this \ncountry. It would be a historic cave-in to the $40 million in deceptive \nads that the tobacco companies have put out across this land over the \nlast month. It would be a historic cave-in to an industry that has \ndeceived and lied to the American people for the last half century.\n\n[[Page S6466]]\n\n  Make no mistake about it, tobacco executives and all of their PAC \ndirectors who have all of that money to start giving out to campaigns, \nthey are watching. They are watching, and they are rubbing their hands \ntogether, and they are saying, ``Oh, boy, they are going to kill that \ntobacco bill.'' And they are going to know who their friends are. They \nare going to know who their friends are--the ones who killed this bill. \nAnd I am sure they will be helpful to their friends.\n  Well, I hope we can send a message to our kids that these well-funded \nspecial interests, no matter what they have done and how much money \nthey have spent, that they can't win today, that they can't win in this \nbody, that this body still represents the rank and file of American \npeople and not just those with a lot of money and a lot of power.\n  If the Republican leadership and those on that side kill this bill \ntoday, we will be back, time and time and time again. We will be back. \nWe will be back with amendment after amendment after amendment on bills \nthat come up to this floor. We will not back down. We have come too far \nto rein in the tobacco companies, we have come too far to stop our kids \nfrom smoking, to back off now.\n  If the Republican leadership and the Republicans succeed in killing \nthis bill today, it might be the end of the debate on the tobacco bill, \nbut it will not be the end of tobacco debate on the Senate floor and it \nwill not be the end of amendments and bills that we will bring up to \ntry to get to the end game to keep our teenagers from smoking.\n  If the Republican leadership succeeds in killing this bill, I predict \nthat there will be a major public backlash--a major public backlash. \nWhy do I say that? A little bit of history.\n  Last year, about this time--actually toward the end of July--Senator \nChafee, a Republican, and I, a Democrat, offered an amendment on the \nfloor of the Senate to provide the necessary money to the FDA to \nenforce the ID checks in stores and outlets, wherever cigarettes were \nsold across the country. We offered the amendment and we had a vote. We \nlost. That was in July. Well, I used a parliamentary maneuver to ensure \nthat we could have one more vote on it when we came back after the \nAugust recess of last year. So I filed my parliamentary appeal on that. \nWe broke here in August and we went home.\n  We came back in September, and the first vote we had when we came \nback in September was the same vote of Senator Chafee and Senator \nHarkin on providing the money to the FDA for the ID checks--the same \nvote that had lost in July. Guess what. This time it carried \noverwhelmingly. I submit that a large part of that was because a lot of \npeople went home in August and a lot of the groups--I am talking about \nall of the public health groups, such as the American Heart \nAssociation, The Lung Association, the American Cancer Society, and a \nhost of others--got to people and said, wait a minute, we want to \nenforce these ID checks. We don't want young people buying cigarettes \nand tobacco products. There was a public backlash. I predict the same \nthing will happen if this bill is killed today.\n  Despite over $40 million in ads that have dominated the airwaves over \nthe last month by the tobacco companies--despite all that--the public \nstill supports this bill by over 2 to 1. This was a survey taken June \n12 through June 15 by Market Facts TeleNation, an independent polling \nfirm, of 924 adults. Margin of error, plus or minus, is 3.2 percent.\n  The question was:\n\n       As you may know, the Congress is currently considering the \n     McCain tobacco bill, which creates a national tobacco policy \n     to reduce tobacco use among kids. Based on what you know \n     about the bill, do you favor or oppose Congress passing the \n     McCain bill?\n\n  Those who favored, 62 percent; opposed, 31 percent.\n  That was June 12 to June 15. This is the 17th, so that was earlier \nthis week. That is after $40 million was spent by the tobacco companies \nto persuade the public that what we are doing is raising these huge \ntaxes and spending all of their money on a variety of nonsense \nprograms. I am sure we have all seen the ads. How can you miss them? \nTurn on the TV and there is another ad. And still, through it all, the \nAmerican people are seeing through it. They have caught on to the \ntobacco companies. They know they have been lying to them for 50 years. \nAsk any older adult today--I am talking about somebody in their \nsixties, seventies, or eighties--who has been addicted to nicotine. Ask \nthem if they believe the tobacco companies told them the truth 30 or 40 \nyears ago when they took up tobacco. They know the tobacco companies \nlied to them through their slick advertising, ads that show doctors \nsmoking and nurses smoking, and all kinds of things, saying that Camels \nwere better for your throat than other cigarettes. Still, the American \npeople, 2 to 1, want this bill.\n  That is why I predict that if this bill is killed, there is going to \nbe a tremendous public backlash. The public is going to know who killed \nthis bill: the Republican leadership in the U.S. Senate. Make no \nmistake about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, the Senate is engaged in an historic debate \nover tobacco control legislation. This bill is the most important \npublic health issue of the decade. Yet, it appears that we are losing \nsight of the foremost purpose of the bill. If this bill was a Christmas \ntree, its branches would be drooping to the floor because of the weight \nof the unrelated amendments. These extraneous amendments were added at \nthe insistence of the majority to broaden the appeal of the \nlegislation. Yet, critics of the bill cite these amendments as reasons \nto topple the tree.\n  First, a majority of Senators voted to strip the liability provisions \nfrom the tobacco bill. With this vote, we lost a powerful incentive for \nthe tobacco companies to accept provisions of the bill that require \ntheir consent. Industry cooperation is critically important to a \ncomprehensive national tobacco policy, and to obtain voluntary \nacceptance of the sweeping advertising restrictions.\n  As my colleagues know, advertising is one of the most important \nfactors in attracting young people to tobacco products, and \nrestrictions on advertising must be a central component of the efforts \nto reduce youth tobacco consumption. Industry acceptance will also be \nessential to the lock-back provisions that will penalize companies that \nfail to meet youth tobacco reduction targets.\n  The majority then passed an amendment to divert $2 billion from \npublic health initiatives into programs having nothing to do with \ntobacco. This amendment takes money allocated to public health and puts \nit into drug interdiction, the Coast Guard, education vouchers, and a \nmultitude of other items. We have abandoned the fundamental objective \nof this public health legislation.\n  The Senate then approved an amendment providing a massive tax cut to \nreduce the marriage penalty and increase the deductibility of health \ninsurance for the self-employed. These provisions not only strip huge \nsums from the bill, but also take funds from the general treasury in \nfuture years. As a result, the majority of my colleagues voted to \nweaken the Social Security system for future generations. Money that \nwould have been used to reduce the incidence of youth smoking will \ninstead be used to finance a tax cut. Make no mistake about it, this \naction severely hampers the effectiveness of the programs designed to \nreduce tobacco use. The money stripped from the bill would have paid \nfor core public health initiatives such as health research, counter \nadvertising, and smoking cessation and education programs.\n  We are losing sight of the grim statistics on youth tobacco \nconsumption that have been repeated here on a daily basis. Every day, \n3,000 kids become smokers. One third will die to tobacco related \ndiseases. We have an obligation to act.\n  Despite my strong objections to these changes, we must pass a measure \nout of the Senate and allow the process to continue. The bill retains \nprovisions that address the problems of youth tobacco consumption. For \nexample, the tobacco price increase in the bill should dramatically \nreduce the number of kids who begin smoking and who may ultimately die \nfrom smoking related diseases. Statistics show that for every ten cents \nadded to the price of cigarettes, approximately 700,000 fewer teens \nwill being smoking and more than 200,000 premature deaths will be \navoided. The bill also provides for a national counter-advertising \ncampaign\n\n[[Page S6467]]\n\naimed at discouraging young people from using tobacco products. It also \nfunds health research at the National Institutes of Health and the \nCenters for Disease Control and state and local tobacco education and \nprevention programs.\n  Two other components of the bill that will have a large impact on our \nefforts were added during floor consideration. The first is the \nincreased investment of funds into early childhood development and \nafter-school activities. The second is the strengthening of the look-\nback provisions which hold individual tobacco companies responsible for \ntheir portion of the youth market.\n  Mr. President, the Senate still has a landmark opportunity to save \nthe lives of future generations. If this effort is defeated it will \nshow that the majority bowed to the tobacco industry and sold out the \nyouth of America.\n\n\n                           tobacco warehouse\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I would like to engage in a colloquy \nwith the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee regarding the role of \nwarehouseman in the tobacco debate. There are 356 tobacco quota \nwarehouses in eleven states. For over 60 years tobacco auction \nwarehouses have played a role in the federal government's tobacco \nprogram. By law, warehousemen collect specified fees, supervise \ninspections, keep records and otherwise act on behalf of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture.\n  In 1935, the Tobacco Inspection Act was passed under the jurisdiction \nof the Agriculture Committee to designate approved auction warehouses \nand to protect growers by providing standards of classification and \ninspection of tobacco. In fact, from the onset of North America's \ntobacco commerce in 1619 successive governments have used tobacco \nwarehouses as the primary channel for regulating the leaf tobacco \ntrade. According to Professor Allan C. Fisher, Jr., between 1619 and \n1731, various colonial governments in North America passed a total of \neight legislative acts pertaining to tobacco warehouses. In effect, \nthese laws made tobacco warehouses the agents of government for \nensuring that the inspection and sale of leaf tobacco remained fair to \ngrowers.\n  Even now, by law, warehousemen collect specified fees, supervise \ninspections, keep records and otherwise act on behalf of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. The Supreme Court, in a 1939 case upholding \nthe inspection law, state that warehousemen and auctioneers act as \nagents for growers and the government.\n  In summary, tobacco warehouses were established by and are regulated \nby the federal government. Therefore, assistance to warehousemen is a \nnecessary component of any legislative action that effects federal \ntobacco policy.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I acknowledge the importance of warehousemen under the \ncurrent tobacco program and that some of those warehousemen may be \nadversely affected when the current program is eliminated. That is why \nI have made it clear in my amendment that warehousemen may be \nconsidered as recipients of some of the $1 billion in economic \nassistance grants to states. I believe that it will be important for \nstate and local governments to determine the level of assistance to \nindividual warehousemen in their localities. Local officials will be \nbetter able to assess the economic impact on individual warehousemen \nand can make adequate compensation accordingly.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I appreciate the Chairman's recognition of the \nimportance of warehousemen and his efforts to include them in this \namendment. The Senator is correct. Tobacco warehouses have no other \nbusiness than operating as agents for the growers and the government. \nThey are as integrally tied to the tobacco program as are farmers and \nquota holders.\n  For these reasons I believe that comprehensive tobacco legislation \nmust provide compensation for tobacco warehousemen--and that such \ncompensation should be specific, certain and equitable.\n  By the term ``specific,'' I mean that the legislation should denote \nwarehousemen as individuals who shall rightfully receive a measure of \ncompensation, just as it provides for a measure of compensation for \ngrowers and quota holders.\n  By the term ``certain,'' I mean that the legislation should provide \nfor a procedure to ensure that such compensation is a definite Federal \nresponsibility calculated by Federal authority according to factors \nthat Congress establishes in the statute.\n  By the term ``equitable,'' I mean that the compensation should be \nbased upon an appreciation for a warehouseman's equity investment in \nhis business and that the formula for determining the appropriate \ncompensation should be related to the volumes of tobacco that each \nwarehouse has historically handled.\n  It is essential that three elements are thoroughly addressed. It is \nmy judgment that the managers' amendment in its current form falls \nshort in meeting these criteria.\n  My question to the distinguished Chairman is this: will you work with \nme and other Senators, as the legislative progress continues, to ensure \nthat warehousemen are not left out of my comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation?\n  Mr. LUGAR. Indeed, it is always a pleasure to work with the Senator \nfrom North Carolina, I will do what I can to ensure that warehousemen \nwho are adversely affected by comprehensive tobacco legislation are not \nforgotten as the tobacco legislation proceeds through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the tobacco bill that is currently before the Senate.\n  As you know, on June 20, 1997, a group of state attorneys general, \nplaintiffs' lawyers, public health advocates, and representatives of \nthe major cigarette manufacturers announced a sweeping settlement that \nwould restructure the tobacco industry and revolutionize the nation's \ntobacco control efforts. The agreement, reached in good faith among the \nparties, would settle lawsuits brought by forty states seeking to \nrecoup Medicaid spending for smoking-related illnesses and ban certain \nclass-action lawsuits against the tobacco industry.\n  The only reason that the Senate is even considering the current bill \nis because the proposed settlement required the approval of Congress \nand the President before taking effect. This measure differs \nsignificantly, however, from the terms of the original settlement. \nAlthough the bill makes some progress toward the important goal of \neliminating youth smoking, it has also become a vehicle for regressive \nhigher taxes and a creation of more federal government. In fact, the \nattorneys general who negotiated the original settlement are opposed to \nthis bill in its current form.\n  Mr. President, S. 1415 contains over $500 billion in new taxes. By \nsome estimates, as much as $800 billion in new taxes could be imposed \non the American people as a result of this bill. But even more alarming \nthan the sheer size of this tax increase is the fact that two-thirds of \nthe tax burden would fall on Americans earning less than $35,000 per \nyear.\n  Indirectly, the bill ``deputizes'' tobacco firms as tax collectors.\n  In view of our country's current economic prosperity and budgetary \nsurpluses, I believe that the American people are entitled to forms of \ntax relief, not increases in taxes.\n  The total result of the bill's proposed tax could, in my view, be \ndisastrous. It would primarily burden lower-income Americans. It could \ncreate a new black market for cigarettes similar to the underground \nmarket that currently exists for illegal drugs. Canada has experienced \nthis terrible problem as a result of its high taxes on cigarettes. \nFurther, it could tempt children to obtain cigarettes illegally or to \nillegally or improperly obtain the funds to purchase cigarettes. There \nis simply no justification for imposing over half a trillion dollars in \nnew regressive taxes on the American people.\n  Traditionally, families and the states have been responsible for \ndealing with the legitimate and important objective of deterring youth \nsmoking. Indeed, every state in the country has enacted laws making \nyouth smoking and selling tobacco products to minors illegal. I believe \nthat these laws should be vigorously enforced, both against adults who \nsell tobacco products to minors and against children who illegally \nattempt to purchase these products. Congress should not intrude on a \nresponsibility that is properly and legitimately under the purview of \nthe citizens of a state and their state governments.\n\n[[Page S6468]]\n\n  Many small family firms, indeed many businesses and communities \nthroughout Virginia, depend on the cultivation, sale, and taxation of \ntobacco. They do so legally. In addition, Virginia's ports depend \nheavily on the shipment of tobacco and related products. The industry \ndirectly employs over 12,800 Virginians and supports over 150,000 \nadditional jobs indirectly, generating more than $2.2 billion in \npayroll taxes annually. The bill before us would have unfair \nconsequences on all of these thousands of honest, hard-working \nVirginians.\n  I would remind my colleagues, however, that one need not represent a \ntobacco-producing state to represent a large number of constituents who \nwould be adversely effected by this legislation. Indeed, thousands of \nAmericans across the country work in other industries that interact \nwith the tobacco industry, such as convenience stores, shippers, \npackers, suppliers of agricultural products and equipment and vendors. \nEach of these industries, and many others, are likely to suffer \ntremendously if this bill is enacted. Most of these enterprises, \nparticularly convenience stores, are small businesses and are \nstruggling every day for survival.\n  I would further remind my colleagues that one need not represent a \ntobacco-producing state to stand for the principles of smaller \ngovernment, lower taxes, and personal responsibility.\n  Last Thursday, Virginia Governor Jim Gilmore convened the Tobacco \nWorkers' Unity Summit. As a governor who is respected nationwide for \nvigorously enforcing Virginia's laws against the sale of tobacco to \nchildren while passing the largest tax cut in Virginia history, I \nconsider Governor Gilmore's to be an important voice in this debate. In \nhis opening remarks at the Unity Summit, Governor Gilmore said, ``We \nwill not be successful in combating youth smoking if we leave the \nmatter to the tax commissioner rather than the law enforcement \nofficer.'' I agree.\n  The them of the Unity Summit was ``Protecting Our Children . . . \nProtecting Our Jobs.''

Mr. President, these are the people who have been left \nout of the debate in the Senate--the people who stand to lose their \nlivelihoods if this bill is passed.\n  The participants of the Unity Summit were universally opposed to the \nbill that is currently before us, and they all signed the following \nTobacco Workers' Unity Pledge:\n\n       We the undersigned urge President Clinton and the U.S. \n     Congress not to forget the hardworking men and women whose \n     livelihoods are linked to tobacco.\n       These men and women include truckers and longshoremen, \n     paper and steelworkers, machinists and growers, convenience \n     store clerks and warehouse workers.\n       These working Americans labor long and hard hours to pay \n     their taxes and put food on the table for their families.\n       These working families should not be forgotten by those who \n     hold power in Washington.\n       We urge policy makers in Washington to find ways to protect \n     children from access to tobacco products that will not result \n     in thousands of working men and women losing their jobs.\n       We urge the Administration and Congress to remember that \n     protecting our children is a vital law enforcement issue, not \n     an excuse to raise taxes.\n       We also urge the President and the Congress to remember \n     that you will not protect our children by putting their \n     parents out of work.\n\n  The bill before us will create far more problems for the American \npeople than it could ever hope to solve. The bill has lost sight of the \nimportant objective of stopping children from smoking and has fallen \nprey to a multi-billion dollar money grab. The bill has blinded us to \nthe American tradition of insisting on personal responsibility from \nadults and protecting our citizens from government intrusion into their \npersonal lives.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nshare my thoughts concerning S. 1415, the National Tobacco Policy and \nYouth Smoking Reduction Act.\n  The fundamental goal of this bill was supposed to be to drastically \nreduce the number of children who become addicted to cigarettes. \nHowever, sometime during the last three weeks of debate on this bill \nthe Senate seems to have lost its focus on that objective.\n  We have debated three different amendments regarding lawyers fees--as \nif the states are incompetent to enter into legal contracts--and \nadopted one\n\n[[Page S6469]]\n\nof them. We have spent the better part of a week on the marriage \npenalty and health insurance deductibility for the self-employed. Now, \nI happen to believe that those two issues are very important, and need \nto be addressed. But this bill is not the proper vehicle for addressing \nthem. This bill is supposed to be about reducing smoking--particularly \nteen smoking.\n  I still view this bill as the best means of focusing on the main \ngoal. For all of its faults, the bill still gives the FDA the power to \ninsure: that no human, animal, or cartoon image is used to advertise \ntobacco products; that tobacco companies do not advertise in color on \nthe backs of magazines; that cigarettes are not advertised on bill \nboards or other outdoor signs; that tobacco products are not displayed \nin close proximity to products--like candy--that would be attractive to \nchildren; that cigarettes are not advertised on the Internet; and that \npayments are not made to celebrities to smoke in movies or on \ntelevision.\n  And this bill sets targets for reducing smoking by our young people \nand penalizes tobacco companies if they fail to meet those targets. \nThis is only fair because tobacco companies have targeted our children. \nAware that nearly 89 percent of all smokers begin smoking by age 18 and \neager to maintain its market, the industry specifically targeted \nchildren in the hopes of creating life-long addicts.\n  Its efforts have paid off handsomely. Today, more than 3 million \nAmerican children and teenagers smoke cigarettes. Seventy-one percent \nof high school students have tried cigarette smoking and about one-\nthird of high school students are current smokers. Teen smoking has \nrisen for five years in a row. And if nothing is done, 5 million \nAmericans who are now children will die prematurely from tobacco-\nrelated diseases.\n  But tobacco products are responsible for enormous damage to all of \nour citizens, not just children. Smoking accounts for nearly one in \nfive deaths in the United States. It is related to over 419,000 U.S. \ndeaths each year--more than alcohol, car accidents, fires, suicides, \ndrugs, and AIDS combined. Approximately half of all continuing smokers \ndie prematurely from smoking. Of these, 50 percent die in middle age, \nlosing, on average, 20 to 25 years of life.\n  We now have proof that the tobacco companies knew precisely what the \nimpact of their products would be. According to their own internal \ndocuments, these companies hid the truth regarding both the dangers \nassociated with smoking and the addictiveness of their products. It is \ntherefore time for the tobacco industry to be held accountable for \nmarketing a product it knew to be unsafe. Fortunately, that is \nsomething that this bill accomplishes.\n  I remain concerned about the regressive nature of the $1.10 per \ncigarette tax that this bill will levy and I believe that it addresses \nissues that, while important, have nothing to do with tobacco \nlegislation and should be addressed separately. Despite the many \nproblems that the Senate has faced during the last three weeks, I think \nit is a real mistake to kill the tobacco reform legislation at this \ntime, and make no mistake about it, that is what is happening here \ntoday.\n  Mr. President, we must tackle the issue of teenage smoking and this \nlegislation may very well be our only opportunity to do so. I would not \nwant to see this bill become law in its current form, but there are \nstill ample opportunities to improve if we allow the legislative \nprocess to go forward. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues not to kill \nthis bill today; I urge them to think of our children and the children \nthat will follow them and to cast a vote to prevent another generation \nof young Americans from becoming addicted to tobacco.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote to kill \nthis bill. It is no more than a massive $577 billion tax increase on \nworking class Americans. Almost one trillion dollars in taxes and \npenalties to fund the largest expansion of government in years. Almost \none trillion dollars to throw tens of thousand of North Carolina \nfactory workers out of their jobs. Almost one trillion dollars to throw \ntens of thousands of farm families off their land.\n  Back in 1993, we denounced the Clinton tax increase, the largest tax \nincrease in world history. Today, some of us seem interested in passing \nthis tobacco tax bill, the second largest tax increase in world \nhistory.\n  I would like to compare the two bills.\n  The 1993 tax increase was for ``fighting deficits.'' The 1998 tax \nincrease is for ``fighting teen smoking.''\n  The 1993 tax increase totaled 240 billion dollars over the first 5 \nyears. The 1998 tax increase totals $103 billion over five years.\n  The 1993 tax increase paid for a massive increase in new spending. \nThe 1998 tax increase pays for a massive increase in new spending.\n  The 1993 tax increase was progressive. The 1998 tax increase is \nregressive.\n  The 1993 tax increase targeted ``those who succeeded in the decade of \ngreed.'' The 1998 tax increase targets smokers--mostly working class \nAmericans.\n  The 1993 tax increase was done in the name of ``the children.'' The \n1998 tax increase is in the name of ``the children.''\n  The 1993 tax increase enlarged the Washington bureaucracy. The 1998 \ntax increase enlarges the Washington bureaucracy.\n  The 1993 tax increase taxed the American people. The 1998 tax \nincrease taxes the American people, not the tobacco companies.\n  It literally requires the tobacco companies to pass on the entire tax \nincrease to the American people--mostly blue collar people. Those \nearning less than $40,000 per year will pay sixty-one percent of these \nnew taxes.\n  It will raise taxes on the one-pack-a-day smoker by $1015 per year. \nThat's a fifty percent federal tax increase on those earning less than \nten thousand dollars per year. Those earning more than $75,000 will pay \nless than one percent more from this tax increase.\n  We should all be deeply concerned about the ``tax and spend'' \napproach that the bill takes to resolving a social problem. The bill \nreaches right into the pockets of hard-working low- and middle-income \nadults who have every right to smoke if they choose. And, it takes \ntheir hard-earned dollars to create yet more federal programs and to \npay trial lawyers billions of dollars. At least the Senate saw the \nlight on my efforts to cap these fees.\n  We're literally grabbing money from the poorest Americans to buy \ntrial lawyers more than Lear jets. Pure greed, Mr. President, pure \ngreed.\n  To what end are we taxing the American people here? It is unclear \nwhether price increases really have the effect of getting kids to stop \nsmoking or to prevent them from starting.\n  And what is the real motivation here? If it really were to cut \nsmoking, we wouldn't phase in the tax, we would drop it right at once. \nBut we're not doing that because the tax-and-spenders want the \nrevenues. I know they're not doing it for the tobacco companies.\n  We all know that this isn't about smoking--it's about money.\n  The consequences are irrelevant. Facing huge profit margins, a new \nindustry will crop up bringing cigarettes into the country tax-free. It \nwill be boom time for smugglers.\n  Just consider how much smuggling already occurs. Ten percent of the \ncigarettes consumed in America today are smuggled from low cigarette-\ntax states to high-tax states.\n  Just ask the Canadian border patrol about the smuggling that occurred \nin 1993 when the Canadian cigarette excise exceeded the U.S. excise by \nas much as $3.50 per pack.\n  Increased smuggling means that not only is the additional tax not \npaid, but the existing federal excise of 24 cents per pack would also \nbe avoided, as would the state excises.\n  Organized crime must be absolutely licking its chops at the prospect \nof smuggling a legal product into the country and then using its \nexisting distribution networks to sell it. One thing's for sure--the \nmarket demand for small planes in about to jump sky high.\n  The effect of smuggling is to create two classes of smokers--those \nwho smoke only legal cigarettes and those who smoke smuggled \ncigarettes. Those who smoke smuggled cigarettes will see a decline in \nprice since these cigarettes will escape the existing federal and state \ntaxes.\n  Thus, if smokers respond to price changes, smokers of smuggled \ncigarettes will smoke more, while smokers\n\n[[Page S6470]]\n\nof legal cigarettes will smoke less. Netting these changes out will be \ninteresting, but it must be done to develop a reasonable revenue \nestimate.\n  Then there are the jobs that will be lost in the industry all along \nthe production and legal distribution chain.\n  This means reduced income and payroll tax receipts to the Federal \ngovernment. The official figures do not include these revenue losses, \nof course, because that would require a level of dynamic analysis the \nestimators are unwilling to try, but the revenue losses will be real \nnonetheless.\n\n  Another element thus far ignored is that the cigarette tax increase \nwill reduce projected federal budget surpluses through its effect on \nthe Consumer Price Index (CPI). The CPI includes cigarettes on a tax-\ninclusive basis.\n  A per pack tax hike of $1.10 will cause an estimated one-time and \npermanent increase in the CPI of just under four-tenths of a percentage \npoint. A higher CPI automatically increases federal outlays because \nmany programs, like Social Security, are indexed to the CPI.\n  Phasing the tax hike in over five years as described in the McCain \nbill, the Tax Foundation calculates that federal outlays will rise by \nalmost $11 billion over the next five years and by over $29 billion \nover the next ten years. Similarly, many tax provisions are indexed to \nthe CPI, like the personal exemption, the standard deduction, and the \ntax brackets.\n  An increase in the CPI reduces tax receipts for a given amount of \ngross income. The Tax Foundation estimates that the cigarette-tax \ninduced increase in the CPI would reduce federal income tax receipts by \nabout $8 billion over the next five years, and by almost $19 billion \nover the next ten years.\n  Combined with the spending increases, the cigarette tax hike would \nreduce future budget surpluses by almost $19 billion over the next five \nyears by over $48 billion over the next ten years.\n  I know that lots of people in this town are jubilant at the prospect \nof this legislation passing. The plaintiffs' lawyers would become \nfabulously wealthy; the public health community would get all of its \nfavorite projects generously funded; and, of course, the bureaucrats \nwill get write volumes of new rules.\n  The ones who won't be so happy are the working class families who \nhave been targeted to pay for it all.\n  In short, the McCain bill, through its highly regressive tax \nprovisions, inflicts enormous costs on lower- and middle-income \nfamilies. Let me put this regressive tax in concrete terms. The \nincreased excise tax payments under the McCain bill are projected to \ntotal some $577 billion over the next 25 years. This is without the \n``look back'' penalties that will add hundreds of billions of dollars \nto the package.\n  Where are the cries about regressive taxes? We're all so used to the \nlong speeches about taxes on the poor. Or is that argument just used \nfor convenience? This is the largest tax increase on the poor in \nyears--if not in all time!\n  It is estimated that, based on projections of the actual increases in \nthe prices of tobacco products, the true cost over the next 25 years \nwill be in the range of $380 billion for families earning less than \n$30,000 per year.\n  It will be more than $735 billion for families earning less than \n$75,000 a year.\n  These are truly staggering numbers.\n  After all, 98.5% of cigarettes are legally purchased by adult \nsmokers, and therefore higher excise taxes will unfairly (and \nregressively) penalize adult consumers who choose to smoke.\n  So, we're talking about hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes \nto try to stop 1.5 percent of tobacco users from illegally buying \ntobacco. Why not just impose penalties on children who try to purchase \ntobacco? Well, I suppose, because it wouldn't be a jackpot for trial \nlawyers and Washington bureaucrats. The fact that it might help the \nchildren is irrelevant.\n  Mr. President, I, for one, was not elected to sock the American \ntaxpayer with more taxes. If teens are really our target, we owe it to \nthe taxpayer to first explore other non-price measures to combat youth \nsmoking.\n  Turning to the bill's reliance on new government programs, I find it \nhighly ironic that we are here debating a bill that will increase the \nsize of the federal bureaucracy when this Congress is supposedly \ncommitted to reducing the federal government.\n  We also need to think long and hard about the bill's Orwellian \napproach--giving the federal government more power to look over our \nshoulders regarding the personal choices we make.\n  I urge my colleagues to learn from experience. Too many times in the \npast, Washington has raised taxes in the name of one feel-good social \nprogram or another.\n  This legislation is going to result in a massive price increase for \nthe entire smoking population, including the 98 percent of legal adult \nsmokers. I think it is important that my colleagues are aware of all \nthe facts before they vote on it.\n  We should be concerned that the McCain bill will set a terrible \nprecedent that will haunt us for years to come. If we begin to use the \ntax code as a coercive means of social engineering, then I submit that \nthere is no end in sight.\n  Today, smokers will be asked to pay a huge share of their income to \nthe federal government and tomorrow, who will be next?\n  We were supposedly sent here to see to it that the tax and spend era \nof big government ends. I'm not sure we're holding up our end of the \nbargain when we propose to pass legislation along the lines of the bill \nwe're debating today.\n  This bill perpetuates a tax and spend mentality that our constituents \nhave rejected. It sets us sliding down the slippery slope. It is a bad \nbill, Mr. President, and we need to move on to other matters.\n  Mr. McCONNELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, there has been a lot of discussion \nover the last 4 weeks about teenagers and smoking. I would like to \nbegin my comments at this moment by asking who might have more \ninfluence over teenagers and smoking--Joe Camel or Leonardo DiCaprio? \nIf we continue on this bill--and it is my fervent hope that we will \nnot, as I believe it is not in the best interest of the country--or if \nit should come back, as those on the other side of the aisle are \npromising that it will, we will not have another tobacco debate that \ndoesn't deal with the real culprit, which is the influence of Hollywood \non our children and their encouragement, after watching fashionable \nmovies, to take up this habit in which none of us believe teenagers \nshould engage.\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\n  An overwhelming number of children under the age of 18 regularly view \nmotion pictures and television productions. A lot more of them do that \nthan look at any cigarette advertising. Depiction of the use of tobacco \nproducts and illegal narcotics is widespread in motion pictures and in \ntelevision productions. Such depictions have increased in recent years, \nas indicated by recent studies that have found, first, that 77 percent \nof all major motion pictures in 1996 portrayed the use of tobacco. Let \nme repeat that. Seventy-seven percent of all major motion pictures in \n1996 portrayed the use of tobacco. Fifty percent of the top grossing \nfilms released between 1990 and 1996 depicted scenes in which the major \ncharacters smoked cigarettes; 78 percent of movies, over the last 5 \nyears, include tobacco use, with an average of 11 smoking incidents per \nhour--11 smoking incidents per hour; 75 percent of movies that included \ntobacco use showed leading and/or supporting actors smoking.\n  As Hillary Clinton has explained, every single movie nominated for a \n1996 Academy Award in the categories of Best Picture, Best Actor, and \nBest Actress featured tobacco use by a leading character. The Academy \nAward nominees for Best Picture in 1996 that featured this activity \nwere: ``The English Patient,'' which was the winner; ``Fargo''; ``Jerry \nMaguire''; ``Secrets and Lies,'' and ``Shine.'' All of them featured \ntobacco use by the leading characters.\n  These depictions often deceptively portrayed the use of tobacco and \nillegal drugs as healthy, desirable, and socially acceptable. As one \nwould expect after hearing these facts and figures, teenage use of \ntobacco products and illegal narcotics is on the rise.\n  Mr. President, I am raising the issue of whether teenagers are more \ninfluenced by Joe Camel or by Leonardo DiCaprio. I am not going to ask \nfor a show of hands from the pages that are up here in the front of the \nChamber. But I think I know the answer. I suspect anybody in America \nwould know the answer. Clearly, the influence on teenage smoking as a \nresult of depiction of smoking and glamorizing of smoking in movies is \na very, very serious problem and considerably more significant than \nadvertising.\n  The depictions in the movies often deceptively portray the use of \ntobacco and illegal drugs as healthy, desirable and socially \nacceptable.\n  As one would expect after hearing these facts and figures, teenage \nuse of tobacco products and illegal narcotics is on the rise.\n  Let's think for just a minute about some of the classic moments in \ncinema history where smoking is glamorized.\n  Humphrey Bogart in ``Casablanca,'' James Dean in ``Rebel Without a \nCause.''\n  We have here a blowup of ``Rebel Without a Cause.'' Here you see \nJames Dean featured with a cigarette in his hands. That was sort of my \ngeneration back in the 1950s.\n  More recently, Julia Roberts in ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' Jane \nFonda in ``Agnes of God,'' or ``9 to 5,'' Rebecca DeMornay in ``Risky \nBusiness,'' Olivia Newton-John and John Travolta in ``Grease,'' which \nwe have blown up again.\n  Here is Olivia Newton-John featured smoking in ``Grease.''\n  And who can forget the recent smash hit ``Titanic,'' which I referred \nto on the floor earlier in this debate. Leonardo DiCaprio who is \ncurrently, I am told, the teen idol of America--I see a few smiles on a \nfew pages' faces down here. I think I probably got that right.\n  Leonardo DiCaprio is ``Smokin' Teen Idol'', and appeared, of course, \nin ``Titanic,'' the most watched movie of all time, ``Romeo and \nJuliet,'' ``Marvin's Room,'' ``Basketball Diaries,'' and ``This Boy's \nLife.''\n  We know ``Titanic'' is the highest grossing movie of all time at $554 \nmillion. If we assume that ticket prices, including matinees, average \n$6, then we can fairly estimate that over 90 million people have seen \nthis blatant glamorization of smoking. And, unfortunately, a \ndisproportionate share of those 90 million people are our children.\n  Let's face it. Who is more adored by the girls and idolized by the \nboys, as I asked earlier--Leonardo DiCaprio or Joe Camel? And in a \nstudy sponsored by the American Lung Association, youth watched 50 top \nbox office movies to evaluate smoking. The youth concluded that a \nsignificant percentage of the scenes involved tobacco use that was \n``sexy, exciting, powerful, sports-related, sophisticated and a means \nof celebration.''\n  Mr. President, I think it is time that Hollywood took responsibility. \nWe need to send a message to Hollywood. ``Don't hook our kids on \ntobacco and illegal drugs.''\n  Under the first amendment, we cannot and would not seek to deny the \nright of free speech to anyone. However, as the Senate, we can and \nshould encourage Hollywood to take responsible steps to protect our \nchildren. We can make sure that at least the Federal Government does \nnot costar with Hollywood in any movies that glorify or glamorize \ntobacco.\n  Let me repeat, we can at least make sure that the Federal Government \nitself does not costar with Hollywood in any movies that glorify and \nglamorize tobacco.\n  Now, Mr. President, had this bill continued, or if it continues--I \nhope that it will not, but if it does--I will be offering an amendment \nthat would do this. The Federal Government currently grants permits to \nHollywood for the production of movies and TV shows, and we have seen \nin recent years more and more movies, at least in part, depicted on \nFederal property. The Government has granted Federal film privileges to \nmotion pictures such as ``Top Gun,'' ``Biloxi Blues,'' ``The Hunt for \nRed October,'' ``In The Line of Fire,'' ``Clear and Present Danger,'' \n``True Lies,'' ``Apollo 11,'' ``Apollo 13,'' ``Contact,'' ``Air Force \nOne,'' ``Crimson Tide,'' and ``A Time to Kill.''\n  The Government currently makes these decisions based on the nature \nand the message of the proposed production. In other words, the Federal \nGovernment itself makes a decision whether or not to allow the use of \nFederal property, and it made that decision in each of those films. The \nDepartment of Defense decides whether to grant Federal filming \nprivileges based on whether a production ``appears to condone or \nendorse activities . . . that are contrary to U.S. Government policy.''\n  Let me repeat. The current Department of Defense standard is as \nfollows. They will grant the filming privilege based on whether a \nproduction ``appears to condone or endorse activities . . . that are \ncontrary to U.S. Government policy.''\n  In other words, ``Top Gun'' is OK but ``GI Jane'' is not. So \nGovernment agencies are already reviewing scripts and deciding who gets \nFederal film privileges and who does not. So we ought to make sure our \nyoung people and tobacco are not left out of this review process. And \nthe amendment I was going to offer, or would offer if we stay on this \nsubject or come back to it, would simply say that no agency or \ndepartment of the Federal Government may grant permission for the \nfilming of a movie on Federal property where such movie depicts the use \nof tobacco or illegal drugs as healthy, desirable, or socially \nacceptable.\n  In other words, what I would do by this amendment, if and when I \noffer it, is require the Federal Government to make a decision about \nwhether it is appropriate for movies filmed on Federal property to \ndepict smoking. And the language should be that no agency or department \nmay grant permission--in other words, we can't do it--for the filming \nof a movie on Federal property where such movie depicts the use of \ntobacco or illegal drugs as healthy, desirable, or socially acceptable.\n  Furthermore, the President has, as we all know, a lot of friends in \nHollywood. That is fine. He is free to associate with whoever he \nchooses. He was just out there this week, I am told. So I would call on \nthe President today to issue an Executive order--all of this could be \ndone by Executive order--mandating that agencies comply with the \nprovisions of the amendment I would have offered. In other words, the \nPresident can today or tomorrow issue an Executive order stating that \nno agency or department may grant permission for the filming of a movie \non Federal property where such movie depicts the use of tobacco or \nillegal drugs as healthy, desirable, or socially acceptable.\n  Now, finally, Mr. President, had I offered the amendment--and I may \nwell offer it; if we either stay on this bill or\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\ncome back to it later, I certainly will--the second part of the \namendment would be a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. No one is more \nsensitive to the first amendment than the Senator from Kentucky, so \nthis could only be done as a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. And this \nsense-of-the-Senate would go something like this, Mr. President: A \nparent should have adequate information about the nature and content of \nmotion pictures and television productions.\n\n  Part 2 of the sense of the Senate would be: The television and motion \npicture industries have developed rating systems that help provide such \ninformation. Point 3: These rating systems currently provide that \nmotion pictures and television productions restricted to mature \naudiences should receive the designation of ``R'' and ``TV-MA''--that \nis, TV-mature audience--respectively.\n  Such rating systems, Mr. President, however, provide insufficient \ninformation about the use of tobacco and illegal narcotics in motion \npictures and in television productions.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate would be this, were I to offer it:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the television and \n     motion picture industries should designate motion pictures \n     and television productions with the rating of ``R'' and ``TV-\n     MA,'' respectively, if such pictures or productions depict \n     the use of tobacco or illegal narcotics as healthy, \n     desirable, or socially acceptable.\n\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, this is not an amendment I am planning \nto offer at this time but will offer later if we get back to this issue \nor stay on it. It would do essentially two things:\n  No. 1--and this is something the President could do today --is to \nprevent motion pictures which use Federal property from featuring \nsmoking--and the President could issue an Executive order to do that \ntoday--and, secondly, to call on the television and motion picture \nindustry to rate any production that features smoking with an ``R'' or \n``TV-MA;'' that is, TV-mature audience.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to make a few brief remarks, \nand then I note the presence of the Democratic leader in the Chamber, \nand I know that he and others have some comments.\n  But I think I would like to make a few brief comments now in \nanticipation that either tonight or tomorrow we will have a cloture \nvote on this legislation that we are now in our fourth week \nconsidering.\n  First of all, I would like to point out, we have a lot of charges \nthat are hurled at the bill, a lot of exaggeration, and more than a \nlittle fiction. Just this morning, one of our colleagues said that the \nbill has gone from $368.5 billion to $858 billion from the money grab. \nThat is astounding--if it were true, and it is not. The first figure \nfails to include inflation, look-back penalties, and the second one \ndoes in order to make it look outlandishly bigger. First, it used to be \ntoo big a bill and too much spending, and now there is a revenue \nshortfall. We have covered most of the bases, Mr. President. So I \ncongratulate the opponents of the bill and the industry on their memory \nloss and their creative accounting.\n  When we decide the fate of this legislation--some have cast this as a \nvote over whether we believe in taxes or not-- it is really a question \nof whether or not we believe an industry should be allowed to lie to \nCongress and the American people and get away with it; whether an \nindustry should be able to target kids to addict them to a deadly \nproduct and get away with it; whether to allow an industry to \nmanipulate nicotine to better hook its customers and get away with it; \nwhether to allow an industry to quash critical public health findings \nand get away with it; whether an industry can pay billions of dollars \nin campaign contributions for protection against their misdeeds and get \naway with it.\n  This bill is not about taxes, it is about whether we are going to \nallow the death march of 418,000 Americans a year who die early from \ntobacco-related disease and do nothing; whether we are going to \ncontinue to heap $50 billion a year in smoking-related health care \ncosts on the American taxpayer, and do nothing. It is about whether we \nare going to have the will to serve the public interest, or the special \ninterests. So I hope every Senator, before making a decision about how \nhe or she will vote, will be fully informed about what is and what is \nnot in this bill, and whether they want to push the legislation process \nforward or to let it die.\n  First of all, briefly, what is in this bill? A major youth smoking \nreduction program that addresses the single greatest cause of death and \ndisease in America and will help stop one million kids a year from \ntaking up a habit that will kill one-third of them. It stops the $50 \nbillion annual health care tax on Americans, which is nearly $455 per \nhousehold per year. It has a major provision to address the illegal \nnarcotics problem in America, and additional resources to find \ntreatment and cures for deadly diseases including breast cancer, heart \ndisease, lung disease and many others. It is a $190 billion tax cut. \nWhat I do not understand is some on the other side of the aisle who \nsaid they favored this bill when it came out of the committee with no \ntax cuts, now are opposed to a $190 billion tax cut. Nearly 40 percent \nof the bill now, as it sits, is to reduce taxes, and every penny above \nthe June 20 settlement goes to tax relief.\n  Mr. President, $3 billion is earmarked for veterans who suffer from \nsmoking-related disease. I have been over this issue before, but the \nfact is there is only one group of Americans that I know of that the \nGovernment encouraged to smoke, and that is the veterans who were \nconveniently left out of the ISTEA bill, as we so eagerly sought our \nhighways and bridges and other pork barrel projects. Don't the veterans \ndeserve something, Mr. President, in the way of treatment of tobacco-\nrelated illness from a Government that encouraged them to take up the \nhabit?\n  There is a cap on legal fees on tobacco suits so that more money can \ngo to victims and not lawyers. No one in this body believed that we \nwould pass an amendment, for the first time that I know of in this \nbody, that caps legal fees; it caps them from any future bills at $500 \nan hour. I will admit that is quite a bit of money. But the reality of \nthat impact is that it is an enormous break for both individuals and \ngroups bringing suits against tobacco companies.\n  It is a chance to settle State cases collectively and efficiently, \nand an antismuggling campaign that will stop those who today traffic in \ncontraband.\n  I keep hearing, again, ``giant programs and huge bureaucracies.'' The \nfact of the matter is there is no guaranteed spending in this bill for \nasbestos victims and none whatsoever for black lung. Spending on \nprevention, cessation research, international reimbursement, and for \nIndian health services, is all subject to appropriations, and there are \nno new Federal bureaucracies. All the functions will be conducted \nthrough existing Federal, State, local and private entities.\n  I really did not appreciate the resurrection of the old Clinton \nhealth care plan bureaucracy chart. I am tempted, with legislation that \nI see coming before this body which is supported on both sides of the \naisle, to make up a chart. But there are no new Federal bureaucracies \nassociated with this legislation.\n  We have heard that giving the FDA authority over tobacco is an \nabomination, even though the courts have already upheld FDA's ability \nto regulate nicotine under their current authority, giving them far \nmore power than this legislation does.\n  We have heard that retail licensing is absurd, even though 46 States \nalready have tobacco licensing programs, and both the National \nGovernors' Association and convenience stores support their provisions, \nwhich is basically the same as alcohol. We have heard the concept of \nlook-backs are absurd, even though the industry itself endorsed the \nidea last June. And every day, we cite drug statistics on this floor \nand give them great credence. They are based on the same premise of \nsurveys that we would be using on determining whether we were reducing \nteenage smoking or not.\n  We have heard the bill contains Indian largess, and the Craig-\nCoverdell amendment eliminated the bill's authorization to set aside a \npercentage of money for Indian health services, although it is \ninteresting to me that we\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\nseem to not understand that Indians, poorest of all our citizens, have \na high incidence of tobacco-related illness and the Indian Health \nService, like the VA, has spent vast sums of money covering smoking-\nrelated illness.\n  What has caused the change in attitude since we reported this bill \nout by a 19-to-1 vote through the Commerce Committee? I don't know. I \nwill leave that to others. I do think it is of note that some $50 \nmillion or more, the estimate is a minimum of $50 million, has been \nspent on tobacco company advertising. I think anybody who believes that \nan advertising campaign of that magnitude does not have an effect, \nobviously is not aware of the effect of advertising in America.\n\n  What happens if we fail to invoke cloture, and after a lot of \nmachinations that we leave this legislation and go on to other issues? \nI think it is important to point out that what happens is two things: \nOne is that 36 attorneys generals go to court. They have said they \nwill. They have cases pending. And the other is, of course, and most \ntragically, 3,000 more kids will start smoking every day that we fail \nto act.\n  I have heard comments on the floor today, finally, Mr. President, \nabout defining the Republican Party, about how we act on this \nlegislation will define the Republican Party. You know, there may be \nsomething to that. There may be something to that. Because maybe we \nought to remember the obligations that we incur when we govern America. \nMaybe we might remember the principles of the founder of our party when \nwe are defining the Republican Party and how we vote on this \nlegislation. We might understand that our obligation, first of all, is \nto those who cannot care for themselves in our society and that \nincludes our children. Isn't it our obligation, shouldn't it define the \nRepublican Party, that we should do everything we can to handle this \nscourge, this disease that is rampant throughout young children in \nAmerica? Does that define the Republican Party, or at least have \nsomething to do with the definition of our party? I hope my colleagues \nmight understand what our obligations are.\n  I did not invent this bill. I did not seek the responsibility for it. \nBut I believe in the strongest possible terms that we need to act. \nOtherwise we will act, sooner or later, and every day that it is later, \nmore young Americans will die as a result of our inaction.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I did not hear all of the remarks of the \nSenator from Arizona. But I observe the applause that he just received. \nI join in expressing my appreciation to the Senator from Arizona for \nthe work that he has done in taking this issue up in the Commerce \nCommittee, being willing to deal with it, being willing to deal with \nthe criticism both in this Chamber and other venues for the effort he \nhas made. Also, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \ncooperation in a number of ways, in the way he worked with Senator \nMcCain.\n  I do have some requests to ask that have been cleared with Senator \nDaschle, or he is aware of what I am going to ask for. After I make \nthese motions, then I would like to just make some brief comments.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for me to \nfile a cloture motion on the committee amendment to the tobacco bill, \nand at the hour of 5:15 p.m. the Senate proceed to vote on the cloture \nmotion with the mandatory quorum under rule XXII having been waived.\n  I further ask that the time between now and 5:15 be equally divided \nbetween the two leaders or their designees. I further ask, if cloture \nis invoked, Members have until the close of business today to file \nfirst-degree amendments and until 10 a.m. on Thursday to file second-\ndegree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, may I ask \nthe majority leader, does the majority leader intend to vote for \ncloture?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I was going to explain that after I had \nasked these unanimous-consent requests. Since the Senator has asked, \nthere has been a request and efforts made in the past to get cloture, \nto have cloture filed and have votes. We have had three of those. This \nis a cloture motion that we will vote on, instead of 2 days from now, \ngo ahead and vote today to see where we are.\n  It is my intention to vote against cloture. I still think we should \nnot cut off some of the amendments and substitutes that could be \noffered. We also still have the pending problem of what to do about \nfarmers in this issue. But I think we need to see where we are.\n  I have, over the past several weeks, been hoping that we could come \nto some resolution on this matter, but we have spent 78 hours or more \nnow and 56 minutes--I guess it is probably closer to 80 or 82 hours. I \ndon't see how we are going to conclude this just by moving along at the \nslow pace we have been moving along. I think we need to see where the \nvotes are. This cloture vote will give us that opportunity. I think it \nis important that we not have this vote occur next Monday or next \nTuesday. If we file cloture today or tomorrow, that will be the result. \nAfter this cloture vote, then we will make a decision where to go from \nthere.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I will not object, but I wish the \nproponent of the vote on cloture will vote for the cloture motion. We \nwill then discover where the votes are. I am prepared to move to final \npassage. There is a lot in the bill I don't like. I agree with what the \nSenator from Arizona said earlier. I believe it important to enact \nlegislation. There are a lot of lives at stake. I wish you would \ndiscover where the votes are by moving to cloture, but also supporting \nthe cloture motion you are going to file.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I now send the cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The cloture motion having been presented under \nrule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the motion.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the provision of \nRule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, do hereby move to bring \nto a close debate on the committee substitute to Calendar No. 353, S. \n1415, regarding tobacco reform:\n         Trent Lott, John McCain, James M. Inhofe, Christopher S. \n           Bond, Gordon H. Smith, Robert F. Bennett, Joseph R. \n           Biden, Jr., Ted Stevens, Richard C. Shelby, Mike \n           DeWine, Kent Conrad, John Glenn, Tom Harkin, John F. \n           Kerry, and Frank H. Murkowski.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that \nfollowing the cloture vote, if not invoked, Senator Stevens be \nrecognized to raise a Budget Act point of order, and that the \nDemocratic leader, or his designee, be immediately recognized to make a \nmotion that it be waived, and that that vote occur immediately \nfollowing the earlier vote without any intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the right to object to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democratic leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I want to ask the majority leader two \nquestions.\n  First, with regard to the cloture motion, he and I have talked about \nthis matter. The motion itself says:\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee \n     substitute. . .\n\n  And it is signed, of course, by 16 Senators, including the \ndistinguished majority leader. If, indeed, it is his position that he \nwill vote against the cloture motion, I am curious as to how he can be \nsigning the cloture motion.\n  Mr. LOTT. As a matter of fact, Mr. President, the motion has to be \nfiled to get a vote on the cloture process. It doesn't mean that you \nwill vote for cloture, and I don't want any inference to be made here \nthat this is unusual. This is, as Senators on both sides know, done \nquite often by majority leaders, that they file cloture and on occasion \nvote against that cloture. So this is\n\n[[Page S6474]]\n\njust a process to get us to a vote, to see where the Senate is, to see \nif the Senate is ready to cut off debate, and there is nothing unusual \nabout that at all.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Well, Mr. President, I just say, I have never heard of \nit before. I think it is highly unusual, but certainly that is the \nmajority leader's prerogative. I just call attention to this \ninteresting juxtaposition of filing cloture and then voting against it.\n  Another question I have relates to the Budget Act point of order. Is \nit the majority leader's understanding that those who vote not to waive \nthe budget point of order will then be voting against those amendments \nthat the Senate has adopted, including the amendment on marriage \npenalty and the amendment on drug enforcement; is that the \nunderstanding of the majority leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I am sure that a lot of people will read \ninto that vote and other votes any number of things, and I am sure that \nit will be described by Senators on both sides of the aisle in the way \nthey would like to describe it, maybe even going so far as to impugn \nthe integrity of Senators based on that vote.\n  But all that means to me, as the Senator says, is that we should not \nwaive the Budget Act. We agreed to the Budget Act; we agreed to the \nbudget last year. That is one of the major problems with this whole \nbill. The original concept that we try to get some limits on teenage \nsmoking, to stop teenage smoking and drug abuse and to deal with some \nof the problems caused by smoking, that is one thing, but it has gone \nfar, far afield from that.\n  I had planned to comment on some of those later, but I will go ahead \nand mention them now. The micromanaging in this bill, the exceeding of \nthe budget caps--what really has happened here, while we have a good \nprinciple that we can all vote on something right now that will deal \nwith teenage smoking if we wanted to and health problems caused by \nsmoking, what has happened is a lot of people have figured out, ``Oh, \nlook, this is a cookie jar, this is a bill we can use to pay for all \nthese programs that we are not going to be able to pay for''----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. May we have order in the Chamber in order that \nwe may hear and understand the majority and minority leaders?\n  Mr. LOTT. ``For these programs under the strictures of the budget \nagreement we had just last year.'' The Washington Post outlined it \npretty clearly today. It is going to be tough to get the appropriations \nbills done, to get a budget done this year because of the constraints \nthat we agreed to.\n  This bill violates the Budget Act in several instances, I think about \nsix different points. At least one of them we are pointing out here \ntoday. That is all it means, that you don't want to waive the Budget \nAct, that we have agreed to pass this bill that started out well-\nintentioned, but has grown like top seed to the point where we have to \ndecide whether we want to take this cup from our lips and move on or \nnot.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, as I have, \nI simply ask that there be 5 minutes equally divided between votes so \nthat we might talk about the specific vote and its ramifications prior \nto the time we cast it. I ask if the majority leader has any problem \nwith that?\n  Mr. LOTT. I think that would be the way to do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I am a \nlittle confused.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It is my understanding that the majority leader some 7, 6, \n5, 10 days ago, told us that this bill would go nowhere unless we added \na Republican provision relating to the marriage penalty. And now he is \ntelling us that it violates the budget because we passed on this floor \nwhat he asked us to do.\n  I want to tell you, I find that incredibly fascinating. I don't find \nit unusual, I find it fascinating. I have to get this straight. Here is \nmy question, and I will not object if I get an answer: Is one of the \nreasons why the Republican leader will argue that this is a violation \nof the budget agreement the fact that this bill now contains a tax \nexpenditure of tens of billions of dollars to correct the marriage \npenalty, which all the Republicans voted for and told us we had to \nhave? Is that one of the reasons why we violate the Budget Act? I ask \nthat as a question of my friend.\n  Mr. LOTT. The violation of the Budget Act that I think carries the \ngreatest weight is the exceeding of the caps that were agreed to by \ncategory in the budget resolution. That is the major problem with it.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will not object, but it is a fascinating \nplace.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, further reserving the right to object, \njust for clarification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. There may be some confusion. I ask there be an \nintervening period of at least 5 minutes prior to the second vote so we \ncan have an opportunity to discuss the ramifications.\n  Mr. LOTT. So everyone is clear, the cloture vote will occur at 5:15. \nFollowing that vote, if not invoked, the Senate will proceed--well, \nwill have 10 minutes equally divided, and then proceed to the second \nvote on the motion to waive the Budget Act to allow Senator Stevens and \nsomebody on your side, some designee on your side, to speak on the \nparticular budget point of order.\n  Therefore, there would be then two back-to-back votes at 5:15, with \nthe 10-minute interval between those two votes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I would just like to make this comment and really express my profound \ndisappointment. For those of us that are somewhat, relatively new to \nthis body, I think to see a very consequential piece of legislation \ncome a cropper in this way is extraordinarily disappointing. Obviously, \nwhat has happened is to kill tobacco reform.\n  There is no question about how it is being done. There is no search \nfor alternatives. There is no search for where there may be a consensus \nin this body. And I think there are points where there is consensus. I \ndeeply believe a bill can be put together which can deter teen smoking.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, would the Senator yield on that point, \nbecause I would like to commend her for some efforts in which she has \nbeen involved?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. May I finish my train of thought for a moment?\n  That there is the possibility--I watched the McCain bill come out of \ncommittee. And then I watched the amendments go on. And then we sat \ndown to do our due diligence and took a look at the impact that the \namendments have on the bill. The Gramm and Coverdell amendment took \n$16.8 billion off of it. The marriage penalty took, I think, around $31 \nbillion off of it. It ate up all but a very small amount of the public \nhealth money.\n  Yet the very party that put these amendments on a tobacco public \nhealth bill--drugs, taxes--now is going to kill that bill, and no \ncalling together any kind of opportunity for consensus.\n  I make no secret that I have been working with the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee to try to put something together. It isn't perfect. \nIt took what we saw were points at issue here and put them in a form \nwhere we thought there could be concurrence. And yet the way we are \ngoing to leave this debate, I have no doubt that the Republican Members \nof the U.S. Senate are clearly going to kill any form of tobacco \nreform; they are going to kill campaign-spending reform and they are \ngoing to kill tobacco reform. I, for one, who tries very hard to work \nacross the aisle, find that just reprehensible.\n  Mr. Majority Leader, I would sincerely hope that there would be some \nleadership to take the remnants of what we can do and put it in a bill \nto send to the House. I have no other--I tried now----\n  Mr. LOTT. Would you yield, because I would like to respond to what \nyou are saying there?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I would be happy to yield if I could just finish. I \nhave been trying to, as Senator Kerry knows, make a simple amendment to \nthe bill since last week. Can't get in line. Wait, wait, wait. Can't \nget in line. Then we go into gridlock. And I just find it all a very \nsorry mess.\n\n[[Page S6475]]\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I agree with that \npart of it. It is a sorry mess. We have gotten into gridlock. And there \nare lots of explanations for that. I don't think we should start \nblaming one Senator or one side or the other.\n  But I wanted to commend the Senator from California for the efforts \nthat I was under the impression she had been making with Senator Hatch \nand others, perhaps on both sides of the aisle, to come up with a bill \nmuch different from what is before us--smaller, probably, by $100 \nbillion, with all the components that would really be needed.\n  I want to remind the Senate that I have given a lot of time and a lot \nof personal effort and have taken a lot of flak for trying to find a \nway to get a bill through here that was responsible enough that we \ncould choke it down in a reasonable period of time, and we are not \nthere. And I cannot figure any way to get a bill that would be credible \nthat we could get through here.\n  In fact, when we have had some critical votes, they went the wrong \nway. I am not blaming that on one side or the other. There were some \nvotes on our side that were really disturbing to me, that you are \nreally trying to get something.\n  But what is wrong with this bill now is it has lost sight of the \noriginal noble cause of just dealing with the question of teenage \nsmoking and drug abuse, if you want to add that--and I think we \nshould--and some limited effort to address the problems for the States \non health problems caused by smoking or research.\n  But we are talking about a bill very different than what you are \ntalking about. If we could wind up somewhere in the area that you are \ntalking about, I would support that. And I want to note that when this \npoint of order is sustained, or we do not waive the Budget Act, the \nbill does not disappear. It goes back to the Commerce Committee.\n  There has also been a suggestion that we consider having a task force \nto see if we could come up with something that could resurrect this in \na way that would be much smaller, to do what we say that we want done, \nbut without these massive micromanaging government controls that we see \nin this bill.\n\n  Most Senators are not happy with this bill. I mean, some don't like \nit because of, perhaps, the marriage penalty tax, although I think, \ngenerally speaking, everybody realizes that is going to happen; it is a \ngood idea.\n  But we have major problems with it over here. But we are stalled out \nwith no end in sight. Even if we get cloture today, which, you know, I \nhope we don't, there are about seven other opportunities for cloture \nmotions to be filed.\n  The Senate, in its unique way, has not reached a consensus here. We \nhave not reached a consensus. It is like Senator McCain has said \nbefore: We can guarantee a vote; we can't guarantee a result. And until \nwe find a way we can get together on something that is much smaller, \nthat is targeted and limited, that is not just more Government from \nWashington, dictates from Washington--I mean, this thing even has \nrequirements in here that not only you can't have smoking in Federal \nbuildings, you can't even have smoking in front of Federal buildings.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Any building.\n  Mr. LOTT. Any building.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is just one example. At any rate, I thank you for \nyielding. I thank you for your effort. Don't give up.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. If I may just finish my statement for a moment, it \nwas my understanding that at the present time the only game in town, so \nto speak, was the McCain bill, that we could vote out the McCain bill, \nit would go to conference, and a bill could be written.\n  Now, Mr. Majority Leader, based on what you are saying, there will be \nno bill at all that would go to conference; ergo no bill, period. That \nis what I find very disturbing.\n  I am prepared to vote for the McCain bill, with the view that it goes \nto conference, and perhaps some of the ideas that Senator Hatch and I, \nand others, Senator Jeffords, Senator Breaux, Senator Torricelli have--\nthat might prevail in a conference setting. So I will just, most \nrespectfully, urge you to reconsider, vote out this bill. Let us not \ngive up the issue of tobacco reform.\n  I thank the Chair for your forbearance. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, but does \nthe majority leader understand that there will be an opportunity for \nthis body to offer this particular measure, the McCain bill, on any \nother piece of legislation that is coming down the pike? This may go \nback to the committee, but it ought to be very clear to this Membership \nthat this issue is not going away and that this body ought to get \nprepared to consider this legislation on every appropriate measure.\n  I have no objection.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, 11 years ago, I offered a \nbill in the House of Representatives to ban smoking on airplanes. I \npassed that bill by five votes. And since that bill passed, in the 11 \nyears since, I have had any number of Members who came up to me and \nsaid, ``I voted against you that day, Congressman Durbin, but I was \nwrong. And I realize I was wrong. I was on the wrong side of history.''\n  I want to tell you, the folks today who are killing this tobacco bill \non the floor are on the wrong side of history. In defending the tobacco \ncompanies, they are defending the indefensible. In refusing to protect \nour children, they are attacking the vulnerable.\n  We can talk about all the procedural votes that we want to. We can \ntalk about filing motions and voting against them, points of order, and \nall the rest. The bottom line is, for almost 4 weeks now we have \nendured countless amendments from those who have no use whatever for \nthis bill, most of which have been adopted, and now the people who \noffer the amendments successfully are telling us, let's walk away from \nthis, we don't like it after all.\n  I think the American people will see through this. Although the \nprocedural battle may be won today, ultimately the folks who opposed \nthis tobacco legislation are on the wrong side of history.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am liable to object unless we get an agreement to get \nthe agreement in order.\n  I was supposed to have half this time and the other side half the \ntime. Now my half will be less than one-eighth. I don't object. Let's \nget the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation, may \nI ask, in terms of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided between the two \nleaders or their designee.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Between now and what time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. 5:15.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I assume that means there is \napproximately 12 or 13 minutes per side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I will designate our manager as the \nmanager of our time, Senator Kerry.\n  Let me make a couple of brief remarks. Many of our colleagues, \nobviously, want to speak to this issue.\n  First of all, our caucus is united, as we have been throughout this \ndebate, on this very important issue. I hope the American people will \nsee it for what it is. We are not deceived, and they shouldn't be \neither. This will be an effort, this afternoon, to kill this bill. The \ngun is on the other side. They will shoot it dead. It will be dead if \nthose votes occur this afternoon as we predict they will vote. That is \na tragedy. That is a tragedy. Three thousand kids a day start smoking; \n1,000 kids a day die early because they started too early. That is what \nis at stake.\n  I hope it is more than just a coincidence that, a night after we \nraised $10 million downtown, they raised $10 million downtown.\n\n[[Page S6476]]\n\n  We vote today to kill the tobacco bill. I am amazed, really, at the \nlogic of some of our colleagues on the other side. How many colleagues \nhave come to the floor to say we cannot pass this legislation until we \ninclude the marriage penalty, until we include the drug amendment, \nuntil we include some cap on lawyers' fees. Guess what. We spent the \nlast 4 weeks doing just that: We passed a marriage penalty; we passed a \ndrug enforcement amendment; we passed, now, some limit on legal fees. I \nwill guarantee that virtually every one of our colleagues on the other \nside, in spite of that, having voted for it, will vote to kill this \nbill.\n  It is amazing to me that I have heard even our majority leader say we \ncan't pass this legislation until we address the marriage penalty, that \nwe can't address this bill completely until we have done the drug \nissue. We have done those, and now we are being told it is too heavy, \nwe can't pass it.\n  The majority leader just said, ``I can't think of a way to bring this \nto closure.'' I can. If the Democrats were in the majority, we would \nbring this bill to closure, because I would vote for cloture. I would \nvote for cloture this afternoon, and every one of our Democratic \ncolleagues would vote for it as well. We would bring an end to this \nbill. There is no mystery to it. You get 60 votes. We have more than 40 \non this side. All we need is a fraction of the caucus on that side and \nwe would bring this vote to closure. There is no mystery here.\n  Let me say, as my colleagues have noted, this is not over. This bill \nmay be dead, but tobacco legislation is not dead. We will continue to \ncome back. I will tell my colleagues right now, we will not let this \nissue die. We will continue to come back. There are, as the Senator \nfrom California noted, some principles that ought to unite us as \nRepublicans and Democrats. We ought to be united on stopping kids from \nsmoking. We will continue to pursue other methods, other ways, other \nlegislation, but we will keep at it.\n  So I hope we can agree on principles. I hope we will all agree that \neven though that bill may die today, the issue does not die. The issue \nwill continue to live until we are victorious.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the senior Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am one of the members of the Commerce \nCommittee who voted to report this bill. I think I am one of the \nMembers of the Senate who does not take tobacco contributions. And I \nhave very serious intentions to see to it that there is a bill passed.\n\n  But I am also chairman of the Appropriations Committee, and we have \n13 bills to pass. We have taken 4 weeks, now, on this bill, and I don't \nsee any hope that it will be finished before the Fourth of July recess, \nthe way things are going. Now, this country has to have a government \nand it has to have the appropriations bills come out of our committee.\n  Members of the Senate seem to think that we are sort of the obnoxious \npeople who bother them all the time until the time comes to decide what \ngoes in those bills, and then I have a lot of friends. I am not going \nto have a lot of friends on what I want to do today, and I am sure \nthere are people who are going to get involved, and unless the chairman \nof the Budget Committee wishes to make a point of order, I will make a \npoint of order that if cloture does not come into effect--we have known \nall along, Mr. President, this bill violates the Budget Act.\n  When I voted to bring it out of the Commerce Committee, I did so on \nthe basis that we thought we could clean it up on the floor and \neventually get it to conference, where it would become a bill that we \nwould all be proud of. The trouble is, now it is just too complex and \ninvolves too much money.\n  I decided to get involved when I heard about CBO's latest letter that \nwent to Senator Lugar, chairman of the Agriculture Committee, and \npointed out that over 25 years this bill would be in effect, the \ncumulative cost of title X is $28 billion and the cumulative cost of \ntitle XV is $18 billion. That is just two titles. This bill is totally \nout of whack with the Budget Act.\n  When I bring a bill out here for the Appropriations Committee, our \nwhole committee brings it out. We are subject to a point of order if we \nviolate the Budget Act. The beauty of anybody who deals with the \nlegislative process is, you are not subject to points of order until \nyou get to the point that it is so extreme, as this one is, and now it \ndoes violate the Budget Act.\n  I believe that it should go--I have suggested the idea of a task \nforce being created. I agree with what the Senator from Massachusetts \nsaid actually. We are going to see something come back here. This \nconcept of trying to deal with tobacco and its impact on society is not \ngone. But this bill has become too complex and too bulky, too \ncumbersome. We can't agree even on what amendments to be offered next, \nand we are not sure what the amendment does from the titles that are \nalready here.\n  Now, I had hoped that I could stay with my good friend from Arizona \nand provide support to get this bill to conference. I don't see any \nhope of going to conference. I am taking the floor to announce that \nwhile I am still for a bill that would try to satisfy what the 40 \nattorneys general tried to do in trying to find some way to settle this \nmatter, I am not for a bill that continues to create more commissions, \nmore boards, more entities, more spending, and does so in the name of \nspending the money that will come out of the tobacco settlement.\n  This is a bill to spend money out of the tobacco settlement. It is \nnot a bill to deal with stopping smoking by teenagers, but particularly \ntargeted young women--which is something I have always been appalled \nby--the targeting of young women by the tobacco industry.\n  As a practical matter, we spent too much time on our bill. We must \nget back to our regular, ordinary, drudge work of getting the 13 \nappropriations bills through the Senate and to the President.\n  If no one else makes a point of order after the cloture on the vote, \nif cloture is not invoked, I will make that point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the distinguished Senator \nfrom Idaho.\n  Who yields the time?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I have sensed an effort to express a great \ndeal of outrage here on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. I am \noutraged that there are a good number of folks who would like to hide \nbehind the idea of teenage smoking to raise more taxes than this Senate \nwill ever have raised with the sweep of one vote and to create more \nofficial bureaucracies in big government than we have ever created by \none vote. That is exactly what you are tending to do.\n  Let me tell you where the outrage is. It is outside the beltway. It \nis the average taxpaying citizen who says, ``By golly, they figured out \nanother way to do it. They balanced the budget. Now they will raise \nnearly $600 billion in taxes and they will create all kinds of \nbureaucracies.''\n  And the latest polls--and they are not biased polls, they are taken \nacross the board--say that this bill will not stop teenage smoking. \nWhy? Because we don't go at it how you go at a teenager. I am all for \nmaking tobacco a controlled substance, and I think this Senate is. I \nwant to get tobacco out of the hands of teenagers, and we ought to. We \nought to do exactly what the States are doing. If you drink or you \nattempt to acquire liquor as a teenager, you lose your driver's \nlicense.\n  But we are not saying that. We want to create great schemes; we want \nto raise hundreds of billions of dollars. I say, let's go get the \ntobacco companies, but let's talk the right talk about how we deal with \nteenage smoking. That is what the issue is here.\n  I am all for pulling this bill down. Maybe we will come to our senses \nand craft something limited, something directed, and something \nrelatively simple. And the American people will say: I believe they are \nserious. Right now, the American people are saying--that $30,000 and \nlower-income group--you are really laying it on us heavy. You are going \nto take it away from us and you are going to try to give it back? It \ndoesn't make a lot of sense. Then again, for 4 weeks we have not made a\n\n[[Page S6477]]\n\nlot of sense. We have postured politically, but we haven't done the \nright thing for America's teenagers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield me 30 seconds?\n  Mr. KERRY. First, I yield 1 minute to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I agree with the previous speaker. There \nhave been a lot of things not making sense. On Friday, June 5, the \nmajority leader said, ``If we don't add something on the marriage \npenalty, tax relief, and on drugs, there will not be a bill.'' Two days \nlater, he said, ``This has gone way beyond trying to do something about \nteenage smoking. Greed has set in. This is about money grubbing; it's \nabout taxing people and spending on a myriad of programs. We have lost \nour focus.''\n  That was the same person--in 2 days, two different things. Yes, there \nhas been a lot of confusion around here on this bill. I think it is \nvery clear. If this bill goes down today, Joe Camel wins, and our kids \nlose--3,000 a day will lose, and Joe Camel wins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it is clear that the tobacco companies have \nno shame. My question for this body is: Have we no shame? What are we \nabout to do? Nothing will happen to protect our children when this goes \ndown. Have we no shame at all?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 1 minute to the senior Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is not the end of this issue. It may \nvery well be the beginning of the issue, because the Democratic Party \nand the American people are not going to let this effort die. It may \nvery well be that the final vote on this issue is cast on election day.\n  This is not a whodunit. We know who has done it. It is big tobacco \nand the Republican Party. They may mug this bill in the Senate of the \nUnited States today, but they cannot kill it because it will not die, \nand we won't let it die.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, from the outset I had hoped to be able to \nvote for a bill that would effectively reduce underage smoking and I \nstill hope to do so during this session of Congress.\n  I continue to believe that a resolution of the issues surrounding \ntobacco are in the best interests of all interested parties--not just \nchildren, but also the public health community, plaintiffs, tobacco \nworkers, tobacco companies, tobacco farmers and their communities.\n  After nearly four weeks of Senate debate on this bill, however, the \nbill currently before us has lost its focus and falls well short of a \nreasonable resolution of the issues involved here. In fact, it actually \nundermines the original goals of the legislation. And with as little \ndiscernible benefit to the public health in the legislation as it \ncurrently stands, I cannot support a bill which unfairly places too \nheavy a burden on too many people I was sent here to represent.\n  First, this legislation currently places no limits on the liability \nof tobacco companies. While I understand the desire of many of my \ncolleagues to punish the companies for their past behavior, the fact of \nthe matter is that a liability cap is needed to entice consent from the \ncompanies to modify their speech and limit their advertising and \nmarketing practices.\n  Second, this legislation now contains tax and spending measures which \nhave nothing to do with the underlying purpose of reducing teen \nsmoking. By approving amendments to add tax relief and anti-drug \nspending to the bill, we have usurped valuable funds for medical \nresearch and public health efforts to combat teen smoking as well as \nput in jeopardy funds for tobacco farmers, tobacco workers and their \ncommunities as they transition into a new era.\n  Third, this legislation relies on highly regressive taxes to \naccomplish its goals rather than individual responsibility. If raising \nthe price of cigarettes by $1.10 a pack was the only way to tackle the \nproblem of teen tobacco use, I would not hesitate to assess it. But I \ndon't believe that is the case. In my view, there is too little \ncertainty on the question of what will actually stop teens from smoking \nto assess such a large and regressive tax on adults. Since only 2% of \nthe cigarettes purchased are actually used by children, I would prefer \na much more precise approach than a tax on the other 98%, particularly \nwhen that tax disproportionately affects lower income individuals. A \nmuch better approach in my view is to enhance marketing and advertising \nrestrictions, toughen retail enforcement, and make adolescents more \naccountable for the decisions that they make, like taking away their \ncar keys if they use tobacco products.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I said from the outset that I was not only \nwilling to support a tobacco bill but believed it was in the best \ninterests of the country to resolve these issues. I applaud the \nPresident for his leadership on the issue as well as our colleagues who \nhave worked in good faith to create a fair and effective bill. But this \nbill, as it currently stands, has become a patchwork of initiatives \nthat are entirely unrelated to the issues surrounding tobacco and teen \nsmoking. For this reason, I cannot in good conscience lock in the \ncurrent provisions of this bill by voting for cloture. I sincerely \nbelieve that this body has the ability and the desire to craft a piece \nof legislation that is both an effective tool in the fight to reduce \nteen smoking as well as an effective resolution of all issues \nsurrounding tobacco.\n  I don't intend to give up on resolving these difficult issues and I \nlook forward to working with those colleagues who sincerely want a \nbill, not just an issue.\n  I believe we can and will succeed in due course.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I believe the Senate should act on \nlegislation to address the problem of teen tobacco addiction, but am \ntroubled by the tax and spend aspects of the legislation as it now \nstands. I support an approach that is closer to the agreement reached \nby the states attorneys-general a year ago this week. That agreement \ncombined tough restrictions on advertising and a commitment by the \nstates to address teen tobacco use.\n  I have worked with Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and other Senators to \nco-sponsor legislation codifying the attorneys-general agreement. Our \nlegislation is a responsible and credible effort to achieve the goal we \nall share: ending smoking by underage youth. If we cut off debate on \nthe McCain tobacco legislation, the rules of the Senate would prevent \ndebate on the Hatch bill or any other responsible alternative. I cannot \nsupport that. Therefore, I will vote against cloture.\n  We will have other opportunities during the 105th Congress to \nconsider alternatives to the McCain bill. I intend to work hard to pass \nlegislation that includes voluntary restrictions on industry \nadvertising to young people and a substantial commitment to smoking \ncessation programs for minors.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I reserve the balance of our time.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. How much time remains on both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Six minutes remain for the Senator from \nOklahoma. Five minutes 50 seconds remain for the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield to the Senator from Missouri 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, this bill may be about tobacco and about \nsmoking, but I think it is more about a smokescreen. Constantly, it is \nsuggested that this is a bill which penalizes tobacco, but the tax \nfalls upon the American people. There is a specific provision in this \nbill that requires that the $868 billion assessment goes to the \nconsumer. Sixty percent of those people earn less than $30,000 a year \nand 44 percent earn less than $10,000 a year.\n  This is not a hit on the tobacco companies for that money. There is a \nrequirement in the bill that the money be collected from these hard-\nworking, low-income Americans. This is a massive tax on low-income \nAmericans, and it is used to proliferate the bureaucracy of this \nGovernment--17 new boards, commissions, and agencies, and hundreds of \nnew functions and responsibilities.\n  It is time for us to say no. When it comes to a habit that needs to \nbe broken, the tax-and-spend habit of the\n\n[[Page S6478]]\n\nU.S. Congress must be broken. Here it is time for Congress to break the \nhabit. That $868 billion in new taxes that will be focused upon hard-\nworking Americans to fund Government programs, including a $350 million \nannual disbursement to foreign countries to conduct studies of smoking, \nis not what the American people expect.\n  This is tax and spend. This is Government bureaucracy. It is time for \nus to stop and give the American people tax relief instead of the kind \nof burden that this bill imposes.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. President, let's understand very clearly what is happening here. \nTo use the word ``tax'' is to use the word that has been the \ncenterpiece of a billion-dollar advertising campaign. If this is a tax, \nthis is the one tax in America that nobody has to pay--nobody--unless \nyou buy a pack of cigarettes. This is a tax that is purely voluntary, \nand the countertax is the tax that millions of Americans pay for the \ncost of people who do smoke, who get sick--all of America pays the tax \nfor those who smoke. The tax that our kids pay is a tax called dying--\n30 percent of those who smoke. And those who started since this debate \nbegan are going to die as a result of this habit, and the Senate today \nis refusing to do something about that.\n  Now, every time that a Republican bill has come to the floor of the \nSenate this year, it has been accompanied by a cloture motion that the \nmajority leader joined in and was prepared to set up a structure in \norder to close debate. This is the first bill that has gone on for 3\\1/\n2\\ weeks. Not one Democrat amendment--not one--has added a penny to the \ncost of this bill.\n  We are going to give a new definition to hypocrisy in the U.S. Senate \ntoday, because the very people who brought us the marriage penalty \nbreak, who brought us the drug program, the very people who brought us \nthe additions of every penny in this bill are going to come to the \nfloor today and say, point of order, Mr. President, forget about the \nkids, we are going to turn around and tube the entire tobacco bill no \nmatter what we did before. It was a Republican amendment on each one of \nthose efforts. Not one Democrat amendment has added a penny to this \nbill. That is critical.\n  I yield 30 seconds to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, around this building now there is that army \nof high-priced tobacco lobbyists who are getting ready to celebrate \ntonight. It looks like the tobacco industry is going to win a big round \nin this fight. The children lose. The powerful will beat out the \npowerless.\n  But this fight is going to have other rounds. And to those who think \nthat the Senators who are trying to protect the kids are going to give \nup today, I ask, ``What are you smoking?'' The health of millions of \nour kids is worth a long, hot summer of debate in this Capitol. Get \nready for it, folks.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, what time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 4 minutes 5 \nseconds, and the Senator from Massachusetts has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I yield the Senator from Washington 1\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, a year ago on Saturday, the attorneys \ngeneral of most of the States of the United States reached an agreement \nwith the tobacco companies. Those attorneys general understood that in \norder to have real control over tobacco sales and advertising such an \nagreement needed to be reached. Members of this body have never \nunderstood the fundamental fact that without that agreement, the basic \nrestrictions on advertising, on look-backs, and on the like are \nblatantly unconstitutional.\n  As a result, we have a bill before us that is unconstitutional, \nsteals the money that the States' attorneys general earned for \nthemselves, and provides no incentives for tobacco companies to operate \nresponsibly.\n  If we reject it, either we will get out of the hot rhetoric of this \nbody with a small group who came up with a responsible bill, or the \nStates will go ahead themselves. People will be protected. They were \nprotected by the States, in the first place. They will be protected by \nthe States if we fail to act responsibly. This bill is not remotely \nresponsible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just point out that the very thing \nhe just called for they voted against, bringing in industry. They came \nin and took away the cap. Each time there is something they want, they \ntake it away and use it as an excuse to kill the bill.\n  I yield 35 seconds to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the fact is there are no new bureaucracies \nin this bill. Those have been taken out. Our friends on the other side \ntalk about taxes. They talk not at all about the taxes that are being \nimposed on every American to pay for the costs that are imposed on \nsociety by the use of this industry's products. This is a defining \nmoment.\n  The question is, Are we going to protect kids or are we going to \nprotect the profits of the tobacco industry?\n  The estimates by the experts are that this legislation would save 1 \nmillion children's lives. The costs for the reduction in industry \nprofits are $4 billion.\n  That is the question before the Members of this body. Do we protect \nour kids' lives or do we protect the profits of the tobacco industry?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gorton). Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the Senator from Tennessee 1 \nminute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I think that the premises on which this \nlegislation began were faulty. And I think they still are.\n  I think it is basically the premise that in order for us to express \nour hatred for the tobacco companies and in order for us to express our \nlove for our children, we must pass a tax increase in excess of $800 \nbillion a year over a 25-year period, which is three times our annual \ndefense budget.\n  That, Mr. President, is a faulty premise. It is based on the faulty \npremise that we can raise taxes and raise the price of cigarettes to a \npoint that it will discourage youth smoking; we can raise it high \nenough to do that but not so high as to create a black market. I \nunderstand that one out of every five packs of cigarettes sold in the \nState of California today are black-market cigarettes. It is based upon \nthe premise that if you will raise prices of cigarettes that the youth \nof America will substantially decrease smoking, even though there is no \nevidence to indicate that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 50 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 45 seconds to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, when I was a little girl, my mother used \nto tell me about my grandfather, who I never met, because he died very \nyoung from a smoking-related illness. I heard about how wonderful he \nwas. And my mother, I remember her saying almost every day of my life, \n``Don't smoke. Don't smoke.'' Little did I know then that I would have \na chance to do something to turn this epidemic around. And what happens \ntonight? We are sitting here and are going to see those on the other \nside kill a chance to make a difference by killing a bill that people \nare going to continue to die from. It is as simple as that.\n  I just want to say I watched those amendments that were loaded on. \nThose were amendments from the other side of the aisle, which they said \nthey had to have to vote for a bill. Now they don't even vote for a \nbill. That shows you the power of the tobacco companies.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 33 seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \nthe cloture vote. We have already had three\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\ncloture votes. This is going to be the fourth. This is our fourth week \non this legislation. If cloture is invoked, I guess we will probably \nspend another 2 or 3 weeks on this legislation and not do the work of \nthe Senate.\n\n  Why should we get rid of this bill for the time being? I heard one of \nmy colleagues say that there are no new programs in this bill. That is \nnot correct. There are lots of new programs in this bill. We don't have \na current international tobacco control awareness program that gets \n$350 million a year for the next 5 years, and then ``as such sums as \nare necessary.'' That is in this bill. We presently don't have a \ntobacco farmer quota payment of $1.6 billion per year that is going to \nmake some tobacco farmers multimillionaires. That is not current law. \nIt would be if this bill became law. We don't have a situation right \nnow that gives advantages to one cigarette company over another one. \nUnder this bill, some companies have an increase in price of at least \n$1.10. Some have zero. Some we increase the price of smokeless tobacco \nby 80-some cents; others, only 50-some cents. That is in this bill.\n  There are lots of reasons to be against this bill. This bill \nprohibits smoking in buildings that are engaged in international \ntraffic and international trade--far greater than any restriction on \nany Federal building. This bill goes way too far. If we vote cloture--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask for 1 minute of the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If we invoke cloture, we will not have the ability for a \nsubstitute. Senator Hatch has a substitute with Senator Feinstein. It \nwill not be offered. The Gramm amendment won't be offered and couldn't \nbe offered.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on cloture. If we have a point \nof order, every dime of this bill is above the budget, the budget the \nPresident agreed to with bipartisan Members of Congress last year. \nClearly, a budget point of order should be sustained. This bill is \nabove the budget. It breaks the budget. It is a violation of the budget \nagreement which the President agreed to with Members of Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on cloture and then to sustain \nthe budget point of order.\n  I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. I ask that the 1 \nminute be restored to our side of the aisle which was taken from the \nleader's time on the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that I also have 1 minute of our \nleader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield the 1 minute remaining of the time in the original \nagreement to the Senator from North Dakota, and I reserve the remainder \nof the time for myself.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there are two lessons that we are learning \nhere today: First, money talks; second, the tobacco companies have \nmoney and kids don't.\n  We have heard people say this is an issue of taxing and spending. Of \ncourse it isn't. They are trying to change the subject. The issue is \nvery simple. When the roll is called, the question is, Who do you stand \nfor? Do you stand for the tobacco companies or do you come and stand on \nthe side of kids? If you stand for the tobacco companies, understand \nthis: If enough of you do it, and you prevail, this issue is not over. \nIt is coming back and back and back again, and eventually enough \nSenators will stand for the interests of kids and the interests of \npreventing teen smoking in this country. And we will prevail.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say quickly, with respect to \nthe chart that was shown, there are almost no new programs in this. \nThose were existing programs. Most importantly, there is only one \nboard. The flimflam artistry of this is really political. The Speaker \nof the House and the House of Representatives do not want a vote on \nthis bill. They fear this bill. Newt Gingrich has had a contract out on \nthis bill. And the Republicans on this side, this afternoon, are going \nto be the ``hit people'' for that contract because they fear voting for \nthis bill. They have said they won't take it up.\n  Every amendment that came to the floor that has changed this and that \nhas supposedly weighted it down are by the very Members who today will \nvote against this bill because it is weighted down. This bill is a bill \nthat sought to do what 19 members of the Commerce Committee approved. \nWe didn't raise the tax; that fact was agreed to in raising the price \nof cigarettes by the companies themselves. That price wasn't even \nraised on the floor of the Senate. The Democrat amendment failed.\n  So what we have here is a choice between kids or the tobacco \ncompanies--kids or the tobacco companies.\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the motion has expired. By \nunanimous consent, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the \nSenate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the committee \n     substitute to Calendar No. 353, S. 1415, regarding tobacco \n     reform.\n         Senators Trent Lott, John McCain, Ben Nighthorse \n           Campbell, James Inhofe, Christopher Bond, Gordon Smith, \n           Robert Bennett, Joe Biden, Ted Stevens, Richard Shelby, \n           Mike DeWine, Kent Conrad, John Glenn, Tom Harkin, John \n           Kerry, and Frank Murkowski.\n\n\n                            Call of the Roll\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the quorum call under \nthe rule is waived.\n\n\n                                  Vote\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate \nthat debate on the committee substitute amendment to S. 1415, the \nUniversal Tobacco Settlement Act, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSpecter) is absent because of illness.\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 57, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 161 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Byrd\n     Chafee\n     Cleland\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Moynihan\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Roth\n     Sarbanes\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Coverdell\n     Craig\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Ford\n     Gorton\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kempthorne\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Specter\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the ayes are 57, the nays are \n42. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from Alaska is to be \nrecognized, but the Senate must be in order. Will the Senators in the \naisles engaged in conversation take their conversations elsewhere.\n  The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the tobacco \nbill violates section 302 of the Budget Act as a result of exceeding \nthe committee's spending allocation.\n  The bill violates section 302, but I will highlight problems with the \nsubstitute.\n\n[[Page S6480]]\n\n  In my judgment, the substitute is vulnerable to a point of order \nunder section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as \namended. Section 302(f) provides a point of order against legislation \nthat would cause the spending allocation of the Committee reporting the \nbill to be exceeded. The bill was reported from the Committee on \nCommerce, Science and Transportation and the direct spending contained \nin this bill exceeds that Committee's allocation.\n  As a matter of fact, the bill and the substitute violate section \n302(f) in a multitude of provisions.\n  For example, the substitute contains a State Litigation Settlement \naccount. Amounts allocated to the account would be automatically \nappropriated and available for grants to States. Once again, the \nAppropriations Committee's jurisdiction will be reduced and not subject \nto annual allocation. CBO estimates new spending of between $5 and $6 \nbillion per year from this account.\n  The substitute would prohibit the sale of cigarettes in vending \nmachines and provides for paying the owners of cigarette vending \nmachines (other than machines that could be used for other products) an \namount equal to the fair-market value of the machines before the \nprohibition (section 1262). The legislation states that such payments \nwould be subject to appropriation, but other provisions make it likely \nthat the government would be required to make the promised payments \neven if discretionary appropriations are not provided. CBO estimates \nnew spending of a billion dollars per year from this account over the \nFY 2000-2002 period.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator making a point of order or is \nhe debating?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I did make it, yes, against the bill.\n  The substitute includes two titles that provide spending from a \nFarmers Assistance Allocation account established in the bill. \nAccording to CBO both title X and title XV would provide direct \nspending authority. CBO estimates that title X would increase direct \nspending by $18 billion over the 1999-2008 period and that title XV \nwould increase direct spending by a billion dollars in 2009 and by half \na billion dollars annually from 2010 through 2023.\n  The substitute contains additional provisions that would cause \nadditional direct spending. These provisions would require Medicare to \npay for a demonstration project of cancer care (section 455), Medicaid \nto cover tobacco cessation products, (section 221). In addition, the \nbill would prohibit the Federal Government from recovering any of the \npayments made to States under this legislation as overpayments of \nMedicaid costs to the States (section 451(a)(5)).\n  I believe the point of order is valid. I yield the remainder of the \ntime to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                     MOTION TO WAIVE THE BUDGET ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I move to waive the Budget Act for the \nbill, the committee substitute, and the pending Gramm motion to \nrecommit.\n  What is the parliamentary order, given our unanimous consent \nagreement? How much time is on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes equally divided, five minutes to a \nside, to debate the motion to waive.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the motion \nto waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield myself a couple of minutes, and then yield the \nremainder of the time to the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts \nand the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. President, let there be no misunderstanding what it is we are \ndoing here. This is one more effort to kill this bill. If it wasn't \ndead the first time, they are going to try to ensure that on the second \nshot it dies. That is what this is about.\n  I think it would be much better if we just voted it up or down, yes \nor no. Instead, some of our colleagues on the other side are hiding in \nthe rocks. They want to shoot and kill that bill so nobody knows who it \nwas who killed it.\n  Well, this will kill it pure and simple, and it is a cynical approach \nto killing it, because it is an amazing demonstration, in my view, of \npolitical juxtaposition here that the very Senators who will vote to \nkill it by not supporting the waiver on the point of order are the very \nSenators who offered the amendments on taxes and on drugs and on the \nother amendments that brought us to this point. The very Senators who \nsaid we have to have a tax bill, we have to have a drug bill, we have \nto have all these other amendments added before we can support this \nlegislation are now going to vote not to waive the point of order to \nbring the bill down.\n  So I hope there is no misunderstanding about what is at stake here. \nWe are going to kill this bill tonight. I should say they are going to \nkill this bill tonight. But they are going to try to use this ruse of \nsaying, now that we have loaded it up, it is too heavy; now that we \nhave loaded it up, we can't afford to carry it further.\n  Mr. President, that is a disappointment. The fact remains that this \nbill dies tonight, but the issue will live. And some day in the not too \ndistant future, we will pass tobacco legislation that will rectify what \nwe are doing tonight. This is wrong. I hope nobody misunderstands what \nthis vote is about. They killed the bill tonight by voting not to waive \nthis point of order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has time yielded \nby the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the Senator from Alaska has yielded me \ncontrol of the time, and I will manage the time. I yield myself 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes at this point.\n  Mr. President, let me make a point first for everybody here. The \nBudget Act which was passed, with Republicans voting for it and three \nDemocrats, the budget resolution, did three things that we have already \nforgotten about.\n  One, it provided a $15.5 billion increase for NIH over the baseline, \nover the President's request; $15.5 billion without this bill goes to \nNIH for cancer research and the kind of things this bill is supposed to \ndo.\n  Secondly, the budget resolution provided $800 million--eight-tenths \nof a billion dollars--for teen smoking cessation. The President of the \nUnited States asked for less than that.\n  The same budget resolution provides $5 billion for child care, and we \nare up here debating a bill to impose over the next 25 years $998 \nbillion worth of new taxes, and we are talking like we haven't done \nanything in these areas that the very bill before us says we are \nsupposed to do.\n  Frankly, whether the other side is saying we killed this bill or not, \nI guarantee you, the bill was subject to a point of order before any of \nthe amendments were attached. So an argument that Republicans added \namendments and thus made it subject to a point of order is--it is \nsubject to at least five points of order, and, as a matter of fact, the \nunderlying bill is subject to the worst of all points of order. It \nkills the bill. That is how bad the bill is in terms of budgets. It \nkills the bill. We didn't make that point of order. The point of order \nthat was made is one that says it goes back to the committee and they \nreconsider.\n  Let me tell you, when you work on budgets and you all vote and you \nwant to restrain Government spending, all the Budget Act says to you, \nonce you made the deal and said this is the budget, if you want to \nviolate it, you can. It does not say you cannot. It says you can. But \nyou need 60 votes.\n\n  That is what this argument is about. If you want to say we ought to \npass this bill, it violates the Budget Act. It has far more spending \nthan we agreed to spend. And let me tell you, another portion of this \njust absolutely says, here are the caps, the spending restraints, and \nwe just do not care about them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has used----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield myself a half a minute.\n  We say the taxes do not count as taxes--that is what the bill says--\nand the expenditures do not count as expenditures. Now, how in the \nworld\n\n[[Page S6481]]\n\ncould that not be subject to the Budget Act if we have any kind of \nbudget restraint at all? So that is the issue. The issue is: Do you \nproceed with the bill or do you send it back to committee and let them \ntry to fix it so it does not violate the Budget Act, which we spent 20 \nyears developing around here to get our house in order? And all of a \nsudden, over 25 years, $998 billion worth of new revenues and \nexpenditures are supposed to be forgotten about.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 43 seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. President, since 1995, we have voted to waive the Budget Act 105 \ntimes. Now, we have heard debate here on the floor of the Senate for \n3\\1/2\\ weeks, and $40 million has been spent telling America there is a \ntax increase in here. Nineteen members of the Commerce Committee--19 to \n1--voted to send this bill to the floor of the Senate with a $1.10 \nprice increase in it. That is the revenue that is raised by this bill.\n  The Senator from New Mexico does not tell you that every single penny \nthat is contemplated to be spent in this bill is offset--it is offset. \nIt was the Republican leader who put into this bill the Lugar amendment \nthat competes with the Ford amendment, which everybody knows has to be \nresolved one way or the other before this bill could finally be signed \ninto law.\n  So this is a charade. This is a charade. We have all learned that you \ncan always find an excuse and a way to use the Budget Act to accomplish \nyour goals.\n  But if you measure what has happened here, there was an effort by \nDemocrats to raise the price. It failed. That should have helped the \nbill pass. There was an effort to have a cap on the damages, but it was \na Republican Senator who brought the amendment to get rid of it. And \nmore Republicans voted to get rid of that cap restraint than Democrats. \nOnce again, the Republicans had their hand and their way.\n  Then there was the look-back amendment. It made it tougher on the \ntobacco companies, holding them accountable in reducing the level of \nsmoking for kids. If you are interested in stopping kids from smoking, \nthat was an amendment that made this bill better.\n  There was a child care amendment. All it did was restrict spending \nthat was already in the bill. It was no new addition of one penny. It \ntook restricted money, already restricted to the Governors, and it \nsimply restricted within the pot of money that was already restricted \nsomewhat further. No add-on of new money. Not one penny was added on by \none Democrat amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 2 minutes have expired.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty seconds.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is a choice between tobacco--and $40 \nmillion spent to advertise a tax increase--and a choice between kids; \nand everybody in the country will understand that.\n  I yield the balance of the time to the Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have \nthe same time available to us on this side as the distinguished Senator \nfrom New Mexico had, which would have added about a half a minute or \nso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. You have already had more.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair charged time to the Senator from \nAlaska and the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask consent we add a minute to the----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would object unless we get time equal \nto all the time used by--I reserve the right to object.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what is the present situation in terms \nof time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The situation is, the Senator has about 20 \nseconds left.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In 20 seconds, Mr. President, what we have seen \ntonight is a charade. What they did was spread DDT here. First delay, \nthen destroy, then terminate any action on tobacco. That is the \nmission. This Budget Act is not--is not--violated. Everything here is \npaid for. And I hope that we will vote to waive the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 40 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Forty seconds?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty seconds.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I object. You have 40 seconds left? No objection. You \nasked for a half minute, and went over.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the 40 seconds to Senator Nickles.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, the question is really, Do we have a \nbudget or not? This bill says the budget does not apply. Read page 181. \nIt says, ``the amount of * * * appropriations shall not be included in \nthe estimates required under section 251 of [the Budget Act]. In other \nwords, all these hundreds of billions of dollars of spending are over \nand above the budget that we agreed to, that the President agreed to.\n  This clearly breaks the budget. If we are going to have a budget, we \nshould sustain it. This point of order is well made. And I urge my \ncolleagues to support it and vote against the motion to waive the \nBudget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on agreeing to the motion \nto waive the Congressional Budget Act. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.

The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will be managing the bill for the \nmajority and the Subcommittee of Appropriations on Energy and Water \nDevelopment. I understand that the minority will not consent to any \namendments being laid down tonight. So we will just have opening \nstatements, and then I gather we will take the matter up at the \nearliest opportunity in the morning and proceed until we finish.\n  I might suggest, unless there are some amendments I am unaware of--\nand that could be the case--that there is a real possibility that we \ncould finish this bill tomorrow. We would very much like to do that. \nThat would mean Thursday night we would finish. If that doesn't happen, \nthen we may have a complication with reference to the manager and \nranking member, which might carry the bill over for a considerable \nnumber of days.\n  I want to give a few opening remarks about the bill. First, I thank \nmy ranking member, Senator Reid. This is a very difficult bill and, in \nmany respects, contains some very, very serious, substantive matters \nfor America and some very important defense policies with reference to \nnuclear weapons, our stockpile, and the like. We have worked very \nhandily together, and I am proud of the bill we have before us.\n  This bill was reported unanimously by the Committee on Appropriations \nlast Thursday and was filed on Friday. It has been available to \nSenators since Monday.\n  The committee recommendation provides a total of $20.9 billion in \nbudget authority. Of that, $12 billion is defense and $8.9 billion is \nnondefense. Especially within the nondefense allocation, the committee \nhas struggled to craft a recommendation that meets the Senate's \nexpectations. The President's request for water projects was $1.8 \nbillion below the level required to continue ongoing construction \nprojects at their optimal level. If we were to truly fix that problem \nto provide the level of funding of water projects Congress envisioned \nwhen it enacted the Water Resources Development Act of 1998, which the \nPresident signed, and last year's Energy and Water Development Act, \nwhich the President signed, the committee would have to shift $1.8 \nbillion from other programs within nondefense, which is only $8.9 \nbillion of the entire bill. We would have to move that to the Corps of \nEngineers and the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  Now, Mr. President, when the President of the United States decided \nto reduce water projects by $1.8 billion, let me suggest that these are \nflood protection projects in many, many States. These are dams and \nreservoirs that have been under construction. These consist of work on \nchanneling our ports. And, yes, there is money that was obligated to \nbuild our ports so that they could continue to carry the vast commerce \nthat comes in and out of the United States through these ports.\n  Much of the port activity--draining and the like, dredges--is paid \nfor by the Federal Government. And the President decided that he had \npriorities in water, and he wanted us to pay for those and give \ndramatic increases. But when it came to all those projects that are all \nover our country that other Members appropriated last year and that the \nPresident signed, those were knocked out.\n  Mr. President, that is just not the way to do business. It is all \nright if the President wants to cut things, but to do it like that and \nthen ask for his special projects to be increased as if they are the \nonly ones that are deserving of any increase, and all the rest of our \nStates and our ports of entry are supposed to be cut, just doesn't make \nsense.\n  So, actually, we are going to have a little difficulty when we go to \nconference in that part of the bill which is called nondefense. That \nincludes water projects, plus nondefense research projects within the \nDepartment of Energy--some very important research projects.\n  That much of a reduction would be impossible to impose on the \nDepartment of Energy's science, energy, research, and environmental \nmanagement programs. Fortunately, to reduce our need to cut these \nprograms, Chairman Stevens provided the Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee with $238 million in nondefense budget authority above a \nfreeze.\n  The committee recommendation is to use all of that increase and an \nadditional $211 million taken from a freeze level within the Department \nof Energy to add to water projects. I just explained why he wants to do \nthat. Even at that, Senators have been very understanding, because it \nmeans two things for all the Senators and their projects. We have been \nable to provide between 60 percent and 70 percent of the optimal \nfunding level for water project construction, and our baseline for the \nDepartment of Energy was a freeze, and we had to go below that.\n  As an example, the administration proposed a $90 million increase, \n$26 million over last year, for solar and renewable energy. We are \nworking with two of our Senators who want to amend what we have done in \nthis bill. Let me just explain what we have done.\n  Regardless of any individual's view on solar and renewable energy, \nthe subcommittee does not have resources to provide the kind of \nincrease that the President had in mind. The recommendation for solar \nand energy is a $780,000 reduction from the current level--that is what \nwe have in our bill--and that is because we have to cut below a freeze \nin this part of this bill.\n  As usual, the subcommittee has received requests for thousands of \nindividual projects. To the best of our ability, we have tried to \ninclude those in the water area where requests were generally well \nfounded requests to provide adequate funding for ongoing projects. \nUnfortunately, because the reductions apply to DOE's nondefense \nprogram, there is very little flexibility to add projects within \nbudgets that are already being cut.\n  For a specific recommendation--but before I do that--I am not sure \nthat I will deliver my entire summary--I want to yield the floor and \nask if my ranking member desires to make some comments at this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as ranking member of this subcommittee, I \nrecommend this bill to my colleagues.\n  I first of all want to say that we hear so much in the press about \nthe partisan nature of this Congress. And there is, I think, in the \nminds of most everyone too much partisanship. But I think the \nAppropriations Committee is a place to look to see bipartisanship, to \nsee a model as to how we can get along to make progress. This bill is a \nbill that was done on a bipartisan basis. The ranking member, I, and \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, the senior Senator from New Mexico, \nhave worked very hard to come up with a bill that is the most just and \nfair bill we could come up with.\n  This is a very important bill. It deals with many different aspects \nof our society. We realize the importance of this legislation. The \nchairman and the ranking member, as a result of that, have worked very \nclosely together. We have a harmonious relationship between ourselves \nand our staffs.\n  I repeat, the two Members operate this subcommittee. I extend my arm \nof friendship to my senior colleague, the chairman of this \nsubcommittee, who has been very forthright. I have been included in all \nthe meetings with Cabinet officials and others to come up with this \nbill.\n  But I also say to the administration that we have a constitutional \nform of government. We have to protect the legislative aspect of this \nseparation of powers document. The administration did not, in my \nopinion, treat us fairly with this bill. As a result of this, because \nwe have broad and equal say in what goes on in this country as a \nlegislative branch, we step forth and rearrange the priorities of this \nbill. We did it in a way that protects ongoing projects that are \nessential to various parts of this country.\n  We feel that we have come up with something that is fair and that is \nreasonable. There are programs that have been itemized for projects and \nactivities of the Department of Energy, the Corps of Engineers, Bureau \nof Reclamation, and other independent agencies.\n\n  I repeat that I support the approximately $21 billion in \nappropriations to this Senate. I recommend this to the Senate as a \nwhole.\n  I can't overemphasize the fiscal tension between these programs that \nwe worked to make a balance. The Department of Energy, the Corps of \nEngineers, the Bureau of Reclamation recognize some of it.\n  On the defense side of this bill, there is a very close, important \nrelationship\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\nthat we have with the security of this country. Some of these programs \nare relatively nondiscretionary, since we must provide for the \nstockpile stewardship management program, defense environmental \nmanagement, and the naval reactor program.\n  I repeat, the chairman and I have worked very hard to find a balance \nin this bill and recognize this bill is far from perfect, but it is the \nbest that two human beings could do to balance the separate interests--\nthe hundreds and hundreds of requests that we get from the 98 other \nSenators. So we have not accommodated everyone's priorities--not every \nState's priorities or the projects--but we have done the very best that \nwe could.\n  Mr. President, the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of \nReclamation:\n  It is no secret that the budget request sent to us by the President \nwould have increased some solar and renewable activities while \ndevastating the Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation \nprojects. But everyone should understand that we did an excellent job, \nin my opinion, with solar and renewable. We are willing to bring at the \nright time solar-renewable up to last year's limit. That will be very \ndifficult to do. But we will do that. But we have taken pretty good \ncare of other programs. We have done a good job of increasing the \nhydrogen aspect. That is very important. We have done a good job with \nwind energy.\n  So I don't really apologize to anyone for the work that we have done \nin this bill. I don't apologize for what we have done with the tools we \nhave with solar-renewable activities.\n  Mr. President, we hear a lot about water projects as if there is \nsomething wrong with a water project because the term ``project'' is \nconnected to it. But let's talk about some. I am going to pick at \nrandom some of the water projects in this bill and indicate to this \nbody and to anyone within the sound of my voice why these projects are \nimportant.\n  Take a place in North Dakota. Mr. President, North Dakota doesn't \nhave a lot of people. I don't know if it is the State with the smallest \nnumber of people in it in this Union or not. But, if not, it is one of \nthe smallest. North Dakota doesn't come to us with a large \ncongressional delegation, but we felt, in fairness to the people of \nthat small State, that we should do something about an act of nature \nthat devastated a place called Devil's Lake. That certainly is a name \nthat is appropriate because that lake is unending in spreading out over \nthat part of the country. We have put money into this for flood control \nprojects in North Dakota. We have, for example, $8 million for \nconstruction of another outlet on Devil's Lake. This is important \nbecause that lake just continues to grow. Never in recorded history has \nthis lake been the size that it is, wiping out highways, people's \nfarms, people's homes. That is one of the projects in this bill.\n\n  In the Mississippi delta region, Davis Pond, LA, this is a pond that \ndiverts fresh water from the Mississippi to the coastal bays and \nmarshes, but also mitigates any negative environmental impacts of \nfreshwater diversion. It is a large project, $16 million, essential to \nthat very important part of that country.\n  Mr. President, I have traveled in California to look at the \nCalifornia bay-delta. I didn't do a very good job of looking at it \nbecause El Nino got in the way. The rains were torrential, and I wasn't \nable to see very much.\n  The State of California has 33 million people. This project, which we \nwere very generous in funding last year, and this will be the second \nyear, is said by most people to be the most important environmental \nproject in this country ongoing today. This bill has $65 million it \nadded to some $85 million we put in last year. I think that was the \nnumber. But it is so important to that massive State to try to get \nthings under control out there. We have environmental interests. We \nhave agricultural interests. We have big cities. We have little cities, \nmany different problems that we have there, and these people are all \nsitting down and talking about it. This is our recognition that \nprogress is being made.\n  There is something in here that I am sure some of the press will \nfocus on--what could this be--aquatic plant control. This is a strange-\nsounding name. Why should there be any money put in this? I wish we \ncould appropriate ten times more money than the $4 million we put in \nthis because it is badly needed. This $4 million is so important \nbecause we have aquatic plants which can and do hinder navigation. They \nundermine flood-control efforts. They threaten agriculture and public \nhealth.\n  Now, you have, for example, in Lake Champlain, VT, a problem with \nsomething called the water chestnut and Eurasian Milfoil. State and \nlocal governments are desperate for help because these plants are \ninvasive. They are interfering with the lives of the people of Vermont \nand that part of the country.\n  We have in the western part of the United States a tree that was \nimported to stop the erosion of banks and rivers and streams. These \nthings, called salt cedar trees or tamarisks, are literally ruining \nstreams, agricultural ponds, rivers. We in Nevada, for example, have \nvery few rivers, and they are not powerful rivers. The only real \npowerful river we have is the Colorado, but on some of these smaller \nstreams this plant is devastating, ruining agriculture. So I wish we \ncould put a lot more money into this to help places like Lake Champlain \nand others throughout the United States.\n  Dredging of ports and harbors along the Atlantic and Pacific \ncoastlines, as well as the harbors in the Gulf of Mexico, no small task \nfor the Corps of Engineers. On an annual basis, U.S. ports and harbors \nhandle an estimated $600 billion in international cargo, generating \nover $150 million in tax revenue. So that is part of the responsibility \nin our bill, to make sure the ports in the Atlantic and Pacific and \nGulf of Mexico can handle their small navigation projects, totaling \nless than $10 million, but they are large navigation projects.\n  As an example, the New York and New Jersey channels need to be \ndeepened, dredging and other corps operations to permit commercial \nnavigation traffic through the complex river-harbor system they have. \nThese projects are funded in this bill at over $50 million. They are \nimportant to the literal survival of the commerce of New Jersey and New \nYork.\n\n  There are things in this bill on which we have to go forward, and it \nis not fair, in my opinion, that the administration cut back on these \nongoing projects. We just could not stop the projects.\n  So these kinds of projects have been priorities of Members and funded \nthrough nondefense dollars. This bill is as important as the defense \nauthorization bill and the defense appropriations bill which will come \nup for the security of this Nation. No question about that in my mind. \nWhile the allocations provided the subcommittee for the Army Corps of \nEngineers was higher than the President's request, it was still over \n$200 million less than last year's level.\n  Now, I want to say one other thing that I think is important, and \nagain I express my appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee. \nThe subcommittee mark has a section in the bill that reports and \naddresses the concerns about the management and regulatory oversight at \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission. As I stated in the markup before the \nfull committee, Senators Chafee and Baucus, who are the authorizing \nfull committee leaders of Environment and Public Works, do a good job, \nand we have requested and they have accepted the responsibility of \ntaking a look at some of the things going on at the NRC.\n  Again, I express my appreciation to the chairman of the subcommittee \nfor cooperating on this issue. We have a responsibility as the \nappropriators to make sure that the taxpayers' dollars that we \nappropriate are used fairly. I have a very, very strong feeling that it \nis topheavy at the NRC. I have talked to people there who believe it is \ntopheavy, too much management. We need to make sure there is an \nexamination of this commission so that there are more people to do the \nwork at the lower levels, and we do a good job of limiting management.\n  I thank the junior Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, for working \nwith us and whose efforts on behalf of the employees living in Maryland \nwere of great value as we reexamined the funding levels and language. \nThere are people who work there who need to make sure they are still \nthere able to do the work and we relieve a little of the dead weight, \nfrankly, at the higher\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\nlevels. This is something we need to revisit next year if this isn't \nresolved during this coming year.\n  Mr. President, we have the responsibility for the Nation's nuclear \nstockpile. I am not going to spend a lot of time on that tonight other \nthan to say the Senate has to realize that this is an awesome \nresponsibility we have, the chairman and the ranking member, to make \nsure there is adequate money to take care of our nuclear stockpile. We \nhave to make sure the nuclear stockpile we have is safe and reliable. \nWe no longer do underground testing, but we still have as large a \nresponsibility as we ever had to make sure our stockpile is safe and \nreliable. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is something that this \ncountry adheres to, but we go one step further than most countries; we \nmake sure the stockpile we have, I repeat, is safe and is reliable. \nThat is what we are trying to do with this bill, and $4.5 billion a \nyear is barely enough to do it. We can't have that cut down at all, or \nwe will have some significant problems in this country. We can't put \nthe nuclear genie back in the bottle. It is open. It is there, as \nindicated in the actions that have been taken by the countries of India \nand Pakistan. We have a responsibility, however, to make sure that we \nsafeguard our nuclear stockpile.\n\n  So I think we have done that in this bill. We have good teamwork \nbetween the laboratories and the Nevada Test Site. We have tried to \nmake a good balance there. I think we are looking at, also, some great \nscience that is being conducted in those national laboratories, which \nare a jewel this country has. These laboratories do the finest raw \nscience of any place in the world, and their job is only going to \nbecome more difficult now that we have stopped underground nuclear \ntesting.\n  It is going to become more difficult because they have to do it in \nways that only great scientific minds can do it. They are doing great \nthings right now with subcritical testing. That is, they will start a \ndevice and before it gets critical they stop it and, through \ncomputerization and the other means they have at their disposal, they \ngive us information as to what would have happened had that nuclear \nreaction gone critical. There are other things they are doing because \nof the need for further evaluation of these tests. Computerization is \ngoing to increase from present models as much as 1,000 times. So there \nis great science taking place as generated in this bill.\n  Again, I say this bill provides for some very important things for \nthis country, in the defense field and the domestic field. I repeat, it \nis not a perfect bill, but we did the best we could with the tools we \nwere given, and I recommend to the Members that we approve this just as \nquickly as possible. This will be the first appropriation bill in the \ncycle and we should get it to the President as quickly as possible. It \nis the first and, I think, if not the most important, one of the two or \nthree most important appropriations bills that we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to proceed for a few minutes and \nthen ask we move off of this bill and go into morning business.\n  Mr. President, within the Department of Energy's nondefense accounts \nwe have placed a priority on science. Our recommendation is only $44.9 \nmillion below the request, most of which is taken from prior year \nbalances that can be used to offset fiscal year 1999 expenses.\n  We are recommending proceeding with the construction of the \nSpallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. When it is \ncompleted, it will be one of America's most significant research tools, \nand it will add to the versatility and diversity of that great \nlaboratory.\n  We have also provided funds for the administration's requests for new \nnuclear energy programs and have provided a slight increase for the \nmagnetic fusion energy account, just enough to bring it up to current \nlevels. We provided three additional nuclear research programs that we \nbelieve are absolutely urgent.\n  The bill includes a total of $11.9 billion for the atomic energy \ndefense activities. That is $269 million below the budget request.\n  This bill contains $1.048 billion for defense facilities cloture \nprojects. The largest increase is $32 million for Rocky Flats, that \nproject which was significantly underfunded in the budget. Accelerated \ncleanup at Rocky Flats will save an estimated $1 billion, which would \nthen be available for other cleanup work. So it is important that the \nschedule at Rocky Flats be maintained as much as possible.\n\n  In other defense activities, one of my highest personal goals is to \ndestroy excess weapons plutonium in the United States and Russia. I \nbelieve it is the key to permanent nuclear arms control.\n  The administration is on a path to begin to fabricate into mixed-\noxide fuels, 3 tons of U.S. weapons plutonium per year and is \ntentatively working to aid Russia to fabricate 1.3 tons per year into \nmixed-oxide fuel. I think both countries should destroy in the order of \n10 tons per year. But more than that, we have to ensure that Russia \ndestroys at least as much weapons plutonium as we do because they have \nmany times as much as we do. Anything else amounts to unequal \ndisarmament.\n  So my recommendation is to provide for a full amount of the request, \nbut make a portion of it contingent upon bilateral accords which \nrequire at least equal conversion of weapons grade plutonium in the \nUnited States and the Soviet Union.\n  Mr. President, just one last closing remark, and perhaps we will have \nto talk about this more tomorrow. But I note, many Senators' offices \nhave had lobbyists come to see them about what is in this bill and what \nis now called Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship. Science-Based \nStockpile Stewardship is an American plan to use the highest of \nscience, technology and computers to measure the efficacy and \neffectiveness of our nuclear weapons; that is, to determine if they \nwill do what they are supposed to do, if they are safe, trustworthy and \nsound.\n  If someone wants to come to the floor and suggest the $4.46 billion \nwhich goes to this Science-Based Stockpile Stewardship should be \nreduced because it is a lot of money, let me just suggest when the \nUnited States of America decided that we would no longer do underground \ntesting, which is one of the methods to determine the validity of our \nnuclear weapons and of that stockpile--since we do not build any new \nones, we are only talking about old ones--if you want to return to \nunderground testing, you probably can get by with less money for \nScience-Based Stockpile Stewardship, because it takes the place, in a \nsense, of underground tests as part of the verification of the value of \nthe nuclear weapons, in terms of trustworthiness, accountability, and \nthe like.\n  So, for those who do not want to give the scientists and the \nlaboratory directors the tools so they can certify our supply of \nnuclear weapons every year to the President of the United States as \nrequired by law--first to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and then to \nthe President--if you don't want to give them the money to do that, \nthen let's have an amendment on the floor and see if we are going to \nreturn to underground testing. I do not believe anyone wants to do \nthat, at least not enough Senators. So we have to proceed doing it \nthrough science, through new ways to x-ray, in a sense, what is in \nthese weapons through computerization, which is going to be improved \ndramatically for America and the world as part of this process so we \ncan use the vast models and research capacity of computers to do this \njob.\n  The day may come when we do not have any nuclear weapons. But for \nnow, Russia still has a lot of nuclear weapons. Within the last month \nand a half, we have heard about two more nuclear powers. I believe that \nwe have to maintain ours in a solid, ready, trustworthy state, and \nreduce them as much as possible, consistent with the risks to the \nUnited States. That is the kinds of things in this bill--very, very \nimportant.\n  I must say, all of that money comes out of the Defense Department. \nSo, when you look at the defense moneys for America, you must \nunderstand that about $14 billion of it goes to this committee for the \nnuclear activities and the laboratories that produce and do the nuclear \nresearch for us, and for the maintenance of the stockpile. It is very \nimportant everybody understand that.\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\n That money cannot be spent anywhere else. It is subject to the walls \nthat we have put up around defense spending so you cannot spend it for \nnondefense work, you cannot spend it for water projects, and I am very, \nvery thankful you cannot. If those walls come down, you will see the \npressure for domestic spending eat away at defense needs, including the \ndefense needs as depicted in this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6481-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, today is a sad day for children across \nAmerica. Big tobacco companies with unlimited lobbying budgets and \nRepublicans in the Senate killed tobacco reform legislation. Kids lost \nand Joe Camel won. I am outraged at the message this sends: tobacco \nmoney is more important than children's health.\n  Almost four weeks ago, the Senate began debating a comprehensive \ntobacco bill aimed at reducing underage smoking and strengthening the \nrole of public health agencies to combat tobacco. Congress appeared \nunified in its intent to end the practice of tobacco companies preying \non our children. But some of my colleagues in the Senate got lost along \nthe way.\n  Since we started debate on tobacco legislation, more than 60,000 \nchildren have taken up this deadly addiction. But, this has not been \nthe focus of the debate on this legislation. In fact, if the American \npeople were watching the debate on the Senate floor they would be hard \npressed to determine what legislation we were actually debating. That's \nbecause the tobacco industry has spent $40 million to hijack the \nprocess and prevent Congress from acting. This is a tragic example of \nour political system at its worst.\n  We had an historic opportunity to enact comprehensive tobacco \nlegislation that would have mandated tobacco companies stop targeting \nour children. In one piece of legislation we could have saved five \nmillion children from suffering the ill effects of smoking or facing \npremature death. Those who acted to kill this legislation will have to \nanswer these five million children, who are now facing a death sentence \ndue to the actions of a few.\n  To those who think the state suits are a fall back position, they \nneed to know that these suits do not change the corporate culture of \ntobacco. The states litigate, and Congress legislates.\n  This is a sad day for those of us who have worked hard to advance the \ntobacco settlement. Throughout debate of this legislation, I voted to \nstrengthen the bill to protect our children and prevent the continued \ndeadly assault of tobacco companies.\n  As a parent, I have always been troubled by how tobacco companies \ntarget our children. When my son turned 14, he received a birthday card \nfrom a tobacco company inviting him to celebrate this milestone by \npurchasing cigarettes. They sent a child coupons for cigarettes as a \nbirthday gift. This is outrageous and unacceptable. These are kind of \ntactics that I have been fighting to end.\n  I will not let this set back today end my pursuit of big tobacco. I \nwill continue to stand up to tobacco companies. I will continue to work \nfor bipartisan, comprehensive tobacco legislation that is focused on \npublic health.\n  This is not the first time I have witnessed the power of the tobacco \nindustry or the hold that tobacco money has on many of the same members \nof the Senate. It is these very members who have used every tactic \nknown to delay, filibuster and load this bill down with so many \nunrelated items, that it is hard to remember what was in the original \nlegislation.\n  Every parent should be outraged. The U.S. Senate played politics with \nthe health and safety of children in America. Today's action says that \ntobacco money is more important than the health and safety of our \nchildren. Where are our priorities?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6485-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reported \nfor the week ending June 12 that the U.S. imported 8,862,000 barrels of \noil each day, 529,000 barrels a day less than the 9,391,000 imported \nduring the same week a year ago.\n  While this is one of the rare weeks when Americans imported slightly \nless foreign oil than the same week a year ago, Americans still relied \non foreign oil for 58.4 percent of their needs last week. There are no \nsigns that the upward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf War, \nthe United States imported about 45 percent of its oil supply from \nforeign countries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970s, foreign \noil accounted for only 35 percent of America's oil supply.\n  Politicians should give consideration to the economic calamity \ncertain to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our \nsupply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing \ninto the U.S.--now 9,532,000 barrels a day at a cost of approximately \n$99,431,640 a day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6485-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6485-S6486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WORLD DAY TO COMBAT DESERTIFICATION\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I would like to take just a few moments \nof the time of the Members to discuss a subject which I find probably \nno one has ever heard of but, nevertheless, is one of the very serious \nproblems facing the world. I wish my colleagues a Happy World Day to \nCombat Desertification.\n  I assume most Senators have never heard of this day, so let me \nexplain. June 17 was established as World Day to Combat Desertification \nto promote awareness of dryland degradation.\n  Few Americans today have an association with desertification. My \nparents and their contemporaries did: the great ``Dust Bowl'' that \noccurred in the western United States in the 1930s. Desertification is \ndefined as land degradation in arid and semi-arid areas resulting from \nclimatic variations and human activities. It can occur to such an \nextent that affected dryland can no longer sustain vegetation, crops, \nlivestock or the people who depend on them for survival. In the 1930s, \ndesertification forced farmers and their families off their land when \ntopsoil--and their livelihood--blew away. Vermont is not arid. But as \nan agricultural State, Vermonters were pained by the plight of western \nfarmers. The suffering of these farmers who became penniless migrants \nis still starkly visible in photos of the era.\n  Hopefully, the U.S. will never experience another ``Dust Bowl.'' We \nhave the expertise and resources to prevent such damage to U.S. \nagricultural lands. However, it threatens the way of life of one \nbillion people worldwide in underdeveloped countries. The economic \nconsequences of desertification are particularly devastating in regions \nthat are both underdeveloped and arid. In these regions, much of the \npopulation relies on subsistence agriculture. Subsistence farmers do \nnot have the means\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\nor incentives to make investments in proper land and water management. \nPoor land and water management, especially when combined with periodic \ndroughts, are the primary causes of desertification. Other factors \ninclude overcultivation, overgrazing, single-crop farming on fragile \nsoil, slash-and-burn land clearing methods, and improper irrigation \npractices. These factors are often compounded by unwise government \npolicies and the pressure of explosive population growth. When formerly \nproductive farm and pastoral land is degraded, it creates a downward \nspiral of poverty and rural out-migration--often to the already \novercrowded cities. We saw this during our own ``Dust Bowl.''\n  I was only a small child in the 1930s. I never met impoverished \nfarmers dislocated by the ``Dust Bowl.'' But I have witnessed first \nhand the effects of desertification in Indonesia and Africa. I saw \nfirst hand how hard farmers are fighting to hold on to arable land in \nthe face of huge environmental changes brought on by cutting of the \nrainforests or overgrazing of arid lands. And I saw the resulting \npoverty and dislocation that then grip these areas.\n  Through our foreign aid programs, we are assisting afflicted regions. \nBut we could use our resources more efficiently by joining 124 other \nnations in ratifying the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification in \nCountries Experiencing Serious Drought and /or Desertification, \nParticularly in Africa. As the Administration began to sharpen its \nfocus on Africa prior to the President's recent trip, it decided to \nmake U.S. ratification a priority. On the occasion of World Day to \nCombat Desertification, I urge my colleagues to take a look at this \ntreaty and reflect for a moment on the benefits to the U.S. of Senate \nratification.\n\n  The treaty is in the best interest of the United States. Our \nagriculture industry, American universities, and our non-governmental \norganizations have considerable expertise in combating desertification. \nBusinesses like Monsanto, Land O' Lakes, and the Chocolate \nManufacturers Association are supporting the treaty because it will \nincrease U.S. business opportunities. Ratification will also increase \nexport of American technical assistance in erosion control. The \nIrrigation Association supports it because many of its members produce \nworld-class irrigation and water control equipment. After ratification, \nthe U.S. may submit names of its desertification experts and \nconsultants for the international Roster of Independent Experts who are \navailable to provide services.\n  The treaty does not commit the U.S. to any specific level of foreign \nassistance. Rather, it asks governments of developed nations to channel \nexisting bilateral and multilateral aid funds through a new mechanism \nthat will provide improved coordination and better use of donor \nresources. The treaty obligates recipient nations to develop actions \nplans ``from the bottom up'' to combat regional and local \ndesertification. The treaty is remarkable because it calls upon local \ncommunities to take the lead in identifying their problems and \nselecting the best solutions for their particular situations.\n  On World Day to Combat Desertification, let's not forget our own grim \nexperience with desertification and the ``Dust Bowl.'' Let's join the \nother nations that have ratified the Convention to Combat \nDesertification and prevent a reoccurrence of this tragedy elsewhere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6485-5", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                      executive messages referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6486-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEASURES RECOMMITTED\n\n  Pursuant to Section 312(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, \nthe following bill was recommitted as indicated:\n\n       S. 1415.

A bill to amend section 3702 of title 38, United Code, to \nmake permanent the eligibility of former members of the Selected \nReserve for veterans housing loans; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwould permanently authorize the Department of Veterans Affairs Home \nLoan Guaranty Program for members of the Selected Reserve.\n  The eligibility of National Guard and Reserve members for VA-\nguaranteed home loans will expire in October 1999. I believe that \nSection 3702 of Title 38, which allows Guard and Reserve members who \ncomplete 6 years of service to participate in the loan program, should \nbe made permanent.\n  The law extending eligibility for the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program \nto these service members was enacted in 1992 with bipartisan support in \nthe Senate and in the House. As the sponsor of the original bill, I am \npleased with the participation of Guard and Reserve members in the \nprogram, and am committed to ensuring that their eligibility for this \nprogram continues beyond the sunset date.\n  With the downsizing of our active duty military forces, Guard and \nReserve units are becoming an increasingly vital element of the total \nforce. However, there are very few incentives to get qualified \nindividuals to serve our country in the Selected Reserve. The VA Home \nLoan Guaranty Program for National Guard and Reserve members is an \nexcellent incentive to join and remain in the Selected Reserve.\n  Since the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program for Guard and Reserve members \nbegan in October 1992, the VA has guaranteed more than 33,000 loans \nthrough fiscal year 1996. In 1996 alone, approximately 11,000 loans \ntotalling over $1 billion were made. According to the VA, only 93 out \nof all loans made to Reservists have been foreclosed upon, for a \nminimal default rate of about 0.4 percent. By comparison, the \nforeclosure rate for loans made to other veterans was two and one-half \ntimes higher than the rate for Reservists. Furthermore, 67 percent of \nloans to Reservists guaranteed by the VA in fiscal year 1996 were to \nfirst time home buyers, compared to 56 percent of loans to other \nveterans.\n  As the statistics on VA-guaranteed home loans indicate, the inclusion \nof Guard and Reserve members actually stabilizes the financial \nviability of he program since this group is likely to have a lower \ndefault rate than other veterans. Reservists are generally an older, \nmore mature, and stable group with established civilian jobs and ties \nto local communities.\n  Mr. President, it is clear that the VA Home Loan Guaranty Program is \nnot only good for members of the Selected Reserve, it is also \nbeneficial for the VA Home Guaranty Program. Furthermore, the local \neconomies where the homes are purchased also benefit from this program. \nSo, therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nlegislation. Passage of this measure will ensure that the program \ncontinues to be made available to National Guard and Reserve members \nwho have served our country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2181\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. PERMANENT ELIGIBILITY OF FORMER MEMBERS OF \n                   SELECTED RESERVE FOR VETERANS HOUSING LOANS.\n\n       Section 3702(a)(2)(E) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking out ``For the period beginning on October \n     28, 1992, and ending on October 27, 1999, each veteran'' and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``Each veteran''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GORTON (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Bumpers, and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 2182. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax-exempt bond financing of certain electric facilities; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               PRIVATE USE COMPETITION REFORM ACT OF 1998\n\n Mr. GORTON. Mr. President today I join with Senators Kerrey, \nJeffords, and Bumpers, to introduce the Private Use Competition Reform \nAct of 1998. This legislation provides a fair balance among public \nfinancing concerns, principles of fair competition and customer choice \nin the electric utility industry. At the same time, it strikes an \nequitable balance between publicly-owned utilities and investor-owned \nutilities. Most importantly, it advances the interest of consumers.\n  The challenge in developing this legislation was to determine the \nmiddle ground. Some publicly-owned utilities would like to change the \nTax Reform Act of 1986 so that all existing and all future tax-exempt \ndebt would be protected without restrictions. Some investor-owned \nutilities favor elimination of tax-exempt options for municipal \nelectric utilities, including much of their existing debt. However, \nthis approach would threaten the existence of publicly owned utilities, \nand raise rates for more than 40 million consumers.\n  This bill will accomplish two objectives. First, it clarifies how the \nexisting private-use requirements--the rules that limit the ability of \npublicly-owned utilities to sell or transport electricity to private \nparties from facilities financed by tax-exempt bonds--will work in a \nnew competitive marketplace. Secondly, it provides options, with \nsignificant tradeoffs, for those utilities that need flexibility and \nencourages municipalities to open their transmission systems and \nprovide retail choice to consumers.\n  There are three categories of debt addressed in this legislation.\n  The first consists of existing debt that has been issued for all \nsegments of a public utility's system: generating plants, transmission \nlines, and local distribution systems. This debt was issued under the \nassumption that our existing system would not change, and electric \nutilities would remain closed and not be subject to retail competition.\n  The second category of debt pertains to bonds issued after the \neffective date of the enacted bill and used to finance new generating \nfacilities. There is a compelling argument that this type of debt \nshould not be tax-exempt because power generation, unlike transmission \nand distribution, is emerging as a competitive market.\n  The third category of future debt involves those areas of a utility's \nsystem that will not face competition: transmission and local \ndistribution. Since these areas would remain de facto monopolies \nregulated by FERC or local governments and would be increasingly open \nto access by all market participants on a non-discriminatory basis, it \nis appropriate that they should continue to have access to tax-exempt \nfinancing.\n  This bill addresses each area differently. To enable public power \nsystems to one up their transmission and distribution systems, it \nprovides limited relief to existing tax-exempt debt.\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nBut there is a significant tradeoff for this relief: eliminating \npublicly-owned utilities' ability to issue tax-exempt debt for \nfacilities that will be used in a competitive marketplace.\n\n\n                          The Current Problem\n\n  The Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the subsequent FERC Order 888 \nmandating open transmission access, coupled with state restructuring \nefforts, have created a significant tax problem for public systems.\n  To gain access to competitive wholesale markets, a publicly-owned \nutility must provide comparable access; some public power systems own \nvital transmission links within a geographical area. Also, customers of \npublic systems--who are also their owners--will want access to other \npower suppliers.\n  If publicly-owned systems open their transmission lines they can run \nafoul of the current ``private-use test'' in the tax code and force \ntheir bonds to become retroactively taxable.\n  In sum, the current private use restrictions were written before \nanyone could anticipate a competitive electricity industry; \nconsequently this places publicly-owned utilities in a complex bind. \nAllowing private entities to use their transmission facilities could \ntrigger the private use tests, resulting in an expensive and chaotic \ndefeasance of these bonds. Public systems also face penalties under \nprivate use regulations if they sell power to existing customers on a \nnon-tariff basis or resell power that becomes excess when retail \ncustomers switch suppliers.\n  The Department of Treasury released temporary regulations in January \nof 1998, (twelve years after the Tax Reform Act of 1986), but these \ntemporary regulations still fail to provide the flexibility needed for \npublic power systems as the electric utility industry transitions to \nretail competition.\n  This legislation is needed to address these concerns, and to promote \nfair competition in the electricity industry. This bill will help \nensure that all Americans can enjoy the benefits of competition--lower \nrates, new and innovative products, and better service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nthe explanatory memorandum be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2182\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

One exception to \n     this general rule relates to bonds that finance output \n     facilities used in a private business. In the case of such \n     facilities, if the contractual arrangements for sale of the \n     output transfer the benefits and burdens of ownership of the \n     facility to private parties, the use is treated as a private \n     business use and the bonds issued to finance the facility may \n     not be tax-exempt. If at the time of issuance the issuer \n     reasonably expected that the private business use rules would \n     be violated or the issuer thereafter took deliberate action \n     that resulted in a violation, interest on the bonds is \n     retroactively taxable to date of issuance.\n       There has been significant uncertainty as to how these \n     private business use rules apply to public power systems in \n     the emerging competitive wholesale and retail electricity \n     markets. In particular, questions have been raised as to \n     whether such systems may (1) provide open access transmission \n     services, (2) contractually commit their transmission systems \n     to an Independent System Operator (ISO), (3) open their \n     distribution facilities to retail competition, or (4) lower \n     prices to particular customers to meet competition.\n\n\n                          proposed amendments\n\n       S. 2182 would amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to \n     make two modifications to the private business use rules as \n     they apply to electric facilities: (1) to clarify the \n     application of the existing private business use rules in the \n     new competitive environment, and (2) to make the private \n     business use rules inapplicable to existing tax-exempt debt \n     issued by any public power system that elects not to issue \n     new tax-exempt debt for electric generation and certain other \n     facilities.\n       1. Clarification of Existing Private Business Use Rules. \n     Subsection (a) of section 1 of the bill amends section \n     141(b)(6) of the Code to make it clear that the following \n     activities (referred to as ``permitted open access \n     transactions'') do not result in a private business use and \n     will not make otherwise tax-exempt bonds taxable:\n       (a) Providing open access transmission service consistent \n     with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) Order No. \n     888 or with State open transmission access rules.\n       (b) Joining a FERC approved ISO, regional transmission \n     group (RTG), power exchange, or providing service in \n     accordance with an ISO, RTG, or power exchange tariff.\n       (c) Providing open access distribution services to \n     competing retail sellers of electricity.\n       (d) If open access transmission or distribution services \n     are offered, contracting for sale of power at non-tariff \n     rates--\n       (i) with on-system purchasers or existing off-system \n     purchasers, or\n       (ii) with new off-system purchasers for up to three years \n     to offset lost load, but only if the issuer elects to \n     temporarily suspend use of certain tax-exempt financing. A \n     sale qualifies under this provision if aggregate new off-\n     system sales do not exceed lost load, and if the public power \n     system has elected to suspend issuance of certain tax-exempt \n     bonds for a period at least as long as the term of the sale. \n     ``Lost load'' means the amount by which on-system sales and \n     existing off-system sales in a year are reduced from such \n     sales in a 1995, 1996, or 1997 base year. A special rule \n     permits a member of a joint action agency that is entitled to \n     make a qualifying load loss sale in a year to transfer that \n     entitlement to the joint action agency.\n\n     Treasury by regulation could add to the list of permitted \n     open access transactions.\n       2. Election to Terminate or Suspend Issuing Future Tax-\n     Exempt Debt. Subsection (b) of section 1 amends section 141 \n     of the Code to permit a public power system to elect to \n     terminate or suspend issuing new tax-exempt bonds.\n       (a) Termination Election.--Under new Code section \n     141(f)(1), if a public power system elects to terminate \n     issuance of new tax-exempt bonds, it may then undertake \n     transactions that are not otherwise permissible under the \n     private business use rules (as amended above) without \n     endangering the tax-exempt status of its existing bonds. \n     Specifically, if the issuer makes an irrevocable termination \n     election under this provision, then (subject to the \n     exceptions discussed below) no tax-exempt bond may be issued \n     on or after the date of such election with respect to an \n     electric output facility, and no tax-exempt bond that was \n     issued before the date of enactment will be treated as a \n     private activity bond. This treatment continues for so long \n     as such facility continues to be owned by a governmental \n     unit.\n       Essentially, making this termination election will \n     eliminate the possibility of a private business use challenge \n     to existing tax-exempt debt. If a utility does not make the \n     election, its existing tax-exempt debt for electric \n     generation facilities would continue to be subject to \n     applicable private business use rules and the marketing \n     constraints thereunder.\n       (b) Suspension Election. New section 141(f)(2) provides an \n     alternative to the election to permanently terminate issuing \n     tax-exempt bonds described above. Under the alternative, an \n     issuer may elect to suspend certain tax-exempt financing for \n     electric output facilities in return for temporary relief \n     from certain of the private business use rules, so as to \n     permit the issuer to make sales to offset lost load, as \n     described in 1(d) above.\n       (c) Exceptions to Termination or Suspension. Under section \n     141(f)(4) even if a public power system made the suspension \n     or termination election, it could continue to issue tax-\n     exempt bonds for the following purposes: for transmission and \n     distribution facilities used to provide open access \n     transmission and distribution services; for ``qualified \n     bonds'' as defined in section 141(e) of the Code (which are \n     not currently subject to private business use restrictions); \n     for eligible refunding bonds (bonds that refinance existing \n     bonds but do not extend their average maturity); and for \n     bonds issued to finance repairs of, or pollution control \n     equipment for, electrical output facilities, so long as the \n     capacity of the facility is not increased over a de minimis \n     amount.\n       3. Effective Dates. Subsection (c) makes the provisions of \n     the bill effective on date of enactment, but an issuer may \n     elect to make the private business use rules as clarified by \n     the bill applicable retroactively to 1996 (when FERC issued \n     its Order No. 888). Paragraph (2) of subsection (c) makes it \n     clear that the provisions of the bill apply to bonds issued \n     under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as well as the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986. This subsection also makes \n     clear that any activity that was not a private business use \n     prior to the enactment of the bill will not be deemed to be a \n     private business use by reason of the bill's enactment. in \n     addition, an issuer making the election under the bill will \n     not be liable under any contract in effect on the date of \n     enactment of the bill for any contract claim arising from \n     having made the election.\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, consumers in Nebraska currently pay \nsome of the lowest rates in the nation for their electric service. They \nreceive power from 171 entities--more individual electric systems than \nany other state. Nebraska is also the only state in the nation which \nrelies entirely on public power for its electric service.\n  This structure has served Nebraskans well, and the legislation that \nSenators Gorton, Bumpers, Jeffords, and I are introducing today will \nensure that consumers in my state continue to receive superior electric \nservice as efforts to deregulate the electric industry move forward.\n  Mr. President, the legislation we are introducing accomplishes three \nimportant goals:\n  First, this bill enables public power systems to open their \ntransmission lines to other power producers and to transfer control of \ntheir transmission facilities to an Independent System Operator without \njeopardizing the status of their tax-exempt bonds. This will enable \nconsumers throughout the country to receive electricity from their \npower producer of choice in an open access marketplace.\n  Secondly, this bill enables public power systems to make non-tariff \nsales of lost ``load'' resulting from retail competition, without \njeopardizing the ability of the utility to issue tax-exempt debt in the \nfuture. This will allow public utilities to continue to provide quality \nservice to current customers and attract new customers in a deregulated \nenvironment.\n  Finally, Mr. President, this legislation gives public power systems \nthe option of terminating issuance of new tax-exempt debt for \ngeneration facilities, while grandfathering all existing debt. This \nprovision will give public power systems the flexibility necessary to \nmake business decisions about the future based on their financial \nstatus and the electricity demands in their individual service areas.\n  Mr. President, I commend Senator Gorton for the time and energy that \nhe has devoted to this issue. It is critical that Congress alleviate \nthe burden which current private-use regulations place on the ability \nof public power\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\nsystems to function in a deregulated environment.\n  While Congress moves toward electricity deregulation, I will continue \nto fight for the consumers of my state to ensure that their best \ninterests are not compromised. The legislation my colleagues and I are \nintroducing today is a realistic and workable solution to the private-\nuse dilemma, and I encourage my colleagues to give it their full \nsupport.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 2183. A bill to amend the Head Start Act to increase the \nreservation of funds for programs for low-income families with very \nyoung children, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and \nHuman Resources.\n\n\n                         head start legislation\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, most Americans are very familiar \nwith Head Start. This popular preschool program was created in 1965 to \nprovide health, nutrition and educational assistance to low-income four \nand five year old children. Head Start enjoys strong bipartisan support \nand is widely recognized as a success.\n  In response to the growing body of research about the critical \ndevelopment which occurs during the first three years of a child's \nlife, Head Start has been expanded in recent years to also serve \ninfants and toddlers. The Early Head Start Program provides \ncomprehensive child development and family support services to families \nwith infants and toddlers from birth through age three and currently \nreceives 5% of Head Start funding. An estimated 39,000 children \ncurrently receive services nationwide. In Iowa, 533 children are served \nby Early Head Start.\n  However, these children and families represent only a fraction of \nthose that need and could benefit from these activities. As a result, \ntoday I am introducing legislation that would increase the set-aside to \n10% in 2002--to double the number of participants.\n  There were many exciting developments last year with respect to the \neducation of young children. Science confirmed what many of us have \nbelieved for years--that the first three years of a child's life are \nthe most important. We discovered that young children have unlimited \npotential to learn many things during this critical time. We learned \nhow important it is for parents to read to their young children, talk \nwith them and stimulate learning through play. We also learned that \nchildren who do not have enriched learning experiences during these \nimportant years can be stunted for life.\n  Last year, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nappropriations subcommittee, of which I am the ranking Democrat, held a \nhearing focused on the importance of early intervention activities. We \nheard compelling testimony on the benefits of providing support for \nearly education and development activities. The President and First \nLady also convened historic conferences to discuss early childhood \neducation and child care and a public campaign was launched to spread \nthe word to parents.\n  Throughout the year, the message was always the same--we must make \ninvestments in early intervention programs a national priority. This is \nthe right thing to do for the young children of our nation, but it is \nalso the most cost-effective thing for us to do. Every dollar invested \nin quality pre-school programs saves $7 in future costs for special \neducation, welfare or corrections.\n  In 1991, the Committee for Economic Development called on the nation \nto rethink how we view education. This group of business leaders urged \nfederal policy makers to view education as a process that begins at \nbirth, with preparations beginning before birth. I strongly support \nthis objective and have always been a strong advocate in early \nintervention activities such as Head Start, the WIC nutrition program \nand early intervention programs for infants and toddlers with \ndisabilities.\n  We must dedicate ourselves to making the CED vision a reality and \nbuild a strong foundation for education in this country. That begins \nwith ensuring that all children get off to a good, strong start and \nenter school ready to learn.\n  Last year, the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education \nappropriations subcommittee made investments in early intervention a \npriority at my request. The FY 1998 appropriations bill invested an \nadditional $64 million in Early Head Start, an increase of 75%, and \nprovided an 11% increase in the early intervention program for infants \nand toddlers with disabilities.\n  The legislation I am introducing today takes another step toward \nbuilding this foundation by doubling the set-aside for the Early Head \nStart Program for children ages 0-3 by the year 2002. This action will \ncontinue to improve access to education and development services for \nour youngest children to provide a good start in life. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. \n        Lieberman):\n  S. 2184. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to provide each \nAmerican child with a KidSave Account; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  social security kidsave accounts act\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, many of the things we do in the \nSenate require hypothetical analysis, shaky forecasts and hazy \npredictions. Indeed at times it could be said that we don't know what \nwe're doing. Today Senator Moynihan and I are introducing a bill based \non a mathematical certainty. Our bill would make every baby born in \nAmerica wealthy. Guaranteed.\n  This proposal, called KidSave, supplements S. 1792, the Social \nSecurity Solvency Act of 1998, which the Senator from New York \nintroduced earlier this year and of which I am an original cosponsor. \nIt would cut the payroll tax by $800 billion--the largest tax cut in \nAmerican history, and the one most targeted to middle class families--\nso individuals can harness the power of compounding interest rates to \nbuild wealth for retirement. One of the discoveries I have made in \nresearching this idea is that the most important variable in \ncompounding interest rates is time. The earlier you start, the more \nwealth you build.\n  KidSave is based on that observation. It would use part of the \nsavings created by S. 1792 to open a $1,000 account for every child at \nbirth and contribute $500 a year to that account for the first five \nyears. These KidSave accounts would be invested in broad funds \nadministered by the Social Security Administration, and be similar to \nthe Thrift Savings Plan available to federal employees and to members \nof this body.\n  As I said, Mr. President, this is a mathematical proposition. Even at \nmodest rates of return, the long stretch of time over which this \ninvestment would be compounded means every baby born in America would \nhave a shot at the American dream. At just 5.4 percent return, less \nthan the historical rates of return for the market, these birth \naccounts alone would allow every American to supplement his or her \nretirement income by $235 a month in 1998 dollars, and still leave more \nthan $100,000 behind to his or her heirs.\n  These accounts would supplement those opened by the payroll tax cut \nproposed in S. 1792. This approach to retirement security is two-\npronged. First, we shore up the solvency of Social Security so it \ncontinues to provide a reliable monthly check. But we also realize that \ncheck isn't enough to live on. The average Social Security check in \nNebraska is $733 a month. Nationwide, sixteen percent of beneficiaries \nhave no other source of income. Another 14 percent rely on Social \nSecurity for more than 90 percent of their income, and nearly two-\nthirds overall derive more than half their income from that small \ncheck. For many of them, it's not enough. Our proposal is based on the \nidea that retirees need both income and wealth, and experience bears \nthat idea out. Today retirees with asset income have more than double \nthe retirement income of those who don't.\n  But this is about much more than money. Not only is this a guaranteed \nroute to retirement security, it's also a mathematically certain \nsolution to one of the toughest problems we face: The rich are getting \nricher and the poor are getting poorer. To understand this problem, we \nmust understand the difference between income and wealth. Income, Mr. \nPresident, consists of the paychecks we use to pay our bills. Wealth is \nwhat an individual owns in assets like a home, mutual fund or pension. \nWe've heard a lot recently about\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\nthe gap between rich and poor in terms of income. The gap in wealth is \neven worse and, I would argue, more important. As our economy becomes \nmore global and technology-intensive, it is disproportionately \ndistributing its rewards to those who own a piece of our economy.\n  Despite the growing importance of wealth, a stark gap has opened \nbetween those who have it and those who don't. The bottom 90 percent of \nAmericans earn 60 percent of all income, but own less than 30 percent \nof net worth and less than 20 percent of financial assets. These \nAmericans are being left behind as the economy apportions more and more \nof its rewards to owners of wealth. Social Security can be a vehicle \nfor solving that problem.\n  We believe wealth can transform Americans' attitudes about their \nfuture. Wealth enables higher living standards, but it also enables \ngenerosity and the optimism that comes with feeling secure about the \nfuture. Wealth can make every American an Oseola McCarty, \nthe remarkable woman in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, who after more than \nseven decades of low-wage work as a washer woman donated $150,000 to \nthe University of Southern Mississippi--wealth she had built by saving \na little bit of money over a long period of time. Wealth can make every \nAmerican like Al, a man who works as a printer for the U.S. Senate. His \nThrift Savings Plan has boomed so much he is thinking of opening a \nsavings account for his two-year-old boy. Wealth can give every \nAmerican the opportunity to be like another man I recently met, whose \nfirm was bought out but who became wealthier because he owned a piece \nof it. When I spoke with him, he didn't talk about his income. He said \nhe had told his wife: ``Whatever else happens to us in life, we know \nthe kids can go to college.''\n\n  Each of these Americans has something in common, Mr. President. They \nown a piece of their country. When the economy grows, they grow. They \nhave a stake in low inflation. They want trade barriers lowered. They \nare on the front lines of a transformation from an ``us-vs.-them'' \neconomy to one in which the attitude is: ``We're all in this \ntogether.''\n  And, Mr. President, that's an opportunity we can open today to every \nbaby born in America. Guaranteed. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, Senator Kerrey and I, along with \nSenators Breaux and Lieberman, are pleased to introduce the Social \nSecurity KidSave Accounts Act, which nicely complements the Social \nSecurity Solvency Act of 1998 introduced by Senator Kerrey and me in \nMarch. In that proposal we reduced payroll taxes by $800 billion over \n10 years. The reduction in the payroll tax rate from 12.4 percent to \n10.4 allows the funding of personal savings accounts with the 2 \npercentage point reduction in the payroll tax.\n  A worker with average earnings depositing 2 percent of wages--one \npercent from the worker and one percent from the employer can--over 45 \nyears--accumulate almost one half of a million dollars. Add in the \nwealth generated over a lifetime of 70 years from the interest on the \nKidSave accounts of $3,500--$1,000 at birth and $500 for each of the \nnext five years--and you have created a new class of millionaires. \nWorkers will have estates which they can pass on to their heirs.\n  Combined, these two bills create wealth without spending the budget \nsurplus. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that for the ten \nyear period 1999-2008, our bill, which saves Social Security \nindefinitely, increases the budget surplus by $170 billion. This \nKidSave bill spends only about $100-$120 billion of that increase. In \nshort, we create private savings without reducing public savings.\n  Together these bills provide for a more comprehensive approach to \nretirement savings. The foundation of this approach remains Social \nSecurity, the financial future of which is secured for 75 years and \nbeyond. If this legislation is enacted, as I hope it will be, \nsignificant new private savings would be added to this \nfoundation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Dodd, \n        and Mr. Reed):\n  S. 2185. A bill to protect children from firearms violence; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                 children's gun violence prevention act\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Children's Gun \nViolence Prevention Act, together with Senator Boxer, Senator Durbin, \nSenator Dodd and Senator Reed.\n  The continuing epidemic of gun violence involving children demands \naction by Congress.\n  The wave of school shootings in communities across the country is a \nwake-up call for the nation. We need to do more--and we can do more--to \nprotect children from guns.\n  Every day in the United States, 14 children are killed by a gun; 24 \npercent of children say they have access to a gun at home; 10 percent \nhave recently carried a gun to school.\n  We need to deal more effectively with all aspects of the culture of \nviolence that is killing our children. The legislation we propose today \nis a concrete step to do more to keep children safe from gun violence.\n  I know that some in Congress are reluctant to challenge the National \nRifle Association, but there are common sense steps that we can take \nand should take to protect children from guns. Our bill says that gun \nowners must take responsibility for securing their guns so that \nchildren can't use them. It says that gun dealers must be more vigilant \nin not selling guns and ammunition to children. It says we must develop \nchild-proof safety locks and other child safety features for guns. We \ndo more today to regulate the safety of toy guns than real guns, and \nthat's a national disgrace.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is the least we can do to \nstop more schoolyard tragedies and to deal more responsibly with the \nfestering crisis of gun violence involving children.\n  In a press conference earlier today, we heard what gun violence has \ndone to Susan Wilson of Jonesboro with the loss of her daughter \nBrittheny, and what it has done to the families in Oregon, and the \nthousands of other families who lose children to gun violence every \nyear, and we know that action is needed.\n  I want to commend Sarah Brady and Handgun Control for their \nleadership on this legislation, and for bringing us to this point \ntoday.\n  Practical steps can clearly be taken to protect children more \neffectively from guns, and to promote greater responsibility by \nparents, gun manufacturers, and gun dealers alike. This legislation \ncalls for such steps and it deserves to be enacted this year by this \nCongress.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text and a description of the bill \nbe included in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2185\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to terminate all United States assistance to the \nNational Endowment for Democracy, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n          END FUNDING FOR THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR DEMOCRACY\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill that would \nend federal funding for the National Endowment for Democracy, known as \nNED.\n  Last year the Administration asked for $30 million in NED funding, \nand after a Senate debate on the program, the Congress met that \nrequest. This year the Administration has requested $31 million for NED \nfor fiscal year 1999.\n  In my view, the time has long since come for Congress to end our \nsubsidy of NED. Let me take a brief moment to explain why.\n  NED began back in the early 1980s, during the darkest days of the \nCold War, when Solidarity was on the ropes in Poland and a former KGB \nchief ruled the Soviet Union. As we all know, Solidarity has given \nbirth to political parties that have governed Poland, and Lech Walesa, \nthe Solidarity union leader, was elected Poland's president. The Soviet \nUnion and the KGB are no more, and Russia has a multi-party political \nsystem. There is no Warsaw Pact. In fact, the Senate has just decided \nto admit into NATO some of the countries that NED used to help.\n  The historic fall of the Berlin Wall, the breakup of the Soviet \nUnion, and the successes of democracy worldwide in the past 15 years \nshould make us wonder whether NED is as necessary now as it was at the \nheight of the Cold War. Democracy is on the march worldwide, most \nrecently perhaps even in Indonesia. Yet the American taxpayer is still \ncoughing up $30 million a year to foot the bill for NED.\n  It's also worth noting that when NED started, back during the Cold \nWar, it was supposed to be a public-private partnership. Federal money \nwas supposed to ``prime the pump'' of private contributions. Private \ncorporations, foundations and philanthropists were supposed to foot \nmuch of the bill. But it didn't happen.\n  Since 1984 the American taxpayer has spent over $360 million on NED. \nAnd according to NED's most recent annual report, in 1996 NED's total \nrevenue was $30.9 million, but its revenue from nonfederal sources was \nonly $585,000. In that year, it took 53 taxpayer dollars to leverage \none private dollar contributed to NED.\n  These statistics show that NED is a very poor investment for the \nFederal Government. There is no public-private partnership funding NED. \nIt's the public, the Federal Government, all the way.\n  Of course, the Federal Government has some private partners when it \ncomes to spending NED funds. Year after year, NED distributes taxpayer \ndollars to the same ``core grantees.'' This is despite the fact that \neverything we know about good government says that there should be \ncompetitive contracting for government work.\n  NED isn't one sole-source contract. It isn't just one set-aside. It's \nfour.\n  Four private institutions got just over $4 million each in 1996 and \n1997. These private groups are: the National Democratic Institute, also \nknown as the Democratic Party; the International Republican Institute, \nbetter known as the Republican Party; the Free Trade Union Institute, \nwhich is really the AFL-CIO; and the Center for International Private \nEnterprise, which we all know as the Chamber of Commerce.\n  Mr. President, these four ``core grantees'' get the lion's share of \nNED funding, year after year. As our former colleague Senator Hank \nBrown of Colorado said four years ago, ``How long does it take for \npeople to realize that what we are doing is not promoting democracy, \nbut promoting these four organizations?''\n  What do these four groups do with this money? They use it to send \nwell-connected Democrats and Republicans, and business and labor \nleaders, around the world. These folks visit various countries and try \nto promote democracy.\n  It sounds fine until you consider that this activity duplicates work \ndone by the United States Information Agency, the Agency for \nInternational Development, and the Departments of State, Justice and \nDefense. In 1996 alone, AID spent $390 million, USIA spent $355 \nmillion, and the Defense Department spent $38 million, all to promote \ndemocracy.\n  There's no reason for another Federal program to achieve this same \ngoal. The American people know that the time is past when we could \nspend money we didn't have on programs we don't need.\n  Last year, I thought that my hope of ending federal funding for the \nNational Endowment for Democracy had come true. The Commerce-State-\nJustice appropriations bill actually zeroed out this program. Let me \nquote from the Appropriations Committee's report language on this \nissue:\n\n       The Committee does not recommend funding for fiscal year \n     1998 for the National Endowment for Democracy. . . . The NED \n     was originally established in 1984 during the days of the \n     cold war as a public-private partnership to promote \n     democratic movements behind the Iron Curtain. Limited U.S. \n     Government funds were viewed as a way to help leverage \n     private contributions and were never envisioned as NED's sole \n     or major source of continuing funds. Since the cold war is \n     over, the Committee believes that the time has come to \n     eliminate Federal funding for this program.\n\n  Unfortunately, the full Senate approved a floor amendment that \nrestored the requested $30 million for the NED.\n  So I am here today to call on Senators to accept the dictates of \ncommon sense this year, and to accept the recommendation of the \nAppropriations Committee. We are having great difficulty allocating \nfunding among the different discretionary programs. The Senate is \nhaving to make difficult choices about federal spending. We need to \ndetermine what is a priority.\n  I strongly believe that NED no longer deserves the Senate's support. \nThe Cold War is over, and we have other, more effective ways to promote \ndemocracy abroad. I hope that the Senate will act favorably on the bill \nthat I am introducing today, and that we will save the American \ntaxpayer $30 million a year.\n\n

                    S. Res. 250\n\n       Whereas the United States has a total of 3,000,000 linear \n     miles of rivers, which have played a fundamental role in the \n     Nation's culture, heritage, ecological health, economic \n     development, and overall quality of life;\n       Whereas rivers are used throughout the Nation as efficient \n     transportation routes for commerce and industry, are used in \n     urban areas as public transportation corridors, and have \n     facilitated economic growth by providing transportation, \n     generating hydroelectric power, and supplying water for farms \n     and rural towns;\n       Whereas rivers support fish, waterfowl, and other wildlife \n     that need greenways and clean water to survive in their \n     habitats, and people throughout America live in close \n     proximity to rivers and streams and use them for swimming, \n     fishing, boating, and other forms of recreation and leisure;\n       Whereas the Nation's rivers are important tourist \n     destinations, which, each year, attract more than 46,000,000 \n     international travelers and generate more than $430,000,000 \n     in tourism revenue;\n       Whereas the activities carried out along the Nation's \n     rivers affect water resources, environment, and geography on \n     regional, national, and global scales;\n       Whereas the President and Congress have declared their \n     support for rivers through the American Heritage Rivers \n     program; and\n       Whereas it is appropriate for the people of the United \n     States from time to time to reflect upon the manner in which \n     their activities and lifestyles affect the rivers of the \n     Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the third \n     Saturday in June of each year should be designated as \n     ``National Rivers Day''.\n\n Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am submitting a sense of the \nSenate resolution to designate the third Saturday in June of every year \nas ``National Rivers Day.'' Rivers touch each and every one of our \nlives. Every State and nearly every community in the United States has \na river or stream going through it. Because every American has access \nto rivers and streams, what we do and how we live has a profound impact \non the quality of the nation's rivers.\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\n  The three million miles of rivers and streams that travel through the \nUnited States have played a fundamental role in our culture and our \nheritage. Indeed, the health of America's rivers inextricably linked to \nour health as a nation. Our rivers contribute to commerce, food \nproduction and public recreation, and they enhance our well-being. \nRivers also support fish, waterfowl, and other wildlife that need clean \nwater to survive in their habitat.\n  The settlers in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were awed by \nour majestic rivers, curious mixtures of pristine and rugged beauty. \nSince colonial times, America's rivers have promoted our economic and \nsocial growth, as an energy source to spur industrialization and as a \nwater supply resource.\n  Regrettably, in the late 1960's, although America had grown to be the \nmost powerful industrial nation in the world, we had failed to protect \nthe very resources that were responsible for our success. The Hudson \nRiver was a dumping ground for fuel and other industrial waste. The \nCuyahoga River in Cleveland became so polluted that it caught fire. \nThese terrible events prompted the call to reverse the trend and to \nclean up the nation's rivers and other waters.\n  Today, the cleanup of our rivers and streams has led to the economic \nrevitalization of urban centers, neighborhoods, and towns all over \nAmerica. From Boston to Chicago to Washington, D.C., Americans are \ncleaning up their rivers and using them for recreation, boating, \ntourism and leisure. America's rivers continue to serve as \ntransportation links supporting commerce and industry. Their greatest \ncontribution to the U.S. economy, however, is the 430 billion dollars \ngenerated annually from the tourists that visit our rivers. And more \nthan 46 million international tourists visit our rivers each year.\n  The tide has turned significantly from the late 1960s and early \n1970s, but we must continue to encourage ongoing protection and \npromotion of the nation's rivers. Designating the third Saturday in \nJune of each year as ``National Rivers Day'' will inspire all Americans \nto get involved in the ongoing protection of our precious rivers and \nstreams. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nmeasure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6497-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6498]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        NATIONAL TOBACCO POLICY AND YOUTH SMOKING REDUCTION ACT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               JEFFORDS (AND BINGAMAN) AMENDMENT NO. 2710\n\n  (Ordered to lie on the table.)\n  Mr. JEFFORDS (for himself and Mr. Bingaman) submitted an amendment \nintended to be proposed by them to the bill (S. 1415) to reform and \nrestructure the processes by which tobacco products are manufactured, \nmarketed, and distributed, to prevent the use of tobacco products by \nminors, to redress the adverse health effects of tobacco use, and for \nother purposes; as follows:\n\n       On page 159, line 8, strike ``such sums as may be \n     necessary'' and all that follows through line 11, and insert \n     ``not less than 5 percent of such funds in fiscal year 1999, \n     10 percent of such funds in fiscal year 2000, 15 percent of \n     such funds in fiscal year 2001, and 20 percent of such funds \n     in fiscal year 2002 and each subsequent fiscal year, shall be \n     used to expand existing support for epidemiological, \n     behavioral, psychopharmacological, psychobiological, \n     psychophysiological, health services and social science \n     research related to the prevention and treatment of tobacco \n     addiction.

Mr. President, our country's relationship with \nthe People's Republic of China is currently receiving a great deal of \nattention. One aspect of that relationship which is not getting enough \nattention is shipping.\n  The United States has an open door to Chinese shipping. Chinese \ncompanies can call at any U.S. port. They do not need any government \nagency to approve their schedule, their ships, or changes to those \ndeployments. They can open branch offices anywhere in the U.S. that \nthey wish. They can provide vessel agency services to their own \nvessels. This U.S. policy has allowed Chinese shipping companies to be \nquite free and successful. COSCO, for example, which is owned by the \nPeople's Republic of China, is by far the largest ocean carrier in the \nU.S.-China trade and is a major carrier in other U.S. trades. The \nChinese government wants the most favorable treatment for COSCO here in \nthe U.S.; yet it continues to deny U.S. carriers operating in China the \nopportunities and privileges Chinese carriers receive here.\n  Not only does Chinese shipping policy seek to control the trade \nrather than allow market forces to operate, but restrictions are \nbecoming increasingly problematic. This lack of reciprocity is unfair.\n  For example, access to ostensibly open ports in China is now solely \nat the discretion of the Chinese Ministry of Communications. While \nAmerican carriers must endure long waits for an uncertain approval of \nwhether and where they can operate, Chinese carriers are free to call \nat U.S. ports without having to face such conditions. Recent Chinese \nregulations make this process even more burdensome and contain the \npotential for huge penalties.\n  U.S. carriers face restrictions on a host of normal commercial \nactivities in China that Chinese carriers don't face here. For example, \nbranch offices are restricted or prohibited. U.S. carriers cannot even \nprovide normal vessel agency services to their own ships. This results \nin a considerably higher cost base for U.S. carriers versus their \nChinese competitors.\n  The Federal Maritime Commission and the Administration have been \nworking on and encouraging a resolution of these problems, but \ninsufficient progress has been made. Therefore, I have written to the \nFMC to encourage it to use the full range of its authority to \ninvestigate these matters.\n  What is additionally very troubling to me--and what should be very \ntroubling to the Chinese government if they value the government-to-\ngovernment negotiation process as a way to resolve differences--is the \nrecent turn of events in the maritime bilateral negotiations between \nour governments. In December of last year some progress was made. An \nagreement was reached on some of the outstanding issues. The U.S. \ngovernment has fulfilled its promises by the FMC giving COSCO an \nexemption from some of the Controlled Carrier Act restrictions. But the \nChinese government has not yet honored its commitments, even though it \nhad agreed to act simultaneously with the U.S. government. The \nAdministration recognizes this. The FMC recognizes this. The Congress \nrecognizes this.\n  China's relationship with the U.S. is undermined when it fails to \nfulfill its promises. Our willingness to treat China favorably is \nundermined if the Chinese government's promises are illusory.\n  Not only do I urge the FMC to investigate and take appropriate action \nin these maritime issues, but I urge the State Department to convey to \nthe Chinese government the damaging effect of its current maritime \nposture on improved trade relations.\n  Both our countries' trade relations are benefited by a liberalized \nshipping environment. An unbalanced lack of reciprocity cannot be \nsustained.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my letters to Secretary Slater at the \nDepartment of Transportation and Chairman Creel at the Federal Maritime \nCommission be printed in the Record.\n  The letters follow:\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Rodney E. Slater,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Transportation, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing with regard to the recent \n     trend toward maritime protectionism in the People's Republic \n     of China. Your Department, particularly the Maritime \n     Administration, has been actively engaged in negotiations \n     with the Chinese to eliminate many of the restrictions faced \n     by U.S. carriers in China. It is my understanding that, \n     unfortunately, progress has been slow. I find particularly \n     troubling the fact that the Chinese have failed to implement \n     a gentlemen's agreement arrived at last December with your \n     acting Maritime Administrator, John Graykowski.\n       I am attaching a letter which I have sent to Harold Creel, \n     Chairman of the Federal Maritime Commission (FMC), asking the \n     FMC to investigate this matter. I am certain you will agree \n     that if the Chinese restrictions enumerated in this letter \n     are not addressed through bilateral consultation, the FMC \n     should act to impose countervailing sanctions on Chinese \n     carriers doing business in the United States. Hopefully, a \n     resolution can be reached before such steps are necessary.\n       I trust that resolving these China maritime issues will be \n     among the Maritime Administration's highest priorities. The \n     Department and the Maritime Administration have my full \n     support in your continuing efforts to eliminate restrictions \n     which hinder the competitiveness of U.S. carriers in China.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings,\n                                                 Ranking Democrat.\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 16, 1998.\n     Hon. Harold J. Creel, Jr.,\n     Chairman, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Unfortunately over the past year, the \n     maritime relationship between the United States and the \n     People's Republic of China has deteriorated dramatically. \n     This has resulted from a series of restrictive measures taken \n     by the Chinese Ministry of Communications (MOC) aimed at \n     limiting the activities of foreign shipping lines in China. \n     At the same time, China's state-owned line, China Ocean \n     Shipping Company (COSCO), has grown to become one of the \n     largest, most successful carriers serving U.S. liner trades.\n       COSCO operates and competes freely and openly in the United \n     States while our carriers face costly, anticompetitive \n     restrictions in China. These restrictions include: (1) a \n     cumbersome and lengthy approval process for vessel or \n     itinerary changes; (2) limits on the number and location of \n     branch offices for U.S. carriers in China; (3) limits on U.S. \n     carriers ability to provide intermodal transport to inland \n     customers; and (4) a prohibition barring U.S. carriers \n     provision of vessel agency services. All of these costly \n     restrictions make it extremely difficult for U.S. carriers to \n     effectively compete in the Chinese market. Conversely, COSCO \n     faces no similar restrictions in the United States.\n       U.S. negotiators from the Departments of Transportation and \n     State have worked to bring reciprocity and fairness to our \n     bilateral maritime relationship with China. To date these \n     efforts have been for the most part unsuccessful. One glimmer \n     of hope was December's ``gentlemen's'' agreement struck \n     between our acting Maritime Administrator and the Chinese \n     Director General for Water Transport from MOC to remove some \n     of the roadblocks to an improved relationship.\n       On the United States side, MarAd and the U.S. carriers \n     supported a petition by COSCO to your Commission for partial \n     relief from the Controlled Carrier Act. The FMC fully granted \n     that petition in March. However, the Chinese side has yet to \n     keep their part of the agreement: to approve U.S. carrier \n     port access and vessel registration applications and to grant \n     a joint venture port operating license to a U.S. carrier. As \n     a result of this breach, talks aimed at finalizing a new \n     bilateral maritime agreement have broken down and U.S. \n     carriers continue to face costly, burdensome restrictions to \n     their operations in China.\n       Mr. Chairman, as you know, I have long been an advocate for \n     fairness and reciprocity in our maritime relationships. I \n     find the situation with China unacceptable. I urge you to \n     act, as you have so effectively in the past, to investigate \n     these matters and encourage China to remove these \n     restrictions so that U.S. carriers can compete as freely and \n     openly in China as COSCO competes here. I am confident that, \n     as in the past, you can count on the full support of the \n     Senate.\n       With kindest regards, I am\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Ranking Democrat.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6499-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO RABBI ALEXANDER D. GOODE\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the \ncourage and bravery of Rabbi Alexander D. Goode and the three other \nchaplains aboard the U.S.A.T. Dorchester on the night it sank into the \nicy waters off the coast of Greenland.\n  On February 3, 1943, the Dorchester, filled to capacity with over 900 \nmen, was struck by German torpedoes around 1:00 am. The Germans \nsucceeded in knocking out the ship's communication, injuring and \nkilling scores of men, and fatally wounding the Dorchester. As the crew \nrealized what had just occurred, chaos and panic erupted on all sides. \nIn the midst of the confusion, four Army Chaplains, Lt. George L. Fox, \nMethodist; Lt. John P. Washington, Roman Catholic; Lt. Clark V. \nPolling, Dutch Reformed; and Lt. Alexander D. Goode, Jewish, brought \nhope and light to those around them.\n  The Arctic air made protection from the cold essential to those \nhoping to survive the night. As one sailor, Petty Officer John J. \nMahoney, tried to return to his cabin to retrieve his gloves, he was \nstopped by Rabbi Goode. ``I have two pairs,'' the Rabbi said, handing \nthe sailor the pair he had been wearing. In retrospect, Mahoney \nrealized the Rabbi could not have had an extra pair and had sacrificed \nhis only gloves to aide the sailor.\n  As the ship sank, the four chaplains distributed jackets and words of \nencouragement to those remaining. When there were no more life jackets \nleft, the four removed their own preservers and handed them to the \nsailors next in line, sealing their own fate. Approximately 18 minutes \nafter it was hit, the Dorchester sank. The last sight many of the \nsurvivors recall was the four chaplains, arms linked, praying together \nwith over 600 men still on board.\n  The sinking of the Dorchester 55 years ago not only showed the \nchaplains' tremendous strength of spirit, but also illuminated their \nracial and religious tolerance. In an era of prejudice, these four men \nembraced ideas on interfaith relationships. These men shared a special \nbrotherhood which lasted until the very end.\n  Mr. President, there are people in history who stand apart from the \nrest, and who go above and beyond what is demanded by their fellow men \nand women. Rabbi Goode and the three other chaplains were such men. I \nask my colleagues to join me in honoring the memory of these truly \nremarkable heroes. Their story and the lessons it teaches will not soon \nbe forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6500-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6500-S6501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TEXAS HATE CRIME\n\n Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I want to offer my heartfelt \ncondolences to the family and friends of James Byrd Jr., who was \nbrutally murdered last week in Jasper, Texas. I am deeply saddened that \nwe in this day and age still have this type of crime being committed in \nour nation.\n  I am even more outraged that this monstrous crime is being copied \nacross the nation, from Louisiana to my own home state of Illinois. \nJust this past weekend, the Belleville News-Democrat reported that a \n17-year-old from Belleville, Illinois, had to be rushed to the hospital \nafter three youths grabbed him by his shirt and then dragged him until \nhe fell under the wheels of their jeep. All the while they shouted \nracial epithets at him.\n  This violence must be stopped. Unless we take swift action to end \nthese atrocities, we run the risk of endangering all the progress we \nhave made toward undoing the ugly legacy of racism. We must stop \ncopycat acts of cowardice from undermining the basic freedoms that we \nall are entitled to enjoy.\n  Every act of violence is reprehensible. Hate crimes are especially \ntroubling, however, because they impact not only the victim, but the \nentire community. When a person is singled out and targeted for a hate \ncrime, other members of that community feel isolated, vulnerable, and \nunprotected by the law. Hate crimes send a message to all members of a \ncommunity that they are not free to walk the streets, to own property, \nor to enjoy their fundamental rights as Americans simply because of how \nthey look or what they believe.\n  But these crimes do not occur only on the back roads of our nation. \nIn 1996, 6,768 crimes committed across the nation were motivated by \nracial bias; 1,497 by religious bias; 1,258 by sexual-orientation bias; \nand 1,179 by ethnic bias. 333 of these crimes occurred in my home state \nof Illinois. The City of Chicago reported 175 incidents, the lowest \nnumber since the City began keeping records. Unfortunately, the \ninhumane nature of last week's brutal murder only remind us that there \nstill remains work to be done to fight the hate.\n  Back in 1963, when a fire bomb at the 16th street Baptist Church took \nthe lives of 4 children, the nation recoiled in horror at the cowardice \nand criminality of those who would resort to such violence. From that \nhorror, however, grew a consensus that hate crimes are un-American, and \nmust be exposed for what they are. The hood came off the hate.\n  We have since redoubled our effort, and must redouble our resolve \nthat never again will such crimes be ignored or overlooked or \nunpunished. We must continue to work together. This means educating one \nanother, building coalitions with our neighbors, and standing together \nagainst racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry.\n  The Administration is doing their part. In June of 1997, President \nClinton announced One America in the 21st Century: The President's \nInitiative on Race. This Initiative has proven critical to initiating \nthe dialogue on race in this country that is essential if we are ever \nto live as one.\n  But we should do our part as well. I am a cosponsor of Hate Crimes \nPrevention Act, which was introduced by Senator Kennedy in November of \nlast year. This bill would strengthen laws to protect Americans from \nhate crimes. We should act swiftly to pass this law,\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nand to send a message to the American people that hate crimes will not \nbe tolerated.\n  Again, I want to commend the people of Jasper, Texas for coming \ntogether in this time of tragedy and saying no to hate in their \ncommunity. Their actions of reconciliation are an example for all of us \nto follow in times of moral crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6500-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE HOSPITAL CORPS OF THE U.S. NAVY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today is the 100th anniversary of the \nHospital Corps of the United States Navy. On June 17,1898, President \nMcKinley established the Hospital Corps which has recorded an \nillustrious history of service to the nation. The men and women who \nserve and have served as corpsmen have honored the nation, the Navy and \nthemselves. They have upheld the highest traditions of service to the \nnation.\n  As a group, corpsmen have been the most highly decorated men and \nwomen who have served in our nation's military. Every day they put \ntheir lives at risk in the course of performing one of our highest \ncallings as human beings, the preservation and protection of life.\n  Individually, during the course of their 100 year history, 1962 \ncorpsmen have paid the ultimate price while administering to their \nwounded comrades on the battlefield. Twenty-seven times, their actions \nwere so extraordinary that the individual was awarded the Congressional \nMedal of Honor.\n  There is a little known fact about a widely hailed piece of American \nhistory. On February 23, 1945, six young men raised our national colors \non top of Mount Suribachi on the island of Iwo Jima. A world renowned \nphotograph was taken and this photograph became a symbol of the self-\nsacrifice and devotion to duty of the United States Marine Corps and \nour nation's military in general. What is little known is that the \nsecond young man from the base of the flagpole, was a U.S. Navy \ncorpsman. Only days before, that young man, Pharmacist Mate Second \nClass John Bradley, during the assault of Iwo Jima, pulled a young \nMarine to safety and bandaged his wounds while braving severe machine \ngun and mortar fire from a determined enemy. For his actions, \nPharmacist Mate Bradley was awarded the Navy Cross. This extraordinary \nindividual as with his other compatriots in that photo is even more \nextraordinary because of his anonymity. They were there for the photo \nby chance, they became the symbol we so readily recognize by a twist of \nfate. But they carried out their duties as thousands of other young \nAmericans had done before them and since, in the most terrible of \ncircumstances.\n  Corpsmen have been the protective blanket our soldiers, sailors, and \nMarines have relied upon in their times of greatest distress. They have \nbeen there for them to heal their wounds, to fend off the battlefield's \nangels of death, and sometimes to comfort them as life ebbed away. \nCorpsmen are representative of the best of our ideals. It is in that \nspirit I call upon my colleagues and all Americans to remember their \nsignificant contribution to our nation and celebrate this day in \nrecognition of their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6501-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SIGNING OF THE BULLETPROOF VESTS PARTNERSHIP GRANT ACT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday I had the privilege to \nattend the signing ceremony at the White House for the Bulletproof \nVests Partnership Grant Act, S. 1605, with Attorney General Reno, Vice \nPresident Gore and President Clinton, who signed the bill into law.\n  I was honored to be joined at the ceremony by Vermont State Police \nCaptain A. Marc Metayer and Springfield, Vermont Police Chief Barbara \nHiggins, who represented state and local law enforcement officers in my \nhome state. Captain Metayer spoke on the importance of this new law and \nintroduced the President of the United States.\n  I am very proud of the remarks of Captain Metayer and I ask that his \nremarks be printed at this point in the Record.\n  The remarks follow:\n\n  Remarks of Captain A. Marc Metayer, Troop ``B'' Commander, Vermont \n                      State Police, June 16, 1998\n\n       I am honored to have the opportunity to speak at the \n     signing of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of \n     1998. I would like to thank Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont \n     and Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado for their \n     efforts in making this life-saving grant a reality.\n       As Senator Leahy knows, the need for body armor for Vermont \n     law enforcement officers was highlighted by the two-state \n     manhunt for Carl Drega, last August. Drega killed four people \n     in Colebrook, New Hampshire, including New Hampshire State \n     Troopers Scott Phillips and Leslie Lord. He then traveled \n     into Vermont where he wounded four more officers during two \n     separate encounters. Drega was killed in the final exchange \n     of gunfire with a combined force of Vermont, New Hampshire \n     and Federal law enforcement officers.\n       I know these circumstances from first hand experience. I \n     was the on scene incident commander for the Vermont State \n     Police when Drega was finally stopped.\n       The Drega incident brought home the fact that no area of \n     the country, regardless of its remote nature, is immune from \n     senseless violence: violence against our citizens and \n     violence against our law enforcement officers. Law \n     enforcement officers must be prepared for such violence at \n     any time, and any place.\n       The Drega incident erupted from a regular traffic stop in \n     which the Troopers were going to remove registration plates \n     from Drega's vehicle. Moments later, two Troopers were dead, \n     horrifying their families and their communities. All from an \n     activity which law enforcement officers perform countless \n     times each day: a traffic stop for a minor violation.\n       In the twenty years that I have served as a Vermont State \n     Trooper, I have worn body armor as a part of my daily \n     routine. For those twenty years, I have personally purchased \n     successive vests since the State did not provide them. I have \n     been fortunate enough to be in a financial position that \n     allowed me to make these important purchases. But I have \n     known many officers, most with young families, who simply \n     could not afford to purchase body armor.\n       The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act will provide the \n     funding to assist police departments with the purchase of \n     body armor for their officers. Every state in the nation has \n     communities that need this help to provide their law \n     enforcement officers with this basic protection. In the end, \n     this new law will save the lives of law enforcement officers \n     in each and every state.\n       Thank you to all that have made this important contribution \n     to the safety of police officers around the country.\n       I am now honored to introduce the President of the United \n     States, President Bill Clinton. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6501-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE NEWBROOK FIRE DEPARTMENT IN HONOR OF THEIR FIFTIETH \n                                BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS.

For fifty years, the Department \nhas given prompt and reliable service to people in the most distressing \nsituations. It gives me great pleasure to recognize today fifty years \nof service and achievement of the Newbrook Fire Department and, more \nimportantly, the volunteers who support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6501-3", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6501-S6503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING\n\n Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, today, I want to speak on an issue \nof critical importance to my state of Nebraska. Whenever I travel back \nto the Good Life, what Nebraskans call their home, the one issue that \nalways percolates to the top of any conversation is the lack of \naffordable housing, and this issue can dominate any spirited civic \ndialogue in our smaller communities throughout the state.\n  Talking with city officials, economic development groups, community \nplanners, chambers of commerce representatives, and any of the town \npeople who are deeply concerned about the prospects of their community, \nit is apparent to me, as sure as the Nebraska summer sky is blue, that \nmore needs to be done to make sure communities\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\nhave the necessary tools to produce affordable housing and create more \nhome ownership opportunities.\n  Home ownership should not be a far away dream, it should be a choice \nfor many more Americans. Owning a home, some say, is not a right or \nprivilege. I say owning a home is part of the American dream and should \nbe a reachable goal for more Americans.\n  There are great examples of home ownership programs throughout this \ncountry, and I would like to share with you some of the exciting and \ninnovative ideas people are trying in Nebraska.\n  Since 1990 the Lincoln Housing Authority (LHA) has enabled over 200 \nfamilies to achieve their goal of owning a home through an innovative \nHome Ownership Program. LHA makes loans to qualified clients up to a \nmaximum of $3,750. And each year the buyer remains in the home and is \nin compliance, 20% of the loan will be forgiven.\n  LHA also has an exciting project called Lease-Purchase Program which \nis a joint venture with the Lincoln Public Schools. Students who are in \nresidential construction trade classes build one single family home a \nyear. When the home is completed, the house is placed under a lease-\npurchase agreement with the understanding the tenants will purchase the \nhouse at the end of the five year lease period.\n  LHA, through innovation and unique partnerships, has made a huge \ndifference in communities throughout Lincoln, where families who once \nthought home ownership was impossible, not see it as something that can \nbe achieved.\n  The Holy Name Housing Corproation, along with South Omaha Affordable \nHousing, have implemented a 32 single family rental project called the \nCrown Project. The project, financed by low income tax credits, \nCommunity Development Block Grant funds, and private financing, is an \nincubator for home ownership. These new single family homes located in \nNorth and South Omaha neighborhoods are rented to tenants committed to \nhome ownership. This is an exciting project for members of these \nneighborhoods and an excellent example of what efficient partnerships \ncan produce.\n  Another fine example of what Nebraskans are doing is the example of \nthe Kearney Housing Authority (KHA) and how they are seeking prudent \npartnerships that fill a need for the community of Kearney. KHA, along \nwith the University of Nebraska at Kearney's Construction and \nTechnology Department and the Platte Valley State Bank and Trust, is \nable to provide homeownership opportunities to families at income \nlevels who otherwise could not afford it.\n  What KHA did was bring in the Platte Valley State Bank and Trust--\nwith their financial expertise and competitive interest rates--and the \nUniversity--who served as the contractor and the providers of excellent \nhands-on education for its students--to form a most qualified \npartnership. KHA served as ``the owner'' and saw the project from \nbeginning to the end, which resulted in a huge success story, as \nfamilies were given the chance to own a home for the first time, while \nthe Kearney community received commitments from families who wanted to \ninvest in Kearney.\n  As Americans are discussing this week how to improve home ownership \nopportunities and make it a reality for many more in their communities, \nI want to focus on rural Nebraska and how we need to make home \nownership and affordable housing a reality for towns throughout \nNebraska.\n  In 1996, a series of seven Nebraska regional focus groups comprised \nof community representatives and development professionals were asked \n``What are the most important things to focus on in the next 12-24 \nmonths in your community?'' The top four priorities were leadership \ndevelopment, regional collaboration, technology, and housing.\n  Housing is a fundamental community need. It enhances or erodes a \ncommunity's image and its appeal to business, industry, and, most \nimportantly, the people who live there or may want to live there. \nHousing is a fundamental human need. Without decent, safe and \naffordable places to live, people lack a resource that enables them to \npursue a quality of life that many others possess.\n  As some communities in Nebraska have seen former residents and new \nfolks moving to their town, they find that their town does not have the \nhousing supply to satisfy this new demand. Also, attracted by our \nstate's economic development efforts, businesses are seriously \nconsidering rural Nebraska, but become hesitant about locating there \nwhen it is evident there is a lack of housing for the workers they aim \nto employ.\n  To ensure that job opportunities are not lost in our communities, to \nencourage population growth and to improve the quality of life for many \nNebraskans, the serious lack of available and affordable housing must \nbe addressed. Housing must be viewed as a component of every \ncommunity's economic development future.\n\n\n                             AFFORDABILITY\n\n  Financing affordable housing is challenging in general, but the small \nproject located in a small town probably poses the greatest challenge \nof them all. Because of its size, a small project does not have the \neconomies of scale that a larger project has, which creates a financial \nchallenge to acquire resources into these areas. These projects cannot \nbe ignored.\n  42 percent of Nebraska's 1.6 million people live in communities of \n5,000 or less. Many of the new jobs coming into these towns are \nprocessing and manufacturing jobs, where wages range from $5 to $8 an \nhour, which is less than $17,000 annually. Indeed, the 1994 average per \ncapita income in rural areas was $19,100 as compared to $22,444 in \nmetropolitan areas.\n  According to the Nebraska Homebuilders, the average cost to build a \nnew house is $120,000 and can get higher in rural areas when lack of \ncredit, few building sites, cost of infrastructure development, and \ntransportation and labor costs are taken into consideration. These \nnumbers strongly suggest most rural Nebraskans will not be able to \nafford new housing.\n\n\n                              AVAILABILITY\n\n  Increased demand coupled with limited production, increased building \ncosts, and an aging housing stock has produced a severe housing \nshortage in many communities.\n  In 1996, the Nebraska Affordable Housing Trust Fund estimated that \nNebraska communities need, over 5 years, approximately 35,000 housing \nunits to address population growth, to replace housing units that are \nsubstandard--29 percent of the housing stock was 58 years or older in \n1996--and to address the issues of affordability.\n  Because of the population decline of the 1980s, housing quality in \nrural Nebraska has suffered. Many home builders and contractors went \nout of business due to the lack of market. Without new homes to augment \nthe older homes, the present housing market does not meet the needs of \npresent demand. In essence, there are housing gaps.\n  Also, a greater portion of housing in rural areas is inhabited by \nsenior citizens who may not have the money, energy, or desire to \nimprove their homes. Older homes often fall off the market because they \naren't inhabitable anymore.\n  From a federal standpoint, there are several tools pending in the \n105th Congress that can be instrumental to communities throughout this \ncountry in need of affordable housing. I support these tools and aim to \npromote them among my Senate colleagues.\n  First, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) is probably the most \nimportant tool today that can create affordable housing in communities. \nIn Nebraska, the LIHTC will be most effective in serving the affordable \nhousing needs of the elderly. Also, it can be a great stepping stone \nfor families moving into rural communities who need sound stability and \nthen can proceed to search for home ownership options, if that is what \nthey desire.\n  The LIHTC was created in the 1986 tax reform bill in the wake of \ndecreasing appropriations for federally-assisted housing. LIHTC \nfinances most affordable rental housing produced in Nebraska for low \nincome working families, the elderly, and people with special needs.\n  Last year's GAO report on the LIHTC gave the program a healthy and \nfavorable review. The GAO report said the program is doing more than \nwhat federal law even expected in serving the needs of the low-income. \nErnst & Young assessed the program, reiterated\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\nthe GAO report, and said the present cap does not meet the needs for \nour communities.\n  Presently, the cap has not been adjusted for 10 years and inflation \nhas muted the effectiveness of this tool for investments into \ncommunities. 45% of its purchasing power has been reduced. The present \ncap has created a situation where low-income needs are not being met.\n  According to Tim Kenny, Executive Director of the Nebraska Investment \nFinance Authority, which distributes the tax credit throughout the \nstate, applications for the LIHTC far outnumber our state's supply. The \nneed is overwhelming.\n  Because of this situation, I strongly support Senate Bill 1252 which \nwould increase the cap per person under the LIHTC from $1.25 to $1.75. \nThis would allow affordable housing projects that are pending in \nNebraska to go through and be utilized in areas that need housing the \nmost.\n  A second federal tool that can be extremely helpful in Nebraska are \nprivate activity tax-exempt bonds. State and local governments can sell \ntax-exempt bonds and then pass on the savings to lower income first-\ntime homebuyers and for the construction of low cost rental apartments.\n  Presently, the cap on private activity tax-exempt bonds, set in 1986, \nis at $150 million, or $50 per capita. The cap applies to issuers of \ntax-exempt bonds for housing, economic development and other needed \ninvestments in communities. Cap growth is limited to State population \nincreases, but not inflation.\n  Similar to the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, the cap has not been \nadjusted for ten years and inflation has muted some of the \neffectiveness of this tool for investments into communities. The \npresent cap has created a situation where demand for capped bonds has \nfar exceeded supply. An example is the large demand for mortgage \nrevenue bonds which can be used to finance first-time homes for lower \nincome families. An increase in the cap could lead to housing \nconstruction in areas of Nebraska which need it most.\n  Senate Bill 1251 would increase the private activity tax-exempt bond \ncap to $250 million, or $75 per capita, and index it to inflation. I \nstrongly support this bill as it could bring the dream of owning a home \nor renting a decent apartment closer to many Nebraskans. We have many \nqualified projects pending in Nebraska. They need to go forward.\n  The other federal tool that Congress needs to enact into law this \nyear is to increase the FHA loan limit and simplify the down payment \ncalculations for these loans.\n  Presently, 250 different loan limits exist throughout the country. \nThis provision would establish one limit by raising all existing limits \nto $227,150.\n  The FHA mortgage program helps meet home financing needs for people \nwho are not served by the private market. Many times, the down payment \nis the biggest barrier to home ownership and the FHA loan guarantee \nhelps overcome this obstacle.\n  In the rural communities of Nebraska the FHA loan limit is $81,548. \nIn non-metro areas only 14 percent of all new homes sell for less than \nexisting rural FHA loan limits. With a loan limit of $81,548, the FHA \nloan, an effective tool for providing affordable housing, can not be \nimplemented in a useful manner. The costs, as mentioned before, of \nbuilding new quality housing, not tin huts, in most of our Nebraska \ncommunities are beyond the present FHA loan limit. We have to raise the \nlimit if we are to utilize this tool\n  Each year, FHA operates at no cost to the taxpayer. Price Waterhouse \nreported that FHA insurance premiums and loan loss recovery proceeds \nmore than cover the cost of claims and operations. This proposal will \nincrease new home ownership in Nebraska and I strongly support it.\n  Passing these legislative proposals is important to getting tools to \nNebraskans to create more affordable housing and home ownership \nopportunities in our communities. I will work hard to seek enactment of \nthese bills into law and I appreciate the support and help of \nNebraskans who are also working hard on making affordable housing and \nhome ownership a reality in our state. Home ownership does not have to \nbe a dream, it can be a reality. These tools bring that reality closer \nto more Nebraskans.\n  I also would like to mention an extremely important tool that does \nnot require a federal law and can work just as well. That tool is \ncommunication. In Nebraska, we have many hard working people within \nexcellent organizations who toil long hours to bring affordable housing \nand homeownership opportunities to people throughout the State. They \nunderstand the importance of home ownership and know what a dream like \nowning your own home can do for a family that finally reaches that \ngoal.\n  I ask the communities of Nebraska to communicate with each other. \nWhat works great in one community might work just as great in the \ncommunity one county over, but they might not be aware of such success. \nCommunities can talk together, ask questions, meet and discuss how each \nother are getting along. Indeed, communication can be the best tool in \ncreating affordable housing and home ownership. Learning from each \nother can only make us better and more aware, and we should always \nencourage more participation and more exchange of ideas.\n  As I have already talked about exciting new projects occurring in my \nstate, I would also like to point out there are many organizations with \nhousing specialists throughout the state who are instrumental in \ngetting resources to our communities. People working at these places \nhave ideas, they have know how and are experts in finding the means to \nget affordable housing to where it is needed. Along with these \ndedicated professionals, we have, throughout Nebraska, active non-\nprofits with missions that make the quality of life for their \nneighborhoods the highest priority. Couple that fact with an army of \ndedicated volunteers means that home ownership and affordable housing \nis a realistic goal for each of our towns. Nebraska is lucky to have \nsuch resources.\n  We need to give these local groups the tools they need to improve the \navailability of affordable, quality housing. The three tools that I \nhave mentioned can help people in these communities achieve the \nAmerican Dream and should be enacted sooner rather than later.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6501-4", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6503-S6504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GEORGIAN CONFLICT\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, disturbing events taking place around \nthe world pose grave challenges to our U.S. strategic interests. In \nPakistan and India, nuclear weapons are being developed, assembled and \ntested, escalating an arms race in the region. In Indonesia, the \ncollapse of the rupiah has caused an economic and political crisis that \nhas reverberated throughout the international financial markets. In \nChina, missile proliferation looms ominously as evidence suggest that \nChina conspired to sell entire missiles to other nations. And, in the \nformer Yugoslavia province of Kosovo, NATO defense ministers have \nlaunched air exercises in an effort to convince Serbian dictator \nSlobodan Milosevic to halt his crackdown on the separatist ethnic \nAlbanians in what has become Europe's most threatening security crisis \nsince the 1992-95 Bosnian war.\n  These are just some of the more widely known international crises--\nrequiring U.S. vigilance to protect its strategic interests. But there \nare lesser known struggles in remote and distant lands that have \nsignificant implications for U.S. foreign policy. One of these that \ndeserves our attention is the conflict in the Republic of Georgia and \nits small break-away region of Abkhazia. In the wake of the recent \narmed insurrection in Abkahazia, U.S. efforts to ensure Georgia \nachieves and sustains political independence and economic stability \nmust be enhanced.\n  Of all the newly independent states to emerges from the breakup of \nthe former Soviet Union, Georgia is considered the most pro-western \nnascent democracy. Since its independence in 1991, Georgia has faced \nand begun to surmount formidable problems of economic collapse, civil \nwar, separatist conflict, rampant crime, political infighting, and \nhuman rights abuses. Much to Russia's chagrin, Georgian President \nEduard Shevardnadze has exerted strong leadership by moving Georgia \naway from Russia's sphere of influence. He has pursued an independent \nforeign policy, ushered in democratic and market reforms, and\n\n[[Page S6504]]\n\nachieved annual growth rates of 10 percent.\n  Moreover, Georgia is a NATO borderland and at the entry point to the \nemerging new ``Silk Road'' that traverses Central Europe to China. This \ncommercial route will eventually encompass oil and gas pipelines, \nroads, railroads, bridges, airports and communications networks. It \nwill completely alter the region's economic and political landscape. \nBecause Georgia is situated at a critical juncture in the corridor, \nstability in this state, and its neighbors, is essential. There are \nsigns of a Russian strategy to keep the region frozen in instability, \nthereby discouraging commercial investment, and ultimately forcing \nnascent democracies and their resources back into Russia's tacit \ncontrol.\n  The small, breakaway region of Abkhazia has been Russia's best \navailable instrument to diminish Georgia's accomplishments and to \nimperil its remarkable gains. Numerous and compelling reports, \nincluding eye-witness accounts by Georgian refugees, suggest active \nRussian involvement in arming, training and sustaining Abkhazia's so-\ncalled freedom fighters against Georgian nationals.\n  In this context, I am very concerned by indications of Russian \nactivities and covert aggression aimed at eroding public support for \nPresident Shevardnadze and his administration. I regard Georgian \nindependence from Russian hegemony as a critical first step toward \nstability in the region.\n  I strongly encourage the administration to end its neglect of this \nsituation and become actively engaged. The administration should state \nunequivocally that it stands behind the leadership of Georgian \nPresident Eduard Shevardnadze; that the stability and survival of an \nindependent, democratic Georgia is in our national interest; and that \nthe U.S. will consider all appropriate measures necessary to help build \ncloser economic and political ties between Georgia and the United \nStates. Finally, the administration should call the Russians to task \nfor engaging in activities that would re-subordinate Georgia to \nMoscow's rule.\n  Moreover, Congress should move expeditiously to secure enactment of \nthe ``Silk Road Strategy Act of 1997.'' This legislation is designed to \npromote sovereign and independent democratic governments; assist in the \ndevelopment of infrastructure necessary for communications, \ntransportation, energy and trade on an East-West axis; and promote \nmarket-oriented principles and practices among Central Asian and South \nCaucasus countries. Passage would help curb Russian hegemony in the \nregion and contain the spread northward of anti-western Islamic \nextremism. The legislation is designed to assist all the nations of the \nregion--Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhastan, Kyrgyzstan, \nTurkmenistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.\n  Russia is again increasing its grip on the region and working to keep \nthese countries from maintaining their independence. Iran continues to \nexert influence to foster anti-western attitudes. It is critical that \nwe help these countries look westward to contain extremist forces \nhostile to U.S. interests--and this is a good place to start.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6503-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MRS. ROSEMARIE PECILLO KNOWLTON\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mrs. \nRosemarie Pecillo Knowlton. For almost 50 years, Rosemarie has \ndedicated her life to education. She will be sincerely missed after her \nretirement from Sacred Heart Parish School.\n  At the age of four, Rosemarie asked to attend school with some of her \nolder friends. The principal allowed her to begin, believing it was \nprobably just a ``phase.'' This phase turned into a teaching career. \nSuch was her desire to teach, that immediately after graduating high \nschool, Rosemarie took a teaching position which required her to travel \non four modes of public transportation just to commute back and forth.\n  When Rosemarie transferred to a position closer to home, she decided \nto continue her own formal education by taking night classes at \nVillanova University. There, she met her future husband, Arthur L. \nKnowlton. They were married in 1956. As her son, Arthur, Jr., graduated \nfrom high school in 1975, Rosemarie also received her degree from \nVillanova.\n  Rosemarie never saw teaching as a job that began and ended with \nmorning and afternoon bells. She enriched her students through \nforensics, the annual Science Fair, and CCD classes. She also directed \nthe school's music shows, the Parish Living Stations of the Cross, and \nthe Living Rosary.\n  Mr. President, the lives Rosemarie has touched are too numerous to \ncount. She is leaving a legacy of dedication and accomplishment, and \nher son, Richard, carries on the family's teaching tradition. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me both in congratulating Rosemarie for 46 years of \ndedication to the children of southeastern Pennsylvania and in \nextending the Senate's best wishes to the Knowltons as Rosemarie \nretires to devote all of her time to her husband, children, and seven \ngrandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6504-1", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6504-S6505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AMERICA-ISRAEL FRIENDSHIP LEAGUE CELEBRATES ISRAEL'S 50TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to inform the Senate of a \ncelebration being held later this evening in New York's historic Gracie \nMansion. New York City's Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his wife Donna \nHanover will be joining the America-Israel Friendship League and the \nJewish Community Relations Council of New York in hosting a gala dinner \ncelebrating the State of Israel's Golden Jubilee. It is most \nappropriate that the city with the largest Jewish population in the \nworld is hosting this official celebration of Israel's fiftieth \nanniversary.\n  The members of the Senate are familiar with the important work of the \nAmerica-Israel Friendship League (AIFL), a national, non-sectarian \norganization committed to maintaining and strengthening the historic, \nmutually supportive relationship between the peoples of the United \nStates and Israel. Founded in 1971, the AIFL's activities generate bi-\npartisan support in reaching out to our citizens of all faiths and \nethnic backgrounds in an effort to educate Americans and Israelis about \nthe common interests they share. With a membership and leadership \ncomprised of political, religious, labor, business, and community \nactivists of all faiths, the diversity of the AIFL's membership makes \nits efforts even more extraordinary. The distinguished publisher \nMortimer Zuckerman currently serves as the League's president, one of \nNew York's leading attorneys Kenneth Bialkin serves as chairman of the \nboard, and the talented Ilana Artman is the League's executive vice \npresident.\n  As a non-sectarian, people-to-people organization, the AIFL is \ndevoted to fostering cultural and economic ties between the United \nStates and Israel and to strengthening the unique friendship between \nour country and the only democracy in the entire history of the Middle \nEast. Throughout Israel's first half century. the people of Israel have \nstruggled to survive in a hostile region. Enduring five wars, they have \nmost recently embarked on an historic journey in search of peace.\n  The United States' support for Israel is grounded in an appreciation \nof the shared values and principles that are at the foundation of \nAmerican and Israeli societies. Israel is the only country in the \nMiddle East that, like the United States, is founded on the rights and \nprivileges that guarantee a free society: elected government; freedom \nof speech; freedom of the press; an independent judiciary; and the rule \nof law. There have been just fourteen free elections in the entire \nhistory of the Middle East: all fourteen have been held in the State of \nIsrael since 1948.\n  To promote the unique friendship between these two great democracies, \nthe AIFL has successfully mobilized a coalition of Americans of all \nages and backgrounds to participate in a broad range of cultural and \neducational programs. Three of our most revered former members--Frank \nChurch, Hubert Humphrey, and Jacob Javits--played major roles in \ncreating the League in 1971, and I can testify to how strongly they \nbelieved in the League's mission and responsibilities.\n  I ask that a report on tonight's dinner be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S6505]]\n\n  Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the American-Israel Friendship League \n        Join in Major New York City 50th Anniversary Celebration\n\n       Mayor Rudolph W. Giulinai and the American-Israel \n     Friendship League announce that a gala celebration of \n     Israel's 50th anniversary will be held at Gracie Mansion on \n     Wednesday evening, June 17, 1998.\n       Mayor Giuliani, who serves with Edgar Bronfman as co-chair \n     of New York City's Official Host Committee for Israel's \n     Fiftieth Birthday, has agreed to open his home for a gala \n     dinner marking 50 years of US-Israel friendship and joint \n     achievements. The evening's guests will include leaders of \n     the US and Israeli governments; faith communities; industry \n     and community organizations.\n       ``I am particularly proud to host this special event, in \n     celebration of Israel's historic 50th Anniversary and in \n     commemoration of our shared traditions of democracy,'' said \n     Mayor Giuliani. ``This exciting gala will be an important \n     part of New York City's celebration of Israel's important \n     milestone birthday.''\n       The dinner will celebrate Israel's accomplishments and will \n     recognize and honor US and Israeli individuals, organizations \n     and companies for their joint achievements. The United States \n     and Israel have a long record of cooperation on strategic, \n     scientific research, economic development and education \n     projects. These initiatives have generated remarkable \n     breakthroughs and have had a major impact on medical \n     research, international communications, agriculture, computer \n     and high technology, and many other areas.\n       ``It will be an exciting evening'' said Mortimer B. \n     Zuckerman, Publisher of the New York Daily News and President \n     of the American-Israel Friendship League. ``The Gracie \n     Mansion gala will bring together a cross section of society, \n     people of all parties and stripes, from both sides of the \n     ocean, coming together in New York City in celebration of the \n     strength of US-Israel friendship and cooperation.''\n       ``The dinner will be a festive occasion with an important \n     message,'' said Kenneth J. Bialkin, Partner of the law firm \n     Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, and chairman of the \n     AIFL's Board of Directors. ``It will highlight the mutual \n     benefits to both the United States and Israel of our close, \n     long-standing relationship. It is an association based on \n     common values, on shared interests and on genuine friendship \n     between our two peoples.''\n       The American-Israel Friendship League is a national, non-\n     sectarian organization committed to maintaining and \n     strengthening the historic bonds between the people of the \n     United States and Israel. Founded in 1971, the League's \n     activities generate bi-partisan support in reaching out to \n     all faiths, ethnic backgrounds, all age groups and political \n     persuasions in an effort to educate Americans and Israelis \n     about the common interests that they share.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1998/06/17/senate-section/article/S6504-2", "month": "06", "year": "1998"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6505]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JUNE 18, 1998\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.
