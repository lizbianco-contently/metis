The pending question is the Coats amendment \nNo. 1249. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I am pleased that over the last few days we have had the \nopportunity to debate what I think is a very vital and very important \nissue, particularly one that affects low-income children in the \nDistrict of Columbia. We have had a number of debates on the Senate \nfloor on the question of vouchers for students to have a choice to \nattend another school because the parents do not feel the school their \nchild is in is providing the education they need to succeed.\n\n[[Page S10186]]\n\n  We have a particularly acute situation in the District of Columbia \nwhereby a number of children find themselves trapped in schools, in \nparticularly low-income, primarily minority neighborhoods, with \nvirtually no way out. We know that many aspire to be pro athletes, and \nI join that group that aspires to do that, but unfortunately God only \ngives a very select few the kind of talent to do that. Education is one \nof the primary ways for young people to better their circumstances, \nparticularly in situations where children of limited means or \npractically no means find themselves locked in a situation that gives \nthem no choice. Then their opportunities for meaningful and gainful \nemployment in the workplace or for continued education to give them \nbetter opportunities is forfeited.\n  The D.C. Scholarship Program is something that Senator Lieberman and \nI have coauthored and have worked to pass. We are moving toward a very \nimportant vote at 11 o'clock that will allow us to continue the debate, \nwhich I think is not just a debate focused on this bill but a debate \nthat this Senate, Congress, the President, and the entire country \nshould be engaging in: How do we improve our education system? It has \nbeen nearly a decade and a half since the report ``A Nation at Risk.'' \nThat report cited the mediocrity of American public education. There \nhave been a number of reforms that have taken place in different parts \nof the country, but it seems that those who are left behind are those \nwho occupy low-income homes, mostly minority students in failing \nschools, urban school systems.\n  Now, our goal is not to replace the public school system in the \nDistrict of Columbia or anywhere else. Clearly, given the number of \nstudents we have, the limited availability of private schools, we need \nto find ways to strengthen the public school system. We believe that \nthis offers an opportunity to provide that impetus, that spur, to help \nmove along the necessary reforms in the D.C. public school system. We \nalso believe it offers an opportunity to 2,000 children in the District \nto better their situation, to utilize the voucher to provide an \nopportunity for a better education. So this bill would provide \nscholarships for 2,000 young people in grades K through 12 in the \nDistrict of Columbia that are at or below 185 percent of poverty. It \nwould also provide tutoring help for those who chose to stay within the \npublic schools but needed some assistance in terms of reading and math.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield at this particular time. I know we have a \nlimited amount of time. Senator Lieberman and I will be dividing that \ntime up, and I believe we have one or two other speakers on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I oppose the voucher amendment to the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill. Students in the District of Columbia \ndeserve good public schools, safe public schools, well-trained teachers \nand a decent education. Vouchers will undermine all of these essential \ngoals by undermining the public schools, not helping them.\n  Vouchers will simply subsidize private school tuition for 3 percent \nof the students in the public schools and leave the other 97 percent of \nthe students even worse off. Public funds should be used for public \nschool reforms that help all students, not to pay for a few public \nschool students to attend private and religious schools. Our goal is to \nimprove public schools, not encourage families to abandon them.\n  We all want the children of the District of Columbia to get the best \npossible education. We should be doing more, much more, to support \nefforts to improve the local schools in the District. We should oppose \nany plan that would undermine these efforts.\n  A year ago, as part of an overall effort to deal more effectively \nwith the serious financial and other challenges facing the District of \nColumbia, Gen. Julius Becton was appointed to improve the D.C. schools. \nGeneral Becton asked for $87 million to make the critical repairs \nnecessary to ensure that all schools would be ready to open for the \n1997-98 school year on time, yet only $50 million was appropriated by \nCongress to repair the schools. Requests for additional funding were \ninitially denied and were only made available by Congress at the last \nminute. So Congress bears part of the responsibility for the continuing \nproblems of the D.C. schools, including the festering problems that led \nto the embarrassing delayed opening of the schools this fall.\n  This voucher amendment would further undermine General Becton's \nefforts just as he is making headway in repairing D.C. schools, \nincreasing security and developing effective ways to improve the \nschools and help all students reach academic standards.\n  In addition, the voucher system would impose yet another bureaucracy, \nanother federally appointed board on the District of Columbia to use \nFederal funds to implement the voucher system. The nominations of six \nof the seven board members would be controlled by Republican leaders of \nCongress. Only one representative of the District of Columbia would \nserve on the corporation.\n  Instead of supporting local efforts to revitalize the schools, the \nvoucher proponents are attempting to make D.C. public schools a guinea \npig for an ideological experiment in education that voters in the \nDistrict of Columbia have soundly rejected and that voters across the \ncountry have soundly rejected, too. Our Republican colleagues have \nclearly been unable to generate any significant support for vouchers in \ntheir own States, and it is a travesty of responsible action for them \nto attempt to foist their discredited idea on the long-suffering people \nand long-suffering public schools of the District of Columbia. If \nvouchers are a bad idea for the public schools in 50 States, they are a \nbad idea for the public schools of the District of Columbia, too.\n  Many of us in Congress favor D.C. home rule and many of us in \nCongress believe that the people of the District of Columbia should be \nentitled to have voting representation in the Senate and the House, \nlike the people in every State. It is an embarrassment to our democracy \nthat the most powerful democracy on Earth denies the most basic right \nof any democracy--the right to vote--to the citizens of the Nation's \nCapital.\n\n  The District of Columbia is not a test tube for misguided Republican \nideological experiments on education. Above all, the District of \nColumbia is not a slave plantation. Republicans in Congress should \nstart treating the people of the District of Columbia with the respect \nthat they deserve.\n  General Becton, local leaders, and D.C. parents are working hard to \nimprove all D.C. public schools for all children. Congress should give \nthem its support, not undermine them.\n  We have here, Mr. President, the examples of some of the activities \nthat are taking place in the Walker Jones Elementary School in \nNorthwest Washington working with the Laboratory for Student Success, \nusing Community for Learning, a research-based reform model, and it is \nworking. The concept is called whole school reform. With increased and \nmore intensive teacher training, in proven methods and materials geared \ntoward better student learning, student test scores have improved. \nAfter 6 months in the program, the school raised its ranking in the \nDistrict on reading scores from 99th in 1996 to 36th in 1997. In math, \nthe school climbed from 81st in the District to 18th. It is working. \nThese kinds of investments are working in this particular school.\n  The John Tyler Elementary School in Southeast Washington uses the \nComer School Development Model Program to restructure school \nmanagement, curriculum, and teacher training. Teachers focus on reading \nand math instruction as well as hands-on learning in science and math. \nAll of the students in the Tyler School, of whom 95 percent come from \nlow-income families, are benefiting from the reforms. Academic \nachievement is going up. It is improving.\n  Spingarn High School in Northeast Washington has extended the day \nbecause they felt that school safety was a first priority. The school \nis a safe haven for students, and the academic standards are going up.\n  The District of Columbia has created the so-called Saturday academies \nfor students who read below grade level. The Saturday curriculum \nreinforces\n\n[[Page S10187]]\n\nthe weekly instruction and benefits from a reduced student-teacher \nratio, and the results show that it is working.\n  These are examples of what is taking place in the District of \nColumbia, working for all students. They should be encouraged. They \nshould be expanded. They should be given the resources to be able to \nimplement those programs.\n  Mr. President, $7 million would provide afterschool programs for \nevery school in the District of Columbia. That would benefit all \nstudents, not just a very small group.\n  Scarce education funds should be targeted to public schools. They do \nnot have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose \nchallenges, such as children with disabilities, limited English-\nproficient children, or homeless students. Vouchers will not help \nchildren who need the most help.\n  Voucher proponents argue that vouchers increase choice for parents. \nBut parental choice is a mirage. Private schools apply different rules \nthan public schools. Public schools must accept all children. Private \nschools can decide whether to accept a child or not. The real choice \ngoes to the schools, not the parents. The better the private school, \nthe more parents and students are turned away.\n  In fact, many private schools require children to take rigorous \nachievement tests, at the parents' expense, as a basic for admission to \nthe private schools. Lengthy interviews and complex selection processes \nare often mandatory. Private schools impose many barriers to admission. \nFew parents can even get to the schoolhouse door to find out if it is \nopen to their child. For the vast majority of families with children in \npublic schools, the so-called school choice offered by the voucher \nscheme is a hollow choice.\n  Public schools must take all children, and build a program to meet \neach of their needs. Private schools only take children who fit the \nguidelines of their existing programs. We should not use public tax \ndollars to support schools that choose some children, and reject \nothers.\n  There are also serious constitutional objections to the voucher \nscheme. The vast majority of private schools that charge tuition below \n$3,200 are religious schools. Providing vouchers to sectarian schools \nviolates the establishment clause of the first amendment of the U.S. \nConstitution. In many States voucher schemes would violate the State \nconstitution, too. Courts in Wisconsin, Ohio, and Vermont have all \nreached decisions this year upholding the ruling that the use of public \nfunds to pay for vouchers for religious schools is unconstitutional.\n  If voucher proponents genuinely wanted to help the children of the \nDistrict of Columbia obtain a good education, they would use the $7 \nmillion in this amendment to support reform efforts to improve the \npublic schools. Money is not the only answer to school reform, but it \nis a principal part of the answer. Public schools in States across the \ncountry are starved for funds, and so are the D.C. public schools.\n  We saw an example just this morning. The Ballou Senior High School \nhere in the District was forced to close due to a leaky roof caused by \nthe weekend rainstorms. Students were sent to Douglass Junior High \nSchool, one of the buildings closed by the District. Again, the \nstudents of the D.C. schools suffered because of poor facilities. Seven \nmillion dollars would begin the critical repairs to the 80 buildings \nthat did not get new roofs this year, to make sure that this will not \nhappen to other schools.\n  We know what works in school reform. Steps are available with proven \nrecords of success to improve teaching and instruction, reduce crowded \nclassrooms, and bring schools into the world of modern technology--let \nalone repairing crumbling schools facilities and making classrooms, \ncorridors, and playgrounds safe for children trying their best to learn \nin conditions that no private schools would tolerate.\n  Too often, with good reason, children in too many public schools in \ntoo many communities across the country feel left out and left behind. \nVouchers will only make that problem worse. Three percent of the \nstudents would be helped by enabling them to attend private schools, \nwhile 97 percent of the students are left even farther behind.\n  Supporting a few children at the expense of all the others is a \nserious mistake. We don't have to abandon the public schools in order \nto help. We should make investments that help all children in the D.C. \nschools to obtain a safer and better education. I hope my colleagues \nwill reject this amendment.\n  Again, we should not impose on the District of Columbia what voters \nin other States don't want. In the last year, voters in Colorado, \nWashington, and California have rejected the vouchers. In the past 10 \nyears, State legislatures in 16 States have voted this down. Even the \nTexas legislature rejected even the vouchers this year, and we should \nas well.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I note at the outset we should not \nimpose on the children of the District of Columbia what Members of the \nU.S. Senate are not willing to do. We did a survey of Members of the \nU.S. Senate to find out how many sent their children to the District of \nColumbia public schools. Of the 100 Members of the U.S. Senate, we were \nable to get ahold of 95 offices. We have not found an office yet that \nsends their children to the District of Columbia public schools.\n  Should we require students whose families do not have the income to \nbe able to either move to other schools or to go to private schools to \nstay in this public school system? I submit we should not. It is not \nfair to the kids.\n  Listen to the statistics. These are just the facts. No. 1, 78 percent \nof the fourth grade students are below basic reading achievement levels \nin the District of Columbia. I chaired this subcommittee. I have held \nnumerous hearings on this. I have gone to the schools. These are the \nfacts.\n  No. 2, 11 percent of the students in the D.C. public schools have \navoided going to school for safety reasons.\n  Fact No. 3, 11 percent of the students in the D.C. public schools \nreport being threatened or injured with a weapon during the past school \nyear.\n  Fact No. 4, this amendment provides low-income students and their \nparents a choice, a choice they currently do not have under the D.C. \npublic school system. Right now, pupils in the District do not have a \nchoice but to risk their lives and their potential for educational \nachievement by going to the D.C. public schools.\n  Fact No. 5, General Becton, who heads the reform in the District of \nColumbia public schools, said, ``Give me to the year 2000. We will fix \nthe schools up by the year 2000.'' And I am behind the General and the \nwork he is trying to do to make these public schools better. But if you \nare a first grade student that means you are going to be in the first \nand second and third grade in these schools that have failed the kids. \nAnd they have failed the children. Some of them have worked, but \noverall they have failed the students. They have to learn to read and \nwrite and add and subtract during those 3 years. That time is too \nvaluable to condemn those students to that type of situation.\n  It is not fair to the kids. If they had the wherewithal, if they had \nthe income, a number of them would move out to different schools in \nMaryland or Virginia or to private schools. They don't have the option \nto be able to do that. This is not fair to the kids, to condemn them to \nthis system. All we are asking is for students below that certain level \nof poverty, that they be able to have the possibility of doing what \nmost of the Members--in fact all we have been able to find, of the 95 \nthat we surveyed and got ahold of--all of the Members in the U.S. \nSenate do, and that is send their children to other schools because \nthis system has failed. This system has failed the children, according \nto the District of Columbia control board itself. This system has \nfailed the children. Let's not condemn that first grader, that second \ngrader, that third grader, not to be able to read or write by not \nallowing this choice.\n  One of my highest priorities as the chairman of the Senate \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, Restructing, and \nthe District of Columbia, is to make sure the children in the Nation's \ncapital are receiving the quality education they deserve. The \nDistrict's public schools, unfortunately, have failed too many \nstudents.\n\n[[Page S10188]]\n\nI'm pleased to join Senators Coats, Lieberman, and Landrieu in offering \nthis amendment to empower students and their parents in the District \nwith a choice in their education.\n  I, along with the distinguished ranking member of my subcommittee, \nSenator Lieberman, have held hearings to explore options to improve \npublic education in the District. I know there are public schools which \nare working and where students are thriving in their learning \nenvironment. I had the privilege to visit two schools in the District: \nStuart-Hobson Middle School and Options Public Charter School. I was \nimpressed by the success of their educational programs and how the \nstudents took pride in their education. The Options Public Charter \nSchool was especially interesting as an example for future charter \nschools in the District to follow. These schools, unfortunately, are \nexceptions in the District public school system.\n  The overall facts about the District public schools speak for itself: \n78 percent of fourth grade students are below basic reading achievement \nlevels; 11 percent of the D.C. public schools have avoided going to \nschool for safety reasons; and 11 percent of the students report being \nthreatened or injured with a weapon during the past year. We cannot \ncontinue to trap these students in an educational system that is \nfailing them.\n  This amendment provides low income students a choice they currently \ndo not have under the D.C. public school system. Right now, pupils in \nthe District do not have a choice but to risk their lives and their \npotential for educational achievement by going to the D.C. public \nschools. Right now, students in the District do not have a choice but \nto go to a D.C. public school knowing the glaring reality that the \nlonger they remain in the D.C. public schools, the less likely they \nwill succeed. The Coats-Lieberman-Brownback-Landrieu amendment would \ngive low-income students and parents the choice to enroll their \nchildren in a safe environment with high quality education at a private \nschool. Under this amendment, the parents and the students are \nempowered with a choice in their education. It is an immediate solution \nto an immediate crisis in the District.\n  Gen. Julius Becton, chief executive officer and superintendent of the \nDistrict of Columbia Public Schools, and the District of Columbia \nEmergency Transitional School Board of Trustees have said that they \nwill make significant improvements by the year 2000, and I recognize \nand respect the work that lies ahead of them. But the year 2000 is 3 \nschool years away. In three school years, a child progresses through \ngrades one through three in which they learn to read, write, add, \nsubtract, and so forth. These 3 school years are too valuable to force \nthese students to continue in the public school system that has not \ndelivered.\n  The focus of this amendment is on the low-income student in the D.C. \npublic schools. By providing up to $3,200 in individual scholarships to \nlow-income families who will choose the school for their children, this \namendment would give these students the chance to make sure the next \nthree school years do not go to waste while General Becton improves the \nD.C. public schools. Improving the chances for these children to get \nthe education they need is one of the most fundamental elements to \nrestore the Nation's capital into the shining city the United States \ndeserves.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Members to support the Coats amendment and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, \nthank you for leading this side.\n  Mr. President, this amendment--and this is the reason why we are \nvoting against cloture--this amendment would use $7 million of public \ntaxpayer funding to pay tuition at private schools. We are in battle to \nbalance the budget. I am proud to say we are making great progress. But \nI know that Americans agree that education is a priority and, while we \ncannot give every child a scholarship, while we cannot do everything we \nwant to do, while we cannot fund, as we would like, Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun's incredible initiative as we rebuild our crumbling \nschools--while we cannot do that, here we are diverting $7 million of \ntaxpayer funds and giving them to private schools.\n  Who are we helping in the District of Columbia? Who, under this idea, \ndo we contend would be helped? Mr. President, 2,000 out of 78,000 \nchildren; 3 percent. It is the 3 percent solution when we need a 100 \npercent solution. You know, you could really debate whether 3 percent \nof the kids would be helped. Because I have read this proposal, and I \nhave to tell you, if I were for vouchers I would have written it a \nlittle differently. Why do I say that? This allows schools to spring \nup, mom-and-pop-shop schools, untested, if they can show that they can \ndraw 25 children. Untested schools will spring up to grab this new \nsource of funding from Uncle Sam. Because, as we know, the good schools \nthat are touted around here, No. 1, many of them are filled up; No. 2, \nmost of them charge at least twice the tuition that these children will \nget. So we are, in essence, going to start a whole new cottage industry \nof people popping up with ``new schools,'' to grab this taxpayer money. \nTo supposedly help 3 percent of the kids. I contend 3 percent of the \nkids will not be helped by going to some of those operations.\n  So, I hope my colleagues will read this proposal because, if you read \nit, you learn a lot of interesting things. For example, a new board of \ndirectors is set up. This is a bureaucracy, folks --a new bureaucracy. \nThe board of directors are going to be political appointees, political \nappointees. So here we have a lot of talk about, ``get government out \nof our lives,'' and who is going to decide this? Political appointees: \nThe Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, is going to recommend these \nappointees to the President. Guess what, buried in that bill, the \npeople who sit on these boards can earn up to $5,000 a year in a \nstipend. That $5,000 is more than the tuition check for the child. So \nwe are creating a little cushy new bureaucracy here, with political \nappointees, to help 3 percent of the kids, which I contend would not be \nhelped.\n  So, I feel Members ought to look at this. My State, California, has \nrejected vouchers twice. Let me tell you the reason. The reason is they \nwant to help 100 percent of the kids. They are smart. They know the \nanswer lies in better schools. That's why we backed charter schools, \nthat's why we want national standards, to make sure that our children \nare living up to their potential. So these are the things that we want \nto do in California.\n  Mr. President, we could take this $7 million and we could do a lot of \nrepairs on some of these D.C. schools. Some of them need boilers, \nbecause it is freezing in those schools. We could set up an after-\nschool program. That is so important. We are doing it in Los Angles and \nSacramento, so these kids have something to say ``Yes'' to after \nschool. We could set up many of those after-school programs with this \n$7 million. By the way, just take the half-million off the top you are \ngoing to use for this new bureaucracy, you could fix a lot of schools. \nYou could put after-school programs in. You could mentor a lot of \nchildren.\n  So I want quality schools for every child in America. I think this is \na surrender. This is a surrender. And even with it, if it went into \nplace, in my view it would encourage these new little schools to pop \nup, untested, because somebody would get the idea: Oh, this is great. I \ncan get $3,500 per child. I will just set up my own school. And \nconvince this board of directors that is politically appointed that \nthey ought to be allowed to continue.\n  I hope we are going to reject this. I do not doubt for one moment \nthat the people who put this forward are very sincere and caring about \nchildren. I just think it will have unintended consequences. I hope we \nwill vote this down.\n  I thank my colleague from Massachusetts and I yield the remainder of \nmy time to him.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield just for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I believe I yielded my time back to the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the Senator 3 more minutes, if we need to.\n\n[[Page S10189]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Yes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Seven years ago, 53 percent of the D.C. teachers were \nnot certified. Last year that number had dropped to 33 percent. In \n1997, all new teachers are going to be certified and existing teachers \nwho are here must be certified by January, 1998, or risk dismissal. Is \nthat the kind of reform that you are talking about, a comprehensive \nsolution, rather than helping just a few children? Programs that \nenhance the training and bring teachers up to speed so they have world \nclass standards and world class certification, to be able to work with \nall children? Is that the kind of thing that the Senator from \nCalifornia is talking about?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely. I am talking about quality schools for 100 \npercent of the children, and I think the chart behind the Senator from \nMassachusetts explains the situation:\n  Restructure the whole school; foster world-class instruction; extend \nthe school day; enhance family centered learning.\n  I talked about after school. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun talks about \nfixing the crumbling schools. This is what we ought to be doing, not \nsurrendering and giving these dollars to private institutions, some of \nthem that are going to be totally untested, I say to my friend.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield further? Under General Becton's \nnew initiatives, students in grade 3 and 8 have to have the basic \nreading skills before advancing to a higher grade. This requirement \nreflects the commitment of the District of Columbia to ensure all \nchildren master basic reading skills. That has been the new program.\n  Do I understand that if we had $7 million to try to implement those \nkinds of programs to work with kids, particularly those that may have \nmore difficulty working through and enhancing their academic \nachievement, we would see all of the students in that class moving \nalong together in enhancing their reading capabilities, which is key to \nall learning in the future? Those are the kind of investments that the \nSenator thinks would make sense for all the students, I imagine?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely, and testing. We support, you and I, this \nvoluntary national testing. It is interesting, some of the people who \nare the strongest supporters of giving back to these private schools \nare fighting against testing. They don't want to have the children \ntested. Therefore, we will never know who is being left behind. The \nSenator is on target. We know what we have to do to make these kids \nwhole. We know what we have to do to help 100 percent of the kids.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let's begin by talking about testing. I \nhave here a pie chart that talks about people who attend D.C. public \nschools. These are the cold realities of the situation: 52.9 percent of \nthem drop out of D.C. public schools before they graduate. So, \nobviously, they don't have a chance of going to college.\n  Of the less than half who graduate, 22.1 percent of all people who \nare in the system never take the SAT test that would allow them an \nopportunity, if they are successful, to attend a major college or \nuniversity.\n  Of those who take the test, half make below 796 on the test. That is \nbelow the minimum standard set by most major colleges or universities \nin this region of the country.\n  So to begin with, roughly only one out of eight students has any \nchance in the world of attending a major college or university. That is \nthe quality of the system that we see defended today by people who are \nwilling to let children go to schools that don't teach, that don't \ndeliver, that don't produce quality in order to defend teachers unions \nand vested interests.\n  Let me show you the next chart. The next chart basically points out \nwhere we are in the District of Columbia as compared to what is \nrequired to actually be successful and go on to a college or \nuniversity.\n  The average student in the District of Columbia makes 790 on the SAT \ntest. The average for the country as a whole is about 1050. To go to \nthe University of Maryland, you have to average about 1170. To go to \nPenn State, you have to average about 1190. To go to the University of \nNorth Carolina, you have to score about 1230, and to go to the \nUniversity of Virginia, you have to make about 1300.\n  Talk about discriminating against children. You force working \nfamilies in the District of Columbia to send their children and their \nmoney to schools that turn out children that make 790 on the SAT test, \nand you are discriminating against them before they ever have any \nopportunity to use their God-given talents to advance themselves and \ntheir families.\n\n  Let me make note of the fact that the NCAA says that if you don't \nmake 840 on the SAT test, you are not a real student and you are being \nexploited by playing football or basketball at a major college or \nuniversity. The average SAT score in the District of Columbia is 789. \nThat is clearly a case of failure.\n  Is it a failure to commit money? The average school system in America \nspends $5,765 per student. The District of Columbia spends $10,180 per \nstudent, roughly twice the national average, and yet look at the final \nproduct. But not for children of D.C. teachers. They want a mandatory \nprogram for everybody except themselves.\n  Nationwide, 12.1 percent of public schoolteachers on average send \ntheir kids to private schools. But in the District of Columbia, it is \n28.2 percent. So despite more money than any other school system in \nAmerica--twice the national average, more than twice the number of \nteachers in the District of Columbia send their children to private \nschools as the national average. Yet the test scores continue to \nreflect failure, and this is not new.\n  The failure of the D.C. schools to deliver in terms of hard \nachievement are well documented, and they have been in existence for a \nlong time. Why not spend $7 million to give people a chance to compete? \nFor God's sakes, this is something we ought to do. We ought to be \nashamed of denying these children an opportunity to compete. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grams). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 6 minutes, or more, if the Senator from Illinois \nwants it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Thank you very much, Mr. President. To my \ncolleague and friend from Texas, I raise the point that this is not \njust a matter of a mandatory system for everybody but themselves, \nreferring to people in the District of Columbia, but, as I understand \nit, the State of Texas has rejected an attempt to put in vouchers. So \nthis issue is one which is applied to the District but not to the State \nof the Senator from Texas. I think we ought to consider for a moment if \nit is not good for Texas, it is not good for anyone else in the \ncountry.\n  I point out this argument about helping poor kids ought to be looked \nat very seriously. Are we really helping poor children, No. 1, and, No. \n2, does it help poor children to hold them out to be guinea pigs in an \nexperiment that has not worked anywhere that it has been tried for \nwhich we have no information and in which, quite frankly, it represents \na clear capitulation and a clear admission of failure, not just of \nfailure, but of a lack of will to reform and revive the system of \npublic education that we have in the District of Columbia?\n  The fact of the matter is, the $7 million that is to be diverted from \nthe District schools won't fix a single school, won't fund reform and \nwon't support the children who are there. I think that we should be \nbuilding up the schools, not tearing them down, not taking money or \nbleeding money away from a public school system that admittedly is \ntroubled. We want to reform the public schools in the District, but \nthey have started a reform effort and, much as the reform effort in my \nhome State of Illinois, it has shown to have great success where there \nis energized and committed leadership. We can reform our schools if we \nwill just believe that they can be reformed, if we will just invest in \nthem.\n\n[[Page S10190]]\n\n  The fact is, again, with the $7 million we could make a real \ndifference in the D.C. public schools. We could fully fund every after \nschool program in the D.C. schools. We could buy 368 new boilers for \nthe schools. We could rewire 65 of the schools that don't have the \nelectrical wiring to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. We \ncould upgrade the plumbing in 102 schools with substandard facilities. \nWe could buy 460,000 new books for the D.C. school libraries.\n\n  Instead of engaging the $7 million to fix what we have, we are going \nto say, let's bleed this patient to death, let's spin off enough for 2 \npercent of the schoolchildren and leave the others behind.\n  Let me point out for a moment, and it has been mentioned in the \ndebate already, that one of the schools in the District just today had \nto close because of a leaky roof. As you know, I have been speaking \nabout the whole issue of school facilities for a while, and in the \nDistrict of Columbia, we see, according to reports by the General \nAccounting Office and others, that 67 percent of the schools have \ncrumbling roofs.\n  If you know anything at all, you know if you have a leaky roof, you \nare likely to have walls that collapse and floorboards that curl and \nelectrical wiring that can't be used. So having a leaky roof goes to \nthe very heart of the environment for learning.\n  Are we going to put the $7 million into fixing some of those \ncrumbling roofs? Apparently not, according to this plan.\n  Sixty-five percent of the schools in the District of Columbia have \nfaulty plumbing, again, a situation where we have children who go to \nschools where the plumbing doesn't work. Yet, instead of saying we are \ngoing to fix the plumbing we are going to engage to support and build \nup and improve education for these kids, we are going to spin off some \nof them into another system, again, that has never been tried and \ncreated, and that we don't, frankly, know whether or not it is going to \nprovide any benefit at all even to them.\n  Forty-one percent of the schools don't have enough power outlets and \nelectrical wiring to accommodate computers and multimedia equipment. \nEverybody knows in this generation of students, computers are what \nbooks were to my generation. The kids have to have computers, and that \nis one of the reasons people do want to have quality education because \nthey want to make certain their youngsters can get on the information \nsuperhighway. You can't plug the computer in if you don't have \nelectrical wiring in the wall.\n  Yet, instead of putting $7 million into fixing the electrical wiring \nin the schools, we want to spend that money somewhere else.\n  Sixty-six percent of the schools have inadequate heating, \nventilation, and air conditioning. Again, I don't know if people \nlistening have spent a summer in the District of Columbia, but if you \nget here toward summertime, being in a room without air conditioning is \nclose to being sentenced to purgatory. The children in the public \nschools would benefit if we were to make the kind of investment in \nthem, as opposed to, again, bleeding the system as this proposal \nsuggests.\n  I think, Mr. President, though, that at the heart of this debate is \nreally almost a sad kind of capitulation, a sad kind of a lack of will \nthat says that education is just a matter of whether or not I got mine, \nget yours, go into the market, buy an education for this chit and if \nyou don't get a chit and can't buy a better education, that is too bad \nfor you. The whole notion of public education is that it creates a \npublic good, that it is something that benefits all of us, and that \npublic education becomes, if you will, the great center of meritocracy \nthat defines what this country is all about.\n  The ladder of opportunity is crafted in the classroom in America. \nWhat we are now saying is that some will get the opportunity and others \nwill not. Assuming for a moment that this proposal were adopted--and I \nam going to do everything I can in opposition to it--but assuming it \nwere adopted, of the 80,000 children in the District of Columbia, about \n2,000 of them would be served. That would leave then 78,000 children \nleft behind, left behind with schools that have crumbling roofs, faulty \nplumbing, not enough electrical power, and inadequate heating, \nventilation, and air conditioning. That is what this proposal really \nrepresents.\n  I had in my office two students who were interns briefly. They were \nactually high school students from the District of Columbia. The reason \nthey were working in my office as recently as last week was because \nthey couldn't go to school, and they couldn't go to school because the \ncourts had closed their school down for bad facilities. The \ninfrastructure was so bad in their schools that they had no place to go \nto get an education. So we took them in to give them an opportunity \njust to do something during the daytime.\n  In the face of that failure, how we can suggest or how it can be \nsuggested that bleeding that system even further instead of investing \nin it and giving it the support seems to me to be not only shortsighted \nbut counterproductive. I think we can afford to waste no child. I think \nwe should leave no child behind. To the extent that the combination of \nmoney and leadership, because it is not just money alone, it has to \ntake an engaged population, if we engage to preserve, to revive and to \nreform these public schools, we can save them, and we can provide \nopportunity for all of our children.\n  The idea is not to create a two- and three-tier system of education \nso some can get and others cannot, what we want to do is have quality \neducation for every child, so whether that child is an orphan or that \nchild has parents who don't understand the school system or don't speak \nthe language, that child will not be left behind in that which we have \nrelegated to the back burner, that which is left over after we have \nsiphoned off the resources into a private system.\n  I say let's not make the children of the District of Columbia guinea \npigs in this ill-considered experiment.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HELMS. I am grateful to the Senator from Indiana [Mr. Coats] and \nthe Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman] for their having \nintroduced the pending amendment. They are to be commended for offering \nthis proposal, which will improve the circumstances of many students \nwho live in the District of Columbia, and who want to escape--and no \nother word really fits--escape the horrific conditions that exist in so \nmany local public schools.\n  I would say to my friends from Indiana and Connecticut that it takes \na lot of courage to stand up against the public education \nestablishment. They're a powerful bunch, the National Education \nAssociation crowd, and they're not afraid to use all of their muscle to \noppose any effort to help parents find alternatives to failing public \nschool systems.\n  Those who have examined the appalling state of the D.C. public \nschools are fully aware that parents need an alternative to the status \nquo. On February 20 of this year, even the Washington Post reported the \nfollowing dismaying statistics:\n  Sixty-five percent of D.C. public school children tested below their \ngrade levels for reading in the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills.\n  Seventy-two percent of fourth-graders in the D.C. public schools \ntested below the ``basic proficiency'' level on the National Assessment \nof Education Progress test given to students every 2 years--this was \nthe lowest score of any school system in the country.\n  The dropout rate among D.C. public schools students is an astounding \n40 percent.\n  Meanwhile, even those that graduate are unprepared. More than half of \nD.C. public school graduates who take the U.S. Armed Forces \nQualification Test scored below 50 percent on the test--that's a \nfailing grade, Mr. President. That might be the saddest statistic of \nall. These young people--who want to better their lives through \nassociation with our armed forces--cannot pass the vocational aptitude \nexam given to aspiring recruits because the D.C. public schools are not \nproperly preparing them.\n  So, Mr. President, the list goes on and on. The Heritage Foundation \nreports that 11 percentage of students in the D.C. public school system \navoid school because they fear for their own safety. Isn't that sad, \nMr. President? Children in our Nation's Capital are afraid to go to \nschool.\n  Then again, why wouldn't they be afraid? Sixteen percent of the \nstudents\n\n[[Page S10191]]\n\nin the D.C. public schools have at one time carried a weapon into their \nschool. There are metal detectors at many if not all schools to prevent \npistols, switchblade knives and narcotics from being smuggled into the \nclassrooms.\n  Nor is it just the students who are afraid. Almost one in five D.C. \npublic school teachers report that verbal abuse from their students is \na serious problem. With conditions like these, no wonder student \nperformance is so low.\n  Mr. President, again I congratulate Senator Coats and Senator \nLieberman for offering this amendment, which opens up the alternative \nof private or parochial schools to parents whose family income is below \n185 percent of the poverty level. Their plan provides opportunity \nscholarships of up to $3,200 for parents who are fed up with the \neducation--or, rather, the lack of education--provided by the D.C. \npublic schools.\n  Mr. President, there is a lot of misinformation swirling about \nconcerning the high cost of private and parochial schools. When the \nwords private school are mentioned, the image of elite and high-priced \neducation often springs to mind. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.\n  In fact, there is a vast and accessible network of private schools in \nthe Washington area. My friend, the Senator from Indiana, informs me \nthat there are 60 private schools in this area that cost less than \n$3,200 a year--the amount that families living below the poverty level \ncan receive under the Coats/Lieberman amendment.\n  Of these 60 schools, many are the remarkable Catholic schools that \noperate in the most poverty-stricken parts of Washington, DC. These \nschools are willing and able to provide true quality education to poor \nstudents; in fact the Catholic Archdiocese of Washington reports over \n1,000 spaces are available in its 16 Washington schools.\n  They want to do the job, Mr. President. But first, Congress must \nstand up to the teachers' unions and the rest of the public school \nestablishment that doesn't want to answer for the poor performance of \npublic schools. The Coats/Lieberman amendment is a day of reckoning for \nthe failure of the D.C. public school system--and an outstanding way \nfor Congress to help school children receive the education they \ndeserve.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  Few issues are as divisive in education as this one--private school \nvouchers. There are very strong feelings on both sides of this issue. \nThis is as it should be on issues affecting our children--strong \nfeelings should be the norm. But I believe we should be concerned for \nall children, not just for a few.\n  Our universal system of public education is one of the very \ncornerstones of our Nation, our democracy and our culture.\n  In every community, public schools are where America comes together \nin its rich diversity. For generations, educating the rich, poor, \nblack, white, first-generation Americans--be they Irish, English, \nJapanese or Mexican-Americans--and all Americans has been the charge \nand challenge of our public schools. It is clearly not the easiest \ntask. But it's importance cannot be undervalued.\n  These efforts are essential to our democracy which relies on an \neducated citizenry, to our communities which require understanding of \ndiversity to function, and to our economy which thrives on highly \neducated and trained worker. Education--public education--is also the \ndoor to economic opportunity for all citizens individually.\n  However, voucher proposals, like the one before us today, \nfundamentally undermine this ideal of public education.\n  Supporters of these programs never argue they will serve all \nchildren. They simply argue it is a way for some children to get out of \npublic schools. The amendment offered today would provide 2,000 \nchildren, at most, with vouchers. But the D.C. public schools serve \n78,000 children and about 50,000 are low-income.\n  I do not argue that our public schools do not face challenges--\nviolence, disinvestment and declining revenues plague some of our \nschools, just as they do many other community institutions.\n  And our schools are not ignoring these problems--even with limited \nresources.\n  Many are digging themselves out of these problems to offer real hope \nand opportunities to students. James Comer in Connecticut has led a \nrevolution in public schools across the country by supporting parents \nand improving education through community involvement and reinvestment \nin the schools. Public magnet and charter schools are flourishing \noffering students innovative curriculum and new choices within the \npublic school system. School safety programs, violence prevention \ncurriculum and character education initiatives are making real gains in \nthe struggle against violence in our schools and larger communities.\n  And these reform efforts are beginning to show results. Our schools \nare getting better. Student achievement is up in math, science and \nreading. The reach of technology has spread to nearly all of our \nschools. The drop out rate continues to decline.\n  We clearly have a ways to go before all our schools are models of \nexcellence, but our goal must be to lend a hand in these critical \nefforts, not withdraw our support for the schools that educate 89 \npercent of all students in America--public schools.\n  And there is no question about it, private school vouchers will \ndivert much needed dollars away from public schools. Our dollars are \nlimited. We must focus them on improving opportunities for all children \nby improving the system that serves all children--the public schools.\n  The $7 million this amendment would dedicate to D.C. vouchers are \nmuch better invested in the District of Columbia's public schools. Last \nweek, Secretary Riley outlined how he would spend these funds on whole \nschool improvement efforts and after-school programs. In addition, the \ninfrastructure needs in D.C. schools remain quite severe--under the \nleadership of General Beckton, things are improving and these problems \nare being addressed. But, he estimates infrastructure needs alone top \n$2 billion.\n  Proponents of private school choice argue that vouchers will open up \nnew educational opportunities to low-income families and their \nchildren. In fact, vouchers offer private schools, not parents choice. \nThe private schools will pick and choose students, as they do now. Few \nwill choose to serve students with low test scores, with disabilities \nor with discipline problems. Vouchers, which will be between $2,400 and \n$3,200, will not come close to covering the cost of tuition at the vast \nmajority of private schools in the District.\n  In fact, the tuitions they will cover are at religious schools \nraising serious constitutional questions. No Federal court has ever \nupheld the use of vouchers for parochial school or religious education. \nTo receive these funds, private religious schools would likely have to \nchange the nature of their educational programs and eliminate any \nreligious content. Many schools would be unwilling to do this; further \nlimiting parent's ability to choose.\n  There are also important accountability issues. Private institutions \ncan fold in mid-year as nearly half a dozen have done in Milwaukee \nleaving taxpayers to pick up these pieces--only the pieces are \nchildren's lives and educations.\n  This amendment also establishes a new bureaucracy within the District \nof Columbia to administer this program. There will be a board of \ncitizens--only one of whom will be appointed by a D.C. official--to set \nup and oversee this program. For all our criticism of the D.C. \ngovernment, its layer of bureaucracy, and lack of accountability \nstructures, it is ironic that this amendment would set up yet another \ngoverning body. This is a long way from what this city needs.\n  Mr. President, our public schools are not just about any one child; \nthey are about all children and all of us. I do not have any children, \nbut I pay property taxes and do so happily to support the education of \nthe children I am counting on to be tomorrow's workers, thinkers, \nleaders, teachers and taxpayers.\n  Our future is dependent on nurturing and developing the potential of \nevery child to its fullest. Investing in our public schools is the best \nway to reach this goal.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in defeating this amendment.\n\n[[Page S10192]]\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, today we debate an amendment to the \nfiscal year 1998 District of Columbia Appropriations Act that would \nprovide publicly-funded vouchers to low-income students so they can \nattend private and religious schools in the District and surrounding \nareas.\n  The bill would authorize $7 million in the first year and a total of \n$45 million over 5 years. My colleagues have pointed out that this $7 \nmillion would only serve 3 percent of the students in the Washington, \nDC school district, and that we should instead be looking at \ninvestments that will help 100 percent of the students.\n  How much would $7 million buy for all the students in Washington, DC \nschools? How much real help--that would improve their ability to learn \nand succeed?\n  How many teachers, reading assistants, school counselors, nurses, or \nvolunteer coordinators would $7 million buy? How many computers, video \nsystems, wireless communications systems, computer-assisted drafting \nsystems, technology labs and other tools could $7 million buy? How many \ndifferent ways could we help the parents--through parent involvement \nprograms or family literacy services--to help their children succeed in \nschool, with $7 million?\n  My colleagues have in this debate asserted or intimated that defense \nof the public school is essentially defending the status quo, and being \nafraid of change. Well, when it comes to using public school funds to \npay for students to attend private, sectarian schools, the status quo \nis actually set in the U.S. and many State constitutions.\n  Our country has a rich history, since Roger Williams, Thomas \nJefferson, and James Madison, that keeps a line of separation between \nour public tax dollars and the checking account at the local house of \nworship. These debates are further informed by public votes and public \npolls. As far as the American public is concerned, this particular \nground has been gone over. The argument is moot; the law is clear.\n  The experiences of the State of Washington also have bearing on this \nissue. I stand before you as a former school board member from a State \nwhere the law allows school boards to change anything not otherwise \nprohibited by law--to help students learn.\n  Washington State allows wide flexibility in carrying out existing \nschool law--and the Washington State Legislature has held many open \npublic debates on laws that seem too stifling. In every school in my \nState, like those in many other States, there are teachers, students, \nparents, and community members thinking about how to make schools \nbetter, and taking actions to make them better.\n  I want to be very clear about this--fear of change is not the \nobstacle here. My State also has a public school choice law that allows \nany student to attend school in any public school they choose. One \nthing we ve learned from this Washington State law is that the biggest \nfrustration occurs when a school determines, as it is allowed, to say \nwhen the school is full, and closes the door to new students--who then \nmust choose another school.\n  The voters of Washington had a choice last fall, to allow private \nschool vouchers. And they overwhelmingly rejected the idea at the \npolls. As you have heard, this has happened in other States around the \ncountry.\n  Today, if you are worried about the educational crisis affecting any \nstudent in a public school anywhere in this country --you have two \nchoices. You can play ``let's talk about vouchers,'' or you can go help \na school. You can work at a think tank, or write a column for a \nnewspaper, or become a Member of Congress.\n  And you can spend a good portion of your career, countless hours of \ndebate, and millions of dollars breaking your pick in the ground of the \nschool voucher issue. You can impose your will on the only people in \nthe contiguous United States without representative government. You can \nplay games with a community that faces enough challenges already. You \ncan strive to further denigrate the D.C. schools by luring away to \nprivate religious schools the 2,000 students who are most likely to \nwant to become leaders in a revitalized public school.\n  Or, you can do something productive. This $7 million could do some \ngood. Your time devoted to a public school could help make needed \nchanges. Your fund-raising on behalf of a public school foundation \ncould make the difference for many students. Your tutoring or advocacy \non behalf of a student or family could be the symbol that drives much \nmore volunteer time and public awareness.\n  It all comes down to one parent wanting to get the very best for his \nor her son or daughter, and how we can help that parent. We can dangle \nthe possibility of a religious school voucher, or we can help the \nstudent and his or her school. For that one student, this $7 million \nvoucher system could be far less meaningful than the help and attention \nof one caring adult.\n  If any nationally-recognized voucher advocate went to that one \nstudent's school and offered to mediate a discussion, hold a fund-\nraiser, or work with a family--that student could find real solutions \nin a real school. Or, we can continue to talk about vouchers and other \nthings that will not, and in this case, should not happen.\n  People have been talking about the crisis in schools for many years. \nThe research shows we are doing better in many areas, but are not \nliving up to the expectations of a new century. I fear that these kinds \nof discussions just create a crisis of a different kind--a crisis that \nsaps our sense of volunteer spirit and voluntary support of public \neducation. The students deserve better.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, since 1992, when the Senate first voted on \nthe issue of providing private school vouchers, I have consistently \nvoted against spending Federal money to pay for tuition at private \nschools. I did so again today. But, I rise to let my colleagues know \nthat I am reconsidering my position based on the changed circumstances \nin American education. I want to give everyone fair notice that in the \nfuture, I may vote to allow such a limited experiment.\n  I realize that whenever elected officials change their position on an \nissue, they are subject to accusations of flip-flopping or being \ninconsistent or trying to have it both ways. It is for that reason that \nI want to explain my thinking on this matter today.\n  Unlike some opponents of vouchers, I have never categorically opposed \nthe idea of public money being used under any circumstances for private \nschool education. Rather--and I think I have been forthright about this \nfrom the very beginning--my concerns have been very specific. First, I \nhave questions about whether a private school voucher system, when it \ninvolves private religious schools, is constitutional. And, second, I \nhave deep reservations about taking money away from underfunded public \nschools.\n  But, Mr. President, I do not believe that simply because I have \nalways voted a particular way on a particular issue that I should be \nlocked in forever to that position. Circumstances change. Thinking \nchanges. And, I have been giving this issue a lot of thought.\n  I have come to the belief that the constitutional issues involved \nhere are not as clear cut as opponents have argued. While lower courts \nhave ruled that vouchers used in private religious schools violate the \nfirst amendment's prohibition on the establishment of religion, the \nSupreme Court has not yet weighed in on the question.\n  In fact, the Supreme Court has ruled that State tuition tax credits \nfor private religious school tuition are perfectly constitutional, and \nthe Supreme Court has ruled that Pell grants--vouchers for college \nstudents--can be used in private religious colleges without violating \nthe Constitution. Granted, Mr. President, the issues that the Court has \nadjudicated are not exactly parallel to the issue of private school \nvouchers for elementary and secondary school students. But, the point \nis, it is an open question. Even some liberal constitutional scholars \nhave noted that vouchers to parents and children may be constitutional. \nAnd, as long as it remains an open question, I do not think I can \ndismiss the issue of vouchers solely on constitutional grounds.\n  With regard to my second concern--that private school vouchers may \ndrain funds away from the public schools--I now think that the issue is \nmore complex. The real issue is not whether money is drained from \npublic schools, but what effect vouchers would have on public schools \nand the quality of education those students receive. And, yes, I do \nbelieve there is a difference. Even\n\n[[Page S10193]]\n\nif vouchers were to take money away from the public schools--and I \nshould point out that not all voucher proposals do--that does not in \nand of itself mean that public schools will be harmed.\n  When you have an area of the country--and most often here we are \ntalking about inner cities--where the public schools are abysmal or \ndysfunctional or not working and where most of the children have no way \nout, it is legitimate to ask what would happen to the public schools \nwith increased competition from private schools and what would happen \nto the quality of education for the children who live there.\n  Most of the opponents of private school vouchers argue that with more \nkids attending private schools, the support for public education will \nbe drained. To date, that assertion has largely gone unchallenged. I am \nnot sure it should any more. Is it not possible that giving poor kids a \nway out will force the public schools to improve and result in more \npeople coming back?\n  Make no mistake about it. Public education must be our primary focus. \nAnd, in considering voting for vouchers in the future, I am not \nsubscribing to the philosophy of many voucher supporters who argue that \nthere should be no Federal role in education or that the Federal \nGovernment should not in any way help States fund public education or \nthat we should decrease our commitment to public education. On the \ncontrary, I think we should increase that commitment. But, for those \nkids who are presently caught in a failed public school, we must start \nasking--only asking--if public education is still the only answer.\n  I do not know the answer to that or any of the other questions I have \nraised today. But, I believe the questions need to be asked. And, it \nmay be that the only way that we will find out the answers is to create \na limited private school voucher demonstration project.\n  I say ``may,'' Mr. President, because I do not know. And, that really \nis part of the point here. I will continue to ask these questions, \nlisten to both sides of the debate, and ponder the answers. In so \ndoing, however, I want everyone to understand that I may conclude in \nthe end that the only true way to answer the questions is to try \nvouchers--in a limited fashion for those who need the most help.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate the concerns my colleagues \nhave expressed for the future of the children of Washington, DC. The \nconditions in many of the schools are truly deplorable, and the \nperformance levels of the children show that there are many problems \nthat need to be addressed. I do not, however, share their faith in \nvouchers as a solution.\n  Although the sponsors have worked to address some of the problems \nwith past voucher proposals, I see four serious flaws with this \nparticular approach.\n  First, this proposal ignores 97 percent of all children in the D.C. \nschools. There are 78,000 children in the D.C. public schools. \nApproximately 50,000 of them are from low-income families. Under this \nproposal, only 2,000 children--less than 3 percent of all children in \nD.C. schools--would receive vouchers.\n  If helping children leave the public school system and go to private \nschool really is the only way to get a good education--and I will \noutline in a moment why I do not believe it is--what message would we \nbe sending to the children who would not get vouchers? Are we telling \nthem that they're not important? Are we telling them that we're giving \nup on them?\n  I think we ought to tell them that they're all important, that we \ncannot afford to leave one of them behind. We need solutions that help \nall children, not just a few who happen to be lucky enough to win a \nlottery.\n  The second flaw I see with this proposal is that there is little \nproof that vouchers work. I certainly do not believe, as some of the \nproponents have claimed, that those who are left behind are helped in \nany way by the divisions that will be created within communities or by \nthe loss of active parents to the public school system. But there is \nalso little evidence that vouchers have helped the children who receive \nthem in Milwaukee and Cleveland. The research is contradictory, but \ncareful examination of the data seems to show that improvements in \nchildren's academic achievement has almost everything to do with family \nbackground, and almost nothing to do with vouchers.\n  A third problem with this proposal is that, in the end, it's not \nparents who choose, it's private schools. My colleagues say they want \nto give parents more choices, and I am sympathetic to that argument. \nBut, who is really doing the choosing? The answer: private schools will \nchoose. As the article in this morning's Washington Post points out, \nvery few of the secular private schools in this area charge a tuition \nat or below the level of the vouchers and many of these do not have \nplaces for additional students. The better the school, the more likely \nthey are to turn students away.\n  The proposal does not require private schools to accept children with \ndisabilities or children with limited English proficiency. So, parents \nof these children are likely to find they have few choices available to \nthem.\n  Finding schools to accept children has been a problem in cities with \nvoucher programs. In Cleveland, for example, nearly half of the public \nschool students who received vouchers could not find a private school \nthat would accept them. No choice was available for those students or \ntheir parents.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would point out that the public is opposed \nto vouchers. All parents want their children to be able to go to the \nbest schools possible. But, when people understand how voucher programs \nwork, they reject them. District voters rejected vouchers by an 8-to-1 \nmargin in 1981. More recent voucher initiatives in California, Oregon \nand Washington State were rejected by more than 2-to-1.\n  Who does support vouchers? Among the biggest proponents are people \nwho want to dismantle public schools, especially the radical religious \nright. In his book, America Can Be Saved, Jerry Falwell writes:\n\n       One day, I hope in the next 10 years, I trust that we will \n     have more Christian day schools than there are public \n     schools. I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early \n     days of our country, we won't have any public schools. The \n     churches will have taken them over again and Christians will \n     be running them. What a happy day that will be!\n\n  Mr. President, make no mistake about this. I support religious \nschools. I am a product of a Catholic school education. My parents had \nthat choice, and I believe every parent should have that choice. But, I \ndo not believe taxpayers should be forced to subsidize that choice. Our \nforefathers wisely understood that there should be a constitutional \nseparation between church and state.\n  There are other ways to expand parents' choices without violating the \nConstitution. We should increase parents' ability to choose which \npublic schools their children attend within a district, among districts \nand even statewide. We should increase the number of magnet and theme \nschools within the public school system such as math and science \nacademies that have been developed in some communities. We should \nestablish more charter public schools, where motivated administrators \nand teachers work with innovative programs in exchange for more \nflexibility.\n  Mr. President, it is pessimistic and callous to settle for helping \nless than 3 children in 100. We can do better. We know what works in \neducation. We know that children need good teachers, high standards and \nreliable measurements to tell us whether they are achieving those \nstandards, safe classrooms, and the active involvement of parents in \nthe schools.\n  There are public schools all across the country doing an outstanding \njob of educating children. They are laboratories of reform and \nexcellence. We ought to support these schools and help other public \nschools reach their level, not give up on the principle of providing a \ngood public education to all children.\n  Sharing information about local school reforms that work, \nincidentally, is one of the functions performed by the Department of \nEducation--which many voucher supporters would abolish.\n  The American people are not willing to abandon public schools. Polls \nshow that 71 percent of Americans believe we should revitalize public \nschools, not\n\n[[Page S10194]]\n\nabandon them. They believe we should educate all children, not just a \nfew. When Americans have had the chance to vote for vouchers, they have \nvoted against them overwhelmingly.\n  In summary, this voucher amendment would: ignore the needs of 97 \npercent of D.C. school children; make D.C. children guinea pigs for \nunproven theory; give choice to private schools, not parents; and drain \nneeded energy and resources away from efforts to revitalize our public \nschools.\n  There are better ways to improve our students' academic performance. \nI urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and work with me to enact \nreal and meaningful strategies that help all of our children, not just \na few.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time allotted to the Senator from \nMassachusetts has expired.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. COATS. I yield myself 6 minutes, and my understanding is that \nwill reserve roughly 10 minutes for the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There would be 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, it is interesting that in this debate not \none person who is opposed to the scholarship program for D.C. students \nhas come down here and addressed the fundamental issue of this debate. \nThe fundamental issue is, will we give poverty-stricken minority \nchildren the opportunity to escape a failed educational system so that \nthey, too, can participate in the American dream?\n  We have talked about plumbing, air conditioning, crumbling schools, \nand we have heard if you can't give it for 100, you can't give it for \nany. What kind of argument is that? In other words, if you can't \ntotally reform the system all at once for everyone, you condemn another \nwhole generation in the District of Columbia--and in Chicago and other \ncities around this country--to failure and the inability to gain skills \nto become gainfully employed or to have the opportunity to go on to \nfurther education.\n  Now, this argument about bleeding the system--if I could have the \nattention of the Senator from Illinois and the delegate from the \nDistrict of Columbia, who is on the floor--bleeding the system. The \nD.C. school system gets $672 million a year, and you are saying that if \nyou added $7 million, the system would be fixed?\n  The General Accounting Office said that 25 percent of the maintenance \nbudget never leaves the maintenance facilities office. It doesn't go to \nfix plumbing. The system is broken. We are taking $7 million, not out \nof the $672 million, not one penny of this is coming out of the current \nbudget for D.C. schools. The $7 million is coming out of money set \naside to reduce the general deficit. That was added on to the \nPresident's budget.\n  Bleeding the system, fixing the ventilating, while kids can't even \nachieve the test score to go on to higher education, kids can't get out \nof a school--your own statistics show why parents want to leave. If 67 \npercent of the schools have crumbling roofs and 65 percent have faulty \nplumbing and 66 percent have inadequate heating, ventilation, and air-\nconditioning and more than 50 percent goes to maintenance and \nadministration and less than 50 percent of the $672 million goes to \neducating students, what is wrong with that system? There is something \ndesperately wrong with the system.\n  This program is designed to at least give 2,000 kids a chance. We \ntalk about the 100-percent solution. Well, it is like if you can't give \n100 percent of the kids an opportunity within a failed system, then \nlet's not give any kids an opportunity, let's condemn all of them.\n  Now, the District of Columbia system needs help desperately. Even the \nWashington Post, not a supporter of school vouchers, has said give it a \nchance. At least try it, to see if maybe it spurs the system on, the \nD.C. public schools system, to a little bit better performance. If it \ndoesn't work--we have a test built in here--if it doesn't work, we will \ntry something else. But let's do something to help these kids. Let's do \na small, little piece.\n\n  Now, the Senator from California talks about bureaucracy. \n``Bureaucracy'' is another word for the D.C. public school system. More \nthan 50 percent of the money, $672 million, doesn't even go to the \nclassroom. Yet in this bill we have a cap of 7.5 percent on \nadministration. We will match our administration with the D.C. \nadministration any time, anywhere.\n  Senator Kennedy said, who wants it? Nobody wants it in the District \nof Columbia. Here are 2,000 parents that want it that have signed this \npetition. I have a list of 100 ministers, D.C. ministers, almost all \nminority ministers, who said, we plead with you, give our kids a chance \nto get an education. They want it.\n  There was a recent poll taken in the District of Columbia, and 64 \npercent of D.C. residents indicated if they had the funds, they would \nget their kids out of the public school system; 40 percent drop out--\nthe Senator had a chart saying 50; say it's 40 or 50 percent, \nwhatever--they don't even graduate from the system.\n  The constitutional argument--vouchers are good enough for day care. I \nthink the Senator supported that. Vouchers are good enough for Head \nStart. I think the Senator supported that. Vouchers are good enough for \nthe GI bill and good enough for kids to go to Loyola in your State. \nThat is a religious school. If they are good enough for people over 17 \nand they are good enough for kids under 5, why aren't they good enough \nfor kids between 5 and 17?\n  Does the Senator want to respond?\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I would be delighted. I am very happy to respond \nto that.\n  I think the issue, and the point I have just made, if the Senator is \nprepared to support an effort to address this as well, to address \nfixing up the crumbling schools in the District of Columbia so those 98 \npercent of the children who will be left behind----\n  Mr. COATS. I will be glad to respond. This Senator would be happy to \nsupport any effort to improve public schools, but I don't put plumbing \nahead of education. I think the first thing we ought to do--and I don't \nknow why the Senator doesn't support it--we first ought to help kids \nget educated, and at the same time maybe we can do that.\n  If we don't fix the schools, we will not fix the education--that is \nupside down.\n  One last thing. It was stated on this floor that few parents can get \nto the schoolhouse door. Well, there are a lot of poor kids who have no \nopportunities in life that can't get through the schoolhouse door \nbecause Members of Congress are standing at the schoolhouse door \nsaying, ``Nope, you are not allowed in the school. You don't have the \nmoney, you can't get in.''\n  I am a product of public schools. My kids are a product of public \nschools. I support public schools. But I don't support public schools \nthat don't give education. I want to do something to help that public \neducation.\n  I yield the remaining time existing to the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 8 minutes 30 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my colleague from Indiana.\n  Let me pick up on what was said by Senator Coats, citing that this \namendment is bleeding the system. Good God, the system is bleeding. It \nis not this amendment that is bleeding it. What is bleeding it is the \nfailure of the system, and the blood that is being lost are the hopes \nand dreams of thousands of parents and children trapped in the school \nsystem who know it is a failure for them, who know it is not working \nfor them.\n  I appeal to my colleagues, particularly my Democratic colleagues, \nplease look at the facts, cut through the rhetoric. I know there is \nstrong pressure from interest groups representing the establishment, \nthe education status quo. I know that my colleagues on the Democratic \nside are great believers in the public school system. But remember \nthose words that I think were spoken by John Gardner, that too often \ndebates are between those who are unloving critics and uncritical \nlovers. We all love the public school system, but open our eyes, look \nwhat is happening here.\n  Senator Kennedy earlier in charting progress in the school system in \nthe District of Columbia said in the last period of time the number of \nuncertified teachers went from more than 50 to 33 percent. Is that a \nsign of progress? Yes, it is progress. That is why Senator Brownback \nand I are working with Delegate Norton and others to bring more money \nto the District and support General Becton.\n\n[[Page S10195]]\n\n  But think about the reality. How many Members of this Senate would \nsend their children to a school system in which one-third of the \nteachers were uncertified, unless they were forced to send them there \nbecause they didn't have the money to get them out.\n  The Senator from California earlier said, gee, let's take this money, \nand my colleague and friend from Illinois added, let's put it on top, \ngive it to all the kids, instead of just benefiting this relatively \nsmall group of 2,000.\n  The Washington Post said a while ago in an editorial that the D.C. \nschool system is a well-financed failure. So choice here is whether you \nwill put $7 million on top of the more than $600 million we put into \nthe system and better finance the failure instead of giving that money \nand focusing it on 2,000 kids and thereby giving them the opportunity \nfor a better education and a better life.\n  The D.C. school system already spends $7,655 a year, more than $1,500 \ngreater than the national average spent, per student in schools, more \nthan $1,000 greater than that spent in the school districts in the \nneighboring counties of Maryland and Virginia.\n  The debate is not about whether you are for the public schools. \nSenator Brownback as the chairman and I as the ranking Democrat have \nworked very hard with General Becton. Progress is being made. This is a \nsystem in which buildings are still deteriorating, are deteriorated, \nkids are afraid to go to schools, teachers are afraid to come and \nteach. Half the children are dropping out. The longer they stay in the \nschool system, the worse they do compared to national averages on the \nstandardized tests.\n  We are saying here on this amendment, while we are all working with \nGeneral Becton to improve this school system, let's recognize that this \nis a building on fire and let's get some kids out of those parts of the \nbuilding on fire to give them a chance to better themselves.\n  This is not a choice between public schools and private, parochial \nschools. That is a false choice. You can support this amendment and \nsupport the public schools in the District. The true choice here is \nbetween preserving the status quo at all costs, which is slamming a \ndoor in the face of the parents and children who want to do better, and \ndoing what is necessary to put those children first. In other words, \nasking whether the status quo of the public education orthodoxy, which \nis letting down so many children, is so important that we are willing \nto sacrifice the hopes and aspirations of thousands of children for the \nsake of a process, not for the sake of the children.\n  What is the interest of government in education? Not to protect a \nparticular form but to educate our children. That is what this \namendment is about. It is not a panacea. We have a lot more work to do. \nThere is a recent independent study of the scholarship program similar \nto this one in Cleveland, and they found it helped produce enormous \nacademic gains in 1 year. The same is true in Milwaukee.\n  Also, it will have an effect on this school system in the District, \nas competition does, to get them to improve what they are doing. \nSupport for choice is growing widely. In a poll, the Joint Center for \nPolitical and Economic Studies found support for school vouchers is \nsurprisingly strong. They concluded it has substantially increased in \nthe last year. A majority of African-Americans, 57.3 percent, and \nHispanics, 65.4 percent, supported school vouchers.\n  Mr. President, I want to make a direct appeal to my Democratic \ncolleagues: I don't know why there is only a handful of us who are \nDemocratic Members of this Senate supporting this proposal. This party \nof ours has been at its best when we have been for opportunity, when we \nhave been for helping people up the ladder of American life--not to \ngive a handout, but to give people a little help, to help them better \nthemselves. That is what this is about. This is not about protecting a \nstatus quo, protecting education. Let's focus on human opportunity and \nthe waste of human talent.\n  In my opinion, voting against this measure, I say with respect, is \nabout the equivalent of voting against Pell grants or the GI bill or \nchild care programs or any of the host of other programs that \nDemocrats, majority strong, proudly I say, have supported this year and \nover history.\n  I think we have just become either uncritical lovers of the school \nsystem, the public school system, forgetting our primary education to \nthe children who are there, or are being convinced by those who have a \nvested interest in the status quo that this is somehow, though on its \nface a good idea, the proverbial camel's nose under the tent. This is a \nlifeline for 2,000 children who are trapped in a school system where \nnone of us would let our kids be. I don't mean all of it, but in many \ncases in this school system many of the schools we simply would not let \nour kids attend. We see it in the wealthiest section of this city. \nChoice supporters see that 65 percent of the families living in ward 3, \nthe wealthiest in this city, send their children to private \nschools. Those ministers and children who came to see us from the \npoorest sections of this city asked us: Is it fair given this \nindictment of the District of Columbia public schools by the wealthier \nfamilies and the wealthier neighborhoods for the Congress to force the \npoor and disenfranchised to attend schools that we would not ourselves?\n\n  I appeal to my colleagues. Break out, break free, and let the kids--\n2,000 of them now trapped in this school system--have the freedom that \nour Constitution provides them, the opportunity that we try to give \nthem, and a future that is their birthright as Americans.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time on the amendment being expired, under \nthe previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the \nSenate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on the pending \n     Coats amendment numbered 1249 to S. 1156:\n         Trent Lott, Dan Coats, Richard Shelby, Mitch McConnell, \n           Connie Mack, Lauch Faircloth, James Inhofe, Alfonse \n           D'Amato, Rod Grams, John Warner, Pat Roberts, Chuck \n           Hagel, Ted Stevens, John McCain, Susan Collins, and Sam \n           Brownback.\n\n\n                                  Vote\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Reed of \nRhode Island be added as a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered simply \nclarifies the implementation of last year's immigration legislation in \none specific area, the suspension of deportation. Last year's bill \nimposed stricter standards to obtain suspension of deportation. While \nthis is fine for future applicants, it is unfair to impose new, harsher \nstandards on cases which were already in the pipeline at the time of \npassage.\n  This amendment does two specific things: first of all, it clarifies \nthat certain Central American immigrants who\n\n[[Page S10197]]\n\nwere in the administrative pipeline for suspension of deportation must \ncontinue to meet the standards that applied before the immigration \nreform law took effect. Second, the annual cap on suspensions of \ndeportation would only apply to cases commenced after April 1, 1997.\n  Without those two changes, we will be changing the rules midstream \nfor a group of people who were attempting to comply with the guidelines \nfor regularizing their immigration status. We encouraged them to come \nforward and play by the rules and we cannot go back on our word now.\n  As a way of background, let me lay out some information for the \nSenate. Starting in the mid-1980's, Nicaraguans, Salvadorans, and \nGuatemalans fleeing the civil wars in their home countries started \ncoming to the United States. Many of them made asylum claims, many of \nwhich were improperly denied as the U.S. Government acknowledged by \nordering them readjudicated. In the case of Nicaraguans, this was done \nthrough the Nicaraguan review program established by Ronald Reagan. And \nin the case of Salvadorans and Guatemalans this was done through \nsettlement of the ABC class lawsuit agreed to by the Bush \nadministration.\n  A huge backlog of asylum claims, however, then prevented their cases \nfrom being reheard for many years. Meanwhile, various temporary \nstatuses allowed the members of this group to avoid deportation. In \naddition, they received authorization to work legally in the United \nStates. During that time many members of that group established strong \nroots in this country.\n  Under immigration law, there has long been available a procedure \ncalled ``suspension of deportation'' for an individual found to be of \ngood character and who has been here for 7 years to adjust to legal \nstatus if deporting that individual would cause ``extreme hardship'' to \nthe person or his or her immediate legal present relative. This \nrequires a case-by-case adjudication that the person being granted this \nbenefit meets the legal standard. Because of the asylum backlog and \nbecause conditions in the individual's home country had changed since \nthe filing of their original asylum claims, the Department of Justice \nunder President Clinton encouraged these central Americans to seek \nsuspension of deportation rather than continuing to press their asylum \nclaims or file a new lawsuit.\n  Again, the point that I am trying to make here in laying out this \nhistory is that each step along the way this group of individuals has \ncomplied with the rules that existed at the time. In fact, we went to \nthe extent that we encouraged these people to file for suspension of \ndeportation, and it would just be fundamentally unfair at this point if \nwe were to change the rules on these people who in fact have been \ntrying to live by the rules every day that they have been here.\n\n  Several other points. The reason why we believe this is important is \nbecause we believe that this in essence will deny these people the \nright to due process under laws with respect to suspension of \ndeportation.\n  I want to emphasize to my colleagues that this is not amnesty, and \nthere is nothing automatic here. Let us assume for a moment that this \namendment were to pass. We are not guaranteeing anybody anything other \nthan the fact that they will have to comply with the rules as they \nexisted at the time they came into the process of suspension of \ndeportation.\n  Again, I want to emphasize to my colleagues that this is not amnesty. \nEvery person affected by my amendment is merely being given a chance \nfor due process, to have their case heard. They must still meet the \ncriteria to be granted suspension of deportation. In addition, my \namendment is focused only upon an identifiable group. There are those \nwho want to create the impression that if this amendment passes \nliterally millions of people, millions of illegal immigrants will use \nthis as a loophole to remain in the country. This is an extremely \nidentifiable group. And, again, working with the INS, we have concluded \nthat there are probably in the neighborhood of 316,000 individuals that \nwould be included in the group, and of that 316,000 it is likely that \n150,000 will receive suspension of deportation.\n  Again, I make the point that we ought to pass this amendment from the \nperspective of fairness. We should not change the rules midstream for \nthis group of people. It is unfair and, I would make the claim, un-\nAmerican.\n  On a personal note, from time to time, I have been asked why I became \ninvolved in this issue, and I will tell you that one of the memories \nthat comes back to me is a trip to Nicaragua back in the 1980's where I \nwent to a contra camp, and this was at a particular period of time \nwhere the concern was whether the United States was going to continue \nto provide assistance to those fighting for freedom in Nicaragua. And \nsince they did not have the commitment to those financial resources, \nthousands of these freedom fighters came back into the camps in \nnorthern Nicaragua. I visited them. It was quite a scene--I must say, \ntoo, a very emotional scene.\n  As the helicopter landed, off to the side of the camp two lines were \nformed, in essence two lines of men in fatigues at attention. As we \nwalked through this group of individuals, where roughly 7,000 to 8,000 \nfreedom fighters were standing at attention, three men, three of the \nsoldiers, with guitars played the Nicaraguan national anthem. It was a \ntremendously emotional period. In essence I said to them that we will \nnot abandon you, that we will continue to support you in your fight for \nfreedom.\n\n  I would make the case that fighting for freedom is not just providing \nresources to those engaged in battle, or fighting for freedom is not \nsimply standing firm in the U.S. Senate for a strong national defense. \nBut standing firm for the protection of individual rights is, in fact, \nstanding up for freedom. And I encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  We have encouraged those people over years, not only in their fight \nfor freedom, but afterward, telling them that if they played by the \nrules they could stay in this country.\n  Mr. President, again, I encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment. It is the right thing to do. It is a fair thing to do. And \nit would be in the best interests of our country to continue to stand \nup for freedom for this group of people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am very proud to support my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Mack, in our efforts to include the Immigration \nReform and Transition Act, as modified, in this current legislation. It \nis important that we take this step today, or as soon thereafter as \npossible. There are thousands of families who are currently in a legal \nlimbo because of the retroactive changes that were made in the \nimmigration laws that were passed in 1996. Senator Mack, Senator \nKennedy, and others have worked to develop a bipartisan, humane \nsolution to give these families the opportunity to remain together--and \nI underscore the word ``opportunity''--and to continue the lives that \nthey have built in hundreds of our local communities in the United \nStates.\n  I can tell you from personal knowledge and experience and \nrelationships, that the people to whom this amendment is primarily \ndirected are, in the overwhelming number, hard-working, tax-paying, \nlaw-abiding individuals who have followed every rule and regulation \nsince they have been resident in the United States and are making a \ncontribution to the development of our country. Since the 1996 \nretroactive immigration bill passed, with the consequences that Senator \nMack has just outlined, these families have lived in fear, fear of \nbeing uprooted and torn apart, and fear that all of their hard work in \nthe United States will be for naught. We now have the chance to act and \nease these fears.\n  The thousands of people we are seeking justice for have human faces. \nThey are not just statistics, they are not just theories in an \nImmigration Act. I want to submit for the Record, stories that mention \nthe human dimension of this important amendment. Also, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record, editorials in support of the \nactions we are urging today.\n  There being no objection, the editorials were ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S10198]]\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Mar. 4, 1997]\n\n                       Deportations Without Cause\n\n       Once again the United States has thrown up a hurdle to \n     stymie immigrants who have legitimate grounds to stay in this \n     country. A recent ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals \n     could send packing tens of thousands of Nicaraguans, \n     Salvadorans, Mexicans, and others who have lived in this \n     country for years.\n       The case before the board involved a Nicaraguan woman from \n     Miami who had been served deportation orders. Like any number \n     who fled Nicaragua during the 1980s, she sought legal status \n     under immigration rules that offer relief to those who, among \n     other criteria, have been in the United States for at least \n     seven years. The board rule 7-5 that she was ineligible for \n     relief, however. It interpreted the new Illegal Immigration \n     Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act to mean that her time \n     in the United States ended when she was served a summons \n     called an ``Order to Show Cause.'' Though physically she had \n     resided and worked in the United States more than the \n     required time, the board said, officially she did not meet \n     the seven-year criteria for suspending her deportation.\n       Ernesto Varas, the woman's attorney, is one among many who \n     dispute that legal interpretation. He now plans to take the \n     case to the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Meanwhile, \n     there is little comfort for those living under threat of \n     deportation. The INS, which is still mulling the Immigration \n     Board ruling, doesn't offer an estimate of how many may be \n     affected. In South Florida, estimates range from 20,000 to \n     75,000 possible deportees. The prospect alarmed even \n     Nicaragua's National Assembly, which argued in a letter to \n     the U.S. Congress that its economy is in no shape to absorb \n     such an impact.\n       Alternatives to deportation should be sought. Particularly \n     for Nicaraguans, who sought refuge from the Sandinista regime \n     in the country that financed the war against the Sandinistas. \n     Deportation would mean unjust hardship for folks who have \n     lived here peaceably for years, such as Nicaraguan Juan Sorto \n     of Fort Lauderdale. As reported by Mabell Dieppa in El Nuevo \n     Herald, Mr. Sorto entered the United States from Mexico on \n     Jan. 2, 1987. Served with an Order to Show Cause the same \n     day, he may not qualify for relief from deportation--even \n     though the INS released him on bail and issued him work \n     permits, and even though he has paid taxes and supported his \n     three U.S.-born children for 10 years here.\n       Attorney General Janet Reno should keep in mind Mr. Sorto \n     and contradictory U.S. policy and review the Immigration \n     Board's recent ruling along with its implementation by the \n     INS.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, May 22, 1997]\n\n                       Defending the Indefensible\n\n       It's bad enough that Congress passed the immoral illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act, now in \n     effect. It's worse that the U.S. Immigration and \n     Nationalization Service is incapable of enforcing this law \n     with any measure of commonsense or consistency. It's worse \n     still that the highest immigration court misinterpreted--\n     forcing the INS to misapply--the law so that overnight tens \n     of thousands of Nicaraguans and other longtime immigrants \n     became deportable aliens.\n       But worse of all, what's happening now in U.S. District \n     Court in Miami is simply reprehensible: The federal \n     government is using its full weight to try to keep those \n     immigrants from having their deserved say in court.\n       The Nicaraguans are suing the government in a class-action \n     suit representing some 30,000 to 40,000 immigrants who could \n     qualify for legal status if not for the retroactive \n     application of a provision in the new law. Under that \n     provision, immigrants we were served ``show-cause'' papers by \n     immigration authorities before their seventh year in the \n     United States no longer qualify for relief from deportation.\n       Senior U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King heard \n     testimony for two days last week and temporarily barred the \n     deportation of those immigrants. U.S. attorneys argued that \n     under the new law, federal courts do not have jurisdiction in \n     these immigration cases. The government's argument ``would \n     require the court to rule that there is simply no remedy \n     available for the 30,000 to 40,000 Nicaraguan refugees and \n     others who have sought suspension of deportation. The court \n     declines to do so,'' ruled Judge King. Well done, and well \n     said.\n       Unbelievably, however, government lawyers are still \n     battling to keep the immigrants from their right to a \n     hearing. Why? Because their testimony would form a factual \n     record on the merit of their claims for an appellate court to \n     review. Congress is empowered to limit courts' jurisdiction, \n     Judge King wrote. But it can't deny courts their power to \n     review constitutional questions.\n       To his credit, Judge King has called the government \n     lawyers' bluff. He ordered them to produce thousands of pages \n     of documents to the immigrants' lawyers by tomorrow. He \n     ordered INS Commissioner Doris Meissner and other officials \n     to appear in his court on Saturday and Monday for \n     depositions. And he set a hearing on a temporary injunction \n     for next Tuesday.\n       Now it's the government's move. Could it just make too much \n     sense to stop wasting tax dollars trying to deport \n     productive, taxpaying, longtime immigrants without due \n     process, a hearing to which they're entitled? We'll soon see.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n         [From the Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, June 26, 1997]\n\n   Reno Should Back Judge's Ruling, Help Nicaraguans to Stay in Peace\n\n       It's temporary reprieve, but a welcome and justifiable one, \n     for 40,000 Nicaraguans who were about to be deported from \n     this country. In a lengthy ruling, dripping with anger at the \n     government and packed with compassion for hard-working \n     immigrants, U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King blocked \n     their deportation at least until a trial can be held in \n     January.\n       Their deportation orders should be revoked permanently. \n     Nicaraguans who fled to this country in the 1980s as refugees \n     from their country's bloody civil war, in which the United \n     States was deeply involved, were at first helped by the \n     Immigration and Naturalization Service to get work permits \n     and find jobs.\n       As King pointed out, the Nicaraguans then established \n     homes, married, had children and grandchildren, started \n     businesses, paid taxes, obeyed our laws and contributed to \n     their communities. In return, INS changed the rules in \n     midstream and tried to deport them to their native land.\n       That's unfair and unacceptable. ``Their hopes and \n     expectations of remaining in the United States were raised \n     and then dashed'' by INS' change in policy, King said, and if \n     they're deported they'll be separated from their children and \n     irreparably harmed.\n       King's ruling in Miami was gutsy and appropriate. It lashes \n     at the INS for misinterpreting a new immigration law and for \n     luring tens of thousands of Nicaraguans to apply for \n     suspension of deportation--and pay a fee--while knowing full \n     well Congress was considering eliminating that right of \n     suspension.\n       The Nicaraguans, stung and frightened by unfair government \n     treatment in a nation supposedly built on fairness, have gone \n     underground, or pulled their children from school, or decline \n     to come forward for medical treatment. One Nicaraguan child, \n     cited by King in his ruling, died when his parents refused to \n     bring him to a hospital for treatment.\n       The Nicaraguans thought, not without some validity, that by \n     appearing in public they would be picked up and deported. \n     That's perhaps the saddest story, with the most painful \n     lesson to emerge from this debacle: Come forward voluntarily, \n     and some U.S. government agent could send you packing, \n     leaving your American-born children behind.\n       The best way to end this deeply embarrassing episode is for \n     Attorney General Janet Reno, one of the defendants, to \n     convince her boss, President Clinton, that the new \n     immigration law has been misintepreted. Then the INS should \n     slink away, and let the Nicaraguans live in peace, in what \n     Judge King referred to as ``a nation renowned throughout the \n     civilized world for justice, fairness and respect for human \n     rights.''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am working today to offer fairness and \njustice for a woman who lives in Miami. She is 86 years old. She and \nher family came to America, encouraged by the U.S. Government to do so \nin 1984. Without this amendment, she faces almost certain deportation \nback to Nicaragua. With this amendment she has the chance, the \nopportunity to apply to be considered on her own individual merits, \nbased on her length of residence in the United States and her \ncontributions since she has been in this country, to stay in the United \nStates on a permanent, secure basis.\n  I also speak on behalf of an 18-year-old student at Coral Park High \nSchool in Miami. This student's parents fled Nicaragua when he was 7 \nyears old. His family was allowed to stay under the old law, and now he \nmay be forced back to a country with which he has almost no connection.\n  These two examples, an elderly lady and a young man, are examples of \nthe people to whom we are attempting to apply fundamental fairness, to \ngive them the opportunity to apply on their own merits, on their own \nrecords in this country, for a legal, permanent status. These families \nhave been in our Nation since the early 1980's, since our Government \nencouraged them to flee Communist oppression and civil unrest in \nCentral America. Speaking specifically to those who have come from \nNicaragua, they fled a nation which had been taken over by a Communist \nregime, which was supported by the then-Soviet Union. In one of the \nlast of those cold war confrontations in a third country, between the \nSoviet Union and the United States, the United States encouraged those \nNicaraguans to leave, to come and to participate in the effort, which \nwas finally successful, to restore democratic government to Nicaragua.\n  Mr. President, 15 years after they came at our request, they own \ntheir\n\n[[Page S10199]]\n\nown homes, they have U.S. citizen children, they have opened up small \nbusinesses, they have become flourishing entrepreneurs. Now we have \nchanged the rules and threaten to divide families. This massive \nupheaval would be detrimental, not only to the individuals affected, \nbut also to Central American nations that would be forced to absorb \nthousands of new residents. This action, taken in 1996, if not modified \nby this amendment which Senator Mack, Senator Kennedy, and I are \nproposing today, would have adverse effects on U.S. interests in this \nimportant region. It would have a destabilizing effect today. It would \nhave an even greater impact in the future, when, God forbid, we were \never in another situation as we were in Nicaragua in the early 1980's. \nHow could the United States with any credibility call out to the people \nof that country to resist the actions of governments which were \nantithetical to U.S. interests?\n  I believe the honor of the United States of America is at stake in \nthis amendment that we offer today. I emphasize, as Senator Mack has so \neffectively done, that this is not an amnesty program. We are not \nstating that all of these people who meet the standards covered by this \namendment will become permanent residents, or have any other legal \nstatus in the United States. What we are saying is that under the rules \nthat applied at the time they came into this country, at our \ninvitation, they will have the right to apply. They will have the right \nto apply to receive permanent residence. It will then be their \nobligation to meet the standards to justify a permanent status in the \nUnited States. That is fundamental American fairness.\n  By adopting this amendment and by recommitting ourselves to that \nstandard of fairness and justice, we will be sending a strong message, \nthat we will support the foreign policy objectives that led to our call \nin the first instance. We will be sending a strong message that the \nUnited States of America believes in playing by the rules and not \nchanging those rules in midlife.\n  These families deserve that message of fairness. They deserve it now. \nThey fled persecution and communism to seek a safe haven in our \ncountry. They assisted our country in restoring democracy to their \ncountry. We must not abandon them now.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time to my colleague, Senator Mack, \nand also to Senator Abraham, for further comments on this issue. Thank \nyou, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I rise today to speak in support of the amendment offered by the \nSenators from Florida. This may be a somewhat unusual occurrence in the \nSenate, because it is often the case that individuals who chair \nauthorizing committees, in this case the Immigration Subcommittee which \nI chair, frequently are at odds with Members who seek to use \nappropriations bills as vehicles for substantive legislation.\n  So I wanted to come down today to speak on behalf of this amendment \nand to explain it a little bit, both why I am not here in opposition on \nthe basis of the process we are using, and also why I support doing \nsomething at this time along the lines outlined in the amendment.\n  First, Mr. President, let me just indicate that a number of us have \nbeen working for some months to try to resolve the issues that are \naddressed by this amendment. We are working with our House \ncounterparts. We will continue to work, even as we move forward in the \nSenate today, to try to find an ultimate solution.\n  At the same time, though, time is of the essence. There is a sense of \nurgency, I think a growing sense of urgency, among a number of Members, \nas expressed by both the Senators from Florida, as well as in my case \nand probably other Members as well, because the impact of the 1996 \nimmigration legislation is slowly but surely coming into effect. The \npeople who may or may not be affected by that legislation, depending on \nthe various decisions to be made by the Department of Justice and the \ncourts, are living on a day-to-day basis under the threat of the \nprospect of deportation. It seems it is in everyone's interest, but it \nis also in the interest of fairness for these individuals, for us to \ntry to take legislative action to resolve and address these matters \nonce and for all.\n  Both Senators have already talked at some length about the chronology \nof circumstances that brings us here today. I won't go into all the \ndetail, nor do I have the sort of personal, firsthand experience of \nhaving served in the Senate or the Congress at the time many of these \nissues were previously debated. I am a late arrival to the debate, and \nI am more an observer of the circumstances that took place in Central \nAmerica than a participant.\n  Those were significant times, Mr. President. The civil wars of the \n1980's in El Salvador, in Guatemala, and Nicaragua were integrally \nrelated to the national security policy of our country, as well as our \nviews with regard to America's role in our hemisphere.\n  Throughout the 1980's and into the early 1990's, El Salvador lived \nthrough a brutal civil war which left tens of thousands of people \nkilled, over a quarter of the population driven from their homes and \nthe economy in shambles. Hundreds of thousands of Salvadorans made \ntheir way to the United States seeking asylum out of fear of being \nkilled by the military, the leftist guerrillas or the extreme right \ndeath squads. In fact, from fiscal year 1981 to fiscal year 1991, \napproximately 126,000 Salvadorans applied for asylum. That was a \nquarter of all our asylum applications in that timeframe.\n  Meanwhile, similar events took place in Guatemala. Approximately \n42,000 Guatemalans applied for asylum in the United States.\n  Meanwhile, the civil war in Nicaragua in the 1980's also prompted \nactions of a similar nature. As you know, Mr. President, during the \n1980s, there was a war between the Communist-influenced Sandinistas, \nwho controlled the government at the time, and groups seeking to \noverthrow that government. These groups ultimately were supported by \nthe U.S. Government and became known as the Contras. The war drained \nthe Nicaraguan economy, which was battered as well by a United States \nembargo on trade and a series of natural disasters. Approximately \n126,000 Nicaraguans applied for asylum in the United States from 1981 \nto 1991.\n\n  What happened when these various people came to our country was \nsomewhat different than what happened to others who have come here. \nFirst of all, many of these people were, in one form or another, either \nasylees or invitees. Indeed, the actions with regard to the Nicaraguans \nin particular suggests that the American Government was actively \npromoting the notion that those Nicaraguans, fearful of the outcome of \nthese uprisings, come to America. The extended voluntary departure \nprogram, which was granted by our Attorney General, was a form of \ntemporary protection from deportation granted under the discretionary \nauthority of the Attorney General.\n  When that program, which began in 1979, expired, it was extended \nfurther through a variety of other congressional actions and \nadministrative actions. In 1987, the Reagan administration established \nthe Nicaraguan Review Program. The NRP provided an extra level of \nreview to Nicaraguans denied asylum. The Attorney General, taking into \naccount a new Supreme Court decision bearing on standard of proof for \nan asylum applicant to show fear of persecution, encouraged Nicaraguans \nto reapply for asylum under the new standard and instructed the INS to \nconduct outreach in Nicaraguan communities and to issue work permits to \nNicaraguan applicants as soon as they applied for asylum under the new \nstandard.\n  When that program ended in 1995, the INS published a notice \nannouncing the termination of the program. Instead of facing \ndeportation, however, under a phaseout program, Nicaraguans were \nencouraged to reopen their deportation cases and apply for suspension \nof deportation, for which they were told they may be eligible if they \nhad been in the United States continuously for 7 or more years.\n  The point of my statement with respect to Nicaraguans, and a similar \nset of circumstances as pertains to the Salvadorans and Guatemalans, is \nthat during this period, Mr. President, in the 1980's, this country \nactively encouraged people fearing persecution,\n\n[[Page S10200]]\n\nfearing death squads, fearing disruptions of their communities to come \nto America. Then we took extraordinary measures to make it feasible for \nthem to stay here, even those who had been denied asylum through the \nofficial asylum-seeking procedures.\n  All of this transpired, Mr. President, prior to the passage of the \n1996 immigration bill. At that point, things changed. Here I think it \nis very important to understand some of the legal circumstances that \nchanged.\n  Prior to the passage of the 1996 bill, if someone had been in this \ncountry for a period of 7 years or more, they were permitted to seek \nsuspension and adjustment of their status from being in illegal status \nhere or being here under one of the special programs for the Central \nAmericans. Extensions were given to the Central American communities I \nhave mentioned to allow them to stay here long enough to apply for \nthese programs.\n  Detrimental reliance on their part occurred under the belief that if \nthey continued to follow these programs, they would be given their day \nin court and given a fair adjudication of their status, and that is \nwhat transpired.\n  At every step of the way, either through an act of Congress or \nthrough an act of the executive branch, these individuals were given, I \nthink, a very clear signal that they would be able remain if they \nplayed by the rules that were then existent: That if they stayed for 7 \nyears and proved themselves to be of good moral character, they would \nbe given an opportunity to have a full adjudication of whether or not \nany process to deport them would be suspended and whether or not they \nwould be given a green card and a chance to stay permanently.\n  However, the 1996 bill changed the rules under which this would be \npermitted. In my judgment, Mr. President, it was not the intent of \nCongress to have this 1996 legislation retroactively apply to the \npeople in these circumstances. I believe that Congress tried to avoid \nchanging the standard retroactively.\n  We specifically provided that, generally speaking, the old rules are \nsupposed to be applied to people in deportation proceedings before \nApril 1, 1997, the effective date of the act. The problem is the INS \nhas interpreted the act as saying that many of the Central Americans \nwere not in deportation proceedings before that time and, hence, it has \nto apply the tougher new standards to them.\n  Now, the basis on which this determination was made by the INS, I \nbelieve, Mr. President, is extremely subject to question. I think it is \nan extremely difficult case to make that the group that the INS has \nargued were not in proceedings as of April 1, 1996, truly were not in \nproceedings. I believe they acted exactly as they had been told they \nshould act, to qualify for the adjudications I have mentioned. But for \nwhatever reason, the INS has concluded that, as to them, we will \nretroactively change the rules.\n  Let me talk about what those rule changes would be. First, as opposed \nto being required to be in the country for 7 years, the requirement was \nchanged to 10 years, meaning an additional 3 years before one could \neven seek to have their status cleared. In addition, the standard to be \nused in such adjudications was made much more difficult. In other \nwords, the standard that people had been promised they would be judged \nby for all the years they were here was altered and made a much tougher \nstandard retroactively after they had stayed longer, after they had \ndetrimentally relied on the assurances they had been granted with \nregard to whether or not they would be given a hearing, and after they \nhad been told what they had every reason to expect was the basis on \nwhich the relief would be granted.\n  Furthermore, based on a judicial decision made within the immigration \ncourts, the clock was stopped with respect to the accrual of time \ntoward the 10-year standard, or, for that matter, the old 7-year \nstandard, because it was determined as soon as the individuals had \nreceived so-called orders to show cause, the clock would stop.\n  Mr. President, these are obviously fairly complicated legal terms, \nand I will try to simplify them here for purposes of this discussion. \nThe rules were changed in the middle of the game to the detrimental \nreliance of literally thousands of individuals who had been waiting and \nplaying by the rules and, in most cases, had actually made themselves \navailable for this process by coming forward in response to \nrequirements that had been in the earlier legislation that had set the \nprocess in motion.\n  Now they had a choice when the earlier legislation was passed. They \ncould have disappeared into the country, never subjected themselves to \nthe process, and been totally immune from any deportation unless they \nwere somehow discovered. Alternatively, they could make themselves \navailable, accept orders to show cause, subject themselves to the \nprocess under a standard they believed would remain in place until they \nhad their trials, and then either be able to stay or be required to \nleave based on a fair adjudication.\n  For the people who played by the rules, the second group, the rules \nare now being changed. They will be disadvantaged as opposed to the \npeople who did not play by the rules. To me, Mr. President, that would \nbe a complete and catastrophic mistake for us to make. It has to be \naddressed in the interests of fairness.\n  Now, there is another thing that has changed that I will also mention \nin the bill that was passed in 1996, a limit, a cap of 4,000 \nsuspensions and adjustments per year was placed and put in force. I \nbelieve it was put in force at that level because it was the view of \nthe drafters of the legislation that 4,000 would be adequate to meet \nthe amount of such suspensions and adjustments of status that would be \ngranted by the reviewing boards, the immigration courts. I believe that \n4,000 figure was recommended by the Immigration Service because it was \nnever contemplated that it would be applied to those who are in this \ncategory of Central Americans we are trying to address today because \nthis category is a much larger group. They will consume more than 4,000 \nadjustments per year, because at least that many and probably as many \nas 7,000 or 8,000 more per year will meet the standard and be permitted \nto stay.\n\n  The cap now in place has the perverse effect of literally putting \npeople in a position where if they somehow meet the 7- or 10-year \nstandard, if they somehow meet the adjudicatory standard of whether or \nnot they will be permitted to stay if the 4,000 cap is reached, they \nwill still be deported. Now, I can't imagine that that was the intent \nof the drafters, and I can't imagine, frankly, Mr. President, it would \nbe sustained in the Federal court system. I believe it is one of a \nvariety of problems that now exists and which will be effectively \naddressed by Senator Mack's proposal.\n  To summarize what these problems are, there are the constitutional \nissues that I think will arise. The due process question is whether the \nstandards could be changed in the middle of the game and applied \nretroactively. We have the problem of this cap, which potentially \ncreates the absurd circumstance I just described where people who have \nbeen adjudged to be able to stay in the country are still deported \nbecause the 4,000 limit has been reached. We have the anomaly I have \ndescribed where those people who were trying to play by the rules, who \nsubjected themselves to the process in response to legislation we \npassed, would suddenly find themselves in a disadvantaged position as \nopposed to those who never played by the rules in the first place. And \nwhat we have, in effect, is a circumstance that I describe as bait and \nswitch. We encouraged people to come forward, to make themselves \navailable for the adjudicatory process, and once they do, based on this \ninterpretation of the 1996 bill, we have now changed the standard by \nwhich they will be subjected and changed whether or not even if they \nsuccessfully meet a standard, they will be allowed to stay.\n  For all those reasons, I think we really have to do something in the \nshort run, not wait any longer. I think the bill offered by Senator \nMack makes sense, and it is consistent with the long history of \nAmerica's response to the Central American community and to the \nstruggles of the 1980's. For that reason, as I said at the outset, \nalthough it is a little bit unusual for an authorizing committee \nchairman to come down to the floor to support the inclusion of \nlegislation within their sphere on appropriations, I support this\n\n[[Page S10201]]\n\nlegislation and look forward to working with other Members--if we are \ngoing to pass this--work both with the Senators as well as with our \nHouse colleagues to try to ultimately reach a solution that is \nsatisfactory to everyone affected.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Abraham not only for \nhis eloquent statement but also his understanding of the matter of why \nwe have ended up in this situation of having to deal with this issue on \nan appropriations bill. Again, I appreciate both your effort and your \nstaff's effort over this last week or 10 days to try to keep making the \neffort to see if there was some way we could come to some agreement \nthat would not have to put the Senate through this debate. So again, \nyour counsel was invaluable, and I appreciate your presence on the \nfloor as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration of the \nJudiciary Committee. It is very meaningful to have your support, and we \nthank you very much.\n  Just a couple of other comments, Mr. President. I wanted to indicate \nsome of those who are supportive of this legislation. I have a letter \nfrom Empower America that is signed by Jeane Kirkpatrick, former \nAmbassador to the United Nations; Jack Kemp, former Member of Congress \nand former Secretary of HUD; William Bennett, former Secretary of \nEducation; Lamar Alexander, former Secretary of Education; and Steve \nForbes. All of them are supporting the legislation, making some of the \nsame points that have been made already in the debate this morning. \nThey urge support of the bill.\n  ``We urge you to join in standing in solidarity with free people and \ndemocratic governments of our Central American neighbors and friends.''\n  The point they stressed in the letter is that the Central American \ncountries, who, in essence, we went to bat for in the 1980's to protect \ndemocracy and to move them toward freedom and capitalism, today are \nstill struggling in that battle. To send several hundred thousand \nindividuals back into an environment, for example, in Nicaragua, where \nthe unemployment rate is 60 percent, would destabilize those countries, \nwhich would be just the opposite of the effort that we made in the \n1980's.\n  Again, I appreciate their letter and their support of this \nlegislation. To give you a sense of the range of support, my colleague \nfrom Florida mentioned several editorials. I don't want to duplicate \nthose editorials, but I ask unanimous consent that letters from Empower \nAmerica and the National Restaurant Association be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              Empower America,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 29, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Trent Lott: In the 1980s, we stood in \n     solidarity with the people and governments of Central America \n     who struggled for democracy and peace when threatened by \n     expanding Communist violence and influence. We stand in \n     solidarity with them today, as they work to consolidate \n     democracy and free market economies.\n       Central America's struggles of the last decade caused \n     thousands of Central Americans to flee to the United States. \n     These Central American refugees have tried to comply with \n     U.S. laws and with the immigration requirements which \n     governed their presence in this country. These rules and \n     understandings have now been changed retroactively and \n     unfairly. Our Central American friends living in the United \n     States now face unexpected and unjust deportations, and their \n     countries of origin will face destabilization. Central \n     America will not be able to simultaneously absorb influxes of \n     large numbers of people being forcibly deported and the \n     deprivation of family remittances that have bolstered these \n     struggling economies.\n       The ex post facto legislation under which Central Americans \n     in our country are threatened with deportation undermines and \n     violates our principles and one of President Reagan's most \n     cherished legacies--a stable and free Central America.\n       Senator Connie Mack has introduced the Immigration Reform \n     Transition Act, S. 1076, legislation which will rectify this \n     unfortunate situation. We urge you to support this bill. We \n     urge you to join us in standing in solidarity with the free \n     people and democratic governments of our Central American \n     neighbors and friends.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeane Kirkpatrick.\n     Jack Kemp.\n     William Bennett.\n     Lamar Alexander.\n     Steve Forbes.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 23, 1997.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the National Restaurant \n     Association and the 787,000 restaurants nationwide, we urge \n     you to support bipartisan immigration legislation that will \n     provide relief for many hardworking members--employees--of \n     the restaurant industry.\n       First, we urge you to support permanent extension of \n     Section 245(i) of the Immigration and Nationality Act as part \n     of the Fiscal Year 1998 Commerce, State, Justice \n     Appropriations bill. Section 245(i), which sunsets on \n     September 30, 1997, enables certain restaurant employees who \n     are eligible for permanent resident status to remain in the \n     United States while their application for a ``green card'' is \n     being processed. By definition, these are employees who are \n     outstanding in their field or for whom no U.S. worker is \n     available. Many families and businesses will be disrupted if \n     these employees are forced to return to their home country to \n     wait for paperwork.\n       Second, we urge you to support bipartisan legislation, H.R. \n     2302, introduced by Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-FL) and S. \n     1076, introduced by Senators Connie Mack (R-FL) and Edward \n     Kennedy (D-MA). In 1996 Congress passed the Illegal \n     Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) \n     which made many important immigration reforms. However, one \n     provision would apply new standards and restrictions \n     retroactively, making it much more difficult for certain \n     immigrants--who are residing in this country legally--to get \n     relief.\n       Most affected by the provision are thousands of Central \n     Americans from El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Guatemala who have \n     been in this country legally under temporary protection from \n     deportation while civil wars in their countries made it \n     dangerous for them to go home. These refugees, having lived \n     and worked here for at least seven years, are eligible to \n     remain in the U.S. permanently. The 1996 Act changed the \n     rules of this relief. H.R. 2302 and S. 1076 would prevent the \n     new rules of IIRIRA from being applied to cases that were \n     ending when the law went into effect on April 1, 1997.\n       Thank you for your consideration and support.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                             Elaine Z.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that editorials from \nthe Miami Herald, New York Times, and Washington Times be printed in \nthe Record, also.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Miami Herald, Sept. 3, 1997]\n\n                       Fix Cruel Immigration Law\n\n       Fresh from summer recess, Congress returns this week to \n     tackle substantive issues anew. One that it needs to address \n     is the plight of longtime immigrants who unjustly face \n     deportation because of an unfair, un-American law.\n       Enacted by the same Congress that brought you anti-\n     immigrant welfare reform, a new 1996 immigration law denies \n     the chance to gain legal status to hundreds of thousands of \n     Central Americans and others who have lived peaceably in the \n     United States for years. Some of the new law is so shameful \n     that Senior U.S. District Judge James Lawrence King, in a \n     class-action suit in Miami, has ruled that it violates the \n     due-process rights of some 40,000 Nicaraguans with more than \n     seven years in this country.\n       After Judge King forbade the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service to deport these class members, Attorney General Janet \n     Reno commendably extended the same protections nationwide to \n     cover an estimated 150,000 Savadorans and 80,000 Guatemalans \n     as well. These people also fled U.S. supported civil wars in \n     their homelands during the 1980s. Many have been issued work \n     permits repeatedly and have established families and \n     businesses. They send billions of dollars to loved ones back \n     in their homelands, helping keep struggling economies afloat \n     and dampening illegal immigration to the United States.\n       Unjust immigration law should be corrected. To their \n     credit, a number of legislators have submitted various \n     proposals with that intent, the best of which was authored by \n     U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Miami. An administration-\n     backed bill, proposed by Sens. Bob Graham, D-Miami Lakes, \n     Connie Mack, R-Cape Coral, and Edward Kennedy, D-Mass, \n     removes a retroactive ``stop-time'' rule that unfairly \n     prevents many longtime immigrants from gaining resident \n     status. But an onerous provision that denies immigrants \n     judicial review is most offensive and quite possibly \n     unconstitutional.\n       Under Mr. Diaz-Balart's legislation, immigrants in \n     deportation proceedings before the new law went into effect \n     last April 1 would rightly qualify for relief under previous, \n     more-favorable rules. The same would apply to Nicaraguans, \n     Guatemalans, and Salvadorans who filed asylum claims before \n     April\n\n[[Page S10202]]\n\n     1990; many of them have been hurt by tremendous INS backlogs. \n     (It would be better if the asylum provision extended to \n     Haitians and others immigrants, too). Folks covered by the \n     bill also would be exempt from a arbitrary cap that limits to \n     4,000 the deportations that may be canceled annually.\n       Much as its earlier budget legislation restored significant \n     welfare benefits to legal immigrants, let Congress now \n     reverse a cruel immigration law's punitive provisions.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 1997]\n\n                       Flaws in Immigration Laws\n\n       The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility \n     Act of 1996 is a morass of technical complexity that has yet \n     to be fully explicated by either the law's drafters or the \n     immigration officers who are supposed to carry it out. But it \n     is already apparent that at least two elements need immediate \n     correction.\n       One provision unfairly punishes refugees from Nicaragua, El \n     Salvador and Guatemala who fled civil wars in the 1980's and \n     were given temporary protection from deportation. Under prior \n     law, these refugees, totaling abut 300,000 could have become \n     permanent residents by showing that they had lived here for \n     seven years and had good moral character, and that \n     deportation would cause them and their family members extreme \n     hardship. The 1996 act increased the residency requirements \n     to 10 years, eliminated hardship to the refugee himself as a \n     basis to fight deportation and limited the number of \n     immigrants who could seek permanent residency through this \n     avenue to 4,000.\n       These Central Americans played by an earlier set of rules \n     endorsed by both Republican and Democratic administrations, \n     but are now being unjustly penalized. The White House \n     supports, and Congress should pass, a bill introduced by \n     Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, that would exempt \n     this group from provisions of the new law, allowing the prior \n     legal standards to apply.\n       A second provision would actually encourage illegals to \n     stay underground rather than risk going abroad, as they might \n     soon have to, to obtain immigrant visas. The new law imposes \n     a three-year bar to re-entry on illegals who leave the \n     country today and a 10-year bar on those who leave after \n     April 1. If a key provision in current immigration law is \n     allowed to expire tomorrow, as scheduled, illegals will have \n     to return to their home countries to obtain permanent visas.\n       Under the current role, people who qualify for permanent \n     residency can have their applications for immigrant visas, or \n     ``green cards,'' processed here rather than through American \n     consulate in their home countries. This does not give them \n     any preference. But it reduces paperwork at consulate offices \n     abroad, and generates $200 million a year in revenues from \n     applicants who pay $1,000 each to have their papers processed \n     here.\n       The Senate has voted to make the provision permanent, but \n     the House is expected to vote only on a three-week extension. \n     If Congress does not renew the provision, hundreds of \n     thousands of people will have to go abroad for green cards. \n     Thousands who have met the criteria for permanent residency \n     but are technically illegal in status would be barred from \n     coming back for years.\n       Fighting illegal immigration is a difficult and important \n     job. But Congress should do it in a way that will deter \n     illegal entry at the border. Deporting Central American war \n     refugees and those who are on the verge of getting green \n     cards will not achieve that goal.\n                                                                    ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Times, Aug. 22, 1997]\n\n                     Righting an Immigration Wrong\n\n       Back in the 1980s when communist regimes and insurgences \n     swept through Central America, it was clear to many here that \n     those nations were badly in need of help. The Reagan \n     administration took up the cause of the Contras in Nicaragua, \n     offered support for the beleaguered government of El \n     Salvador, even invading Grenada to prevent communism from \n     gaining foothold in the hemisphere. Despite the best efforts \n     of Democrats to undermine the effort, it was a remarkably \n     successful policy. Today, democracy dominates the region, and \n     economic reconstruction is taking shape.\n       But there is one forgotten chapter of the story, which \n     could have a less than happy ending. That's the over 300,000 \n     refugees from El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala, who ended \n     up in the United States, fleeing persecution, danger and \n     poverty in their home countries, victims of forces far beyond \n     their control.\n       The status of the refugees was not exactly legal, but not \n     exactly illegal either. They were granted various forms of \n     temporary protection from deportation, which in accordance \n     with the law would become permanent if certain conditions \n     were met: seven years of continuous residency, a record of \n     good behavior, and proof of hardships awaiting in their \n     native countries. As a consequence, the refugees settled, had \n     children, many becoming a part of the U.S. workforce that \n     Washington knows very well indeed, the nannies, housekeepers \n     and gardeners that so many have come to rely on.\n       That was until the 1996 Immigration Act changed \n     everything--and did so retroactively. Aimed not so much at \n     the Central Americans but at deterring new refugees, the law \n     capped the number of grantees at 4,000, changed the \n     conditions, and mandated immediate deportation of those who \n     were rejected. To obtain what is now known as ``cancellation \n     of removal,'' a refugee must now have been in the country for \n     10 years, show good character and demonstrate ``extreme or \n     exceptional hardship'' to a U.S. citizen or resident, be that \n     a spouse, child or parent--but, oddly, not the refugee \n     himself.\n       Also, the clock ``stops ticking'' on those 10 years, the \n     moment the INS removal proceedings start. That means that if \n     you applied in good faith after your seven years in the \n     country (as per the 1986 law), and got rejected for having \n     accumulated too little time (in accordance with the 1096 \n     law), you would now be out of luck because you could not \n     accumulate more time. If this sounds Kafkaesque, it's because \n     it surely is.\n       About 1,000 people were deported before the outcry from the \n     Latin American community and the governments in the region \n     caused the Clinton administration to reverse course. On July \n     10, Attorney General Janet Reno vacated a Board of \n     Immigration Appeal's decision in a test case, and the \n     deportations were halted, though last week one Nicaraguan was \n     deported, the first since the attorney general's decision. \n     Bills in the House and Senate will be taken up when Congress \n     comes back to fix the unintended consequences of the 1996 \n     Immigration Act and to grant relief from the 4,000 annual \n     cap. All the refugees want is a hearing based on the \n     conditions at the time when they were granted temporary \n     stay--in other words eliminate the element of retroactivity \n     in the law, which indeed only seems fair.\n       But there is not only the refugees to think of here. If we \n     want the fragile economies of Central America to recover, \n     governments in the region will need breathing space. \n     Nicaragua, for instance, has an unemployment rate of 60 \n     percent and cannot afford to absorb its 250,000 refugees in \n     the United States. Nor indeed can the country afford to do \n     without the remittance sent by Nicaraguans here to their \n     families at home. In other words, giving the Central American \n     refugees the fair shake they deserve will also mean giving \n     their countries a chance to stabilize, which, after all, has \n     been the aim of the U.S. policy deal all around, for them and \n     for us.\n\n  Mr. MACK. Again, I mention those particular editorials because I \nthink it gives you a sense of the range of support, both Democrat and \nRepublican, from conservative to those considered liberal, who support \nour action and support this amendment.\n  Mr. President, there are several things I need to do.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Santorum be added as an original \ncosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, just to close this portion of the debate, \nthere may be some that are saying, why are we doing this now? I ask \npeople to try to put themselves in a position of a group of people who \nhave, in fact, played by the rules, as was so eloquently laid out by \nSenator Abraham, and now there is the great potential that the rules \ncould be changed on them and they would be denied due process. That is \nfundamentally wrong.\n  I want people to think about what it must be like to wake up each \nmorning and wonder whether you are going to be one of those that will \nbe the subject of deportation. Think about the fear that must be going \nthrough that family, that mother or father, when that child goes off to \nschool that afternoon or that morning. What is going to happen? Are \nthey going to receive a notice of deportation? I know that our Nation \ndoes not want to impose that kind of fear on people. That is counter to \neverything that we believe.\n  So again, I ask those who have listened to this debate and will be \nvoting to vote in favor of this amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It is a privilege to join Senator Mack and Senator \nGraham in offering this amendment on behalf of Central American \nrefugees. The amendment we propose today closely parellels S. 1076 the \nImmigration Reform Transition Act of 1997 proposed by President \nClinton, which we introduced on July 28.\n  Without this legislation, thousands of Central American refugee \nfamilies who fled death squads and persecution in their native lands \nand found safe haven in the United States would be forced to return. \nRepublican and Democratic administrations alike promised them \nrepeatedly that they will get their day in court to make their claims \nto remain in the United States.\n  Last year's immigration law, however, turned its back on that \ncommitment and treated these families unfairly. This legislation \nreinstates that promise and guarantees these families the day in court \nthey deserve.\n  Virtually all of these families fled to the United States in the \n1980's from El Salvador, Nicaragua, or Guatemala. Many were targeted by \ndeath squads and faced persecution at the hands of rogue militias. They \ncame to America\n\n[[Page S10203]]\n\nto seek safety and freedom for themselves and their children.\n  The Reagan administration, the Bush Administration, and the Clinton \nadministration assured them that they could apply to remain permanently \nin the United States under our immigration laws. They were promised \nthat if they have lived here for at least 7 years and are of good moral \ncharacter, and if a return to Central America will be an unusual \nhardship, they would be allowed to remain. Last year's immigration law \nviolated that commitment.\n  President Clinton has promised to find a fair and reasonable solution \nfor these families, and the administration will use its authority to \nhelp as many of them as possible. But Congress must do its part too, by \nenacting this corrective legislation.\n  Some are opposing this legislation as an amnesty for illegal aliens. \nThat charge is false. It is an insult to these hard-working refugees, \nand their families who have suffered so much pain and hardship and who \nrelied in good faith on the solemn promise they were given.\n  Virtually all of these families are already known to the Immigration \nand Naturalization Service. They are not illegal aliens working \nunderground. These families have applied to come to the United States \nunder INS programs, and they are here on a variety of temporary \nimmigration categories. They have acted in accord with what our \nGovernment told them to do.\n  Not all of these families will qualify to remain here under the terms \nof this amendment. They still must meet certain standards that existed \nin the law, before last year's immigration law was enacted and applied \nretroactively. The Immigration Service estimates that less than half of \nthose who qualify to apply to remain in this country will be approved.\n  These families are law-abiding, tax-paying members of communities in \nall parts of America. In many many cases, they have children who were \nborn in this country and who are U.S. citizens by birth. They deserve \nto be treated fairly, and I urge the Senate to support the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will not raise a point of order against \nSenator Mack's amendment. Though I continue to have numerous concerns \nabout the proposed measure, it has been improved since the original \nClinton administration proposal was offered.\n  I am supportive of allowing those Central Americans who came to this \ncountry during the 1980's in order to flee persecution, and other forms \nof danger, to have the opportunity to apply for relief from deportation \nunder the suspension of deportation application rules that existed \nprior to the passage of last year's immigration reform bill.\n  During the 1980's thousands of our neighbors from El Salvador, \nGuatemala, and Nicaragua came to this country to escape civil war. \nThese individuals were granted temporary protected status [TPS], and \nwere allowed to stay in the United States and work because of the \nforeign policy issues at hand.\n  During such time, these Central Americans should have been afforded a \nproper opportunity to have asylum applications processed, but some were \ndenied this opportunity. As a result, these individuals, made up of \nSalvadorans and Guatemalans who are sometimes referred to as the \nAmerican Baptist Churches [ABC] case group, were given another \nopportunity to have their asylum cases heard. This group is also \ncomprised of Nicaraguans who participated in the Nicaraguan Review \nProgram.\n  If such asylum applications were denied, the Central Americans were \nto be afforded the opportunity to apply for what is known as suspension \nof deportation. That means that, even if they were denied asylum, but \ncould prove that they were persons of good moral character, had been \nliving in the United States for 7 years, and could prove that \ndeportation would cause extreme hardship to either the immigrant or a \nU.S. citizen or legal immigrant, the Attorney General could suspend the \nalien's deportation.\n  However, in the ensuing years, the U.S. asylum system has become so \nbacked-up that upward of 240,000 Central Americans' asylum cases have \nnot been resolved. As a result, the process for applying for suspension \nof deportation has been delayed as well.\n  Many of us argue that these Central Americans should be allowed to go \nthrough the suspension of deportation process that existed prior to the \npassage of the Immigraton Act of 1996 because most have lived here \nsince the 1980's and were led to believe that their claims to asylum, \nor that their pleas to adjust to legal status, would be processed under \npre-1996 rules.\n  The Mack amendment will afford these Central Americans who fled here \namid civil war and chaos in the 1970's and 1980's a fair chance to show \nthat their deportation would cause extreme hardship.\n  The Mack amendment has been improved substantially in one critical \narea. Initially, the proposal allowed any individual, not just Central \nAmericans, in deportation proceedings as of April 1, 1997, to apply for \nsuspension of deportation under the old rules--7 years in U.S., good \nmoral character, extreme hardship--instead of the new tougher rules \nunder the Immigration Act of 1996. The revised Mack amendment will \nallow those Central Americans, who came here to flee civil strife and \nwar in the 1980's, to apply for suspension of deportation under the old \nrules. Individuals who have simply come here illegally will be required \nto apply for suspension of deportation under the new Immigration Act of \n1996 rules. The new rules require such illegal immigrants to prove, \nlike the old law, that they are of good moral character. But, in \naddition, they must prove that they have been in the United States \ncontinuously for 10 years and demonstrate that removal would cause \nextreme and unusual hardship to a U.S. citizen or legal immigrant, but \nnot to the illegal immigrant himself.\n  The fact that this amendment has been revised to include only Central \nAmericans is important--during all of the meetings I have had on this \nissue, and of all of the correspondence I have received, none have \nsuggested that any individuals other than those Central Americans who \nfled to the United States in the 1980's should be processed under old \nImmigration Act suspension standards. I am pleased that the Mack \nproposal limits the scope in this area.\n  A provision of the Mack amendment that I continue to be concerned \nabout concerns a numerical cap included in last year's Immigration Act. \nThe Immigration Act of 1996 imposed a cap of 4,000 on the number of \nsuspension of deportation cases that can be adjudicated in a given \nyear. The Mack proposal removes the numerical cap of 4,000.\n  Even though the necessary adjustments have been made to ensure that \nonly a specific group of individuals will be allowed to have their \nsuspension of deportation cases heard under the old rules, the fact is, \naccording to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, approximately \n150,000 Central Americans will actually be adjusting their status to \npermanent legal resident. These additional permanent resident numbers \nshould be offset in other areas of legal immigration. During the \nnegotiation on this amendment, many of us suggested that we increase \nthe number of individuals who will be adjudicated per year from 4,000 \nto 14,000, but include these numbers in our annual count of legal \nimmigration and ensure, as a result of the addition, that legal \nimmigration does not increase. The Mack proposal should be modified to \nreinstate the cap, but at 14,000 annually, with an offset in legal \nimmigration that ensures that legal immigration does not increase.\n  Another concern I have about the Mack proposal is its silence about \nwhether thousands of individuals who entered the country illegally, \nwith no connection to any of these formerly war-torn countries, should \nbe exempted from one of the new tougher standards against illegal \nimmigration in the Immigration Act of 1996. Specifically, the Mack \namendment is silent on the issue of the N-J-B case. The N-J-B case \ndetermined that section 309(C)5 of the Immigration Act of 1996 means \nthat ``period of continuous residence'' stopped when an alien was \nserved with an order to show cause before enactment of the Immigration \nAct of 1996, and that such time stops when an alien is, or was, served \na notice to appear after enactment of the Immigration Act of 1996. In \nother words, the Bureau of Immigration Appeals has interpreted the \nprovision to mean that those aliens applying for suspension of \ndeportation cannot\n\n[[Page S10204]]\n\ncount as time spent here in the United States that time spent here \nafter having received an order. If congressional intent is not clarifed \nin this area, it has been made clear that the Clinton administration \nwill seek to administratively overturn the N-J-B decision.\n  Legislation introduced by Representative Lamar Smith would clarify \ncongressional intent. It provides that the period of time that an \nindividual is considered to have been in the United States stops when \nan order to show cause was issued, except for those Guatemalans, \nSalvadorans, and Nicaraguans who fled here during the 1970's and 1980's \nto escape civil strife and persecution. Under the Smith proposal, these \nCentral Americans would be allowed to continue to count the time spent \nhere in the United States after having received an order to show cause.\n  Mr. President, many people are legitimately concerned about the \neffects of the removal of these Central Americans from the United \nStates. It is my hope that, as we work toward a D.C. appropriations \nconference report, a modified version of this amendment can be achieved \nto the satisfaction of all interested parties.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will report House Joint Resolution \n94.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H. J. Res. 94) making continuing \n     appropriations for the fiscal year 1998, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n\n                              log exports\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I rise for a brief colloquy with, the manager of the \nbill. Mr. President, section 104 of the continuing resolution states \nthat no funds available or authority granted shall be used to initiate \nor resume any project or activity for which appropriations, funds, or \nother authority were not available during fiscal year 1997. As the \nchairman knows, the fiscal year 1997 interior--or is it Omnibus--\nappropriations bill included language which prohibited the use of \nappropriated funds to review or modify sourcing areas previously \napproved under the Forest Resources Conservation and Shortage Relief \nAct [FRCSRA] of 1990. The fiscal year 1997 language goes on to further \nprohibit the use of funds to enforce or implement Forest Service \nregulations for this act that were issued on September 8, 1995. As the \nchairman is also aware, I have included language in the fiscal year \n1998 Interior appropriations bill that clarifies FRCSRA. Am I correct \nin my interpretation of the continuing resolution, that the provisions \nrelated to FRCSRA in fiscal year 1997 are extended for the duration of \nthis CR?\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator is correct in his assessment of the \ncontinuing resolution. If funding and authority were restricted in \nfiscal year 1997, then that same funding and authority remains \nrestricted under this resolution. In this particular case, the language \nto which the Senator from Washington refers in fiscal year would be \nextended for the duration of the CR.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the third reading of the \njoint resolution.\n  The joint resolution (H. J. Res. 94) was ordered to a third reading, \nand was read for a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to use just a few minutes of \nmy leader time, if I can. I know we are on the D.C. appropriations \nbill, and there is a Mack amendment pending. But until we get back to \nit, I would like to just take a couple of minutes.\n  I do not know whether we will have the opportunity again today to \ntalk about campaign finance reform. I certainly hope so. But on the \npossibility that we will not have that opportunity, I wanted to \nreiterate an offer that I have made publicly and I would like to do it \nfor the Record, if I can.\n  Obviously, we are in a situation now where the tree has been filled, \nand there are no opportunities to offer amendments. I am disappointed \nwe are in that set of circumstances because, clearly, with campaign \nfinance reform, as important as it is, with Senators waiting to have \nthe opportunity to offer amendments, we are being denied that right. I \nhope that at some point we could clear the tree and allow Senators the \nopportunity to offer amendments. That is what a good debate is all \nabout. It is not how long you spend on any given issue as much as it \nis, during whatever time you spend on the issue, whether or not you \nhave had a good chance for debate.\n  I must say I think the debate has been very good with regard to \nSenators coming to the floor to express themselves on an array of \npositions, and I respect Senators on both sides of the aisle who made \nthe effort to come to the floor and express themselves as clearly as \nthey can.\n  My hope is that we can get back to this issue and have the \nopportunity, therefore, to offer amendments. The offer I made--and I \nwill personally make this same offer to the majority leader--is that we \ntake the Lott amendment and separate it. Democrats would be prepared, \njust as soon as we finish campaign finance reform, to allow this bill \nto be debated without filibuster, to allow the bill to be voted upon up \nor down. Obviously, we have amendments because in our view, whatever \ntreatment we accord labor, we ought to accord corporations and other \norganizations that may have membership requirements. We do that,\n\n[[Page S10205]]\n\nand we can have a good debate about that.\n  To add an extraneous amendment onto this bill, and therefore not only \npreclude Senators from offering the amendments that they had hoped they \ncould but to preclude us from even getting a vote on campaign finance \nreform makes it a poison pill and nothing more. If we are interested in \ndebating the issue about whether or not organizations ought to refund \npart of their membership fees, that is one question. We should have a \ngood debate about it. We should have an opportunity to discuss it. And \nwe are prepared to allow a final vote on that issue if we can get \nagreement on this proposal.\n  If, on the other hand, we are simply using this as a guise, as a way \nin which to prevent Senators, perhaps the vast majority of Senators, \nfrom having a vote on campaign finance reform, from offering \namendments, then it is nothing more than that.\n  So I hope we can work through this. I hope we can find a way to \nresolve this impasse. But certainly that would be one way to do it.\n  Let us take the Lott amendment. Let us set it aside. Let us have a \ngood debate. Let us schedule a time when amendments could be offered. \nSenators will not filibuster the motion to proceed, nor the bill \nitself. I am hopeful we can work through that and at some point, as I \nhave indicated, I will discuss this matter at greater length with the \nmajority leader.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak as if in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak about \nbipartisan efforts to reform the Internal Revenue Service because these \nefforts are being publicly challenged and criticized, I regret to say, \ninaccurately by the administration. It is perplexing to me personally \nwhy this administration would send a message to the American taxpayer \nthat despite what they have been hearing the Internal Revenue Service \ndoes not need comprehensive reform.\n  During 3 days of hearings of the Senate Finance Committee last week, \ntaxpayers and employees of the Internal Revenue Service testified under \noath that the legal power to collect taxes has been and continues to be \nabused. Combined with 12 days of public hearings held by the \ncongressionally mandated Commission on Restructuring the IRS, which \nconducted thousands of hours of interviews with IRS investigators, \nprofessional preparers, private sector experts, and taxpayers, a clear \nand convincing conclusion has been reached. The law which creates and \ngoverns the actions of the IRS needs to be changed.\n  Mr. President, if lawmakers in the Senate and the House consider that \nhundreds of new collection notices will be sent to taxpayers every \nworking day and that 800,000 monthly contacts in its notices of audit \nor taxes owed will be made, then there is an urgency for us to act \nquickly.\n  If we can prevent any of the suffering disclosed in these hearings \nwith a change in the law, why would we hesitate to act?\n  Of equal importance is the need to increase confidence in this unique \nFederal agency. More Americans pay taxes than vote. Remember, America's \ntax system depends upon our voluntary declaration of taxes owed and a \npatriotic willingness to pay our fair share. If citizens believe there \nis a chance that voluntary compliance will result in their privacy \nbeing violated, their return unfairly audited, or their lives made \nmiserable, all of which we now know is a possibility, then the \npercentage of citizen participation could fall even further. It is safe \nto say that the faith of the American people in our ability to govern \nis linked to the ability of the IRS to function properly.\n  The House leadership has declared its intent to pass a new law and to \npass a law this year--a law which was created in a bipartisan and \nbicameral atmosphere--which would solve many of the problems \nhighlighted by the Senate Finance Committee hearings last week. The \nHouse intends to enact comprehensive reform, similar to that \nrecommended by the congressionally mandated National Commission on \nRestructuring the IRS. And the Senate, in my judgment, Mr. President, \nshould do the same.\n  As cochair of the commission, along with Congressman Rob Portman of \nOhio, I would like to share with my colleagues the problems that were \nuncovered by our deliberation. To be clear, at no time during these \ndeliberations did Congressman Portman and I resort to bashing the IRS. \nIndeed, a former Commissioner of the IRS, Peggy Richardson, was an ex \nofficio member of our commission. We gained unprecedented access and a \nwindow into the operations of the IRS. We visited service centers, we \nworked and talked with employees. It is significant to note that our \nlegislation has the endorsement of the National Treasury Employees \nUnion.\n  We found that the IRS has a law enforcement mentality, but that the \nvast majority of its employees perform functions including tracking \nfinances, sending out notices, and assisting taxpayers.\n  We find as well the IRS has a general attitude that taxpayers are \nguilty, even though close to 90 percent of taxpayers are compliant.\n  We found that taxpayers have a low opinion of service levels provided \nby the IRS and do not believe the IRS is trying to help make paying \ntaxes easier. Indeed, in today's USA Today, a poll shows that 70 \npercent of Americans think that the IRS abuses their power.\n  We found that training is not a priority, and employees do not have \nthe skills of their private sector counterparts.\n  We found that the IRS uses employee evaluation measures that do not \nencourage employees to provide quality service to taxpayers.\n  We found IRS management and governance structure makes strategic \nplanning impossible and has caused a massive failure of the IRS's $3.4 \nbillion computer modernization program. Mr. President, this conclusion \nhas been supported by a GAO report that was issued in 1996.\n  We found the IRS computer systems were developed during the 1960's \nand 1970's and lacked the capability to provide taxpayers with quality \nservice.\n  We found wasteful inefficiencies and high error rates existing in the \nprocessing of paper forms.\n  We found that the Treasury Department has done little to correct IRS \nmanagement problems, and lacks the expertise and continuity to do so \neffectively. In fact, Treasury officials were noticeably absent at last \nweek's Finance Committee hearings.\n  We found as well the congressional oversight of the IRS is scattered \nand can send confusing signals to the IRS that can be manipulated by \nthe IRS to avoid accountability. Indeed, witness after witness came \nbefore our committee, knowledgeable witnesses who assist taxpayers in \npreparing their returns, and laid equal blame upon the executive and \nthe legislative branches.\n  We found as well that complexity and constant changing of the Tax \nCode is a major obstacle that intensifies all of these problems.\n  The administration continues to criticize the legislation introduced \nby Senator Grassley and I on this floor on the 23d of July, and \nCongressman Portman and Congressman Cardin in the House in the same \nweek. They continue to criticize our legislation unfairly and, most \nimportant, inaccurately. In order to perhaps clear up some of the \ndifferences between what we are proposing and what the administration \nwould like to see happen, I would like to review the complaints made \nagainst the IRS in last week's hearings and show how the law as \nproposed by Senator Grassley and I, the IRS Restructuring Reform Act of \n1997, would change things.\n  Criticism No. 1. Citizens have no power in a dispute with the IRS. \nOur law would create in law new protections for the taxpayer and new \nrights if a taxpayer dispute arises. At a minimum, the law should, one, \nexpand authority of the taxpayer advocate to issue taxpayer assistance \norders; two, to expand the authority of the taxpayer to recover costs \nand fees by permitting awards relating back to the 30-\n\n[[Page S10206]]\n\nday notice letter, allowing awards for pro bono services, increasing \nnet worth limitations, and allowing recovery for IRS negligence up to \n$100,000; third, require the IRS to provide more information to \ntaxpayers, such as making public their general audit selection criteria \nand explaining certain rights to taxpayers before audits such as joint \nand several liability and extensions of statutes of limitations.\n  The question of fairness of audits can be solved by requiring the IRS \nto provide general audit selection criteria. Remarkably, the only \ninformation we currently have about how the IRS audits comes from a \nresearcher who used the Freedom of Information Act to force the IRS to \nsurrender some data. There simply is no good reason for us not to write \na law requiring an annual disclosure.\n  Fourth, force the IRS to resolve its dispute with the National \nArchives in which allegations have been made that historical records \nhave been mishandled or destroyed.\n  Fifth, help taxpayers pay their fair share of taxes by establishing \nnational and local allowances for offers-in-compromise; eliminating the \ninterest differential; dropping tolling penalties during installment \nagreements; and providing safe harbors to qualify for installment \nagreements.\n  Sixth, open low-income taxpayer clinics with matching grants up to \n$100,000 a year for up to 3 years to help low-income taxpayers and \nespecially small business.\n  No. 7, expand the jurisdiction of the tax court to allow more \ntaxpayers to take advantage of the simplified small case procedures.\n  And, eighth, require a study of the administration of penalties, \nespecially penalties that will fall heavier on married filers and the \nburden of proof needed before penalties are determined valid.\n  These are eight suggested changes in the law that would give \ntaxpayers more power, more authority. They are not made as a \nconsequence of receiving a number of complaints. They are made as a \nconsequence of thoughtful deliberation between Republicans and \nDemocrats, trying to figure out what the payers themselves say need to \nbe done. We examined it in a bipartisan and bicameral fashion with the \nfull cooperation and participation of former Commissioner Richardson \nwho says today that she would support these provisions. These changes \nin the law, all by themselves, would solve many of the problems that we \nheard before the Senate Finance Committee last week. And all by \nthemselves, would go a long ways toward increasing citizen confidence \nthat they are going to be able to get a fair deal from the IRS.\n  The administration's bill, which they introduced--had Members \nintroduce for them--has no taxpayer protections or rights provisions. I \nwant to underline that. One of the things the administration has been \nsaying is we like the Portman-Kerrey bill but we don't like the board. \nWe like everything in it. If they like everything in it, the question \nis why don't they have taxpayer protections or rights provisions? I \nbelieve the reason is they introduced their bill, had their bill \nintroduced, just so they could say we want to change the IRS as well.\n  A second criticism we heard was that the IRS is isolated from the \ntaxpayer. Anybody who does not think the IRS is isolated has not \nexamined the structure. It is buried in Treasury. The Secretary of \nTreasury is in charge of oversight, not just of the IRS, the 115,000-\nperson organization, but the Secretary of the Treasury obviously has \nlots of other things on his mind--whoever the Secretary is. It does not \nhave to be Secretary Rubin--any Secretary faced this. They also have to \nmanage Secret Service, Customs, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and \nFirearms. Keeping the operational side inside Treasury buried as it is, \nmakes it difficult to achieve accountability.\n  This, in my judgment, may be the most common thread that ran through \nthe decisions, the criticisms that we heard, not only last week but for \nthe entire last year.\n  Tax Code complexity, outdated technology, a primitive management \nstructure contributed to the problem, but these factors alone did not \nexplain a bureaucratic culture that produced allegations of taxpayers \nbeing hounded based on their vulnerability; confidential returns being \nsnooped; or records being altered to reflect the IRS's point of view. \nThose flaws are the symptom of an agency isolated from the customers it \nis supposed to be serving. The IRS is languishing under a suffocating \nbureaucracy from which it is getting inadequate oversight and far too \nlittle input from the taxpayer.\n  Our new law would do a number of things. First, it would create a \nPresidentially appointed citizens oversight board that would oversee \nthe operation of the IRS. The members of this board, for example, could \nhave expertise in the operation of large service organizations or in \nother areas. What we tried to do was give the President maximum \nflexibility, so he could make selection of individuals who had \nexpertise--the Secretary of Treasury is on the board, the head of the \nNational Treasury Employees Union is on the board--because we believe \nthat there are going to be significant personnel decisions that have to \nbe made. We believe it is important to have a representative on the \nboard, making those decisions and getting support as a consequence.\n\n  The board would be responsible for oversight, approval of strategic \nplans and review of operational plans. The President would appoint \nboard members for 5-year terms and would have the authority to remove \nany of these members at will.\n  The board would approve an advisory budget of IRS, prepared in \nconjunction with the commissioner. It would have no access to taxpayer \nreturn information and it would not participate in law enforcement. \nThis is what has drawn the most heat from the administration, and leads \nme to suspect that their principal concern is relinquishing any \nauthority to a board that would have any authority over the decisions \nthat are being made.\n  They have misrepresented and said that the board is going to be \ncomposed of chief executive officers--not mentioned in the law. They \nhave suggested of these board members, as recently as yesterday, there \nwere going to be significant conflicts of interest. If that be the \ncase, how could the Secretary of Treasury sit on the board? How could \nanybody from the private sector sit on any advisory board that we have \nin all of Government? We understand conflicts of interest and we deal \nwith them. It is not accurate to say that we cannot protect ourselves, \nespecially when this statute says that this board will have no access \nto taxpayer return information and it will not participate in law \nenforcement.\n  Equally important, and oftentimes lost in the debate over this board, \nis that our law would create a requirement for two annual joint \nhearings of tax writing, appropriating, and oversight committees. It \nwould also expand the duties and reporting requirements of the joint \ncommittee on taxation.\n  The Finance Committee hearings last week were the first oversight \nhearings in 21 years. It is the inconsistent oversight that we are \ntrying to deal with, with this provision. But, in addition, we heard \nfrom individual after individual, the restructuring commission did, \nthat one of the most important things you have to do before you make a \ntechnology decision or other allocation decision, you have to get a \nshared agreement on what the mission is going to be. Having a new \noversight board for the IRS, working with a new oversight committee on \nthe congressional side, would give us the possibility of achieving this \ncommon and shared mission.\n  In our deliberations, we found that congressional oversight of the \nIRS had no coordination. This provision will allow the IRS Citizens \nOversight Board and Congress to reach agreement on regulations, goals, \nand objectives. It will enable the authorization of new initiatives \nafter IRS satisfies rigorous contingencies to assure financial \naccountability, subject, of course, as always to the approval of the \nappropriating committees.\n  For example, decisions about the design and purchase of computer \nsystems will be made after the legislative and executive branches have \nagreed on a plan. The strategy is to collect taxes owed from those \nAmericans unwilling to pay their fair share, must also be jointly \napproved in order to survive congressional funding cycles.\n  Finally, we must provide funding for the century date change. As all \nof us have looked at that particular problem know, if you think the IRS \ncomputer\n\n[[Page S10207]]\n\nsystem is a mess now, it could get a heck of a lot worse if the date \nchange problem is not fixed and not fixed at 100 percent.\n  The administration proposal would codify the status quo. Treasury \nproposes the creation of an IRS management board made up of 20 \nGovernment officials, mainly political appointees from departments \nincluding OMB, OPM, and the Vice President's office. I urge colleagues \nwho are concerned about this board that Senator Grassley, Congressman \nPortman and Congressman Cardin and I are proposing, who are critical of \nthat, compare it to what the administration is proposing. To repeat, \nthe administration wants a 20-person board composed entirely of \nGovernment officials, political appointees, including people from OMB, \nOPM, and the Vice President's office.\n  They also propose an advisory board of citizens. For decades there \nhas been a commissioner's advisory group to the IRS, and we were told \nthat it was ineffectual and the bureaucracy ignored their advice.\n  The reason they ignored their advice, Mr. President, is an advisory \nboard has no authority, no power, and no one, to my knowledge, pays a \nlot of attention to advisory boards that lack either authority or \npower.\n  Fourteen expert witnesses testified before the Ways and Means \nCommittee on September 16. All but two or three testified in favor of \nthe bill that Congressmen Portman and Cardin introduced, and all \ntestified against the administration's proposal.\n  I would like to read the names of some of the experts who testified: \nEugene Steuerle, senior fellow of the Urban Institute, against; Donald \nF. Kettl, director, Brookings Institution, against; Robert B. Stobaugh, \nHarvard Business School, against; Phillip Mann, section of taxation, \nAmerican Bar Association, against. And on and on, Mr. President.\n  The administration's proposal has been opposed by all the people that \nthey cite, or some of the people they cite at least as reasons not to \nsupport the newly constructed oversight board that Senator Grassley and \nI have proposed. Again, I have regrettably reached the conclusion that \nthis really is not about what is going to work as it is about making \ncertain that no power and authority is relinquished by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury over the 115,000 people who work for the IRS.\n  The third criticism that we heard not only last week, but all year \nlong, was that the IRS management structure does not allow for the \nremoval of bad apples. Our law, Mr. President, would create a 5-year \nterm for the IRS Commissioner. In current form, our legislation says \nthat the board appoints the Commissioner. I would be willing to \nconsider having the President appoint the Commissioner with formal \ninput from the board and continuing to allow the board to evaluate and \nrecommend removal for cause.\n  This law would give this Commissioner increased legal authority to \nmanage the IRS. Consistent with merit system principles, veterans \npreferences and established labor/management rules, the Commission \nwould be given a new rating system to hire qualified applicants and \nflexibility to hire a senior team of managers.\n  Remarkably, the IRS Commissioner has very little flexibility in \nmanaging this agency, and one of the difficulties that he or she is \ngoing to have, regardless of who they have, in managing with zero \ntolerance is the sort of things we saw last week: the absence of the \npower and authority to be able to manage as I think most of us in \nCongress and most of the American taxpaying citizens would like to see \ndone.\n  The administration's proposal would create a 5-year term for the \nCommissioner. That is true; that is the same as ours. But it stops \nthere. It would not have board members with 5-year terms to provide the \nneeded continuity and support to the Commissioner. All the political \nappointees could come and go in the same year.\n  One of the biggest problems we have with the IRS is lack of \ncontinuity, particularly continuity of management oversight. One of the \ndefects of a board being all political appointees inside the Government \nis that they tend to turn over more. It is this turnover that makes it \ndifficult for us to get the kind of continuity this agency demands.\n  The fourth criticism we have heard is it is difficult to file a tax \nreturn and there is a breathtaking gap between the service taxpayers \nget from the IRS and the service they get in the private sector.\n  Our new law would create goals and due dates for electronic filing. \nAt the heart of comprehensive reform must be a vision of an IRS that \noperates in the new paradigm of electronic commerce. One of the most \ntelling comparisons made by taxpayers who appeared before us was the \ncomparison given between an ATM card that is provided by their \ncommercial banks and the lack of similar conveniences from the IRS. \nPotential savings to the taxpayers are large: The error rate for \nelectronic filers was less than 1 percent, compared with 20 percent for \na paper file. While we will never have a paperless IRS, Congress must \nchange the law to provide incentives and assistance to a new IRS which \ngives its customers services comparable to the private sector.\n  The administration proposal would allow the IRS to spend more money \non marketing electronic filing, but would not include any specific \ngoals or requirements for the IRS to take immediate action to increase \nelectronic filing.\n  The fifth criticism we heard is that Congress has created a monster \nof a Tax Code that is too complex to administer. Under our new law, Mr. \nPresident, we would create a process for evaluating the cost to the \ntaxpayer of tax law complexity by giving the Commissioner, for the \nfirst time, an advisory role when new tax laws are being considered; \nrequiring, as well, a tax complexity analysis during legislative \ndeliberations; increasing Federal-State cooperation; and requiring the \nJoint Committee on Taxation to study feasibility of estimating \ntaxpayers' compliance burdens.\n  We just made the Social Security Administration independent. The \nPresident's nominee was confirmed by the Senate. When the President's \nnominee came before the Senate Finance Committee, we were able to ask \nthe question: If you reach a conclusion that the President doesn't like \nor that we don't like up here, are you going to be able to express that \nconclusion publicly? And the answer is yes. That is what comes with \nindependence.\n  We need an IRS Commissioner that is able to, while we are debating \ntaxes, say, ``Great idea, Mr. President, I saw everybody gave you a \nstanding ovation.'' ``Great speech, Senator Blowhard, I see you got a \nstanding ovation as well, but guess what it is going to cost the \ntaxpayer to comply with your idea? They may give you a standing \novation, but if it becomes law, this is what it is going to create as \nfar as the taxpayer is concerned.''\n  Under the current law, the IRS Commissioner will never come before \nthe American people and make that kind of statement. Under our law, \nthey would be required to do so. The complexity of the Code may require \ncomprehensive reform of our tax law, but in the meantime, why not give \nthe Commissioner authority to advise Congress of the potential problems \nof our ideas, and why not require a tax complexity analysis? At least \nwe could then evaluate these potential new costs before proceeding. The \nadministration's proposal would not do anything to encourage \nsimplification of the tax law, although it would allow the IRS to enter \ninto cooperative agreements with State tax administrators.\n  Mr. President, let me add a closing note about the administration's \nhandling of this bill. Honest people can have honest disagreements. For \nthat reason, I tried to be restrained in my criticism of the \nadministration's proposal. But the ongoing public relations battle they \nare waging requires me to respond.\n  First, my broad critique is that the administration's proposal is \nboth timid and hollow. We started our proposal with the belief that the \nlaw needed to be changed. Laws, Mr. President, have teeth. They must be \nenforced. They make a difference. The administration's proposal is more \na set of suggestions than a set of laws--false substitutes. They become \ndentures rather than teeth.\n  Second, the administration has leveled its strongest complaints \nagainst our proposal for an oversight board comprised of taxpayers. We \nmade this proposal because we thought the IRS was culturally isolated \nfrom the taxpayer, because we believe the IRS\n\n[[Page S10208]]\n\nlacked the independence from the bureaucracy it needs to fix the \nproblems, and because we believe the agency needs input from outside \nits own headquarters.\n  I assume the administration agrees with this observation, because it, \ntoo, has proposed an oversight board. The problem with the \nadministration's board is that its members would come from the same \nbureaucracies that created the problem we heard about last week. \nTaxpayers would have no input except through an advisory panel, and the \nboard they propose would have little real power. In fact, all 14 expert \nwitnesses, as I said earlier, testifying before the Ways and Means \nCommittee said they do not support the administration's IRS governance \nproposals.\n  The administration contends our oversight board would consist of \nself-interested CEO's. This is quite simply, and quite directly, false, \nand the administration knows it. They have read our bill. They know \nwhat is in it. And they continue to describe it inaccurately in order \nto get people to presume they should oppose it.\n  Our proposal is for a nine-member board, two of whom will be the \nSecretary of the Treasury and a representative of Treasury employees. \nThe other seven could be anyone who the President appoints and the \nSenate confirms--anyone. A small business owner in Lincoln, NE, can be \non this board, as a taxpayer advocate from anywhere in America. ``CEO'' \ndoes not appear in our bill. I do not know where the administration has \nconcocted this ruse, unless they fear that CEO's are who this \nadministration will appoint.\n  The administration also claims a board run by taxpayers is a recipe \nfor conflicts of interest. At root, this is an argument that the vast \nmajority of taxpayers who do not work for the Government lack the \nnecessary moral rectitude to participate in reforming the Government \nthat belongs to them, and I strongly disagree. Americans who work and \npay taxes in the private sector contribute to Government all the time. \nIn fact, one of them is the Secretary of the Treasury today. He ran one \nof Wall Street's most elite firms. I presume that whatever mechanism \nhas been sufficient to protect him against conflicts of interest would \nalso be sufficient to guard against conflicts of interest by members of \nthis board.\n  Finally, it seems to me the administration is intent, perhaps \ndetermined, on preserving the basic structure of the status quo. They \nwish to strand the IRS in the labyrinth that is the Treasury \nDepartment's bureaucracy and is the same bureaucracy that has failed to \nrun the IRS in a manner that gives citizens confidence.\n  The problems at the IRS are not this administration's fault alone, \nbut I cannot help but observe that if the Treasury Department had done \na great job running the IRS the last 5 years, I might be more convinced \nthat they ought to keep running it. But the simple truth is, they \nhaven't. Perhaps the best summary of the administration's proposal is \nthis: If you like the service you get from the IRS now, you'll love the \nadministration's IRS protection bill.\n\n  Having responded in kind, Mr. President, I still hope the \nadministration will start participating in this debate constructively. \nI still believe we can work out our differences, which are not great, \nas long as they begin to tell the truth about Senator Grassley's and my \nplan.\n  Regardless, Congress needs to proceed as quickly as possible to enact \nchanges in the law which will result in the best practices being \napplied to the operations of the IRS. Americans want an IRS that can \nquickly answer the question, How much do I owe; an IRS that is customer \noriented to those payers willing to voluntarily comply as is a \ncommercial bank to its customers; an IRS that knows it had better be \nright when it comes after a taxpayer for collection, otherwise it will \npay for wrongly accusing a taxpayer of being delinquent.\n  In the interest of those Americans who voluntarily comply but who \nstruggle with a complicated code, a confusing service policy, \nincompatible information systems, and the fear that they could be the \nnext in line for harassment, the time has come for Congress to act.\n  Mr. President, it is time the IRS starts working for the American \ntaxpayer. To further delay is to ask millions to suffer unnecessarily. \nI yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts).

Mr. President, I was listening to the news this morning, \nand the reporter said, ``The Senate has agreed to set aside campaign \nfinance reform and go to more pressing matters.''\n  I thought to myself, campaign finance reform is a pressing matter. It \nseems to me there can be no more pressing matter. We ought to deal with \nthis issue of campaign finance reform and let the chips fall.\n\n  We have a lot of parliamentary games being played. One of my \ncolleagues, Senator Dorgan, said earlier that if the American public \nwas listening this morning and heard somebody say, ``There is a poison \npill on a tree that has been filled,'' the public would not really \nunderstand what we were talking about. When we talk about a poison \npill, we are talking about an objectionable amendment that is \nextraneous to what we are trying to do being offered in an attempt to \nkill the underlying bill. Filling the tree means using a parliamentary \ntactic to prevent opponents of an amendment from offering any changes \nto that amendment. So I apologize to the American public if they tuned \nin and heard somebody talking about a tree being filled with poison \npills because it does get confusing.\n  But the matter is not that confusing. The matter is, how do we \nfinance our campaigns, and can we improve that system? I think all of \nAmerica is crying out, ``Yes, we can improve it.'' Only a few say, \n``Don't touch it, it is great, and money is speech.''\n  Now, it is true that a divided Supreme Court did equate spending as \nmuch money as you have with the right of free speech. But that was a \nclose call. It seems to me our Founders would be turning in their \ngraves if they believed at the time they stood up for free speech that \nit really meant ``only if you are rich,'' because, folks, that is what \nit is about.\n  I am proud of my colleagues, Russ Feingold and John McCain, for \npressing this matter across party lines, and standing up for campaign \nfinance reform. I am proud of both of them because it is not easy. The \nstatus quo around here is what people like the best.\n  I have to tell you, when I think about speech, I think about both \nsides of it. If\n\n[[Page S10209]]\n\nyou have an independently wealthy billionaire running against you in a \nState like California, and he writes checks every day and bashes you on \ntelevision every day and bashes the other opponents that he is running \nagainst every day, I believe we should ask, what about the free speech \nrights of the opponents? What about the speech of the other people that \nare drowned out because of money? If you equate money and speech, it \nseems to me you are saying someone who is wealthy has more speech \nrights than someone who is not.\n  This is not the American way. We are all created equal. That is the \nbasis of who we are as a nation. I really hope that we can get past \nthis notion that money is speech and that we will move forward with a \ncomprehensive bill.\n  My one disappointment with the substitute pending before the Senate, \nis that it is not as comprehensive as the first version of the McCain-\nFeingold bill. However, I respect the judgement of the Senators that it \nwould be best at this time to zero in on two horrible abuses of the \nsystem.\n  One abuse is the soft money abuse, which means unregulated dollars of \nany amount that flow into political parties. We have seen the hearings \nthat are going on by this U.S. Senate and over in the House. If \nanything, we come away with this: Let's put an end to soft money. We \ncould point fingers all day--this politician, that politician, where \nthe calls were made, who made them--but I guarantee that gets us \nnowhere. The issue is the system. There will be enough examples around \nfrom both parties. This is not the problem.\n  So if we get exercised about these hearings--and I have seen \ncolleagues here who are very exercised about them--they should go over \nto John McCain and Russ Feingold and tell them they are on their side. \nThere ought to be some controls on the soft money contribution, and \nthose controls are now pending before the Senate. The second area of \nabuse tackled by the McCain-Feingold bill is the so-called issues \nadvocacy advertisements. This is where you take an organization with \nendless sums of money to put into an attack ad against the candidate \nthey don't like.\n  Under current law, individuals can only give $1,000 in the primary \nand $1,000 in the general to the candidate, but issues advocacy has \ngrown into huge loophole. These so-called issues ads are not regulated \nat all and mention candidates by name. They directly attack candidates \nwithout any accountability. It is brutal. I have seen them. I have seen \nthem from both sides.\n\n  I can tell you, it is totally unfair and totally unregulated and \nvicious. It is vicious. We have an opportunity in the McCain-Feingold \nbill to stop that and basically say, if you want to talk about an \nissue, that is fine, but you can't mention a candidate. If this is \ntruly issue advocacy, you can't mention a candidate a few weeks before \nthe election.\n  If you want to talk about an issue day and night, talk about the \nissue, whether it is choice, the environment, health care, gun \ncontrol--talk about it. But once you attack a candidate, that is not an \nissue ad. This is what the Feingold-McCain will go after.\n  I think we owe a great big thank you to those two colleagues for \npushing this and moving this. I have to say that I am very disappointed \nat some of the debate, because one of our colleagues who is leading the \ncharge against this says, ``We are going to kill this bill and we're \ngoing to be proud to kill this bill.''\n  I don't know why someone would feel proud to kill a reform bill that \nthe American people want to see us do. I don't think it is a proud \nmoment. I don't think it will be a proud moment if we can't move this \nforward.\n  I am both hopeful and fearful at this point. Hopeful because, as long \nas we are here in this body and this measure is pending and the people \nare listening, there will be an outcry for reform; but I am fearful \nbecause of some of the statements I have heard.\n  Let me close by saying what it is like to run in a State like \nCalifornia. I am told by the people with the calculators that if you \nfigure out how much a candidate from California needs to raise in 6 \nyears to run for the U.S. Senate, you would have to raise $10,000 every \nday, 7 days a week, in order to meet your budget. That is not right. \nThat is not the way I think the American people want us to spend our \ntime. I also don't think the American people want to make this an \nexclusive club for multimillionaires.\n  If we get to that stage where everyone here is independently wealthy \nand they really don't understand what life is all about, I think we \nwill lose a very special aspect of what a representative democracy is.\n  I am hopeful we will rise to the occasion. We have done it before in \nthis body. We have a chance to do it again. I see the Senator from \nMinnesota is on his feet, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. While we are waiting for amendments, I ask if I could \nhave up to 15 minutes to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to pick up on some comments made \nby the Senator from California. First of all, I express my \ndisappointment that we are really not debating this campaign finance \nreform bill. There are a lot of games that are being played right now.\n  What we have--my colleague from California was saying there is no \nreason to talk about filling up the tree and poison pill provisions--\nbut what we have going on here is an amendment introduced by the \nmajority leader that has an Orwellian title called the Paycheck \nProtection Act. It is really kind of a union label working people gag \nact. In any case, it is a killer amendment and has no business being on \nthis bill.\n  Senator Daschle, the minority leader, has said if the majority leader \nwants to have a debate on this division provision, we will deal with it \nseparately. We will agree to a debate on it. We will have amendments \nand we will deal with it.\n  But what is going on right now is that this amendment and this effort \nto fill up the tree means that there is no way in which other Senators \ncan introduce amendments. For that matter, I don't see us having much \nof a debate. I am hopeful we will get back to this debate.\n  I want to be clear with people in the country that the fact that you \nhave a campaign finance reform bill hanging out there on the Senate \ncalendar, I guess starting at the end of last week and yesterday, \nMonday, doesn't necessarily mean we have really a high-quality debate. \nI am not even going to speak that long because I want to wait for \ncolleagues to come out here on the other side and have a full-scale \ndebate on this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, we are very close to passing a reform bill. In many \nways I am pessimistic because I think this amendment that the majority \nleader has introduced is an amendment which may very well destroy our \nchances for passing reform legislation if it passes. On the other hand, \nI think people in the country are pretty smart about this. I think they \nsee it for what it is. My hope is that there will be a few more \nRepublicans that will join Senator McCain and Senator Collins and \nSenator Thompson and Senator Specter and we will have the ability to \ndefeat this amendment and then go on to the McCain-Feingold bill.\n  I am willing to admit people have different views about how to solve \nthis problem. I am convinced this is the core problem. I don't think \nthere is a more important issue. I think people in the country know it. \nThe problem is that people hate this system and they know it, and I \nthink they believe that Government too often responds to the interests \nof the wealthy and powerful and not them. I think they are probably \nright. Even though I think individuals here in the Senate and the House \nhave a highly developed sense of public service, people can agree to \ndisagree, but systematically you have a huge imbalance of power because \nthis whole political process has become too dependent on the heavy \nhitters and the investors and the givers and the people who have a \nwhole lot of money. That tilts the system in a very dangerous direction \ntoward the very top of the population, and it leaves the vast majority \nof people out.\n  It also means we have a very, if you will, distorted debate on \nissues. I don't think it is any accident that ultimately when it came \ndown to how we did deficit reduction, a good part of\n\n[[Page S10210]]\n\nmany of the areas we made reductions in affected vulnerable people, \nlow- and moderate-income people who are not the big givers. I don't \nthink it is any accident we left most of the tax loopholes and tax \ndeductions alone, because then we would have had to take on the big \ngivers. I don't think it is any accident that there are a whole lot of \nquestions that deal with concentration of power. I will take the \ntelecommunications industry, since I think we made a big mistake when \nwe passed that piece of legislation. I think the flow of information in \na democracy is the most precious thing we have, but in a way this whole \nissue of concentration of power gets taken off the table.\n  I don't think it is any accident when we were debating universal \nhealth care coverage very fine Senators would say to me, ``There is no \nway we can take on the insurance industry given the power of the \ninsurance industry.''\n  This is very corrupting in a very systematic way--not in an \nindividual way, but in a very systematic way. I just say I think if we \ndon't get the job done or if we don't at least get half the job done or \nif we at least don't get a quarter of the job done, I think people will \nbe disillusioned and they will have a right to be. We will have given \nthem every justification, every reason for being disillusioned with us.\n\n  Now, Senator McCain and Senator Feingold are both close colleagues \nand good friends. Senator Feingold is my colleague from the State of \nWisconsin. We have all worked together on these reform issues. I was \nproud to be one of the original cosponsors of the bill with Senator \nThompson. What we had was an original--it's a little like hot sauce; we \nhave the McCain-Feingold original formula, and we have the McCain-\nFeingold extra mild, which is the new formulation. The extra mild is \nmeant to get us past the filibuster and any diversion from the majority \nside, and I hope it does. But I have to say that I don't even think the \nextra mild has enough zing in it. I know this is a good-faith effort to \nmove us forward.\n  Let me talk in very concrete terms about what all this means for \npeople in the country. I will get back to this in a more extensive way \nwhen we have the debate. What has already been dropped out, I think, is \na shame. I think Senators Feingold and McCain are disappointed, but \nthey are trying to move forward on some reform. What has been dropped \nout of this is the agreed-upon spending limits, reducing the amount of \nmoney that is spent in exchange for discount broadcast advertising time \nand direct mailing expenses.\n  In other words, the very part of the legislation that actually would \nhave reduced the amount of money spent in our races, Senate and House \nraces, has been taken out. Actually, the one provision of this bill \nthat I think would have led to a more level playing field has been \ntaken out already. I think that is a shame. The reason that I got so \ninvolved in this whole debate about reform from the word go was because \nI just think an obscene amount of money is spent. The reason I got \ninvolved was, back in 1989 and part of 1990, it was so disillusioning \nto me to have just about everybody I talked to tell me I didn't have a \nchance to win because I didn't have access to the money. That is all \npeople would talk about.\n  Actually, the provision of this legislation that directly deals with \nour raising money and our spending money in our campaigns and the \nconnection to how we vote--even though I think all of us hope there is \nno connection, it certainly looks that way to people--has already been \ntaken out. What is in this piece of legislation that I think is \nimportant--there is one provision I disagree with. In the aggregate we \nhave now raised the amount of money individuals can contribute from \n$25,000 to $30,000 a year. I would not raise individual contributions \nat all. I think that just intensifies the problem of those people who \nhave the big bucks being able to contribute more. Most people in North \nCarolina or Kansas or Minnesota cannot afford to contribute $100 a year \nmuch less collectively $30,000 a year.\n  But we are now down to, as I said, an extra mild version. It doesn't \nhave enough zing in it, from my point of view. But I understand it \nwould represent a step forward if we keep it intact. Part of that deals \nwith the unregulated money, the soft money, that goes to parties. I \nthink it is terribly important to prohibit that because obscene amounts \nof money have been spent. We really saw that in the Presidential \nelection. It essentially has become such a loophole that it has made \npeople utterly disgusted with the system. A lot of what people have \nread about and heard about on TV has to do with soft money.\n  There's a second part which my colleague was talking about, \nindependent expenditures. It's the issue advocacy ads, which are \nterribly important to talk about because this is a huge loophole. If \nthis gets stripped out of this piece of legislation, we will be making \na huge mistake. I don't need to tell the people in Minnesota who \nfollowed the last election because there was about a million dollars \nspent on issue ads. They essentially run these ads on television and \nthey bash you if you are a Democrat or a Republican--it depends who is \ndoing it. They just don't say vote against you. There is no spending \nlimits at all. So a huge problem, again, is with the unregulated money, \nwhich can be the soft money, which means that people can be \ncontributing huge amounts of money to this, obscene amounts, which is \nused to buy elections.\n\n  What this piece of legislation says is you can't do those ads. It \nbecomes express advocacy if you do it in a 60-day period prior to the \nelection and you use the name of the candidate. This is the bright-line \ntest, which makes a whole lot of sense. You can't have perfection here. \nBut if you drop that provision--and I know a lot of colleagues want to \ndrop that provision--then what you will do is stop the soft money to \nthe parties; it is just like Jello, you push in and it will all shift \nover to these issue advocacy ads. You will have all sorts of groups and \norganizations, and some you might like and some the Chair might like, \nsome the Senator from North Carolina might like, some I would not like, \nbut that is beside the point. You are going to have the same \nunregulated, obscene amount of money, no accountability, being spent in \nthese elections, adding to the disillusionment of the people and used, \nby the way, for these attack ads, where they have been raising millions \nof dollars figuring out how to rip their opponent to shreds or how to \nprevent themselves from being ripped up into shreds. Hundreds of \nmillions of dollars are spent like this, and it does not add one bit of \ninformation for one citizen in the United States. No wonder people hate \nthis system. We ought to really try to build a little bit more \naccountability into this.\n  Well, Mr. President, these are important provisions that we are \ntalking about here. I think that this represents a huge step forward. \nMr. President, what I would worry about--and I will sort of finish up \nthis way--is these three scenarios, and when we get into the debate, I \ncan go into all of them in more specifics. One scenario is that we have \nthe majority leader's amendment. It really is, as my colleague said, \nextraneous to this legislation. We can have a separate debate on it \nlater on. It is really essentially a union gag, worker gag amendment. \nIt is harsh. It should not be on this bill. If it passes--and I think \nwe can have the votes to defeat it--then we reach a huge impasse. I \nsuppose that people can think we have a clever strategy here. But most \npeople in the country know this is nothing more than an effort to \nwaylay the whole reform effort. It won't work. We are only a vote or \ntwo away from defeating it. I think we can have Republicans and \nDemocrats join together to do that.\n  The second scenario I worry about as well, which is an already \nstripped-down version of McCain-Feingold, you will have the 60-day \naccountability on the issue ads taken out. You will raise campaign \ncontributions and you will wind up with a piece of legislation that \nwill have a fine-sounding acronym, that made-for-Congress look, but as \na matter of fact, it will just shift the amount of money, spent in a \ndifferent way. It will be an obscene amount of money. It will still \nundercut democracy. You will still have all of this money spent, and \nwhen people in the country find out that not much really has changed, \nthey will be furious, discouraged, disengaged, and none of us benefit. \nI hope that doesn't happen.\n  The third thing that could happen is that the McCain-Feingold, what I \ncalled extra mild, the new formulation,\n\n[[Page S10211]]\n\nwill pass. Again, there is not enough zing in it, from my point of \nview, but I think it would represent a step forward. I mean, the \nprovisions in the McCain-Feingold extra mild would be a step forward. \nIt would be a reform effort. It would build some more accountability \ninto the system. It would lessen some of the money that was spent, and \nI think it would give people some confidence that we are serious in \nthis Congress about trying to change this system, this mix of money and \npolitics, which so severely undercuts democracy.\n  Now, a final point, if I have 2 minutes left. There is a whole lot of \nenergy around the country at the State level. I mean, Vermont just \npassed a clean money election option. Maine passed it. I know that \nMassachusetts is going to deal with this question. This is an effort \nthat I love. I have introduced a bill with Senators Kerry, Biden, and \nGlenn which basically says we are going to get all of the private money \nout, the big dollars out, and I think ultimately this is the direction \nwe have to go in. I will tell you something. People around the country \nat the State level are saying yes to that.\n  So, colleagues, people are serious about reform. This is one of those \nmoments in time. As the Senator from Minnesota, I am very discouraged \nthat we are not out here debating this. Let's finish this \nappropriations bill that my colleagues from North Carolina and \nCalifornia are managing, the D.C. appropriations bill, and let's have \nthe debate on campaign finance reform. Let's not have amendments out \nhere that are nothing less than an effort to destroy this reform \neffort. Let's debate the stripped-down McCain-Feingold measure and get \non and pass the reform bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10208-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10211-S10216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 1998\n\n  The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont 40 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 40 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I don't anticipate taking very long. I \nwant to raise a very important issue relative to the District of \nColumbia. First of all, I want to commend the subcommittee chairman. I \nserved just ahead of him in that capacity. I know of the tremendous \nresponsibility he has, and I have admired the way he has been handling \nhis job. I have also admired the way they have put the bill together \nthis year to help the city of Washington.\n  But there are problems that are really beyond the possibility of the \nsubcommittee to correct. These are what I want to discuss today. First \nof all, let us remember what the important issues facing this Nation \nare and reflect and look at the District of Columbia with respect to \nthose. The District of Columbia, as we all know, is the Nation's \nCapital. But I think sometimes we Members have a tendency to forget \nthat we are responsible now for the city of Washington. We, in 1974, \nturned the city over to home rule. As that experience turned out to be \nrife with difficulty for the residents of D.C., Congress made efforts \nto become more vigorously involved with the city's governance. By \ngetting more directly involved, particularly with regard to the \neducation system, we therefore made ourselves, the Members of this body \nand the House, directly responsible to the people of the District of \nColumbia. And furthermore, we became more directly responsible to the \npeople of the Nation overall that we would have to do what is necessary \nto make this Capital a capital we can all be proud of.\n  Can you be proud of the United States Capital when the top issue in \nthis Nation right now is education and here in Washington we continue \nto have some of the lowest educational scores and standards in the \ncountry? We are doing our jobs as leaders in a major metropolitan area; \nhow can we turn this city into a model for the Nation to show how we \ncan take the cities and help them become educational enterprises that \nare functioning well and that are delivering our young people into \nsociety with the skills they need to be able to make this Nation \nstrong?\n  This is a national problem of the highest priority. But let us take a \nlook at the District of Columbia and where we stand as far as what we \nare doing for it and the distance that we have to go. As I said, I had \nthe job that the Senator from North Carolina has, the chairmanship of \nthe subcommittee, and I took that responsibility very, very seriously. \nWorking with Congressman Gunderson on the other side, we developed an \neducational program for the city. We worked long and hard at it. We got \nit approved, and it is in law. It sets out the goals and methodology \nand the means for us to take this city and turn it from the worst--and \nI will explain that later--in educational results of any city in this \ncountry.\n  Second--and I will talk about that even more quickly--we also have \nabout the worst infrastructure of any school system in this country--\nthe worst. So if we are going to make real progress in turning this \neducation system around we have a long way to go.\n  We set the framework a couple years ago when we took over the city. \nWe created, first, the Control Board, which now has more of the mayoral \nresponsibilities, or is more analogous to a board of aldermen. They \nthen created a school board to take a look and see what they could do \nto take this city and to change it into a city that we could be proud \nof.\n  We have all recently noted that the schools didn't open on time. \nChildren were ready to come in, but the roofs were leaking, books had \nnot been delivered. What happened? We had an amount of money for \nemergency repairs that had been appropriated--but that money, about $86 \nmillion came from the remainder of existing funds, and other one-time \npiece meal funding, not through a dedicated, sustainable revenue \nstream. It will just not be the right way to go to meet the needs we \nhave, particularly with regard to infrastructure.\n  Take a look at this chart. You can see that if this situation is not \nthe worst in the Nation, it is pretty close.\n  Look at these statistics from a General Services Administration \nstudy, which I will make a part of the Record, which goes through these \ninfrastructure categories item-by-item to show where this city is.\n  Exterior walls: The national average for having problems is 27 \npercent. We have 72 percent of our exterior walls and windows which are \nbad and not meeting codes.\n  Next one: Roofs. This probably has improved a little since we spent \n$70 million fixing roofs this fall. But a year ago, only 27 percent of \nthe schools in this country had poor roofs--but in the District we had \n60-some percent of the roofs that were not meeting code. This does not \nmean they are beautiful; they just do not meet the code and safety \nviolations.\n  Heating and ventilation, and air conditioning: The national average, \n36 percent below code; Washington D.C., 66 percent.\n  Plumbing: Sixty-five percent of the plumbing doesn't meet code in \nD.C.'s schools--65 percent.\n  Electrical and lighting: Fifty-three percent of the District's \nschool's are in code violations in this category\n  Life safety codes: Fifty-one percent of our schools are in violation \nof life safety codes. Would you trust your own children to that? I \nthink not.\n  Power for technology: This is where we are doing the best, \nfortunately. But, still, 41 percent of the schools don't have power to \nutilize technology.\n  I am talking here about the Nation's Capital, the city that we would \nlike to point to to show as an example of how a school system should be \nrun.\n  Keep that in mind.\n  Let's take a look at this next chart to see what is going to happen.\n  For 3 years in a row we have had the schools not opened on time \nbecause of violations. Well, this is according to the GSA. The amount \nof repairs, cost of repairs to meet code, plus some other essential \nrepair: $2 billion--that is with a ``b''--2 billion dollars' worth of \nrepairs that are necessary in order to get our schools in compliance \nwith the safety codes and other codes.\n  We managed to get $86 million available this year. That was the high \npoint. We put $50 million the year before. Divide $86 million into $2 \nbillion, and you will see that somewhere between 20, 30, or 40 years \nfrom now depending on\n\n[[Page S10212]]\n\nwhat you spend each year, those schools are going to be in code--our \nNation's Capital.\n  That is inexcusable. You tell me how we are going to get $2 billion \nto be able to fix those schools. Is this subcommittee going to \nappropriate $2 billion? Of course not.\n  I went from the Appropriations Committee to the Finance Committee, \nbecause I knew that was where the action was going to be. There is a \nlot of money out of there--$35 billion for education.\n  So to the Finance Committee, I said, ``Hey. We ought to fix these \nschools.'' So I had an amendment to get $1 billion--only one $1 \nbillion--to get half the job done. I came within one vote of passing \nthat in the Finance Committee. That was one of those meetings in the \nmiddle of the night where nobody was quite present. But, anyway, I came \nwithin one vote of getting it. I finally got $50 million. That would \nhave paid part of this year.\n  We went to conference. And they said, ``No. We would much rather \ncreate more jobs in the city. We would much rather give things like tax \ncredits for buying new houses, and all of these kinds of things.'' So I \nwent after the $50 million. But I did get a commitment from the head of \nOMB. I will get into that in the later part of the discussion here. But \nhe agreed with me that we ought to do something, and that he would go \nwith me and travel and talk with the Governors of Maryland and \nVirginia. I intend to do that, and see whether we can work something \nout. That will get to the solution which I will get to a little later.\n  Now let's take a look at where we are as far as the achievement of \nour young people and take a look at this, if you want to get depressed.\n  This chart shows where the District of Columbia is in red. We put the \nDistrict of Columbia in red each time where it belongs. And this shows \nthe Northeast average; the national average levels. These are fourth \ngrade students scored at or above basic reading achievement levels. And \nit was down 6 percent from 1992. We took these from 1994. Twenty-eight \npercent of the children in the District of Columbia were passing the \nassessment for reading. In 1993, it went down 6 percent to 22 percent.\n  If we are going to make the District of Columbia the model for the \nNation to follow, we are kind of headed in the wrong direction.\n  So what are we going to do about that? I will also get to that in a \nlittle bit. Right now I think it would be appropriate to go to the next \nphase where I am going to offer the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1266\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a regional education and work force training \n   system in the metropolitan Washington area, to improve the school \nfacilities of the District of Columbia, and to fund such activities in \n    part by an income tax on nonresident workers in the District of \n                               Columbia)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk. I would \nespecially want to alert my Virginia and Maryland Senators that they \ndon't need to jump out of their chairs and run over to the floor right \nnow because I intend to withdraw it when I am finished. I offer the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent to set aside temporarily the \npending amendment and I will withdraw it so it will be back pending at \nthe time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1266.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the purpose \nbe read. It is relatively short. The amendment is unfortunately quite \nlong.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a regional education and work force training \n   system in the metropolitan Washington area, to improve the school \nfacilities of the District of Columbia, and to fund such activities in \n    part by an income tax on nonresident workers in the District of \n                               Columbia)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thought that last sentence might stir \nup some anxiety. So I wanted to make sure that I reassured Senators \nthat I would withdraw it.\n  But I did want to reemphasize that I intend to meet with the OMB \ndirector and with the Governors of Maryland and Virginia, and lay out \nthis plan which will help the District. But it will also help the two \nsurrounding States. So hopefully we can get an agreement to go forward \nwith this, if we could, one, raise the $2 billion to take care of the \ninfrastructure problem; and, two, share 50-50 the ability to create the \nkind of skilled training that is necessary in this metropolitan area in \norder to provide skilled workers for the 50,000 jobs that are available \nin this region which are not being filled at this time.\n\n  Before I go on, I want to say that the things which I am saying here \nand recommending are not things that Jim Jeffords decided when he was \nlosing his mind or something, as somebody would think about standing up \nhere and trying to help the District of Columbia. But this book \neveryone ought to be required to read in the Congress, which is ``The \nOrphaned Capital,'' and it is by Carol O'Clanahan, at the Brookings \nInstitution.\n  This was done on behalf of the city to explain the mess we are in, \nand possible solutions as to how to get out of the mess.\n  So, again I want to emphasize that what I am trying to do today is to \nchallenge the delegations from Maryland and Virginia, or anybody else, \nto say show me if you have a better way to come up with $2 billion so \nthat we are not embarrassed by having our schools shut down. Let me \ntell you why they will end up shutting down again if we don't come up \nwith something.\n  There is a group called Parents United. And they are upset with the \nfact that their kids are going to schools that are unsafe. So each year \nthey go to a judge who is very friendly to them and who likes to make \nus look stupid. So that judge shuts the schools down each year. And \nthey have about 20 to 40 years to go, depending on how much we put up \neach year with these code violations.\n  So they will pick on a number of code violations. The boilers are \nabout to blow in several of the schools. So maybe this winter the \nChristmas holidays may get extended, if they decide to go and get the \nboilers fixed, although I hope they will be able to fix the boilers \nwithout that.\n  But anyway, they will each time go, and they will get the court to \norder the schools to be repaired. But as you say, with $2 billion to go \nin doing it with $50 million to $80 million a year, it will take a \nwhile. I don't want to have to spend the rest of my time here being \nembarrassed every year about why these schools are not being opened.\n  So let's take a look at what the positive side of the events are. Let \nme tell you what we have here, just to give you some credence on what I \nam saying. Look at this Washington Post editorial the shortage of \nworkers in this regional area for the information technology jobs \navailable.\n  But, as I mentioned earlier, there is a serious labor market shortage \nin this area. We have a burgeoning development of technology-based \njobs--not only in the information industry but in every sector of our \neconomy. These jobs are available in a location that's nice and \nconvenient to the Capitol. There are 50,000 jobs out there right now \nthat cannot be filled. And these are $20- $30- and $40-an-hour jobs \nthat cannot be filled because the schools, the high schools in this \narea, even though we have some good ones out in the suburbs, are not \ngraduating people from high school with the capacity they should have \nto take these jobs. I want to mention this to give you an idea of the \ndimension of the problem.\n  If we could fill these jobs, it would increase the revenues in the \narea available by $3.5 billion annually. We are talking about an \nenormous amount. Keep that figure in mind. That is the potential that \nwe could do. Keep also in mind the fact that in this city now two-\nthirds of the workers are living in the suburbs. That is up by one-half\n\n[[Page S10213]]\n\nfrom several years ago when everybody flooded out of the city.\n  I will remind you. Why did they flood out? Two reasons: One, crime; \nand, back and forth between number one and two, the schools. The \nschools are lousy. I am not going to bring my kids up here. I am taking \nthem to the suburbs.\n  So now two-thirds of the workers go out. Do you know what they take \nwith them? They take with them $20 billion a year--$20 billion a year \nthat goes out to be taxed by Virginia and Maryland. Do you want to know \nwhy Virginia and Maryland are going to get upset? Because if I try to \ntake some of that, wow. That is going to be revenue out of their \npockets.\n\n  That is why I want to emphasize that if we increase the revenues by \n$3.5 billion, it will help reduce the impact of removing it. And we are \nnot going to take all of it anyway. How much comes back in from people \nworking out? One percent of that. One percent comes from workers \nworking out of the District--outside the District, coming back into the \nDistrict. It is a huge disparity.\n  Another fact that I want to mention--this one is very, very important \nto remember. Washington, DC, is the only city in America which is in an \ninterstate area where its workers cannot--cannot--be taxed on their \nwages before they go home. It is the only city in America that is in \nthat situation. All of the cities that are in an interstate situation \nhave taxes on the nonresidents. So part of the work revenue stays. The \nhighest I think is 4 percent. The average is around 2 or 3 percent. \nJust keep that figure in mind because you have a huge amount of money \nthat flows out of the District into Maryland and Virginia, which grab \nhold of it and throw into their treasury. Everybody would like to be \nable to do that.\n  So that is the situation we are in.\n  Now the question is, How can we make an equitable system, granted \nthat this city is restrained? How are we restrained? Let me tell you \nhow that happened. Back in 1974, when the District of Columbia went to \nhome rule, a very astute Member of the House said, ``Hey. Every other \ncity in this country grabs money from the workers.'' And that \nRepresentative was from Virginia, naturally, and offered an amendment \nwhich passed that said the District of Columbia is prohibited from \ntaxing workers, nonresident workers. And that is still in the law. So \nright now, unlike any other city in America in a similar situation, the \nDistrict of Columbia cannot tax the nonresident income.\n\n  Well, it seemed to me that under that circumstance it would be \nappropriate to take a look to see if we could not just nick it and take \nsome money back to float the bond for the $2 billion needed for the \ninfrastructure code repairs.\n  That is what this amendment does. But in addition to that, to be more \nwise and also make it more appealing, my amendment will take money from \nthe nonresident workers, the tax money that goes to Annapolis and \nRichmond, and bring it back into counties of Maryland and Virginia that \nborder the District of Columbia.\n  So in the final analysis we start out and ease it in, phase it in so \nthat it would have a slow differential in the impact it has on those \nStates starting off with money to repair the schools. That will take \nabout 1 percent. We could phase that in in a couple years. One percent \nwould take care of the bonds to raise $2 billion. Then, if we can go to \n3 percent, split that so that it equals half the money going to the \nsuburbs and half to the District of Columbia--that is including the \ninfrastructure repairs--we can then create what needs to be done, a \nsystem to be able to coordinate the schools in these areas to find out \nwhere best to have skill training. For instance, I would recommend we \ntake UDC, the University of the District of Columbia, and make it into \na skill training center. Give it a new purpose. It could be used for \nthose purposes. And these grants would be given out in cooperation with \nthe Department of Education and the Department of Labor. I did not want \nto give it to the Federal Government, but that does make it necessary \nfor interstate compacts. So then we could create the system.\n  Let's take a look back at the Washington Post. What it is talking \nabout is where the jobless could be given jobs. I want to give validity \nto what I am saying. They are aware of this. The business community is \nalso aware of what I am trying to do and very supportive, and the \neducators are, of course, too.\n\n       I have spoken with the leaders of the exploding high-\n     technology industry from Virginia and Maryland, and they note \n     that the boom has been so dramatic that they're worried about \n     finding enough people to work for them. Then note the plight \n     of the District, where businesses evaporate and unemployment \n     is the highest in the region. The obvious but so far elusive \n     solution: match the District of Columbia jobless with \n     Northern Virginia jobs.\n\n  So this is known as an area of need. So what I am recommending with \nthis amendment is that we ought to work together as a region. And this \ncan be done nationally. I would say the Senator from North Carolina, \nwhen we discussed this some time ago, pointed out in North Carolina \nthey have developed these things, and the South has been very astute. \nWe in the Northeast and the rest of the country ought to be aware of \nwhat they are doing. They are working together in a region. They are \ninviting businesses to come in. They are creating skill training in \norder to make sure that they can get the jobs and get the businesses to \nlocate in their States to provide them with what is necessary.\n  Now, I am hopeful that when the other States look at this they will \nrealize, if we come in and just take a little bit of the money, which \nany other city in this country could do that is in this interstate \nsituation, we must make sure we turn this city around and move it in \nthe right direction, first, by fixing up the schools.\n  Now, certainly I am embarrassed, and I hope all of my colleagues are \nembarrassed, by the fact that this city has the worst school \ninfrastructure in the country and that such a huge number of our \nschools are unfit. With $2 billion, I hope they would take notice and \njoin me in trying to do something about it.\n  But I also point out that it does not make any difference to me how \nwe do it. I would challenge the Senators from Virginia and Maryland, if \nthey do not like the fact that some of the money may be taken from \ntheir State capitals and moved down into their counties near here or \nsome into the District of Columbia, then suggest another alternative. I \nurge any of my colleagues to figure out how we can raise $2 billion \nover the next couple years so that we can get these schools fixed so we \ndo not have to go through the difficult period of time each year of \nbeing embarrassed by the District of Columbia school system.\n  In winding up, I urge that we will get your attention because I think \nit is easy for us, as so many Members do when I talk to them, to say, \n``Oh, that's Mayor Marion Barry's problem. He made a mess out of it.'' \nThat may be true. But that is not the solution. We are responsible. We \nare the ones who have to come up with a solution, and if we do not do \nit, then I am sad for the kids in these schools. I am sad for the city, \nand I am sad for all of us who will be embarrassed, instead of having \nthe Nation's Capital pointed to, as it could be, as a model to follow, \nand ridiculed and we feel so sorry for those kids.\n  Now, let me talk a little bit also about other things that can be \ndone to help the city and that are being done. I have lived here now \nclose to 25 years. I have lived right in the District. I have not gone \nout to the suburbs so I know what's going on here and I have seen it \nimproved; I have seen it getting better; but I feel very responsible \nfor it. And so I hope that we will see as we move forward that we can \nchange this city around. I am hopeful that we will have that \nresponsibility, recognize it and do something about it.\n  In addition to what I have already told you about, I would also like \nto mention what the private sector has been doing to assist. We ought \nto keep our eye on the private sector because they are showing us their \nability through volunteering.\n  Let me talk about two programs that I have been working with the \nprivate sector. One looks at one of the most difficult problems the \nNation has, and that is reading. You saw the record, the horrible \nrecord of the District of Columbia in reading. We have started a \nprogram called ``Everybody Wins!'' This is a lunchtime volunteer \nreading program that pairs caring adults with\n\n[[Page S10214]]\n\nelementary school children in Title 1 schools to help them learn to \nread and learn the value of reading and education. Senate volunteers go \nevery Tuesday to the Brent School to read over here on the Hill and the \nHouse volunteers go down to the John Tyler school. All in all we now \nhave around 300 House and Senate staff who read in the program. We \nbegan ``Everybody Wins!'' up here on the Hill to generate awareness \nwith the private sector and others of how fantastic a program it is and \nhow easy and effective it is to get involved and this year we will have \nabout 1,200 volunteers all across the city who are reading to kids in \nfirst through sixth grades to make sure at the end of the third grade \nthey know how to read--a great program. It is a non-profit educational \nfoundation funded by the private sector, with the whole effort led by \nthe PGA Tour and the Tour Wives Association. The PGA Tour is under the \nleadership of Commissioner Tim Finchem, who is really making children \nand education a priority, and I commend him for all his help. We have \nbeen able to raise some money each year at a fundraiser called ``Links \nto Literacy.'' The entire House and Senate leadership from both sides \nof the aisle joined me and Senator Kennedy in spearheading this event. \nWe will have another fundraiser this spring where ``everybody wins'' so \nthat we can make progress toward our goal of having every elementary \nschool child in the D.C. public schools read with an adult volunteer \nonce a week at lunchtime.\n  Secondly, the area of greatest difficulty--and here is another area \nwhere the District of Columbia leads the Nation, I think--is school \ndropouts. Forty percent of the kids in the District of Columbia system \nwho start do not finish, and that I tell you is very much related to \nthe serious crime problem because 80 percent of the people that are in \njails are school dropouts.\n\n  I traveled out to San Diego and visited a program there which was set \nup by the private sector called ``Operation FitKids.'' This program was \nfounded by a man named Ken Germano who works in the fitness industry \nand who is passionately dedicated to underprivileged kids. He figured \nout a way for the fitness industry to donate used equipment to schools \nto create safe, educational fitness centers in the middle and high \nschools. Now you have to have the biggest and best equipment in order \nto attract people. I know I watch television. Every couple weeks there \nis a new way to tread the mill and those kinds of things. My colleague \nSenator Kohl has joined with me to bring this great program to the \nDistrict of Columbia. This summer we were able to have half a million \ndollars worth of equipment that has been donated to four of the middle \nschools and high schools in our city's worst areas to help young people \nwith a place to go to exercise and to communicate with each other and \nto learn life-long healthy habits. To make this work we had to form a \npartnership with a local university and American University stepped \nright up to the plate and we now will have a big launch event this Fall \nto get the word out about how more people can get involved.\n  Another area. Representative Cass Ballenger has been working with the \nprivate sector and contractors, saying, will you help? Will you help do \nthings with a little money? In other words, try to get donated whatever \nis needed to help fix these schools. And they say yes. Ballenger said, \nwell, the problem is we can't do much about it because of the Davis-\nBacon Act. And hopefully at the same time we do this we could get an \nagreement to lift the Davis-Bacon Act, or at least the size of \ncontracts which are needed to be met so that we could take that money \nand do it with much less by being able to get around the Davis-Bacon \nAct.\n  So the private sector is ready to help. I am certainly ready to help. \nA number of my colleagues are. But it is up to the rest of the Senate \nand the House to really say we are going to make this capital the best \nin the country, not the worst. And right now we are embarrassed, and I \nam embarrassed, but I am hopeful a year from now we will be on the road \nto progress and I am going to do everything I can to make sure that we \nare on that road.\n  Mr. President, I am pleased to yield back the remainder of my time. I \nwithdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 1266) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an issue that \nconcerns me and, in my opinion, does not receive enough attention, \nenough attention or enough action by the Congress. This is the issue of \nyouth alcohol use. It is a serious problem in the District of Columbia, \nas it is throughout the Nation.\n  Alcohol is the drug that is used most by teens. If we are concerned \nabout drug use by teens, this is the drug that is used most by teens. \nInformation compiled by the National Center on Addiction and Substance \nAbuse indicates that, among children between the ages of 16 and 17, \n69.3 percent have at one point in their lifetime experimented with \nalcohol.\n  Let me say that again. Among children between the ages of 16 and 17, \n69.3 percent have at one point in their lifetime experimented with \nalcohol. That is not a very good reflection on their parents, I would \nsay. In the last month, approximately 8 percent of the Nation's eighth \ngraders--now, get that--in the last month, approximately 8 percent of \nthe Nation's eighth graders have been drunk. What are we coming to? \nEighth graders--8 percent of the Nation's eighth graders have been \ndrunk. What does that say about the parents? What does it say about \nthis Nation of ours? Eighth graders are generally 13-year-olds. Every \nState has a law prohibiting the sale of alcohol to individuals under \nthe age of 21. Unfortunately, though, two out of every three teenagers \nwho drink report that they can buy their own alcoholic beverages.\n  Alarmingly, junior and senior high school students drink 35 percent \nof all wine coolers and consume 1.1 billion cans of beer a year. Yet, \nagain, every State and the District of Columbia have laws prohibiting \nthe sale of alcohol to individuals under the age of 21. Alcohol is a \nfactor in the three leading causes of death for 15- to 24-year-olds: \naccidents, homicides, and suicides. In approximately 50 to 60 percent \nof youth suicides, alcohol is a factor. Alcohol is involved. In 1995, \nthere were 1,666 alcohol-related fatalities of children between the \nages of 15 and 19. Drinking and driving kills. Links have also been \nshown between alcohol use and teen pregnancies. And links have been \nshown between alcohol use and sexually transmitted diseases.\n  According to a Washington Post article from July 17, 1997, entitled, \n``The Corner Store,'' the District outranks every State with regard to \ndeaths and diseases related to alcohol. In addition, according to Joye \nM. Carter, chief D.C. medical examiner, in 1993, 50 percent of the \nhomicide victims had consumed alcohol.\n  In order to begin to address the distressing cost of alcohol to this \ncity, and its children, I am offering three commonsense amendments to \nthis bill, the District of Columbia Appropriations Act for fiscal year \n1998. The amendments I have sent already to the desk.\n  The first one would prohibit alcoholic beverage advertisements on \nbillboards, signs, and posters and other forms of advertising in \ncertain publicly visible locations in the District of Columbia where \nchildren are likely to walk to school or to play. I believe this is an \nimportant, commonsense measure to help to shelter innocent children of \nthe District of Columbia from the daily bombardment of messages \ntempting them to partake of alcoholic beverages. There is a lot of fuss \nmade about advertisements concerning smoking. Nothing is said about \nadvertisements concerning alcohol. That, apparently, is taboo.\n  Competitive Media Reporting estimates that the alcoholic beverage \nindustry spent more than $1 billion on alcohol advertising in 1995. \nThat is an enormous amount of money, and this advertising is often \ncrafted to particularly appeal to impressionable children. Our children \nare bombarded with slick and ingenious messages that drinking alcohol \nwill lead to popularity; you will be popular; it leads even to good \nlooks, and leads to a magnetic personality. Nothing could be further \nfrom the truth, of course. Drinking alcohol more often leads to wrecked \nautomobiles, unwanted sex, coarse and stupid behavior, and more often \nthan we like to contemplate, a space in the cemetery with a tombstone \nresting above--especially in the case of young drinkers. Ads filled \nwith singles playing exciting outdoor sports, or sophisticated adults \ncombining alcohol with an elegant evening out, mask the darker view of \nchildren cringing and hiding when Daddy weaves drunkenly through the \ndoor from a bleary-eyed evening spent in the company of a bottle, or \nseveral bottles.\n  Similar bans have been enacted in Baltimore and Chicago to protect \nchildren in those cities. Why not here? Given the large number of \nliquor stores in the District and the number of signs enticing children \nto try a substance that they are barred from using by law, it is \nimportant that we take action now. Let us not delay and miss this \nopportunity to make a positive difference for the District's children.\n  It is my understanding that similar legislation is currently pending \nbefore the D.C. Council. It is not clear whether the council will act \nexpeditiously on this important matter. Thus, it is incumbent upon the \nCongress to provide this important protection to the District of \nColumbia's children as they walk to school and as they play in their \nneighborhoods. In my opinion, the amendment, although I believe it is \ncrafted to survive legal challenges, does not go as far as I would like \nin protecting the District's children. I urge the council to explore \nadditional ways to expand this protection.\n\n  I am sure that some will challenge this amendment, arguing that \ncommercial speech is protected from such bans under the First \nAmendment. As a matter of fact, the beer industry challenged the \nBaltimore ordinance banning outdoor, stationary alcoholic beverage \nadvertising which is almost identical to my amendment. The circuit \ncourt has upheld the Baltimore ordinance as constitutional.\n  Children cannot readily interpret media messages. Their ability to \nanalyze information is not yet fully developed, and, thus, they are \nmore vulnerable to being swayed by advertisements. This fact is of \nparticular concern when the substances being advertised are illegal for \nconsumption by minors. According to the U.S. Court of Appeals, Fourth \nCircuit, in Anheuser-Busch, Incorporated versus Schmoke:\n\n       This decision thus conforms to the Supreme Court's repeated \n     recognition that children deserve special solicitude in the \n     First Amendment balance because they lack the ability to \n     assess and to analyze fully the information presented through \n     commercial media.\n\n  The Fourth Circuit decision goes on:\n\n       After our own independent assessment, we recognized the \n     reasonableness of Baltimore City's legislative finding that \n     there is a ``definite correlation between alcoholic beverage \n     advertising and underage drinking.'' We also concluded that \n     the regulation of commercial speech is not more extensive \n     than necessary to serve the governmental interest. . .\n\n\n[[Page S10216]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, in addition to its decision, the Court determined that \nBaltimore's ordinance was not more restrictive than necessary to \naccomplish the stated goal of protecting children from alcoholic \nbeverage advertising.\n  The Court of Appeals specifically cited the ordinance's inclusion of \nan exemption, which is also included in my amendment, for commercial \nand industrial areas. According to the decision, ``* * * Baltimore's \nefforts to tailor the ordinance by exempting commercial and industrial \nzones from its effort renders it not more extensive than is necessary \nto serve the governmental interest under consideration.''\n  The exceptions to the ban included in my amendment are numerous and \nresult in a narrowly tailored approach to achieving the goal of \nprotecting children in areas they frequent while staying within the \nconfines of permissible restrictions on commercial speech under the \nConstitution. Banning billboard advertisements for alcoholic beverages \nwhere children play and go to school are reasonable safeguards that \ncommunities can take to address youth alcohol use. So, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in this worthwhile and narrowly tailored effort \nto protect the children of our Nation's Capital.\n  My second amendment, Mr. President, would increase the number of \nAlcohol Beverage Control Board inspectors in the District and focus \nenforcement on the sale of alcoholic beverages to minors. The D.C. \nAlcohol Beverage Control Board has just three inspectors in the field \nin addition to their chief, who also performs inspections of alcohol \noutlets. These four inspectors are responsible for monitoring over \n1,600 alcoholic beverage outlets. This is a sad state of affairs for a \ncity that has more alcohol-influenced crime than any other city of \ncomparable size. In contrast, Baltimore employs 18 regular inspectors \nin addition to a number of part-time inspectors.\n  It is illegal for persons under the age of 21 to purchase, possess, \nor consume alcoholic beverages in the District. In addition, the sale \nof alcoholic beverages to minors is prohibited. However, these laws are \nnot being adequately enforced.\n  In May of this year, the Center for Science in the Public Interest \n[CSPI] conducted a sting operation at small grocery and convenience \nstores in which alcoholic beverages are sold. The sting operation used \nyouthful looking twenty-one-year-olds to purchase beer. In 63 percent \nof the cases, the young looking subjects were able to buy beer without \npresenting age identification--63 percent of the cases. Clearly this is \nnot good news. It is not legal to sell alcoholic beverages to minors. \nThe low probability of enforcement of this law results in lax age \nidentification checks. My amendment strengthens the District's ABC \nenforcement efforts by bringing the number of inspectors up to a level \ncomparable to other cities of this size. It is my hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in this important effort to address the serious \nissue of alcoholic beverage sales to minors.\n  My third amendment calls for the General Accounting Office [GAO] to \nconduct a study on the District's alcoholic beverage excise taxes. It \nis my understanding that the level of taxation in the District is \namongst the lowest in the Nation. According to local activists \nconcerned about the effects of alcohol consumption on the District, \nraising the excise tax on alcohol could be the single most effective \nmeans of reducing alcohol consumption in the District. This amendment \nwould require the General Accounting Office to study: (1) the District \nof Columbia's alcoholic beverage tax structure and its relation to \nsurrounding jurisdictions; (2) the effect of D.C.'s lower excise taxes \non alcoholic beverages on consumption of alcoholic beverages in D.C.; \n(3) ways in which the District of Columbia's tax structure can be \nrevised to bring it into conformity with the higher levels in \nsurrounding jurisdictions; and (4) ways in which those increased \nrevenues can be used to lower consumption and promote abstention from \nalcohol amongst young people.\n  The study would also explore whether alcohol is being sold in \nproximity to schools and other areas where children are likely to be. \nIn addition, would the creation of alcohol free zones in areas \nfrequented by children be useful in deterring under-age alcohol \nconsumption?\n  These are important issues. They are important issues that ought to \nbe explored. The information obtained in the study will be useful in \ndetermining the need for possible future adjustments of the excise \ntaxes in the District on alcohol that might reduce the high costs that \nalcohol abuse imposes on the District of Columbia.\n  The District of Columbia is our Nation's Capital, a centerpiece for \nour Nation's Government, as well as a hometown for 600,000 people. It \nshould be a shining star in the constellation of American cities, but \nit is not. Sadly, that star is tarnished by neglect, abuse, and by the \ncomplex forces that hold sway over and within it. The corrosive effects \nof alcohol abuse further erode its beauty and grandeur. I believe that \nthese three amendments make a positive step toward repairing the \nDistrict so that it might claim its rightful place at the pinnacle of \nAmerican metropolitan areas.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendments en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD.

In his book ``Breaking the News,'' Jim Fallows writes: \n``If the public is confused, alienated, pessimistic or hostile to \ngovernment, that is only partly the public's fault. . . .'' And he goes \non to say, ``Journalism should lead the public by pointing out \nrealities.''\n  So I briefly point out a reality, Mr. President, to the Congress here \nthis\n\n[[Page S10217]]\n\nafternoon. In ``The Economic and Budget Outlook'' of the Congressional \nBudget Office--the authority with respect to budgetary figures such as \nthe balanced budget, deficits and surpluses--we find on page 34, Mr. \nPresident, the reality that while, yes, a unified deficit is listed as \n$34 billion, the actual deficit for the year 1997 that ends at midnight \ntonight is $177 billion. That is the deficit. The media should report \nthis, the reality, and not the fraudulent unified deficit. We are \nspending $177 billion more than we are taking in.\n  The unified deficit is $34 billion because they count the surpluses \nfrom the airports, the highway trust funds, Social Security, and the \nmilitary and civil service pension funds--billions of dollars moved \nover. But that does not obscure the fact, nor it should not obscure the \nfact, that as of this fiscal year, when we are all talking about \nwonderful reductions in deficits, we are running a real deficit of $177 \nbillion.\n  Now, Mr. President, 5 years out when we all say, ``Oh, we have a \nbalanced budget for the first time since Lyndon Johnson,'' and everyone \nis running around shouting ``balance!'' there will be no balance, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. In the year 2002, the \ndeficit, rather than being in balance, will be $161 billion. And that \nassumes optimistically that 95 percent of the domestic cuts occur in \nthe last 2 years.\n  I can assure the distinguished Senator from North Carolina that the \ndeficit will be bigger 5 years out than it is today, at the end of this \nfiscal year. Looking at the figures across the board for the next 5 \nyears, I see that the CBO forecasts next year's deficit to be $210 \nbillion; the year following that, 1999, the deficit will be $226 \nbillion. Go across the board and you will find out the so-called \nbalanced budget actually increases the national debt by $1 trillion.\n  Now why is that dangerous? That is dangerous because you cannot avoid \nthe interest costs on the national debt. The national debt is now in \nexcess of $5.3 trillion, and going up to over $7 trillion in the next \n10 years.\n  Mr. President, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that even \nwith low-interest rates we will spend $358 billion in the next year \njust servicing the national debt. This amounts to almost $1 billion a \nday. This is $1 billion a day we cannot spend on new roads or schools. \nThe first thing the Government does every day is borrow another $1 \nbillion to pay interest on the national debt. Now, if you managed your \nfamily finances or your business this way, you would not last long; but \nwe are doing it.\n\n  All this reminds me of Denny McLain. He was convicted earlier this \nyear of using his company's pension fund to pay off his company's debt. \nYou see, we passed the Pension Reform Act of 1994, and when Denny \nviolated that act, he was sentenced to 8 years in prison. If you can \nfind what prison he is in, tell Denny he made a mistake. He should have \nrun for the Senate: instead of getting a prison sentence, he would have \ngotten the Good Government award. That is what we are doing around \nhere--stealing from the American people's pension funds. And we are \npatting each other on the back. This is a sweetheart deal. Both parties \nare agreeing to lie to the American people so that we can proclaim the \nbudget is balanced.\n  The truth of the matter is, we have a deficit now, and we will still \nhave one in 2002. This year's much-ballyhooed budget deal increases \nspending $52 billion and cuts revenues $95 billion. Now, how can you \nbalance anything by increasing your spending and cutting your revenues? \nYou can't. But that is what we are claiming. It is Rome all over again, \nand we are trying to make the people happy with bread and circuses. \nOnly today, the Congress' circuses are spending increases and tax cuts \nand shouts of ``balance, balance, balance.''\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President. I thank the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer and my colleague from North Carolina.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded and that the time be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Snowe).

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nturn to the conference a report on (H.R. 2203) making appropriations \nfor energy and water development for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 1998.\n  The report will be stated.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee on conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the (Senate or House) to the \n     (H.R. 2203) having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     Houses this report, signed by all of the conferees.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 26, 1997.)\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, on July 16, the Senate passed its \nversion of the Energy and Water Development Act for fiscal year 1998 by \na vote of 99 to 0. Since that time, the House has passed its version, \nwhich in some cases was quite different than the Senate version, and \nconferees have resolved the differences between the two bills.\n  At times, those negotiations were difficult. However, the final \nresult is a well balanced bill I believe should be supported by all my \ncolleagues--it certainly was well received by the House which passed it \na few hours ago by a vote of 404 to 17.\n  In summary, the bill provides $21,209,623,000, a reduction of \n$1,895,701,000 from the amount of the request and $57,421,000 below the \nlevel recommended by the Senate, for programs with the jurisdiction of \nthe subcommittee. Details are provided in the report which was filed \nlast Friday and has been available to Members since Saturday when it \nwas printed in the Record.\n  There are a few matters that need clarification.\n  The conferees included language in the conference report commending \nthe Department on the tremendous advances made in pulsed-power \ntechnology in the past year. Because of uncertainties, which I will \ndiscuss in a moment, in the level of funding needed for the pulsed \npower program in the coming fiscal year, a level was not specified. \nHowever, the conferees have indicated that the Department should \nsupport continued Z-physics and diagnostics in the coming year.\n  A robust pulsed power program in the coming year might include \n$13,000,000 for continued Z-machine physics, $5,000,000 for \nbacklighting, and an additional $7,000,000 for the conceptual design of \nthe next generation pulsed power machine; X-1. However, there may be \nless expensive ways to achieve backlighting, and the schedule for a \nnext generation machine would be better determined following additional \nexperiments on the existing machine. For those reasons, it is \nimpossible to specify a level of funding for the coming year. However, \nthe Department should continue Z-physics experiments with those \nobjectives in mind.\n  The conferees agreed to a provision that would prohibit the \nDepartment of Energy from awarding, amending, or modifying any contract \nin a manner that deviates from the Federal acquisition regulation, \nunless the Secretary grants, on a case-by-case basis, a waiver to allow \nfor such deviation. In the statement of managers, the conferees direct \nthe Department to be cognizant of and utilized provisions of the \nFederal acquisition regulation that permit exceptions to the Federal \nacquisition regulation and provisions intended to address the special \ncircumstances entailed by management and operating contracts. I want to \nclarify that, if the Department utilizes those provisions of the \nFederal acquisition regulation that permit exceptions to the Federal \nacquisition regulation or that address the special circumstances of \nmanagement and operating contracts, it will not be necessary for the \nSecretary to obtain a waiver for those cases; the use of such \nprovisions will not be considered a deviation from the Federal \nacquisition regulation.\n\n[[Page S10218]]\n\n  Due to a production error, report language agreed to by conferees \nfrom the House and Senate was inadvertently excluded from the joint \nstatement of the managers. The text of that language is as follows:\n\n       With respect to funds appropriated in fiscal year 1993 and \n     made available to the Center for Energy and Environmental \n     Resources, Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, \n     Louisiana, the conferee strongly recommend that the \n     Department disperse these funds only in accordance with the \n     original intent to place the facility on property owned by \n     the Research Park Corporation in Baton Rouge, Louisiana or \n     contiguous property thereto owned by Louisiana State \n     University, Baton Rouge.\n\n  We fully expect that the Department of Energy and interested \nstakeholders will regard this language as though included in full in \nthe joint explanatory statement of the committee of conference.\n  The conference report contains a provision requiring the Bureau of \nReclamation [BOR] ``to undertake a study of the feasibility of using \nthe Mount Taylor mine as a possible source of water supply for the City \nof Gallup.'' While the background material for this study clearly \nindicates that this study will include the impacts of such water use on \nother users, such as the Laguna and Acoma Indian Pueblos, I would like \nto clarify today that it has been my intention, as verified in the \ndetailed project description, to include these Indian Pueblos as \npossible beneficiaries of available water supplies from the Mount \nTaylor mine or its environs.\n  Like other water users in the Mount Taylor area where water is \nscarce, any new and potable water resource would be most welcome. The \nLaguana and Acoma Pueblos are east of Mount Taylor, Gallup is to the \nwest, and the private mine that is the focus of the study is on the \nwestern slope of Mount Taylor. The Canoncito Band of Navajo Indians are \nalso to the east of Mount Taylor, new Laguna Pueblo. The feasibility of \nproviding Mount Taylor water to these Indian Tribes is included in the \ndetails of the planned BOR study.\n  As stated in the project study description, ``Some potential exists \nfor the Mt. Taylor pipeline project to be integrated into a regional \nwater supply network along the Interstate 40 corridor.'' Depending on \nthe findings of this study ``to verify the quantity, quality, and \nexpected life of the water source,'' there are many potential \nbeneficiaries. It is my intention, as stated in the project narratives, \nto do our best to include as many potential water users along this \ncorridor as possible. I thank the Chair for this opportunity to clarify \nan important section of this bill for these potential water users from \nthe Mt. Taylor source.\n  Madam President, I would like to thank my friend and colleague from \nNevada for his help on this legislation. This is Senator Reid's first \nyear as ranking member of the subcommittee and it has been a most \nproductive year. I greatly appreciate his cooperation and look forward \nto many years of working together.\n  Madam President, I am merely going to remind the Senate that when we \nare in conference with the House, sometimes we get our way, sometimes \nthey get their way. As a matter of fact, most of the items that the \ndistinguished Senator from Arizona is concerned about were House \nmatters, as I listened to them and as my staff tells me about them.\n  Frankly, everybody in this body that has been here for any period of \ntime knows that when you go to conference with the House, they have to \nget some things that are theirs and we have to get some things that are \nours, and we have to compromise on others. I want the Senate to know \nthat, in terms of overall expenditures, this bill is $1.8 billion in \nbudget authority under the request of the President. That means we have \ndone things differently than the President. In some areas, we have gone \nup and in some areas we have gone way down from where he wanted us to \nbe. When you add them altogether, water projects, which are more than \nthe President wanted and, obviously, the House wanted far more water \nprojects than we did--and there again it is a question of working with \nboth bodies--add up the water, nondefense, energy, research and the \ndefense part, and it is about $1.8 billion below what the President of \nthe United States requested.\n  Madam President, again, let me give a little recap on the bill and \nthen yield to my friend Senator Reid. Madam President, on July 17, the \nSenate passed its version of the Energy and Water Development Act by 99 \nto 0. Since that time, the House passed its own version of the bill, \nand last week, as implicit in my remarks, conferees for the two bodies \nmet to work out differences, and there were many that dealt with many \nmillions of dollars.\n  The bill started off quite differently. The Senate bill had $810 \nmillion over the House bill on defense matters. On the nondefense side, \nthough, the allocations were very similar. The House had proposed \nspending approximately $300 million less on the Department of Energy \nnondefense programs and about $300 million more on water projects. It \nis obvious that those are extremely large differences. The full \ncommittee of appropriations decided that the allocation that the House \nreceived on the entire bill was too low. Some adjustments were made, \nboth on the defense and nondefense side, which permitted us to get \ntogether and bridge some remaining gaps that were indeed very serious.\n  This bill provides what we need for stockpile stewardship to maintain \nthe trustworthiness of our nuclear weapons, to participate adequately \nin the builddown, which is extremely technical and highly scientific, \nwithout building any new weapons, and without any underground testing--\nto make sure that our weapons are safe and reliable--which is a new \nconcept called science-phased stockpile stewardship.\n  That represents a little over $4 billion in this bill. And I imagine \nfor a long period of time we will be spending something like that, or \nmore, because apparently we are not going to do any underground \ntesting. That means that scientists have to use new methods built \naround large computers, and testing in other ways; and scientific \ninstruments that will measure the validity of our nuclear weapons \nwithout having them tested.\n  In addition, there is some very excellent research that everybody \nthinks ought to take place. Much of it is not necessarily in direct \nenergy research but has to do with basic physics wherein some of the \nbest physics research in the world takes place under the auspices of \nthis bill.\n  We are busy trying to do our very best to maintain the stewardship of \nthe weapons; to see what the reality of the future lies therein; to \ntake care of the basic research for this, which is one of the three or \nfour major areas for research in science-based physics, and the like, \nfound in this bill; and, at the same time to satisfy many requests for \nMembers about water projects.\n  It has been a very exceptional year of many floods with many of the \nlevies being torn down, and much work having to be done, especially in \nthe southern part of America regarding flood damage. Much of that is in \nthis bill--and an orderly manner of authorizing the Corps of Engineers \nto get on with some of it. They will be rather busy. They have received \nauthority to start a number of new projects.\n  But I am hopeful that in the final analysis the President will sign \nthis bill, and that the U.S. Senate will overwhelmingly support it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding that, under the unanimous-consent \nagreement, I have 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, the Senate will shortly vote to adopt \nthe conference agreement on the fiscal year 1998 energy/water \nappropriations bill. And unfortunately, this bill is laden with pork-\nbarrel spending, much of which was considered by neither the House nor \nthe Senate as part of the normal appropriations process.\n  I count seven projects for which funds are earmarked in the bill \nlanguage that were not included in the bill that passed either the \nSenate or the House. Let me list these seven projects for the benefit \nof my colleagues who are not members of the Appropriations Committee.\n  First, there are three projects earmarked in the legislative language \nagreed to by the conferees for reimbursements to non-Federal sponsors \nof work in Texas:\n\n[[Page S10219]]\n\n  There is $150,000 for the White Oak Bayou watershed in Texas. The \nHouse added a line item for this unrequested project in its report; the \nSenate never considered it. Yet it is now included in the conferees' \nlegislative language.\n  There is $500,000 for the Hunting Bayou element and another $2 \nmillion for the Brays Bayou portion of the flood control project in \nBuffalo Bayou, TX. In its report, the House cut the $1.8 million \nrequested for this project, while the Senate included the line item in \nits report at the requested amount of $1.8 million. Neither body \nincluded an earmark in legislative language, but the conferees approved \nan earmark of $2.5 million which is almost $700,000 more than the \namount requested.\n  Another legislative earmark approved by the conferees is $4 million \nfor the Army Corps of Engineers to dredge Sardis Lake, MS, so that the \ncity of Sardis may proceed with development of the lake. The conferees \ndirected the corps to conduct or pay for environmental assessments and \nimpact studies required under the Sardis lake recreation and tourism \nmaster plan, phase II. This provision was in neither bill.\n  The conferees included bill language to earmark $6 million for the \nCorps of Engineers to extend navigation channels on the Allegheny River \nto provide passenger boat access to the Kittanning, PA, Riverfront \nPark. This project was mentioned in the House report, but was not \nincluded in either bill.\n  Another earmark that migrated from the House report to the conference \nbill language is $2.5 million of corps' operations funds to intercept \nand dispose of solid waste upstream of Lake Cumberland, KY.\n  Another earmark that moved from Senate report language to the \nconference bill language is $6.9 million from Tennessee Valley \nAuthority funds for operation, maintenance, surveillance, and \nimprovement of Land Between the Lakes.\n  These seven provisions, earmarking over $32 million for these \nspecific projects, were added to the bill language in conference. I \ndon't know why the conferees chose to add emphasis to these provisions \nby including them as earmarks in the bill language, instead of \nincluding them, as is the normal process, in the report language if \nthey were approved by the conferees. Only the conferees could explain \nthat decision.\n  However, Madam President, in at least one instance, it is clear that \nthe conferees chose to add a wholly new provision to this bill. And \nthey did this behind closed doors, without benefit of public or full \ncongressional review.\n  Madam President, the Congress has a process for considering \nlegislation. That process relies on full and open consideration of the \nPresident's budget and policy requests, as well as fair and open \nconsideration of Members' requests for added funding or new policies. \nThat process, when followed, makes it possible for all Members of the \nCongress, not just those who serve on the Appropriations Committees, to \nhave an opportunity to review the legislation on which we must vote.\n  This bill, at least in part, bypassed that normal process. \nUnfortunately, the decision of the conferees to bypass the normal \nauthorization and appropriations process is one of the reasons the \nAmerican people do not trust the Congress to do what the people desire.\n  Madam President, I do not mean to give the impression that this bill \ndoes not provide necessary and appropriate funding for important \nprojects that will benefit our Nation. Funding is included for flood \ncontrol and water projects, nuclear energy and weapons activities, \nenvironmental restoration of contaminated properties, and other \nimportant projects that are necessary and valid. The majority of the \nfunding recommendations in this bill are ones that I fully support.\n  But I am saddened by the blatant examples of pork-barrel spending in \nthis bill. And because this bill is not amendable in its present form, \nthere is, unfortunately, nothing that I or any other Member of this \nbody can do to eliminate these spending items.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of objectional \nprovision in this conference agreement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      Objectionable Provisions in H.R. 2203, Conference Agreement\n\n\n                             bill language\n\n       Earmarks funds for 15 specific projects, including \n     feasibility studies, from general investigations account of \n     Army Corps of Engineers, including 2 projects not in either \n     bill [$500,000 to reimburse the non-Federal sponsor of the \n     Hunting Bayou element of the flood control project in Buffalo \n     Bayou, Texas; and $150,000 to reimburse the non-Federal \n     sponsor of the flood control project in the White Oak Bayou \n     watershed in Texas]\n       Earmarks funds for 40 specific projects from Army Corps of \n     Engineers construction account, including 1 project not in \n     either bill [$2 million to reimburse the non-Federal sponsor \n     of the flood control project in the Brays Bayou portion of \n     the Buffalo Bayou, Texas]\n       Earmarks funds from Army Corps of Engineers flood control \n     funding for 3 specific projects, including 1 project not in \n     either bill [up to $4 million to dredge Sardis Lake, \n     Mississippi, so that the City of Sardis may proceed with \n     development of the lake, including direction to pay for \n     environmental assessments and impact studies required under \n     the Sardis Lake Recreation and Tourism Master Plan, Phase II]\n       Earmarks funds for 9 projects from Army Corps of Engineers \n     operation and maintenance account, including 2 projects not \n     in either bill [$6 million for navigation channels on the \n     Allegheny River to provide passenger boat access to the \n     Kittanning, Pennsylvania, Riverfront Park; and $2.5 million \n     to intercept and dispose of solid waste upstream of Lake \n     Cumberland, Kentucky]\n       Section 101--Earmarks $5 million for the Army Corps of \n     Engineers to provide planning, design, and construction \n     assistance to non-Federal interests in carrying out water \n     related environmental infrastructure and environmental \n     resources development projects in Alaska [Senate had provided \n     $10 million in nationwide authority; conferees cut funding \n     half but limited application of section to Alaska]\n       Appropriates additional $10 million above the budget \n     request for Appalachian Regional Commission (for a total of \n     $170 million)\n       Earmarks $6.9 million, not in either bill, from Tennessee \n     Valley Authority funds for operation, maintenance, \n     surveillance, and improvement of Land Between the Lakes\n       Section 507--Increases the appropriations ceiling for \n     construction of the Chandler Pumping Plant in Arizona from $4 \n     million to $13 million.\n       Section 508--Revises a 1977 recreation cost-sharing \n     agreement between the State of West Virginia and the U.S. to: \n     allow West Virginia to receive credit toward its required \n     contribution for the cost of recreation facilities at \n     Stonewall Jackson Lake in West Virginia, which are \n     constructed by a joint venture of the State of West Virginia \n     and a private entity; remove the requirement that these \n     facilities be owned by the Government when completed; and \n     prohibit any reduction in Government funding for the project.\n\n\n                            Report Language\n\n       [NOTE: States that language in either House or Senate \n     report that is not specifically addressed in the conference \n     report remains the intent of the conferees.

Of course, this conference agreement contains other \nobjectionable provisions in the bill, as well as the usual earmarks in \nthe report language.\n  Madam President, I plan to write to the President recommending that \nhe veto the line items in this bill that are unnecessary and wasteful, \nparticularly those that were added without benefit of public or \ncongressional review.\n  Madam President, I want to tell the distinguished managers of the \nbill again of my deep disappointment that they would add seven projects \nin conference that totals $32 million and which were in neither bill, \nalong with the usual unnecessary and wasteful projects. I think it is \nan abrogation of my ability as a U.S. Senator to vote for these \nprojects, and I deeply resent it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my good friend from Arizona, the neighbor \nto the State of Nevada, pointed out seven projects which he objected \nto. These are all in the House budget.\n  But I would say to the Senate, and anyone who is in the sound of my \nvoice, that these are seven projects out of hundreds and hundreds of \nprojects. He complains that this bill is a $21 billion bill. And we \nshould waste no Government money--not a single penny. But I have to say \nthat in picking seven relatively small projects out of a $21 billion \nbill I think the Senator from New Mexico and I in managing this bill \ndid a pretty good job. This bill provides many different things.\n  I would also say before leaving that subject that the Senator from \nArizona, my good friend, also talks about things being done without \nauthorization. The House is very, very tough on making sure that things \nare authorized. Congressman McDade, chairman of the subcommittee on the \nHouse side, has been very strict on that. However, I want to make sure \nthat everyone understands that this bill provides a number of dollars \nfor many different projects.\n  Let's take, for example--I will not take any of the things in Nevada \nfor obvious reasons. But let's take the sister State of California: $6 \nmillion to dredge and deepen Long Beach Harbor. This deepening will \nsignificantly improve sea trade up and down the west coast, and in the \nAsia-Pacific basin. It will even reduce the transportation costs of oil \nthat is being brought down from Alaska. That is one example for $6 \nmillion.\n  The bill also provides $10 million to restore the sensitive \nEverglades ecosystem which has been damaged for decades by agricultural \nproduction.\n  Those are only two examples. There are numerous flood control \nprojects throughout the country that will prevent significant personal \nand economic loss.\n  This is of particular importance in light of El Nino which may bring \nunusually heavy rains, as it already has to the western part of the \nUnited States.\n  These floods projects are important. It is a relatively small part of \nthe bill. But they are important projects.\n\n[[Page S10221]]\n\n  Madam President, the Corps of Engineers is one of the last great \nbastions of infrastructure development in this country. You can just \ntake the bill itself and look at some of the flood control projects. \nYou can look at them in Arkansas at a place called American River \nWatershed; in Colorado, at a place called Alamosa; you can look at \nFlorida and many different places, including the Everglades that we \nhave already talked about; Hawaii, at a place called Wailupe Stream; in \nIllinois, Reno Lake; Indiana, the Fort Wayne metropolitan area; you can \ntalk about Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana. All through this country there \nare flood control projects that are going to save lives and property. \nThat is one of the main parts of this bill.\n  I am somewhat concerned that someone would indicate that this bill is \nfluffed. It is far from that, Madam President.\n  I would like at this time to make sure that the Record is spread with \nthe fact that this is a bill that has reached the Senate floor as a \nresult of bipartisanship. The chairman of the subcommittee, the senior \nSenator from New Mexico, and I worked hand in glove this past 10 months \nto arrive at the point where we are now asking the Senate to approve \nthis conference report.\n\n  So I want to extend my appreciation to the Senator from New Mexico, \nand also extend my appreciation to my clerk, Greg Daines, and Liz \nBlevins on the minority side for the work that they have done day after \nday, week after week, month after month, arriving at this point.\n  I also say publicly that Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, and Lashawnda \nLeftwich on the majority side, have set an example of how congressional \nstaffs should work together to arrive at a goal that is good for this \ncountry.\n  Madam President, this bill has, as the Senator from New Mexico \npointed out, many different items dealing with the sciences. For \nexample, one of the things that I am extremely happy about is that we \nhave provided money for desalinization. Personally I don't think it is \nnearly enough because I think in the years to come desalinization is \ngoing to be the watchword for not only water in this country but all \nover the world. We need to do much more than what we have done.\n  Senator Paul Simon, the Senator, just retired, from Illinois, is \nwriting a book on water. I had the good fortune to read the book before \nit went to the publisher. It is a wonderful book. He points out how \nimportant desalinization is. And I acknowledge that and agree with him. \nThere is desalinization in this bill that I think is very important.\n  We have done things with hydrogen fuel development. We have done \nthings with the other renewable programs--solar; and programs that are \ngoing to take the place someday of fossil fuel. It is not enough \ncertainly in this bill, but I am proud of the fact that it is in this \nlegislation.\n  I would like to also point out another California project called the \nCalifornia Bay-Delta ecosystem restoration project.\n  I say this because this is one of the first times in the history of \nthis country that parties with dissimilar and often opposing interests \nhave sat down and are working together for an equitable resolution to a \nsignificant problem in the State of California dealing with water.\n  I think this very big project--for which there is a lot of money in \nthis bill to get this started--is going to set the pattern all over the \ncountry. Now parties with dissimilar interests have to sit down and \nwork toward a common goal as they have done.\n  I am very proud of this bill. I think we have done a good job. We \nhave done a good job in making sure that we have not only done the \nprojects that the Senator from New Mexico and I have talked about but \nalso, Madam President, we have done a good job in making sure that our \nnuclear deterrent is safe and reliable.\n  When I was in the House of Representatives, I supported a nuclear \nfreeze. I support the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. And I do it with \nso much more anticipation now because of what we have in this bill \nbecause we have enough money to provide for stockpile stewardship so \nthat the people who we are going to call upon to certify that our \nstockpile is safe and reliable can do it.\n  So, in short, this is a good bill. And I hope that it passes the \nSenate as it did on the initial go-around unanimously.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, St. Louis, MO, is the location of this \ncountry's first nuclear weapons site. Unfortunately, the wastes are in \nthe midst of the St. Louis metropolitan area and are for the most part \nuncontrolled. The radioactive waste at these sites was generated from \nthe production of nuclear weapons as part of the Federal Government's \nManhattan Project and Atomic Energy Commission between 1942 and 1957. \nMuch to my dismay, St. Louis has the distinction of having the largest \nvolume of radioactive waste in the country with over 900,000 cubic \nyards.\n  For 15 years we have worked with the Department of Energy to clean up \nthis site. Finally, in just the past 2 weeks, after much frustration \nand delay, we have come to the point were DOE has begun preliminary \ncleanup efforts. Given this recent progress, the news of the FUSRAP \nprogram's transfer out of DOE has, quite understandably, caused a great \ndeal of distress in the community. While I am by no means questioning \nthe Corps' ability to handle the FUSRAP project, I am concerned that \npotential delays caused by the transfer will undo much of the recent \nprogress.\n  With site recommendations already made, feasibility studies \nconcluded, and contracts let, it is important that the Corps honor the \npreliminary groundwork laid by DOE in order to avoid any further \ndelays. Will the Corps be willing to respect these studies, site plans, \nand contracts?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The committee fully intends that the feasibility \nstudies and the site recommendations prepared by DOE will be accepted \nand carried out by the Corps of Engineers as appropriate. Furthermore, \nthe Energy and Water Development Conference for fiscal year 1998 \ncontains language requiring the Corps to honor all existing contracts.\n  Mr. BOND. The local community has been very involved in designing a \nplan to clean up the site. They are concerned that the administration \nof the cleanup will be moved away from the St. Louis area to Omaha or \nKansas City, reducing their input and influence on the cleanup process. \nWhen the Army Corps of Engineers takes over the FUSRAP program, will \nthe St. Louis cleanup be managed out of the St. Louis Corps office?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It is the understanding and intent of the committee \nthat the cleanup and restoration of contaminated sites falling within \nthe purview of FUSRAP shall be managed and executed by the nearest \nCivil Works District of the Corps of Engineers with appropriate \nassistance from an approved design center for hazardous, toxic, and \nradioactive waste. Local communities throughout the country have been \nvery involved in designing cleanup plans at FUSRAP sites and this \nstrategy effectively maintains community input on the process.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the chairman for his assistance and assurances.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Madam President, I intend to support final passage of \nH.R. 2203, the fiscal year 1998 energy and water development \nappropriations conference report, because it includes funding for a \nnumber of projects important to Tennessee, including the National \nSpallation Neutron Source in Oak Ridge.\n  However, I want to express my deep concern about the section of the \nconference report dealing with the Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA]. \nThe conference report includes $70 million for TVA's nonpower programs \nin fiscal year 1998, which is $36 million less than TVA received to \nperform these functions last year. However, the House version of the \nbill had zeroed out funding for TVA, so I am grateful that the \nconferees provided most of the Senate-passed level of $86 million for \nnext year.\n  Unfortunately, the conferees also stipulated that this will be the \nlast year that they will provide funding for TVA to carry out its \nnonpower activities. They warned that, beginning next year, these \nnonpower responsibilities will either have to be transferred to some \nother Federal agency or paid for with revenues from TVA's self-\nfinancing power program.\n\n[[Page S10222]]\n\n  Mr. President, I want to be sure everyone understands what we are \ntalking about when we discuss TVA's nonpower programs. We are talking \nabout flood control and navigation on the Tennessee River, our Nation's \nfifth-largest river system. We are talking about the operation and \nmaintenance of 14 navigational locks and 54 dams--to which the TVA \npower system contributes its proportionate share of funding. And we are \ntalking about the management of 480,000 acres of recreational lakes, \nnearly 11,000 miles of shoreline, and 435,000 acres of public land--\nincluding such unique national resources as the Land Between the Lakes \nNational Recreation Area in Tennessee and Kentucky.\n  During the debate on this legislation, some have claimed that the \nresidents of the seven-State TVA region are receiving an unfair Federal \nsubsidy that no one else in the country receives. Madam President, that \nis simply not true. In every other region of the country, these types \nof natural resource and infrastructure management activities are \nperformed by some Federal agency, whether it is the Army Corps of \nEngineers, the National Park Service, the National Forest Service, or \nthe Bureau of Reclamation. In the southeast region, they have \ntraditionally been carried out by the TVA. But if the TVA does not \nperform them next year, someone else will have to. There is no question \nthat these are Federal responsibilities.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing suggestion that has been made in recent \nweeks is that the TVA power program should pick up the cost of these \nFederal land and water stewardship responsibilities. That is nothing \nless than an unfair tax on TVA ratepayers. As I said before, these are \nFederal responsibilities that are paid for by the Federal Government in \nevery other region of the country. Nowhere else are utility ratepayers \nexpected to assume the costs of these types of Federal responsibilities \nby paying more for their electricity.\n  So while I appreciate the fact that the conferees agreed to provide \nfunding for TVA to meet its Federal obligations this year, I am very \nconcerned about what they have proposed for the future. And I want to \nbe clear about one thing: it is not acceptable for Congress to walk \naway from its Federal responsibilities in one region of the country \nwhile continuing to provide for them everywhere else. Over the course \nof the coming year, I plan to work very hard with my colleagues to come \nup with a solution that is fair and equitable for the people of the \nTennessee Valley.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, we yield back any time we have \nremaining on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I yield back any time the minority has.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We have an \nagreement there will be up to 20 minutes of debate on that amendment \nand we will engage in a colloquy.\n  I am glad to yield the floor so the Senator from Oregon can carry \nthis out.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, the Wyden-Grassley amendment is before \nthe Senate at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I will be very brief. I also want to \nthank the majority leader for his courtesy.\n  This amendment involves one of the most awesome powers that a Member \nof the U.S. Senate has. That is the power to effectively block the \nconsideration of a bill or nomination in secret.\n  Now, it is a power that I think many Americans are concerned about. I \nhave made it very clear that I am not seeking to abolish the right of a \nSenator to put a hold on a measure or matter. But I do think that if an \nimportant health or environmental matter comes before the Senate, as \nthe Kennedy-Kassebaum measure did in the last Congress, involving \nhealth care for millions of Americans, that there ought to be public \ndisclosure, that there ought to be sunshine.\n  The majority leader, in my view, has made a number of constructive \nproposals in the past with respect to this procedure. I am particularly \npleased that he sought in the beginning of this year, January 27, to \nlimit Members from putting holds on blocks of legislation, in effect, \nblocking a whole package of legislation, from coming before the Senate. \nBut we still have not been able to change the Senate rules to bring \nsome sunshine in, to make sure that the American people can hold each \none of us accountable.\n  There have been reports that when the Senate passes the Wyden-\nGrassley legislation to have public disclosure of holds in the U.S. \nSenate, this is just going to die in conference and it will just vanish \nin the vapor in secret. It is especially ironic that an effort to \neliminate secrecy in the exercise of awesome powers of the U.S. Senate, \nthat would somehow take place again in secret, but I am concerned that \nmay happen. In fact, there is a report today in Roll Call, a Capitol \nHill publication, that raises concern in my mind.\n  I briefly would like to engage the majority leader in a colloquy on \nthis point. He and I have been talking about it for about a year and a \nhalf now, I think. As I said, I believe the majority leader has made a \nnumber of constructive changes already with respect to the hold \nprocedure. I would like to have his thoughts at this time with respect \nto his views on public disclosure of holds, and specifically whether it \nwill be possible on a bipartisan basis to work out this change and \nensure that there is real accountability with the American people for \nimportant actions taken by Senators.\n  I yield to the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, first and foremost, I want to apologize to \nthe Senator from Oregon for not being able to respond last week to his \nrequest that we engage in a colloquy regarding his amendment which is \npending to the D.C. appropriations bill. He was generous enough to be \nunderstanding that we had a number of other issues we were dealing with \nlate last week, including the campaign finance reform issue, as well as \na number of other issues that are very pressing at the end of the \nfiscal year with the appropriations bills. So I am glad he was willing \nto allow us to do the colloquy now instead of last week. I appreciate \nhis attitude on that.\n\n  I think also I should note that he has been talking with me over the \npast year and 4 months that I have been majority leader about his \nconcerns in this area. I appreciate the fact that you noted, Senator, I \nhave tried to be more open and more communicative with Senators about \nthe procedures around here, trying to open up, trying to make them \nclearer and more understandable. As a matter of fact, I sent out a long \nletter clarifying to Members what is the process and what is the proper \nway to exercise a hold. I did feel that it had sort of evolved into a \nsituation that was not fair and was not intended.\n  I continue and want to continue working to have a fair system around \nhere and one that everybody understands. I am sure the Senator also has \nlearned to appreciate, as a Senator, the importance and the \nsignificance of the hold. It is a unique creature in the Senate and it \nis one that is used, I think reasonably and responsibly most all of the \ntime, and can serve very positive purposes.\n  For instance, I believe you noted in your comments that you used it \nearlier, or last month, with regard to the confirmation of the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff to get an issue addressed that was \nimportant to you. You didn't do it secretly. You were pretty open about \nyour hold. It led to some accommodations that I believe will be helpful \nto the families there in Oregon and satisfied the Senator.\n  We want to be careful how we change things around here. When you come \nover from the House to the Senate you really have a lot of questions \nabout how this place operates: What are the rules? This seems like an \narchaic way to do things. Then you begin to understand it better, then \nyou begin to think to yourself, no, I don't want the Senate to be the \nHouse. You begin to appreciate the traditions and the rules and the \nprocedures around here. You have an opportunity to talk to Senator \nByrd, as the Senator from Oregon has, or in my case, to Senator Stevens \nor Senator Helms. If you go to them and say, why is this important? Why \nhas it been done that way? Then you begin to have a whole different \nview about the institution and the tradition and how things are done.\n  So, I will continue to move in the direction, I think, that the \nSenator is seeking. I want a clearer understanding and I like doing \nthings in the daylight, not in the dark of night. I don't like secrecy \ngenerally on anything, as a matter of fact. I like sunshine.\n  But it is a problem for the majority leader and for the Senate to \nmake this kind of change on the D.C. appropriations bill. I think to \nchange the standing orders of the Senate in this way is something that \nis troublesome to some Senators.\n  For instance, I have not had an opportunity yet to sit down and talk \nwith the minority leader about this. I had thought that the better \nplace to do this would be at the beginning of a session when we meet, \nbetween the two leaders of the two parties, and we have knowledge and \ninput from both sides of the aisle and that you do it at the beginning \nof a Congress when you have the organization of the Senate. I think \nthat path would have been much preferable or is preferable to this \napproach.\n\n  I assume that the minority leader has some reservations of the use of \nany Senator to effect the so-called standing orders with an amendment \non an appropriations bill.\n  So I say to my colleague, then, that I understand what he is trying \nto do and I am not unsympathetic to that, but I do have problems with \ndoing it in this way on an appropriations bill.\n  I will continue to listen to all Senators. I will sit down. This has \ncaused me to find a time--and I am not complaining--to sit down and \nmake sure that senior Senators understand what we might be thinking of \ndoing. Are there problems with it? I don't know that there will be. I \nreally think that any Senator who feels strongly enough about an issue \nto put a hold on it ought to be prepared to come to the floor and \nexplain it. I have indicated to Senators on both sides of the aisle, \nsometimes when holds have been placed and have not been removed in a \nreasonable period of time that they better be prepared to come to the \nfloor and object and debate because I was prepared to call up the \nissue.\n  However, I also feel a real appreciation for the way the Senate is \nconsiderate of every single Senator--if she or he has a problem, I like \nto give them time to work through it, whether they are Republican or \nDemocrat, regardless of philosophy, religion, or anything else. \nSometimes there may be a good reason why they would not want, in a \nspecified period of time, 2 days, for instance, to explain all of what \nis going on.\n  I guess that is a long explanation to the Senator's comments and \nquestions, but I understand what he is trying to do. I hope we can find \na way to continue to work on it and come to a conclusion that would \nbenefit the Senate as a whole.\n  Mr. WYDEN. If the majority leader can spend another minute--these are \nthoughtful points that you raise, and I\n\n[[Page S10224]]\n\nappreciate the courtesy--the reason for acting now is this is the \nseason when senior Members say that the abuses are greatest. At the end \nof a session when there is a rush to complete the business is when this \npractice which, as the majority leader points out, is a long tradition, \nthat is when this practice is abused. I think the majority leader makes \na very good point with respect to the need for courtesy and respect for \ntraditions.\n  I see our friend, Senator Grassley, is here. This is a bipartisan \namendment. We share the majority leader's view with respect to this \ntradition. We are not seeking to eliminate the hold, seeking to \neliminate the filibuster, seeking the right of Senators to work matters \nout. What we are concerned about is secrecy. At a time when the \nAmerican people are so skeptical about our Government, when they go to \nhearings and day after day look at practices that they question, when \nthey look at the U.S. Senate and see these procedures that are secret, \nit smacks of a backroom deal.\n  I think the majority leader is right, the Senate is a good \ninstitution. It is not going to suffer if a bit of sunlight comes in. \nThis is an institution strong enough to have a bit of sunlight and to \nhave Members held accountable. I don't want to disrupt the tradition of \nthe Senate, but if an important health or environmental measure or \nother important issue is held up for months on end because a Senator \ngenuinely objects, then it is not just a matter of courtesy, it is a \nmatter of being accountable to the American people.\n  I will interpret the majority leader's response to this colloquy as \nwilling to work with the Wyden-Grassley effort, and I appreciate the \nfact that it is going to pass today. I know the majority leader has \nother matters that he has to attend to. I want to thank him for his \ncolloquy and look forward to working with him.\n  I yield the time now to the Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, what we are proposing in the Wyden-\nGrassley amendment is not going to hurt anybody. Senator Wyden and I \nexperimented with this so the other 98 Members of the Senate would not \nhave to be hurt if it didn't work. Well over a year ago, we \nvoluntarily, on our own, without any instigation from the rules or \nanything or anybody else, we publicly stated that we were going to \nfollow the practice of our amendment, even though we didn't have to, \nand when we put a hold on a bill or a nomination, we would put it in \nthe Congressional Record. We did that. I can speak for myself and say \nthat there are no bruises, there is no harm, there is no retaliation. \nNothing happened as a result of the whole world knowing why Senator \nGrassley or Senator Wyden were holding up a particular action.\n  I think that ought to tell everybody else that they can likewise do \nwhatever they need to do in the Senate to adequately represent the \ninterests of their constituents through the use of a hold and freely \ntell everybody, and the end result can still be accomplished without \nanybody being hurt as a result of it. I hope that we will now \ninstitutionalize what I have found to be a very effective way of doing \nthe job of U.S. Senator and, yet, at the same time, being open and \naboveboard about it.\n  This amendment requires simply disclosure by Senators of the holds \nthat they place on legislation. As we all know, the current Senate \npractice allows Senators to block consideration of any measure without \ndisclosing their actions just by notifying Senate leaders of their \nobjection. Our amendment does not stop this practice. Rather, we seek \nto put an end to the secrecy surrounding the practice. If any Senator \nobjects to legislation, that Senator should have the courage and \nconviction to express openly the reasons for opposition. It is critical \nto preserve the right of every Senator to represent the views of his \nconstituents, but we cannot fully earn the trust of our constituents if \nwe do not shed the brightest possible light on what we do here in the \npeople's assembly.\n  It is important for the Senators to remember that their right to \nplace holds on initiatives about which they have objection, then, is \nvery much preserved in the tradition of the Senate, but everything is \nout in the open. The only thing untraditional about it is, if you want \nto hold up legislation, you should state your reason in the Record and \nlet people know. All we are requiring is that Senators make their \nobjections known in one of two ways--either stating their objections on \nthe floor, or publishing their objections in the Congressional Record \nwithin 48 hours of placing such a hold.\n  It is a simple amendment that sends a very powerful message that the \nU.S. Senate is willing to operate in an open manner, according to the \nprinciples of representative democracy. I believe this amendment can \nonly increase our constituents' belief that we are willing to be open \nand honest about the legislative process and what our legislative \nagenda is. It should help reduce some of the cynicism toward the \nprocesses of representative Government here at the Federal level.\n  I thank Senator Wyden for his work on this amendment and the majority \nleader for accommodating this issue. It will go to conference. I would \nexpect comity between the House and Senate because this is just a \nSenate issue, and that there will not be any objection on the part of \nthe House because of comity. In the case of the Senate, since this is \nbeing adopted by the Senate, I would expect that our Senate conferees \nwould uphold the amendment and it would become a part of the \ntraditional process.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to continue to work toward reform that makes \nCongress more open and straightforward in how we do the people's \nbusiness. I thank you for your consideration.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for an \nadditional 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Thank you. Mr. President, I want to especially thank my \ncolleague, Senator Grassley, for a fine statement and for all his help. \nHe has long been recognized as one of the most honest, up-front Members \nof the U.S. Senate. I want to tell him that it is a special pleasure to \nbe able to work with him.\n  Mr. President, certainly, if you walk down the main streets of this \ncountry and ask our citizens what a hold is in the U.S. Senate, you are \ncertainly not going to find many Americans who are familiar with this \npractice. But the fact of the matter is, this is an awesome, awesome \npower exercised by a Member of the U.S. Senate. The power to put a hold \non a bill or a nomination is the power to singlehandedly, effectively \nblock the consideration of a bill or nomination from coming to the \nfloor of the U.S. Senate.\n  All Senator Grassley and I are asking tonight is that when a Member \nof the U.S. Senate exercises this extraordinary power, that it be \npublicly disclosed. All we are asking is for an end to the secrecy.\n  My constituents look at the U.S. Senate sometimes and raise questions \nabout how business is done here and, frankly, have some suspicions \nabout the way the Senate conducts business. Sometimes I think they \nsuspect that the procedures around here are a little bit like an \nelegant game of three-card monte. Now, my own hope is that with the \npassage of this amendment tonight in the U.S. Senate, and by making \npublic the exercise of this extraordinary power by a U.S. Senator, our \ncitizens will feel a bit more confidence and a bit more likely to see \nthe Senate as an institution that is open and accountable.\n  The majority leader, Senator Lott, is absolutely right about the \ntraditions of the Senate and, particularly, making accommodations to \nwork out issues wherever possible. All we are saying is that when a \nMember of the U.S. Senate digs in with all his or her strength to block \na bill or a nomination, the American people deserve to know the name of \nthat Senator. This effort does not eliminate holds, it doesn't \neliminate the filibuster; it eliminates none of the traditions that the \nmajority leader referred to. All it does is say that a Senator is going \nto be straight with the American people when they exercise their \nenormous power to effectively block the consideration of a bill or a \nnomination on the use of the hold procedure.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S10225]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to say a few words about the \nsurface transportation reauthorization debate. North Carolina is the \nnumber one donor State. We received just 82 cents on the dollar for our \ngas tax contributions to the Highway Trust Fund under the 1991 ISTEA. \nIn fact, over the 40 year life of the federal highway aid program, we \nhave received just 87 cents for every dollar that we sent to \nWashington. There is no State that received a lesser rate of return on \nits gas taxes than North Carolina.\n  Mr. President, like other Donor State Senators, I will not support a \nreauthorization bill that fails to offer the Donor States some basic \nfairness. The Donor States accepted this role--and accepted it \ngraciously--for forty years. The Chafee-Warner-Baucus bill is a step in \nthe right direction. However, there is much work to be done. I served \non the North Carolina Highway Commission and chaired it for four years. \nWe understood the national importance of the interstate system. We were \nnot happy about our Donor State status, Mr. President, but we accepted \nit. We understood that the interstate system was a national priority. \nHowever, the interstate system is now almost complete, and the \nrationale for Donor and Donee States is gone.\n  The Donor States are not asking for extra dollars. We're not asking \nto be made whole for past subsidies to the Donee States. We just want \nan equitable rate of return on our gas taxes. Just a fair return after \nforty years of our subsidies to other States. I believe that there is a \nreal role for the federal government in transportation. But it must be \na fair one. Make no mistake about it, now that the rationale for Donor \nand Donee States is gone, their argument is just plain old-fashioned \npolitics.\n  Let me illustrate the absurd results of this long-term imbalance. One \nof the last additions to the 1991 ISTEA was a 3 billion dollar pot of \nmoney to reimburse States for the costs of roads built before the start \nof the Interstate system in 1956. This so-called ``equity category'' \nbenefitted, for the most part, northeastern Donee States. These are the \nsame States that enjoyed a huge windfall from the federal highway aid \nprogram during the Interstate construction era. Mr. President, these \nroads are more than 40 years old, and the construction bonds were paid \noff long ago. The toll booths are still up, though, collecting millions \nof dollars. These States received 3 billion dollars in ISTEA--for 40-\nyear-old roads--but, apparently, that wasn't enough for them.\n  The Clinton Administration proposed in its NEXTEA that the American \ntaxpayers continue to funnel their hard-earned tax dollars to these \nStates. In the NEXTEA proposal--its plan for the first post-Interstate \nhighway bill--the White House proposes not only to retain this program, \nbut to increase it to 6 billion dollars.\n  These must have been pretty expensive roads. After all, Mr. \nPresident, they have been paid for several times. First, the drivers \npaid tolls to pay off the construction bonds, and these roads were all \npaid off more than a decade ago. After the bonds were paid off, though, \nthe States kept collecting tolls. Then the federal government sent 3 \nbillion dollars to pay for the roads again. And the States kept \ncollecting the tolls.\n  Now they want 6 billion dollars to pay for the roads another time. \nAnd they will still keep collecting the tolls. North Carolina drivers \nlose 20 cents off every gas tax dollar to the Donee States. The \nSouthern States are growing fast and have major transportation needs. \nBut, not only can't North Carolina drivers get a dollar for dollar \nreturn, we are supposed to pay again and again for these 40-year-old \nroads. It seems just absurd to squander money like this. It is \nespecially absurd since there is such a limited pool of transportation \nfunds.\n  In fact, Mr. President, the transportation budget is so squeezed that \nwe hear all this talk about new ``user fees'' for transportation. These \nare just new taxes, of course, just a euphemism for new ways to take \nmoney from the taxpayers. The American people are already overtaxed. \nThese proposals to raise taxes just defy common sense. I find it \ninteresting, however, that I don't hear much discussion about one of \nthe most obvious ways to increase the value of our transportation \ndollars. It will not cost the taxpayers a dime and will boost the value \nof some transportation dollars by 15 percent.\n  The taxpayers' friends know that I am talking about repeal of the \nDavis-Bacon Act. I am talking about a Congress that favors the \ntaxpayers over the union bosses. These Davis-Bacon requirements, \nespecially the ``union work practices'' provision, drive up \nconstruction costs because they promote inefficiency in many forms. \nDavis-Bacon is a needless surcharge, just a contribution to union \nbosses, on these construction projects. The Davis-Bacon Act drives up \nconstruction costs by an average of 15 percent. The Congressional \nBudget Office confirms that repeal of Davis-Bacon will save the \ntaxpayers billions of dollars.\n  Incredibly, the White House proposed to expand Davis-Bacon in its \ntransportation bill. It is no secret, though, that Davis-Bacon repeal \nis essential if we are serious about squeezing every penny out of the \nfederal highway program. It is far better for the taxpayers to root out \nthese inefficiencies than to raise the taxes of the American people. I \nknow that some people find it hard to imagine that there are \nalternatives to new taxes in order to increase the transportation \nbudget. This Senate voted this year for billions of dollars for a \nmission in Bosnia, which was supposed to be over last year, and for \nhundreds of millions of dollars in new welfare spending.\n  It is time to cut the waste--not raise taxes--to fund our \ntransportation priorities. This is the first authorization bill in the \npost-Interstate era. It is also the first authorization bill subject to \nthe constraints of a balanced budget plan. This bill brings new \nchallenges. And, Mr. President, new obligations. This bill must be fair \nto the States that subsidized the Interstate system for 40 years. We \nneed to get the most for each and every dollar in the transportation \nbudget. We certainly cannot afford to squander taxpayer dollars on \noutdated rules in order to prop up the power of the labor unions.\n  It's time to tell the union bosses that the good times are over! This \nis not their transportation bill! North Carolina needs a transportation \nbill that builds highways, not government bureaucracies. A \ntransportation bill that works for the taxpayers, not the labor bosses. \nMr. President, if this bill is not fair to North Carolina taxpayers, I \nwill be forced to filibuster it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10225-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10225-S10226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  VISIT OF DAVID TRIMBLE OF THE NORTHERN IRELAND ULSTER UNIONIST PARTY\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, next week David Trimble, leader of the \nUlster Unionist Party in Northern Ireland, will begin a visit to the \nUnited States where he will meet with many of us on both sides of the \naisle in Congress who are deeply committed to helping achieve a lasting \npeace in Northern Ireland. There is perhaps no one better placed to \nmake that happen than Mr. Trimble, who leads Northern Ireland's largest \nparty.\n  Mr. Trimble is to be commended for bringing his party into the \ncurrent talks, which now include Sinn Fein as a result of the \nrestoration of the IRA cease-fire in July. Those talks are ably\n\n[[Page S10226]]\n\nchaired by our former Senate colleague, George Mitchell.\n  Mr. Trimble and his party faced many difficulties in deciding to \nparticipate in talks which include Sinn Fein. There is a long history \nof distrust by both sides in Northern Ireland, and the fears and \nconcerns of unionists cannot be dismissed. Mr. Trimble spent the month \nof August consulting with many people and concluded that his \nconstituents want his party to participate in the talks as the best \nhope for achieving a peaceful settlement.\n  Huge challenges lie ahead. Negotiating a solution which can obtain \nthe support of both communities is a formidable task. But at long last, \nthe principal parties are at the negotiating table and real dialogue is \nbeginning. David Trimble deserves a significant share of the credit for \nthis long-sought progess. I look forward to his visit to this country, \nand I ask unanimous consent that an excellent article in the September \n29 issue of Time Magazine be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From Time, Sept. 29, 1997]\n\n                              Face To Face\n\n                         (By Barry Hillenbrand)\n\n       It was no surprise last week when, just as historic talks \n     began to try to dissolve the annealed hate that divides \n     Northern Ireland, a 400-lb. bomb exploded in a largely \n     Protestant town near Belfast. The hard men for whom terrorism \n     has become a way of life were again trying to blow away the \n     chance for peace. Nor was it a surprise that the Protestant \n     politicians, who fear any change in their domination of the \n     province, denounced the bombing as a Roman Catholic \n     republican plot that made the talks impossible.\n       But it was a surprise when, one day after the explosion, \n     the talks began anyway, bringing together for the first time \n     the leaders of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish \n     Republican Army, which has waged war to drive the British off \n     the island of Ireland, and the main leaders of their bitter \n     Protestant Unionist opponents. That the talks began at all \n     was a triumph of patience, persistence and cleverness by the \n     governments of Ireland, Britain and the U.S., which are \n     shepherding the broader peace process.\n       It was also a measure of how much has changed in Northern \n     Ireland over the past half dozen years. Most important, the \n     1.6 million people of the province, Protestant and Catholic \n     alike, have come to hate the war of hate and are demanding \n     peace. Second, the terrorists have come to believe they can \n     win more from talking than from killing. And finally, the \n     huge parliamentary majority rolled up by Tony Blair and the \n     Labour Party has stripped the recalcitrant Unionists of their \n     veto over the efforts of the British government to change the \n     status of its troubled province.\n       In the past the Unionists have been able simply to \n     stonewall the peace process. But last week, there at the head \n     of the Unionist delegation was David Trimble, a hot-tempered, \n     frequently red-faced law lecturer who heads Northern \n     Ireland's largest and most important Protestant party, the \n     Ulster Unionist Party (U.U.P.).\n       For years Trimble, like many other Unionists, refused to \n     sit down in the same room with Sinn Fein repesentatives. Once \n     Trimble stormed out of a TV interview in the midst of a live \n     broadcast because he was about to be electronically linked \n     with a Sinn Fein member in another studio. But in August the \n     British government declared that a new I.R.A. cease-fire was \n     genuine and that Sinn Fein was thus qualified to join the \n     political talks jointly sponsored by London and Dublin under \n     the chairmanship of former U.S. Senator George Mitchell. \n     Suddenly, Sept. 15, the date set for the start of a new round \n     of talks, became the moment of truth for Trimble, Sinn Fein \n     would join the talks, but would Trimble take his party in?\n       If Trimble's temperament and political background were any \n     guide, the answer would clearly have been no. As a young \n     lecturer in law at Queen's University in Belfast in the late \n     '60s, Trimble joined a fringe political group Vanguard, that \n     condemned the U.U.P., the party Trimble was later to head, \n     for being insufficiently hard line. He flirted with other \n     extremist groups before finally coming to terms with the \n     U.U.P. and being elected to Parliament as one of its \n     candidates in 1990. His rise to the top of the party was \n     swift. He won the leadership slot in 1995, largely on the \n     strength of the militant image he had acquired by marching at \n     the head of a triumphalist Protestant parade that bullied its \n     way through a besieged Catholic neighborhood. ``We were in \n     despair when he was elected,'' says a moderate in Trimble's \n     party. ``We thought all hope for peace and accommodation was \n     gone.''\n       But Trimble has changed. Once he became leader of the \n     party, there was a concerted effort by Britain and the U.S. \n     to erode his narrow provincialism by getting him to travel \n     outside Ulster, a process that had worked well with Gerry \n     Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein. For a man who once bragged he \n     had never set foot outside the U.K., it was a heady \n     experience. Trimble visited the U.S., long shunned by \n     Unionists as the bastion of fervent I.R.A. support. He had \n     coffee with President Bill Clinton and chatted with the sort \n     of Congressmen he once considered the enemies of Unionism. \n     Now Trimble's office hands out copies of the Congressional \n     Record featuring a speech paying tribute to the Irish \n     Protestant tradition in America. Its author: Ted Kennedy, \n     the Irish republican's greatest champion in Congress. \n     Trimble also traveled to South Africa with delegations of \n     other parties from Northern Ireland for a conference on \n     Conflict resolution.\n       Trimble is still a staunch Unionist and profoundly leery of \n     Sinn Fein. Before walking into the talks last week, he \n     defiantly said he had come not to ``negotiate with Sinn Fein \n     but to confront them and to expose their facist character.'' \n     ``Yet,'' says David Ervine, a senior official of the \n     Progressive Unionist Party, who marched into talks with \n     Trimble last week, ``Trimble has come further than any \n     Unionist leader in history.'' He has broken out of the siege \n     mentality, which for years had Unionist leaders hiding behind \n     banners proclaiming no surrender and refusing to consider any \n     accommodation with the Catholic minority or with the Irish \n     Republic to the south. ``We are certainly going to address \n     the views of those who consider themselves Irish and don't \n     want to be part of the United Kingdom,'' says Trimble. ``We \n     have to respect their cultural identity and protect their \n     civil rights. We are comfortable with that.'' But, of course, \n     Trimble holds fast to the basic principle of Unionism: that \n     Northern Ireland should remain part of the U.K.\n       Despite his firm belief that the I.R.A. cease-fire is a \n     sham, Trimble recognized that the moral burden of continuing \n     the peace process has fallen on him. ``We could have stayed \n     back and waited for the talks to collapse without us,'' says \n     Trimble. But then we would have been accused of blocking \n     peace.''\n       Trimble also knew that the popular political mood in \n     Northern Ireland was running strongly in favor of all-\n     inclusive peace talks. The failure of the I.R.A. cease-fire \n     which collapsed in February 1996, had profoundly depressed \n     people. This summer sectarian tension once again ran high, \n     and Northern Ireland teetered on the edge of what one of the \n     senior members of Mitchell's team warned could have been \n     ``full-scale civil war.'' The I.R.A. cease-fire announced in \n     July and the promise of peace talks in September again raised \n     hopes. Says Christopher McGimpsey, a U.U.P. city councilor \n     from Belfast: ``We were hearing from the grass roots that we \n     should enter talks.''\n       Trimble also received a powerful shove through the \n     negotiating gates from Blair. First, Blair warned Sinn Fein \n     that if it wanted to have a say in the future of Northern \n     Ireland, it would have to secure a cease-fire from the I.R.A. \n     and agree to respect democratic principles. When it did just \n     that, Blair turned his attention to Trimble's Unionists. \n     ``Some Unionists failed to understand that if we do not join \n     the talks, London and Dublin could impose a political \n     solution on us,'' says John Taylor, the deputy leader of \n     Trimble's party. With that possibility staring him in the \n     face, Trimble could hardly have said no to the talks.\n       Even after last week's bombing, Trimble arrived for the \n     talks. ``Two years ago,'' said Marjorie (``Mo'') Mowlam, the \n     tough-talking, no-nonsense British Secretary of State for \n     Northern Ireland, ``it would not have been possible for \n     Trimble to move forward after a bomb like that. Now Unionism \n     wants its leaders to be talking.'' And in the North, that is \n     surprising progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10225-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        HONORING THE WOODALLS ON THEIR 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

In accordance with this provision, I have sent the enclosed \nnotice, stating that the Iran emergency declared in 1979 is to continue \nin effect beyond November 14, 1997, to the Federal Register for \npublication. Similar notices have been sent annually to the Congress \nand the Federal Register since November 12, 1980. The most recent \nnotice appeared in the Federal Register on October 31, 1996. This \nemergency is separate from that declared with respect to Iran on March \n15, 1995, in Executive Order 12957.\n  The crisis between the United States and Iran that began in 1979 has \nnot been fully resolved. The international tribunal established to \nadjudicate claims of the United States and U.S. nationals against Iran \nand of the Iranian government and Iranian nationals against the United \nStates continues to function, and normalization of commercial and \ndiplomatic relations between the United States and Iran has not been \nachieved. In these circumstances, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to maintain in force the broad authorities that are in place \nby virtue of the November 14, 1979, declaration of emergency and that \nare needed in the process of implementing the January 1981 agreements \nwith Iran.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to further improve the safety and health of working environments, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                the safety advancement for employees act\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Safety \nAdvancement for Employees Act of 1997. I send the bill to the desk.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask that further reading of the bill be dispensed \nwith.\n  Mr. President, during this first Session of the 105th Congress, my \nesteemed colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Gregg, and I, each \nintroduced a bill related to workplace safety and health. On July 10, a \ncomprehensive OSHA oversight hearing was held by Chairman Frist in the \nSubcommittee on Public Health and Safety. This hearing specifically \nfocused on OSHA modernization legislation pending before the committee. \nThe results of this hearing further confirmed the commitment Senator \nGregg and I share concerning the safety and health of our Nation's \nworkforce.\n  It is with great pleasure that Senator Gregg and I, introduce this \nconsensus legislation. The SAFE Act has the support of Subcommittee \nChairman Frist, as well as Labor Committee Chairman Jeffords. Both are \nproud to be original cosponsors and I am sincerely grateful to them for \nall their hard work. They have clearly helped pave the way for this \nimportant measure. In addition, my House colleague and chairman of the \nSmall Business Committee, Jim Talent, will introduce similar \nlegislation in the House today. This legislation has received strong \nbipartisan support--an essential ingredient in the recipe for success.\n  It is important to understand that both the Senate and House versions \ndo not attempt to reinvent OSHA's wheel, just change its tires. \nTreading water for 27 years, OSHA has never seriously attempted to \nencourage employers and employees in their efforts to create safe and \nhealthful workplaces. Instead, OSHA chose to operate according to a \ncommand and control mentality. This approach has lead to burdensome and \noften incomprehensible regulations which may not relate to worker \nsafety and health and are, quite often, only sporadically enforced. \nEven the AFL-CIO has acknowledged that with only 2,451 State and \nFederal inspectors regulating 6.2 million American worksites, an \nemployer can expect to see an inspector once every 167 years.\n  While changing OSHA's bald tires, it is important to point out that \nthe SAFE Act does not dismantle OSHA's enforcement capabilities. That \napproach has been tried time and time again. But, enforcement alone \ncannot ensure the safety of our Nation's workplaces and the health of \nour working population. America would be better served by an OSHA that \nplaces a greater emphasis on promoting employers and employees working \ntogether and this bill would strike that balance.\n  The SAFE Act is geared to provide employers who seek a safe and \nhealthful workplace for their employees with the ability to obtain \ncompliance evaluations from qualified, third party consultants. In \naddition, the SAFE Act includes additional voluntary and technical \ncompliance initiatives to assist employers in deeming their worksites \nsafe for their employees. Businesses and employees need clarification \non a whole host of issues. They need progress, now. We need good \ncommonsense legislation that advances safety and health of the American \nworkplace, now.\n  Senator Gregg and I are not interested in making another political \nstatement. It is time for us to tuck the political statements into our \ncoat pockets and pass good common sense legislation that advances the \nsafety and health of the American workplace. Advancing safety and \nhealth in the American workplace is a matter of great importance and it \nmust be considered in a serious and rational manner by Congress, by the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, by employers, and yes, \nby employees too.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that the SAFE Act represents a clean \nstart to addressing the problems that affect OSHA and its dealings with \nemployers and employees. Senator Gregg and I, are quite eager to \ncontinue working with my Senate and House colleagues on this important \nmatter. By working together in a bipartisan fashion, we can ensure our \nNation's work force that Congress does care about their\n\n[[Page S10230]]\n\npersonal safety and health. I welcome your support in doing just that.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend section 1926 of the Public Health Service \nAct to encourage States to strengthen their efforts to prevent the sale \nand distribution of tobacco products to individuals under the age of 18 \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n            the tobacco use by minors deterrence act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today in America, too many \nteenagers have access to too much tobacco at too many stores and retail \noutlets. The result? Each day 3,000 more young people start smoking and \nget addicted to lethal tobacco products.\n\n  As Congress considers legislation to reduce teenage smoking and to \naddress the growing public health concerns associated with the use of \ntobacco, I want to propose a concept that goes to the heart of the \nproblem--keeping tobacco products out of the hands of kids. While there \nare numerous well-intentioned suggestions as to how to best achieve \nthis goal, I believe that the proposal I am introducing today goes to \nthe heart of the problem--holding both those who sell tobacco \naccountable and those who illegally purchase tobacco responsible. It \ndemands the participation by store owners, clerks, parents, kids, and \nlocal law enforcement.\n  The proposal is a simple, direct approach: require those who sell \ntobacco to be licensed and trained, and hold children who illegally \npurchase tobacco responsible for their actions--by notifying their \nparents, imposing fines and community service, and restricting access \nto driving privileges.\n  With this legislation, we have an opportunity to take some \nincremental and immediate action today, to empower our communities in \nthe fight against teenage tobacco use. The Tobacco Use by Minors \nDeterrence Act elicits cooperation among families, communities, the \nretailers, and law enforcement officials in the fight against tobacco \nuse by children. Importantly, this legislation gives retailers a new \nleadership role and places greater responsibility on parents and \nminors.\n  First, this bill establishes a self-funding State license program for \nretailers to sell tobacco products, similar to liquor licenses. Second, \nit imposes strict penalties on store owners and employees for selling \ntobacco products to minors. Third, it requires employee training on all \ntobacco laws. Fourth, it subjects minors who are caught purchasing or \nusing tobacco products to punishments that are meaningful to them, \nincluding the option of fines, parental notification, community \nservice, and possible loss of driving privileges.\n  In my State of Oregon, restrictions on the distribution and sale of \ntobacco products are some of the strongest in the nation. This \nlegislation echoes Oregon's commitment by making it more difficult for \nretailers across the Nation to make a profit from the illegal sale of \ntobacco products to children.\n  Just how important is it that we take immediate action? Each day that \nwe wait for the pending FDA lawsuits, and each day that we spend \ntalking about doing something to reduce tobacco use by our Nation's \nchildren, 3,000 more young people begin smoking. I want you to think \nabout that for a moment. Each day, 3,000 children start smoking---\nthat's more than 1 million children each year. To put this into \nperspective, the Centers for Disease Control [CDC] estimates that 16.6 \nmillion of our children today will become regular smokers, and almost \none-third, approximately 5 million children, will die from tobacco-\nrelated illness. In my State of Oregon, 191,688 children under 18 are \nprojected to become smokers; 61,340 of those youth will die. It is time \nto recognize teen tobacco use for what it is--a public health epidemic.\n  In addition to the loss of life associated with tobacco use, there is \na significant cost to our public health system. Currently, health care \ncosts caused directly by smoking total more than $50 billion each year. \nWe cannot afford to wait any longer. Because the longer we postpone \nempowering communities, families, and law enforcement officials, we do \nso by sacrificing the health and life of our children.\n\n

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Greater Washington Metropolitan Area has an \n     expanding regional economy but suffers from a serious \n     regional labor market shortage that threatens economic \n     growth;\n       (2) the region's education and training systems, \n     particularly in the District of Columbia, fail to provide \n     many youths and adults with the skills necessary to be \n     competitive in the regional labor market;\n       (3) the need for a better skilled area workforce makes it \n     imperative that the region's businesses, educational \n     institutions, and governments work together to provide youth \n     and adults with the education and training necessary to meet \n     the needs of the 21st century;\n       (4) the condition of school facilities is a major \n     impediment to improving the quality of education in the \n     District of Columbia and their repair and modernization is a \n     necessary step in making the District's public schools a full \n     partner in preparing students for the regional labor market;\n       (5) the University of the District of Columbia, as well as \n     other area institutions of post-secondary education, have an \n     important role to play in providing skills training to meet \n     the needs of the regional labor market;\n       (6) although the present revenues for the District of \n     Columbia public school system provide sufficient operating \n     funds, as with other public school systems in the \n     metropolitan region, there are insufficient revenues for \n     programs to prepare students to compete in the global economy \n     and or to provide students with the skills demanded by the \n     local market: and\n       (7) the Greater Washington Metropolitan Area has an \n     opportunity to set a national example of regional cooperation \n     in engaging in education reform and workforce training.\n       (b) Purpose.--\n       (1) In general.--It is the purpose of this division to \n     foster the development of a regional workforce investment \n     system that will bring about improvements in education and \n     workforce preparation by--\n       (A) creating a metropolitan partnership through which area \n     businesses, school systems, postsecondary institutions, and \n     governments can cooperate in charting a course for reforms \n     and investments in education and workforce training; and\n       (B) providing the Greater Washington Metropolitan Area with \n     the resources necessary to lead the Nation in improving its \n     capacity to provide for a highly educated and skilled \n     workforce.\n       (2) Nonresident tax.--The purpose of imposing the tax \n     established by title II is to--\n       (A) fund the repair and modernization of District of \n     Columbia public schools; and\n       (B) provide resources to carry out the activities of a \n     Washington metropolitan partnership as described in title I.\n   TITLE I--METROPOLITAN WASHINGTON EDUCATION AND WORKFORCE TRAINING \n                                 GRANTS\n\n     SEC. 101.

If an individual entitled to a distributive share of \n     such net income of an unincorporated business computes his \n     income tax under this article upon the basis of a period \n     different from that upon the basis of which the net income of \n     the unincorporated business is computed, then his \n     distributive share of the net income of the unincorporated \n     business for any accounting period of the unincorporated \n     business ending within the taxable year upon the basis of \n     which such individual's income tax is computed shall be \n     included in computing such tax.\n       ``(b) If the deductions which are allowed or allowable to \n     an unincorporated business under section 3(a) of title III of \n     this article exceed the gross income of such unincorporated \n     business derived from sources within the District within the \n     meaning of title X of this article, the distributive shares \n     of such excess deductions shall be allowed as deductions to \n     the individuals entitled thereto in determining their \n     individual tax liability under title VI of this article in \n     the case of residents and under title XVII of this article in \n     the case of nonresidents, except that in the case of a \n     nonresident such excess deductions shall be allowed to the \n     nonresident only to the extent provided in section 1(b) of \n     such title XVII. If an individual entitled to a distributive \n     share of the excess deductions of an unincorporated business \n     computes his income tax under this article upon the basis of \n     a period different from that upon the basis of which the net \n     income of the unincorporated business is computed, then his \n     distributive share of the excess deductions of the \n     unincorporated business for any accounting period of the \n     unincorporated business ending within the taxable year upon \n     the basis of which such individual's income tax is computed \n     shall be included in computing such tax.\n       ``(c) In computing the net income or the excess deductions \n     of an unincorporated business for purposes of this title, the \n     full amount of the deductions described in section 3(a) of \n     title III of this article shall be allowed to such \n     unincorporated business notwithstanding that a nonresident \n     may be entitled to a distributive share of such net income or \n     excess deductions.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendments.--\n       (1)(A) Section 1 of title III of such Act (D.C.

Mr. President, I take the floor today to speak \nabout the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to be Assistant Attorney General \nfor Civil Rights at the Department of Justice. I urge the Judiciary \nCommittee to act expeditiously on this nomination and send it to the \nfull Senate for a vote.\n  Bill Lann Lee brings outstanding legal, educational and personal \ncredentials to this important position. Most recently, he served as the \nwestern regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Education \nFund. Mr. Lee is also regarded by many as a skilled consensus-builder \nwith a knack for finding pragmatic solutions, earning him praise from \nallies and adversaries alike. His numerous accomplishments in \nlitigation and over 20 years of experience in civil rights work have \nestablished him as one of the most experienced civil rights lawyers in \nthe Nation.\n  Bill Lee was inspired to become a civil rights lawyer by his father, \nwho was subjected to discrimination in\n\n[[Page S10240]]\n\nhousing and other areas because of his race, even after serving his \ncountry loyally in the U.S. Army during World War II. Witnessing this \nbigotry had a profound impact on young Bill. After graduating from \nColumbia Law School in 1974, he entered the legal profession with a \npassion for serving the public interest and advocating for civil \nrights.\n  Bill Lee will bring a passion and commitment to the cause of civil \nrights and equal treatment under law for all Americans. He is a \ntremendous role model for all Americans who care about civil rights. \nEarly in life, he recognized the importance of public service and he \nhas dedicated his life to it.\n  On that point, I would like to take this opportunity to express my \nconcern that many Americans, especially those with Asian names or of \nAsian heritage, may be less interested in becoming involved in public \nlife as a result of a series of unfortunate and disparaging remarks \nmade by some in the media and in public positions.\n  Such remarks and misperceptions appeal to the worst human instincts \nwhen we should be appealing to the best. A recent study by the National \nAsian Pacific American Legal Consortium documented an increase last \nyear in hate crimes targeting Asian Pacific Americans.\n  This disturbing trend demonstrates that now is the time for these \nissues to be handled fairly, thoroughly and expediently, under strong \nnew leadership by the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10239-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n\n                              section 8123\n\n Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to recognize the men and women of Ellsworth Air Force \nBase's 28th Bomb Wing and join them in their celebration of the Air \nForce's and the bomb wing's 50th anniversary.\n  This is a wonderful time to reflect on the remarkable role the U.S. \nAir Force and the 28th Bomb Wing have played in our national security \nand to look toward the future at the growing importance air superiority \nwill have in maintaining the peace around the world. These past five \ndecades have provided countless successes and great memories for the \nmen and women who piloted, maintained, and provided oversight to the \nnumerous important missions of the U.S. Air Force. Our country owes all \nwho have served a debt of gratitude.\n  The 28th Bomb Wing was born in August 1947 when the Strategic Air \nCommand organized the wing at Rapid City Army Air Field, later renamed \nEllsworth Air Force Base, SD. In 1949, the 28th participated in the \nfirst of a long line of historical missions when B-29's flew a 90-day \nshow-of force mission during the Soviet blockade of Berlin. At the \nstart of the cold war, the B-29's gave way to B-36 Peacemakers in 1950 \nas the 28th provided an umbrella of security for NATO countries.\n  The crews of the B-36 were dedicated to their missions--primarily \nreconnaissance and to gather photographic and electronic information. \nHowever, according to B-36 crew chief Bill Shoemaker, they did \neverything from drop haybales to stranded livestock during the terrible \nwinters of 1949 and 1950 for Operation Haylifts; transport Thanksgiving \nturkeys to soldiers in Greenland; attend the coronation of Queen \nElizabeth II, and take a member of the royal family on a short flight. \nThe ability to perform any job, and do it well, was the hallmark of the \nB-36 crew and a trait that has been reflected in the personnel of the \n28th throughout the years.\n  Senior Master Sgt. Dave Sitch spent 6 of his 26 years of military \nservice at Ellsworth Air Force Base as part of the 28th Bomb Wing--\n1951-55, 1974-76. ``In the days of the '36 and as part of the 28th, \nthat was the closest group I had ever been in. There was a lot of \ncompetition among the squadrons, but there was a lot of camaraderie \ntoo. We looked out for each other.''\n  Jet technology changed the face of aeronautics, and the all-jet B-52 \nStratofortress started replacing the Peacemakers in 1957. The 28th Bomb \nWing played an important role in the Vietnam war, flying both bombers \nand tankers for 9 years. Over the next 20 years, Ellsworth Air Force \nBase became a vital component of our country's defensive strategy as \nthe 28th assumed the bomber role in the Strategic Projection Force. The \nB-52 mission expanded to include sea reconnaissance, surveillance, and \nconventional operations from forward bases, and Ellsworth Air Force \nBase's reach extended to a number of hot spots overseas.\n  Don Strachan spent 10 years as a member of the 28th Bomb Wing at \nEllsworth Air Force Base. He recalls a time when the B-52's \nparticipated in an operation titled Airborne Alert, in which one-third \nof the entire B-52 fleet was expected to remain airborne at all times \nbetween 1957 and 1960. ``Some of the wings couldn't handle it, but the \n28th filled in. We never failed to meet our commitment. It was like \nfamily. We supported everyone extremely well. The esprit de corps was \nunmatched. There was a great deal of sharing among the crews. People \nwould come in and observe our operations.''\n  Strachan and Shoemaker recalled conducting maintenance on planes in \ndesperately cold temperatures. While stationed with the B-36's in \nGreenland, Shoemaker recalled, ``It was so cold, you couldn't do \nanything. We worked under the lights on ramps. It was so dark all the \ntime.'' Strachan said maintenance crews worked in chill factors that \nwere 100 degrees below zero. ``Nothing stopped the 28th,'' said \nStrachan.\n  Fred Hurst spent six different stints totaling 19 years at Ellsworth \nAir Force Base as a member of the 28th Bomb Wing. For many years, he \nserved as president of the 28th Bomb Wing Reunion Association and was \nrecently succeeded in the position by Strachan. Hurst spent 30 years of \nmilitary service, working in maintenance on B-29's, B-36's, and B-52's \nand retired from military service as a chief master sergeant. He \nretired last year as a civilian worker and advisor on B-1B operations. \nHurst says the 28th Bomb Wing has always been admired for its \nprofessionalism and efficiency. ``It is a good wing. It's been at the \ntop for so many years as far as performance goes. It has a great safety \nrecord. Whenever someone had a problem, everyone and his brother tried \nto help him.''\n  Mike Isaman spent a total of 15 years at Ellsworth Air Force Base \nover two stints. As a member of the 28th Bomb Wing, Isaman said \nteamwork was key to the success of any operation, as well as to the \nsuccess of the Wing and the Base. ``We were all friends. Everyone \nlooked out after each other. It was a team. It worked together. They \nall stood together. We would do anything possible for other crews and \nsquadrons.''\n  The Air Force introduced the next generation of bombers, the B-1B \nLancer, in 1987, and once again, the 28th took the lead in housing the \nsleek new bombers. Adding to its already storied combat experience, the \nwing deployed\n\n[[Page S10241]]\n\nboth tanker and airborne command post aircraft to Operations Desert \nShield/Desert Storm. Following action in the Persian Gulf, B-1's were \ntaken off alert, and the world began to settle into the post-cold war \nera. The 28th Bomb Wing, successful in protecting the United States for \nfive decades began the transition from the strategic role to an all-\nconventional mission. Once again, the 28th shone brightly as the bomb \nwing successfully participated in the congressionally directed \noperational readiness assessment known as Dakota Challenge in 1994. The \n77th Bomb Squadron was activated at Ellsworth Air Force Base in April \n1997, and the 28th Bomb Wing will continue to stand tall as the \n``Pioneer of Peace for the 21st Century.''\n  I strongly support the B-1B program and share the view of the Air \nForce that the B-1B is the backbone of our bomber force. It deserves \nthis reputation because of the versatility, efficiency, and \neffectiveness of the craft. To the flight crews as well as the ground \nsupport, administrative staff, security personnel, base support, and \nhospital personnel who served and continue to serve as part of the \n28th, I salute and commend your efforts. The active duty members, \nfamilies, and retirees have forged an unbreakable bond with the \ncommunities of Box Elder and Rapid City.\n  Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of \nthose associated with Ellsworth and the Air Force for their impressive \nefforts and for their commitment to South Dakota and the United States. \nI know they have had an illustrious past, and I know they will continue \ntheir success in the future. Their missions will continue, although \nmodified to fit the requirements of the post-cold war world, and I have \nno doubt that they will continue to be the ``first to fight with \ndecisive combat airpower that achieves the aims of the combatant \ncommander's campaign'' as their mission states. Best wishes for another \n50 years of pride and success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10240-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE OF NEW YORK\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to note the \naccomplishments of the International Rescue Committee of New York.\n  This week the International Rescue Committee was awarded the Conrad \nN. Hilton Humanitarian Prize, in recognition of its relief and \nresettlement services to millions of refugees. In presenting the award \nto John C. Whitehead, chairman of the IRC Board, former President Jimmy \nCarter said, ``This year, the Hilton Foundation has fulfilled a vital \nneed in bringing the refugee issue, one that is often overlooked or \nignored, to the forefront by honoring the International Rescue \nCommittee.''\n  The Conrad N. Hilton Foundation created the annual award to recognize \noutstanding efforts by the best American charitable organization \nengaged in combating ``famine, war, disease, human affliction and man's \ninhumanity to man.'' IRC was selected to receive the award by a \nprestigious international jury that included Dr. C. Everett Koop, \nformer Surgeon General of the United States. It was accorded the Hilton \nPrize on the basis of its achievements in alleviating suffering, on the \nsustainability of its programs, and on the extent to which it reaches \nout and involves others in accomplishing its mission.\n  I want to congratulate the International Rescue Committee on its fine \nachievements and salute the Conrad N.

For \nthe past quarter century, this outstanding institution's commitment to \nacademic excellence and its constant celebration of diversity has \nenriched communities throughout Florida, the United States, and the \nentire world.\n  This milestone anniversary is particularly special to members of the \nGraham family. In 1943, State senator Ernest R. Graham--my father--\nintroduced legislation to establish a public university in south \nFlorida. Twenty-two years later, on May 26, 1965, the Florida State \nsenate unanimously passed legislation to fulfill his vision. On \nSeptember 19, 1972, Florida International University opened its doors \nfor the first time.\n  That would have been a proud day for my father. When I was growing up \nin the Miami area, he used to tell my brothers, sister, and I that the \nbest investment he ever made were his Dade County school taxes. He was \nproud, even enthusiastic, about paying those taxes because they enabled \nhis children to get a strong education in the Dade County public school \nsystem. If he were alive today, my father would agree that the time and \nenergy he put into laying the groundwork for a Florida International \nUniversity was yet another wise educational investment.\n  After only a quarter-century in existence, FIU has already gained \nacclaim as one of the most academically challenging and culturally \ndiverse universities in the entire United States. This distinction is a \ncredit to Florida International University's hard-working staff, \ndedicated faculty, bright student body, loyal alumni, and especially \nthe wise, dynamic leadership of FIU's four presidents--Charles Perry, \nHarold Crosby, Gregory Wolfe, and Modesto Maidique.\n  Each of these four outstanding individuals have contributed to \nFlorida International University's popularity, prestige, and \nreputation. When Charles Perry took the reins of FIU in 1969, a full 3 \nyears before the university opened, the campus was a run-down airport \ntower, old empty hangars, and 342 acres of land in west Dade County. \nHis boundless energy and zeal for establishing an outstanding public \nuniversity in south Florida led to the largest opening day enrollment \nof any university in American history. On September 19, 1972, nearly \n6,000 students started classes at Florida International University.\n  Presidents Harold Crosby and Gregory Wolfe continued the outstanding \nwork that president Perry had begun. President Crosby placed special \nemphasis on fulfilling the international vision espoused by FIU's \nfounders, hiring faculty members from a number of foreign countries and \nestablishing the multilingual, multicultural center. President Wolfe \nled Florida International through its critical transition from 2- to 4-\nyear university.\n  For the last 10 years, Florida International University has had the \ngood fortune to be guided by a dedicated, hard-working leader with an \neye for excellence, a passion for education, a keen insight into \nbringing town and gown together in support of academic success, and a \ndetermination to make FIU second to none in preparing students for the \nUnited States' future in an increasingly international economy and \nsociety.\n  It might have been destiny that brought President Modesto ``Mitch'' \nMaidique to Florida International University. He has helped to mold FIU \nin his own image--president Maidique's own background contains the same \nethnic and cultural diversity, financial savvy, and academic excellence \nthat have come to characterize south Florida's preeminent public \nuniversity.\n  The son of German-Czech emigrants who settled in Cuba during the \nearly 1800's, president Maidique was born in Havana in 1940. At the end \nof his formal education, he had earned three degrees from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology--bachelor of science, master of \nscience, doctor of electrical engineering--and another from the \nbusiness program at MIT's Cambridge neighbor, Harvard University. By \nthe time he assumed Florida International University's presidency in \n1986, he had added professor and distinguished businessman to his \nresume, teaching at prestigious institutions like Harvard and Stanford \nand lending his scientific knowledge and business know-how to several \nprominent firms.\n  Success followed president Maidique to Florida International. His \ndecade of leadership has spurred a number of impressive academic, \nfinancial, and cultural achievements. In academics, U.S. News & World \nReport consistently ranks Florida International University as one of \nthe top 150 national universities in the United States. Money magazine \nsays that it is among America's best public commuter universities.\n\n[[Page S10242]]\n\n  Perhaps Florida International University's greatest academic \nachievement is the fact that it so earnestly works to provide an \noutstanding education to all students, regardless of socioeconomic \nbackground. Thanks in part to low tuition rates, and to the work ethic \nand frugality of FIU administrators, faculty, and staff, its students \nare the fifth least indebted in the Nation. U.S. News & World Report \nrates it as one of the 10 best educational buys in the United States.\n  Finally, Florida International University is one of the most diverse \ncolleges in the United States that is increasingly benefited by its \nethnic diversity. For the last 25 years, it has been training young \nadults to live, work, and succeed in a world that speaks multiple \nlanguages and celebrates a variety of cultural achievements. More than \nhalf of its student body is Hispanic, and the university produces more \nHispanic graduates than any other university in America. All in all, it \nhas 70,000 alumni that represent all 50 States and more than 146 \ncountries.\n  Mr. President, I join with all Floridians in congratulating president \nModesto Maidique and every past and present member of the Florida \nInternational University community on its historic 25th anniversary. As \nthe university prepares to begin its next quarter-century, its abiding \ncommitment to academic excellence, affordability, and diversity is \nleading the United States into the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10241-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO LESLIE LORD AND SCOTT E. PHILLIPS\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the memories of two brave New Hampshire State Troopers killed in \nthe line of duty. Leslie Lord, 45, of Pittsburg and Scott E. Phillips, \n32, of Colebrook both bravely gave their lives trying to protect others \nand stop a man wielding an automatic rifle throughout the town of \nColebrook, New Hampshire on August 19th. Vickie Bunnell, a Colebrook \nDistrict Court judge, and Dennis Joos, editor of the Sentinel \nnewspaper, were also innocent victims in the shooting spree.\n  Leslie Lord was a 1974 graduate of Pittsburg High School and the next \nyear graduated in the 25th class at the New Hampshire Police Academy. \nLater, Lord became the chief of police in his hometown, until January \n16, 1987, when he resigned to become a state highway enforcement \nofficer. After working as a state highway truck inspector, Lord became \na state trooper for the Granite state in 1996.\n  Lord, who was not only a husband to Beverly, was also a father to two \nteenage boys, Cory and Shawn.\n  Scott Phillips was a 1984 graduate of White Mountain Regional High \nSchool in Whitefield and also a veteran of the U.S. Army. He served \nwith the military police, including a tour of duty in Panama. In 1990, \nas a member of the 90th class at the State Police Academy, Phillips \ngraduated an impressive 14th in a class of 38.\n  Phillips lived in Colebrook with his dear wife, Christine, their \nyoung son, Keenan, 2\\1/2\\, and their 1-year-old daughter, Clancy.\n  Both Troopers Lord and Phillips were known as dedicated, hardworking, \nand well-liked individuals by members of their respective communities.\n  Mr. President, the state of New Hampshire as well as the families of \nthese fine state troopers have suffered a tremendous loss. I would like \nto commend the efforts of both men, for their actions were nothing \nshort of heroic. I would also like to extend to the families of not \nonly Lord and Phillips, but also of Vickie Bunnell and Dennis Joos, my \ndeepest heartfelt sorrow and I pray that God watches over them. The \nmemories of Leslie Lord and Scott E. Phillips will live on in all of \nthe lives they have touched, for they were two remarkable and beloved \nindividuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10242-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     TRIBUTE TO CONRAD RICHARD GAGNON, JR. AND MAUREEN E. CONNELLY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor Conrad Richard Gagnon, Jr. and Maureen E. Connelly who were named \nfinalists in the second annual Samsung American Legion Scholarship \nProgram.\n  The scholarship program is funded by a $5 million endowment from the \nSamsung Group, an international company based in South Korea, and is \nadministered by the American Legion, the world's largest veterans \norganization. Only direct decedents of U.S. wartime veterans are \neligible for the scholarships.\n  Conrad and Maureen are among many other outstanding young Americans \nnamed as finalists to compete for one of ten college scholarships, each \nworth $20,000. The students were judged on the basis of their \ninvolvement in their school and community, and for their academic \nachievements.\n  Conrad is a native of Bedford, New Hampshire and is currently in his \nsenior year of high school. He is the son of Conrad and Gisele Gagnon, \nand has three bothers: Brian, Tim and Dan. His grandfather, Richard \nAdalard Gagnon, is a World War Two veteran.\n  Conrad has distinguished himself by achieving excellent grades, as \nwell as being involved in numerous and varied actives. He is an \nassociate editor of his school year book, a member of his school's math \nteam, and French club. He has been awarded the Boy Scouts Order of the \nArrow, and will travel to California and Japan this summer on the Sony \nStudent Abroad scholarship. Conrad also participates in community \nservice activities such as peer tutoring, food drives, and was involved \nin organizing an effort to place over one hundred of his peers in \nvolunteer positions. He would like to study engineering and law in \ncollege.\n  Maureen is a resident of Greenland, New Hampshire. She attends \nPortsmouth High School. She is the daughter of Mark and Marian \nConnelly, and she has a sister Carolyn and a brother Steven. Her \ngrandfather, Quentin Dante Halstead, served on active duty in World War \nTwo, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War.\n  Maureen has earned outstanding grades in honors and advance placement \nclasses. She is also very active on her school's field hockey team and \ntrack team. In addition she is a member of student government, serving \nin the capacity of treasure, as well as a member of the school \nnewspaper staff. Maureen volunteers her time to teach young children \nfield hockey, and she maintains a job as a lifeguard. She is a senior \nin high school and would like to be a doctor.\n  Young men and women such as Conrad and Maureen are a valuable asset \nto New Hampshire and the future of the United States. I congratulate \nthem on all their hard work and wish them success in their future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10242-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10242-S10243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF CHAD WARREN\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today in memory of \nChad Warren, a young, thoughtful and motivated man who recently passed \naway. Chad was only 25 years old when he unfortunately lost his life, \nonly months away from his 26th birthday. He is an example to us all \nbecause of his sheer dedication to his job and his unconditional love \nfor his family.\n  Working at the Goodhue Hawkins Navy Yard for the past six years, Chad \nbecame an invaluable employee and was also known as a friend to all. \nHard working and dedicated are only mere words to epitomize Chad as a \nperson. He started out as a boat washer and dockboy and soon progressed \nto a boat rigger and forklift operator He then achieved certification \nas a boat mechanic. Mr. President, I admire Chad not only for his \ndedication but also for the heart he put into his service at the Navy \nYard.\n  Prior to his employment, Chad was in Steve Durgan's Junior High \nGeography and U.S. History classes at Kingswood Regional Junior/Senior \nHigh School. Steve, a close personal friend of mine, described Chad as \nquiet, shy and thoughtful.\n  At such a young age, Chad was surrounded by many close, loving \npeople. Besides his mother, Linda Morrill of Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, \nand his father, Paul Warren of Ashburnham, Massachusetts, Chad leaves \nhis dear wife Sherri Warren and their young beloved children Corbin, 5 \nyears old, Shane, 8 years old, and Amber, 12 years old. Chad was \nblessed to have these valuable people in his life.\n  Mr. President, to lose any life is a sad event. But to lose a young \nlife, one full of energy, life, hopes and dreams is a tragedy. My heart \nand prayers go out\n\n[[Page S10243]]\n\nto Chad's family and especially his wife, Sherri, and their children, \nCorbin, Shane, and Amber. The loss of a husband and father is \nirreplaceable but Chad's memory will always live on in those who loved \nhim.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10242-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JEREMY CHARRON\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \nhonor the memory of a bright, young police officer wrongfully killed \nwhile on duty. Officer Jeremy Charron, 24, of Concord, New Hampshire, \nwas gunned down while checking on a report of a suspicious car during \nthe early morning hours of August 24th.\n  Officer Charron embodied all that is honorable about our state's law \nenforcement professionals. His selfless devotion to protecting the \nlives of innocent New Hampshire citizens enabled him to perform the \nheroic acts for which he will always be remembered. It is not often \nthat we see such strength, valor, and courage in a person. Jeremy \nCharron was unique and his family can be proud of his bravery in this \ntragedy.\n  Jeremy Charron was an All-American kid, a high school athlete, a \nnatural leader, president of his senior class at Hillsborough-Deering \nHigh School, a U.S. Marine and a police officer.\n  Fulfilling his life long dream, Charron became a police officer for \nthe town of Epsom, New Hampshire, in November, after completing the \nfull-time police academy training and becoming certified as a full-time \nofficer July 11.\n  Charron also served in the U.S. Marine Corps from July 1992 to June \n1996, when he received an honorable discharge.\n  Born to Robert and Frances Charron, Jeremy leaves brothers Rob, 28, \nand Andrew, 27, and sisters, Amanda, 21, and Bethany, 12, and his \nfinance, April LaRochelle.\n  Mr. President, the family of Jeremy Charron has suffered a great \nloss. The people of New Hampshire again have lost another fine officer. \nIt is a time for faith and a time for healing. My prayers and sympathy \ngo out to the families and friends of Officer Charron.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10243-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--CONFERENCE REPORT ACCOMPANYING H.R. 2378\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, tomorrow morning, the Senate will begin 60 \nminutes of debate on the Treasury-Postal Service appropriations \nconference report. Senators can, therefore, expect rollcall votes \nWednesday morning at approximately 11 a.m. or earlier if debate time is \nyielded back, and it could be yielded back, so the vote could be \nshortly before 11 o'clock. Following that vote, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the DC appropriations bill. It is the intention of the \nmajority leader to finish action on the final appropriations measure. \nIn observance of Rosh Hashanah, no recall call votes will occur after 1 \np.m. tomorrow. Therefore, all Senators' cooperation will be appreciated \nin allowing the Senate to conclude action on the pending bill. I should \nnote that we will continue to try to get an agreement to clear \nconference reports, and we probably will be in session until about 4 \no'clock tomorrow afternoon, but there will be no recorded votes after 1 \no'clock.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/30/senate-section/article/S10244-5", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10244]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW AT 10 A.M.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
