There will now be 15 minutes of debate prior \nto a vote on or in relation to the Gregg amendment No. 426.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Is it not time for the proponent \nand opponents to share some time equally in reference to the Gregg \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct. There are now 15 minutes \nequally divided on the Gregg amendment No. 426.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor to Senator Gregg.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I am not sure who rises in opposition to \nthis amendment. I understand there are some concerns that have been \nraised. Let me review the amendment so people understand what it does.\n  Essentially, this amendment creates a marketplace, creates \ncompetition, and it gives seniors the opportunity to go into the \nmarketplace, be thoughtful purchasers, and the result of being \nthoughtful purchasers is getting an actual return, a monetary return, \nfor being thoughtful purchasers.\n  What the amendment does is strike the language in the bill which says \nthat there can be no cash incentives tied to any sort of Choice plan. \nNow, in the original bill as it was presented by myself, the original \nChoice bill, the vast majority of which has been incorporated in this \nbill, we had a section which said that if a senior was able to purchase \na plan at less dollars, then the senior would be allowed to keep 75 \npercent of the savings, and 25 percent of the savings would go into the \npart A trust fund. Under the bill as it is presently structured, the \npractical effect was it created more marketplace forces. It meant \nseniors would be more thoughtful purchasers of health care. This is \nimportant.\n  Second, it meant that the health care provider groups like HMO's, \nPPO's and the PSO's who are now being empowered to compete for senior \ndollars, those groups would have a reason to deliver the same benefit \nstructure as\n\n[[Page S6106]]\n\nMedicare gives today at the same quality but deliver it at less cost. \nIt is called capitalism. It is called a marketplace force. It is what \nwe are trying to put in place to try to control the cost of health care \nand Medicare, and it is what is working in the private sector.\n  Under the bill as it is presently structured, that opportunity would \nbe eliminated. Now, we are not suggesting that opportunity has to be \npursued. We are just saying let's leave open that opportunity under \nHCFA's guidance, and by the way, if it was determined this might be a \nway to create better competition and better health care delivery, it \nwould be available.\n  Now, I cannot speak for the opposition, but what I have heard from \nthe opposition is that there is a feeling that this cash rebate may in \nsome way affect the Treasury. Well, it does not. Under the present law \nas it is structured in this bill, if there is no cash rebate, the only \nbeneficiaries of more efficiency are the provider groups. They get to \nkeep the money. They get to keep the money. They do not rebate it to \nthe seniors. They get to keep it, to quote Jerry McGuire.\n  Then I heard another comment, ``Basically what we want to do is \nencourage the provider groups to supply more benefits, not to supply a \nfinancial rebate to senior citizens.'' I think that makes sense. I \nthink that should be an option. I think provider groups like PPO's that \ncan deliver the services for less might want to throw in eyeglass care, \nmight want to throw in prescription care. I think it is a good public \npolicy decision to encourage that. But at the same time I bet you there \nare some provider groups today, because we pay so much in insurance for \nMedicare, who could pay the cost of eyeglass care and some percentage \nof prescription drug care and still be delivering that service for \nconsiderably less than what the basic premium is today that we pay in \nMedicare. Who is going to keep that difference? The provider groups. \nThey will keep it in profit.\n  Now, I do find it ironic that people would oppose the concept that we \nwant to open it up to competition in a way that allows the senior \ncitizen to benefit from the cost savings, by putting some pressure on \nthose provider groups to have to say, ``We are going to make $100 extra \non this contract. Maybe we better return $50 to the senior citizen \nbecause, if we do not, our competitor down the street will make that \n$100 and they will return that $50 and they will get this client.''\n  Right now this is an issue. I understand there are some undercurrents \nof opposition to this. I am appreciative of that. The fact is that this \nis an attempt to open the marketplace to more competition and create \nmore cost-conscious purchasers and buyers, and as a result I think it \nis a good approach. It does not demand that that occur. It does not \neven allow that to occur in the first instance. It simply makes that \nadditional avenue of competition available by giving HCFA the authority \nto do it rather than banning HCFA from having the authority to do it.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey controls 7\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will yield myself such time as \nneeded to respond with my opposition to the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire and rise in support of the provision in the \nreconciliation package that was developed by Senator Roth and Senator \nMoynihan and other members of the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, the reconciliation bill establishes a new program \nknown as Medicare Choice, which will give Medicare beneficiaries more \noptions for the type of health care that they will receive in the \nprogram. Seniors will be able to choose from HMO's, PPO's, and medical \nsavings accounts, among several other options. The committee's proposal \nis intended to increase Choice for seniors. At the same time, it is \nmeant to avoid the risk that the Medicare Program would move toward a \ntwo-tiered or multitiered system in which some seniors, especially the \nhealthier and wealthier, enjoy benefits not available to the others.\n  Under the committee-reported bill, providers of different services \nare paid a set amount. They then can compete for the consumers based on \nthe quality and types of benefits they provide. If, for example, one \nHMO can operate more efficiently, it can plow the resulting savings \ninto providing services that other less-efficient HMO's could not. This \ntype of system is intended to ensure that seniors get the best quality \ncare for each Federal dollar that gets spent. I think that makes sense.\n  The Finance Committee also wanted to avoid a situation in which \nproviders limit their benefit package to attract those who are healthy \nand who therefore could take advantage of a cheaper plan that offers \nfewer benefits. This could ultimately lead to a Medicare system that \nsegregates the healthy from the ill and that forces sicker people to \npay more to get the health care they need.\n  Mr. President, I am going to stick with the Finance Committee's \nproposal on this. Let's give seniors more choice but let's make sure \nthat the choices offer the type of quality health care they need and \ndeserve.\n  When I think of plans that may offer premiums--maybe they offer \ntheater tickets or baseball games or what have you--to seduce or induce \npeople to go their way, I think that is a terrible idea. It can provide \na large provider with a monopoly of opportunities. ``Spend your money \nnow, you will get it back.'' You will have these people locked into \nyour service, so spend it up front. It is a calculated marketing cost. \nFrankly, I hate to see our senior citizens get caught up in a scheme \nlike that.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will be able to muster the support that is \nrequired here for the Finance Committee. Once again, this is now a new \nproposal. It alters the bill as originally developed. I do not think we \nought to be doing it at this time.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from New Jersey, \nbut they are inaccurate. This does not create a two-tier system.\n  Under the law, the basic benefits package of the Medicare system has \nto be supplied by all providers. Therefore, any provider that comes \nforward and produces a less costly system is going to be producing a \nsystem that still meets the basic benefits package of the Medicare \nsystem. The added benefits might be eyeglasses or prescription drugs, \nbut those are benefits which are not presently covered by Medicare \nanyway. So there is no opportunity for a two-tiered system.\n  What the Senator from New Jersey said that was accurate is that \nefficient suppliers of health care will end up creating a savings. What \nI am pointing out is that savings then flows to the supplier of the \nhealth care, the HMO or the PPO. You are basically underwriting the big \nhealth care companies at the disadvantage of seniors because seniors \nget none of that savings unless there is a benefit added that they may \nnot want. They may not want eyeglasses. They may not want prescription \ndrugs. They may have that under another system. Why not make this \noption available?\n  However, I have been asked by the chairman of the committee to \nwithdraw the amendment at this time. I have great respect for the \nchairman of the committee and will acquiesce to his request. I \nunderstand his concern. I believe this is bad policy as it is presently \nstructured. It is not in the House bill, and I hope it will be \nstraightened out in Congress because I think we ought to give seniors \nthis chance.\n  I ask unanimous consent to vitiate the yeas and nays and withdraw the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 426) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I will be brief. I want to compliment my \ncolleague from New Hampshire for offering this amendment.\n  He mentioned this prohibition is not in the House bill. I hope to \nhave something to do with the conference. I think he has brought out a \nvery good point. We should allow some of these savings to go to the \nparticipants. So I appreciate his examination of the bill. That fact \nproves he has done his homework. I, for one, think he has pointed out a \ngood option that we should allow to be available. I appreciate my \ncolleague's attention in this matter. I will be happy to work with him \nto see if we can't come up with a good provision in conference.\n\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n[[Page S6107]]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I, too, want to join the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma in thanking our friend from New Hampshire and \nwithdrawing the amendment. I think he has articulated the reason for \nthe change. I think there is considerable merit to the idea, but I do \nappreciate the fact that he has withdrawn the amendment. I don't think \nit is appropriate at this time. We look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I, too, want to join in saying to the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire that I saw this as a Choice \nproposal, an expansion of Choice. It wasn't a mandate. I thought it was \na pretty good thing that we keep as much choice and potential for \nchoice in the Medicare reform. I am sure this will be revisited at some \npoint.\n  As the manager for the majority, I would like to talk a little bit \nwith the Senate about where we are. Could I inquire, none of the \namendments are automatically up at this point, are they? Am I mistaken \non that? Aren't they subject to a management decision on which ones \ncome next?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question would recur on No. 429, the \nKennedy-Wellstone amendment to S. 947.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair. Might I then enquire, under the \nordinary rules of amendments, how much time is left on the Kennedy-\nWellstone amendment, if it were all to be used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will check on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is fine. Is there any reason we should not go to \nthe Kennedy-Wellstone amendment? I am sure Senator Roth has a \nsubstantial amount of time on the amendment. I want to yield the entire \ntime in opposition to the amendment to the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee. I may need a few minutes later. I will yield the \nSenator the time that is left. Can the Senator manage that?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes, I can manage that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To answer the question of the Senator from New \nMexico as to the time remaining on the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment, \nSenator Kennedy has 15 minutes and the Senator from New Mexico has 45 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will yield the 45 minutes to Senator Roth.\n  Let me indicate to the Senate, so there won't be any \nmisunderstanding, that what I am trying to do is get time used up or \nget time agreements. We don't intend to vote on the Kennedy-Wellstone \namendment until early in the afternoon. So we can finish the debate and \ngo to another one. I wanted to indicate that to the Senate at this \npoint.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I might just add a note here for \nall of our colleagues who are interested in amendments, or talking on \nthe bill. Time is flying and we will be finished at about 7:30 tonight, \nI think it is, with no more time left. And then should any amendments \nbe offered, they will be offered without debate or discussion and just \nvoted upon.\n  So I say to all of our colleagues within earshot, or through the \nstaff, if you have amendments, you better get them here because pretty \nsoon the time will have expired and you won't have an opportunity to do \nso.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized for 45 \nminutes.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 429\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, the Kennedy amendment would strike the $5 \ncoinsurance payment, and I think that would be a mistake. Let me start \nout by pointing out that home health care has exploded in cost over the \nrecent years. It has been a serious problem that this particular aspect \nof Medicare has become extraordinarily expensive.\n  As I said yesterday, according to the Prospective Payment Assessment \nCommission, which is commonly called PROPAC, Medicare spending on home \nhealth services was only 1 percent of Medicare spending in 1968. By \n1996, Medicare spending on home health care had increased to 14 percent \nof Medicare part A spending. In other words, it had gone from 1 percent \nto 14 percent. This is an increase that cannot be permitted in a \nprogram that is in financial difficulty.\n  As we all know, Medicare is an extraordinarily successful program in \nproviding health care to senior citizens. But we do face a serious \nproblem with respect both to part A and part B if we do not bring the \ncost of these programs under control. As is well understood, part A \nwill be in bankruptcy by 2001. If we don't correct it, it will be in \ndebt to the tune of one-half trillion dollars by 2007. And we face the \nsame kind of serious problems with part B. Part B--it is predicted--\nwill increase in cost roughly 8 percent a year in the coming year. So \nwe have to bring these costs under control, and that is what we are \nseeking to do.\n\n  As I said, home health care has exploded in cost. Just let me point \nout what has happened to the cost of this part of the program in the \nlast several years. From 1989 to 1990, the cost went up 53 percent--in \n1 year, the cost of home health care went up 53 percent. The pattern \nhas been a little better since then. In 1990-91, it went up 44 percent; \nin 1991-92, 40 percent; in 1992-93, 30 percent; in 1993-94, it went up \n30 percent; and in 1994-95, it went up 19 percent.\n  Now, the reason home health care has exploded is because there are no \nadequate controls. For example, there has been a major increase in the \nnumber of beneficiaries using home health care. There has been an \nincrease in the number of visits per beneficiary. I must also say that \nthere has been a tremendous increase in the number of agencies \nproviding home health care, and the Medicare payment system does not \ncontrol the utilization of home care.\n  So that is the nub of the problem. There is no reason for the \nbeneficiaries to be concerned as to how they utilize this program \nbecause there are no copayments in the part B program, as there are in \nothers. Let me point out that the cost growth of home care, due to the \nincrease in visits per beneficiary, has indeed been very substantial. \nIn 1983, 45 Medicare enrollees--let me put it this way. There were 45 \nMedicare enrollees per thousand that used this program, an average \nannual of 28 visits. This was in 1983. In 1995, the number of Medicare \nenrollees per thousand jumped to 97--that is, from 45 to 97--and they \nused this program for an annual of 70 visits. That is 70 visits as \ncompared with 28 visits in 1983.\n  So the question is, Why has the utilization of Medicare's home health \nbenefit grown so rapidly? Essentially, there are two factors explaining \nthe growth. First, the home health benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, \nfor all practical purposes, have been unlimited since 1980. Prior to \n1980, home health benefits were limited to 100 visits per beneficiary \nper year following a hospitalization. But in 1989, as a result of an \nagreement reached in a class action suit, Dougan versus Bowen, \nvirtually all regulatory limitations on coverage were eliminated. And \neven today, based on Dougan, a beneficiary only needs to be homebound \nand under the supervision of a physician in order to receive home \nhealth care.\n  Now, the cost growth in home care is partly due to the Medicare cost-\nbased payment system. Medicare pays home care companies the cost of \neach home care visit up to a per visit cost limit. Medicare does not \nlimit the total number of home care visits. And the cost results are \npredictable. There is a great incentive for agencies to get into the \nbusiness. That is one of the reasons we see the explosion of the number \nof agencies now in the home health care business.\n\n  Medicare payments per visit are estimated to have increased by 1.6 \npercent from 1993 and 1994, and the total number of Medicaid certified \nhome health care agencies grew in 1991-95 by 52 percent from 5,949 \nagencies in 1991 to a total of 9,040 in 1995.\n  So, Mr. President, this is the reason it was felt necessary that \nthere be a copayment on the part of the beneficiary so that there is \nmore prudent use of this care than has taken place in recent years.\n  Beginning in 1998, financing for the home health benefits will begin \nto be transferred from the part A to the part B trust fund. This will \nestablish 100 visits--after the hospital stay--for home health benefits \nunder part A with all other visits considered part of a new part B home \nhealth benefit. Consistent with Medicare's treatment of other part B \nservices, the mark establishes cost-sharing for part B home health\n\n[[Page S6108]]\n\nservice at $5 per visit billable on a monthly basis, and capped at an \namount equal to the annual hospital deductible.\n  I point out to my colleagues that creating this copayment is \nconsistent with the way we handle part B. As a general rule, there is \ncopayment of roughly 20 percent for services under part B. Five dollars \nper visit is substantially less than 20 percent. But it means that as \nbeneficiaries utilize home health care they are going to be more \ncareful in its utilization.\n  Beneficiaries, I point out with respect to those who are under 100 \npercent of Federal poverty, will not have to pay this $5 copayment fee. \nThey will not have to pay this copayment fee because it will be covered \nby Medicaid. Our Medicaid Program has been structured to protect the \npoor and impoverished. And under that program he or she who is under \n100 percent of Federal poverty will be covered by Medicaid. So there \nwill be no payment of the $5 fee by those who are impoverished under \nFederal standards.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for unlimited floor privileges \nfor the duration of S. 947 for the following members of the Senate \nFinance Committee staff:\n  Julie James, Gioia Bonmartini, Dennis Smith, Deloris Spitznagel, and \nAlexander Vachon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as I said, the purpose of the $5 copayment \nfee is to bring some balance into this program.\n  I obviously cannot support the Kennedy amendment. I do not believe \nthat the home health care copayment is a barrier to care nor that it is \nunreasonable.\n  As I have already pointed out, from 1988 to 1996, spending on home \nhealth care grew an average of 37 percent per year. That is a growth \nthat cannot be sustained if we are going to maintain Medicare as a \nprogram not only for those on it now but for the future. Medicare is \ngoing bankrupt. And this rate of growth is without question \nunsustainable. I cannot say too loud nor too clear that we need to \nassure that Medicare is preserved and protected. It is our \nresponsibility to make certain that costs do not run out of control.\n  Under current law, all Medicare benefits, except for home health and \nlaboratory services, are subject to some form of beneficiary cost-\nsharing. Let me reemphasize that. Under current law, all Medicare \nbenefits, except home health and laboratory services, are subject to \nsome form of beneficiary cost-sharing.\n  The $5 home health copay will have beneficiary share--in some degree, \nfinancial responsibility for services with the program. Five dollars is \nnot an unreasonable amount to ask beneficiaries to pay for a visit.\n  The Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, which advises Congress \non Medicare policy, supports--I underscore the word ``supports''--a \nmodest beneficiary copay subject to an annual limit. That is exactly \nwhat this bill proposes to do.\n  I also point out that a report recently issued by the Commonwealth \nFund supports the idea of a $5 copay. The report claims there is a \nsensible approach--a sensible approach which would make beneficiaries \nsensitive to use but not form a barrier to care. That is exactly what \nwe want. We want this program to be used on a prudent basis; a sensible \nbasis. But, of course, we do not want it to be a barrier to those who \nneed this form of care.\n  As I have already indicated, those who cannot afford the $5 copay, \nthose who are under 100 percent of Federal poverty, will be covered by \nMedicaid. They will not have to pay the $5 copay. Medicaid will pay it.\n  So they are protected. Beneficiaries will not have to pay any copay \nfor the first 100 home health cares after a hospital stay. Only those \nvisits in excess of 100, or that do not follow a hospitalization, will \nhave a copay. And the amount is limited every year to the hospital \ndeductible, which is what beneficiaries who have home health after a \nhospital stay would have to pay the hospital.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a modest proposal where according to the \nCongressional Budget Office only about one-third of home health users--\nthat is about 1.2 million beneficiaries--are likely to be subject to \nmore than $100 in copays in a year. And only about 11 percent of home \nhealth users--that is roughly 380,000 beneficiaries--are likely to \nreach the annual cap.\n  The copay for home health is not an untested idea. Until 1972, \nMedicare required a 20-percent copay for all part B home health visits. \nDuring health care reform, President Clinton's Health Security Act \nincluded a 20-percent copay on home health care.\n  So the proposal that we have in the legislation before us is far more \nmodest.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I understand we have 15 minutes. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Fourteen minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think there are some important points \nto make in response to the presentation of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  The first point to be made is that $5 billion that are going to be \ncollected from our senior citizens was never considered to be an \nessential part of the balanced budget program. When the Senate voted \nfor a balanced budget, there was no comment that we were going to have \nto raise the copays for our elderly citizens for nursing home care.\n  So this is something that has just been added by the Finance \nCommittee in order, as they say, to discourage the utilization of home \nhealth care services. That is first.\n  So this is not part of the whole budget agreement. It was a decision \nby the Finance Committee to pick up $5 billion that will be paid by the \nfrailest elderly citizens of this country, most of them between 75 and \n80 years old, and primarily individuals that are on about $11,000 or \n$12,000 income, and primarily women. That is the profile of those that \nwill be affected by this increase in the copay. That is first.\n  Second, as anyone who has ever gone through and reviewed, or had \nhearings on overutilization, they will find out that it isn't the \npatient that is overutilizing the system.\n  Of the groups in our society, by and large, if it is the patients \nthat are overutilizing the system, it is the more affluent. They have \nthe time to go down and overutilize the system. But, by and large, when \nyou are talking about the frail elderly, it is very difficult for them \nto get out of their particular home, if they are in this situation, and \nutilize the systems. And so they are the ones who do not. But it is the \ndoctors who are the ones that are prescribing these services. It is the \ndoctors who are saying these home services are necessary. It is not \njust the elderly saying I want the services. It is the doctors who are \nsaying these are important.\n  Now, we had a wonderful citizen yesterday from our neighboring area \nof Maryland, Marian, who makes about $7,600 a year. She said, I get \nhome health services three times a week. It is going to be $15 a week, \nand I am going to run up against the limit at the end of the year. Are \nwe in the Senate going to say that Marian should not be washed during \nthe course of the week? She will have to reduce it to one treatment \nover the course of the week? Are we going to here say that we have to \nadd the $5 billion that is going to be used for tax cuts for the \nwealthiest individuals? Are we going to say to that elderly person, you \nare not going to get washed; you are not going to be able to have your \nlegs stretched; you are not going to be able, because you are too old \nand have a hip problem, to be able to wash your feet?\n  That is what we are talking about here. These are the kinds of \nservices that are being provided.\n  Now, I was here in 1972. It was the judgment of the Congress of the \nUnited States and the administration that we wanted to encourage home \nhealth services, to try and keep people in their homes if they wanted \nto stay there. They have maybe an option to go to a nursing home, but \nif they want to stay in their homes with their friends in a \nneighborhood and a community, they ought to have the opportunity and \nthe\n\n[[Page S6109]]\n\nability to do so. And so it was the judgment at that time, in order to \nencourage home services that provide actual savings in the total health \nexpenditures, that we ought to do so. That is the basis for it.\n  Now, that is what we are running up against, Mr. President, and I am \nreally surprised that the Finance Committee would take this step, \nparticularly when there are other steps that are included in this \nlegislation to restrain the doctors from prescribing this. Do we \nunderstand? There are already provisions in the legislation that we are \nconsidering in the Finance Committee to discourage the doctors from \nprescribing this. But, no, the Finance Committee said, that isn't \nenough; we are going to discourage the doctors from sending you home, \nbut if you get home or are going to be home, then you are going to pay \nthat 5 extra dollars.\n  We have the interim payment system, which is an agency-specific per \ncapita cap, which before was limitless. Now it is limited. You have \nalready put that in, Senators of the Finance Committee, which is going \nto be a further restraint. And that is to discourage the growth in the \nutilization of services. And you have a lump-sum percentage of payment \nsystems like the hospitals which will be effective in 1999 that is \ngoing to further discourage this.\n  Our point is we have already written into the Finance Committee the \ntargeting, where the target ought to be, and that is with doctors to \nprovide some limitation on home health services. We are not even in the \nposition of having tried those provisions. No, we are already saying we \nare going to also put the burden on the senior citizens who are \nreceiving the home health care services. It makes no sense. It is \ngrossly unfair. It is bad health policy. There is absolutely no reason \nin our attempt to achieve the balanced budget that we ought to be \ntaking it out on the most frail individuals who are receiving, under \nMedicare, home health care services, Mr. President. So I hope that this \nmeasure would be struck.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am very proud to join Senator \nKennedy's effort. I would say to my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle that this amendment is a perfect example of where the rubber \nmeets the road. We are not now talking about adding and subtracting \nnumbers. We are not talking about statistics in the abstract. We are \ntalking about the effect of what we do on people's lives. We are \ntalking about how decisions we make can crucially affect the quality or \nlack of quality of lives of people all across our country--in \nMinnesota, Massachusetts, Delaware, Oklahoma, Tennessee, you name it.\n  Mr. President, I just want to take on some of the arguments that have \nbeen made about why we need to go forward with this $5 copay on the \nhome-based health care.\n  First of all, I have heard it argued here that $5 is not that much. \nBut we cannot make those arguments, in all due respect. There is a huge \ndifference between our salaries and what we can afford and what an \nelderly person can afford.\n  Now, when the argument is made, ``But, Senators, we have protection \nfor those who are officially defined as poor,'' do you know where that \ndefinition comes from? Mollie Orshansky in 1963, Social Security, a \nminimal definition--a minimal definition. So now we are saying that a \nsingle elderly woman 80 years of age, who makes over $7,000 a year, she \nis not officially defined as poor, but we are going to charge her $5 \nevery time for a home-based health care visit. That is outrageous. That \nis outrageous.\n  So, first of all, please, do not have any illusions, colleagues, that \nbecause we say the poor are taken care of, we really are taking care of \nvulnerable elderly people, because if you are a single person, single \nwoman living at home and you are over the poverty level income--maybe \nyou make $9,000 a year--you do not have any protection at all.\n  Now, is there any Senator here, Democrat or Republican, who believes \nthat a single woman living at home making $9,000, $9,500 a year can \nafford to pay $5 for each home health care visit?\n  As to the expansion of this, in all due respect, I thought that what \nwe were trying to do here, albeit we have not done it nearly as well as \nwe should, is to make sure that as many elderly people as possible can \nlive at home in as near normal circumstances as possible with dignity. \nWe want to encourage people to be able to live at home. When one of our \nparents or one of our grandparents needs to have a home health visit \nonce or twice or three times a week in order to stay at home and be \nindependent and not have to be institutionalized, we should applaud \nthat. It should not be surprising that this is more a part of what we \ndo by way of investment in resources because more and more of the \npeople in our country are living to be over 65 and 85. But if we want \npeople to be able to stay at home and live with dignity, and we do not \nwant people to be institutionalized, and we do not want to take away a \nbenefit that is so important to vulnerable elderly people, even if they \nare over the poverty level income, which is defined in such a minimal \nway, we ought to for certain support this amendment.\n  This amendment that Senator Kennedy and I have introduced is all \nabout connecting this debate to people. This proposal in the Finance \nCommittee of a $5 charge for every single home-based health care visit \nand support for elderly people is profoundly mistaken. Mr. President, \nlet me repeat that. It is profoundly mistaken. Please, colleagues, \nadmit to the fact that we may have made a mistake here and that we can \ndo better for elderly people. Therefore, I hope that we get a huge vote \nfor this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. What do we have, 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I will take a moment to include in the Record a letter \nfrom former Senator Frank Moss from the State of Utah, and I will just \nread the relevant sections of it.\n\n       Dear Senator Kennedy.\n       I was the author in 1965 of the amendment which included \n     home health care coverage under Medicare. Congressman Claude \n     Pepper introduced the legislation in the House. Our original \n     legislation required seniors to pay some portion of their \n     home health care costs out of pocket. However, the studies \n     done by the Senate Committee on Aging and the General \n     Accounting Office persuaded me in 1972 to work with Senator \n     Muskie and Senator Nelson to delete the copayment provision. \n     Our studies clearly indicated that copayments--\n\n  Now listen to this--\n\n     cost Medicare more to collect in administrative costs than \n     they saved in the program; 2. Denied access to care and fell \n     more heavily on those who could least afford it; 3. Pushed \n     families into poverty and loved ones unnecessarily into \n     institutions, resulting in increased costs to the States \n     and Federal Government through the Medicaid Programs; and, \n     4, increased costs to Medicare because people put off care \n     until they had to be hospitalized. I am writing to urge \n     you not to repeat the mistakes that we made in the past.\n\n  Now, what has escaped in this debate, Mr. President, is the estimated \nbudgetary impacts of this particular provision. Now, listen to this, \nour colleagues who are concerned about unfunded mandates. The chairman \nof the Finance Committee has pointed out it hits the very, very poor, \nfrail elderly; those who qualify for Medicaid will be able to receive \nit and the States will pick it up. True. That is true. And that amount \nwill be $700 million. We are putting an unfunded mandate on the States \nto pick up the costs of this copayment, and it is going to cost the \nStates $700 million. And in terms of the Federal Government, because we \nparticipate in the Medicaid Program, $900 million.\n  That is what it is going to be just under Medicaid. So on the one \nhand, supposedly we are taking in the $5 billion. On the other hand, \nyou are losing, effectively, $1.6 billion that the States and the \nFederal Government are providing.\n  Now, Mr. President, this makes absolutely no sense. They had the \nextensive hearings by the committee in charge, the Aging Committee, and \nyou could have those same hearings today and you would find exactly the \nsame results, exactly the same results. It unfairly falls on the frail \nelderly, and it is going to discourage people from using\n\n[[Page S6110]]\n\nhome health care services and go into institutions and Medicaid \neventually ending up paying more and people will delay getting the kind \nof care they need.\n  Why shouldn't we first try to find out about the provisions that have \nbeen included by the Finance Committee which are going to provide for \nthe providers the kind of prospective budgeting which we are using \ntoday for the hospitals. That is going to discourage this service. Why \nare we putting an additional burden that was never part of the \nagreement on the frailest of our society--$5 billion to use for tax \ncuts, tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals.\n  It is absolutely outrageous, Mr. President, that in the course of \nthis week, we will be out here on Thursday or Friday providing those \nkinds of tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and the people who \nwill be paying for them are going to be the seniors, the frailest, the \nelderly, the widowed individuals in our society. It is bad health \npolicy. It is unfair. And it is just a continuation evidently of the \nkinds of assaults that we have seen on the Medicare system. We find the \nFinance Committee refusing to fund the $1.5 billion that they had \nagreed would be funded and putting on $5 billion that was never \nindicated in terms of the balanced budget. That is wrong, Mr. \nPresident, and every senior knows it. Every senior will know about \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  There are 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I withhold that time.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. First, I wish to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware controls time. Who \nyields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield such time as is required by the Senator from \nOklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague from Delaware. I also want to \ncompliment him for his stewardship as chairman of the Finance Committee \non this bill.\n  First, let me just say a couple of things about the comments Senator \nKennedy made. ``We are cutting Medicare so we can pay for tax cuts for \nwealthy people.'' I heard that comment made 2 years ago. I heard it a \nlot. ``They are gutting Medicare so they can pay for tax cuts for \nwealthy people.''\n  Just an interesting footnote, the amount of expenditures, the \noutlays, what we are going to spend on Medicare for this 5 years that \nare covered by this bill is $1.248 trillion. The amount of outlays that \nwe had in the bill 2 years ago that the President vetoed and said it \nwas gutting, decimating Medicare, was $1.247 trillion--a one-billion-\ndollar difference. So the outlays are the same.\n  Did we make this change, this change dealing with home health care, \nso we could pay for tax cuts? The answer is absolutely no. What we did, \nin a bipartisan fashion, I think without dissent in the Finance \nCommittee, in putting in the $5 copay on home health care, is recognize \nthat we need to make some policy changes in home health care. This \nprogram is exploding in cost, and the reason why is quite obvious, if \nyou look at. It is a program that is paid for 100 percent by the \nFederal Government. There is no copay by the beneficiary; the \nbeneficiary does not pay a dime. There is no payment by the State. \nThere is no copayment by anybody. It is Uncle Sam writing a check for \n100 percent of the cost. There is no limit on the number of visits; you \ncan have one visit, you can have 300 visits. So it is a program, by its \nvery design, if Uncle Sam is going to pay for it all, obviously it is \ngoing to explode in costs, and that is exactly what has happened.\n  Just looking at this program, in 1990 this program cost $4 billion. \nIn 1995, 5 years later, it cost $16 billion. It is projected next year \nto cost $21.1 billion. It has growth rates--in the year of 1989 this \ngrew almost 24 percent; the next year, 53 percent; the next year, 43 \npercent; 1992, 41 percent; in 1993, 30 percent; in 1994, 30 percent; in \n1995, 19.4 percent. This is a program that is exploding in cost.\n  The Finance Committee realizes this. Anybody who has looked at the \nfacts realizes this and knows we need to change it. So the change, a \nvery modest change, I might say, is we say the beneficiaries would have \na $5 copay. That is not a lot on visits that may well cost $70 or $80, \nbut at least it is a start. And it might have some marginal impact on \nbehavior. Will it cost the lowest of our citizens as alleged by Senator \nKennedy and others? I doubt it, because in most cases they have Medigap \npolicies or it is picked up by Medicaid. So in some cases those people \nwill have coverage. But doesn't the policy of having some copay make \nsense? This Congress had the courage to stand up and say we should have \na copay on veterans for prescription drugs of $2. Some people screamed \nand said, ``Wait a minute, this is a breaking of a contract,'' and so \non, but we realized that prescription drugs for non-service-connected \nveterans was exploding in cost. So we stepped forward very marginally \nand set a $2 copay on prescription drugs, and it did change behavior \nsomewhat. This will change behavior somewhat.\n  I urge my colleagues to read an article on the front page of the Wall \nStreet Journal about the explosion of this program. They have home \nhealth care providers now, some of which are starting new companies--\nthey had no experience whatsoever--out of mobile homes. If you look at \nthe number of providers, in 1991 there were a little less than 6,000 \nproviders; in 1995, over 9,000 providers. Look at the number of \nbeneficiaries, the total payment costs, the number of visits--this is a \nprogram that is truly exploding in cost.\n  This was done in the Finance Committee, not so there could be greater \ntax cuts. As a matter of fact, I might mention--this is a little sore \nspot with me. The budget agreement said we would have $85 billion in \nnet tax cuts. We did not end up with $85 billion; we ended up with $77 \nbillion. So we did not even come up with the total amount of net tax \ncuts that the budget agreement, President Clinton and the leadership, \nagreed upon. So that argument, ``They did this so they could have more \ntax cuts'', is total hogwash. This was done in order to try to reform a \nprogram that is growing way out of control, and it was done in a \nbipartisan fashion. I hope we will continue to have bipartisan support. \nWe need to have bipartisan support.\n\n  I will make a couple of other comments. One of the things that was \ndone in the budget agreement I do not agree with. It said let's \ntransfer home health care away from part A into part B, to make part A \nlook solvent. That is a shell game. I do not want to have my \nfingerprints on it. It is in this deal. I don't have the votes to \nchange that. But that bothers me. It doesn't keep part A solvent. Well, \nI guess theoretically it does. We could keep part A solvent if we said \nwe will move all the expensive hospitals, from Tennessee west, take \nthem out, move them out of part A and then we'll keep part A solvent. \nThat's a little bit of a shell game.\n  This is one little reform on the fastest growing portion in Medicare \nthat is real reform. It was done in a bipartisan fashion because we \nknow we need to do something to constrain these costs. You cannot have \na program that has total, 100 percent, Federal funding, has no State \nmatch, no participant match whatsoever, and no limit on the number of \nvisits and say we hope we can constrain its costs.\n  So I think this is a serious vote. I urge my colleagues to vote \nagainst the Kennedy-Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I know the Senator----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Not on my time, on my colleague's time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On the bill's time.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 20 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts \noff the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Briefly, I am wondering, as a Senator who has been \nstrongly against unfunded mandates, with the recognition here it is \ngoing to cost the States some $700 million to pick up the Medicaid \nportion and we are not providing that to the States, how the Senator \njustifies that requirement that we are placing on the States to carry \nthis proposal through?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to respond to my colleague. I think what \nwe\n\n[[Page S6111]]\n\nhave right now is a program that is 100 percent Federal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. On Medicaid--excuse me. The position of the chairman of \nthe committee is that, for those who are going to fall into Medicaid, \nthe State is going to pick up that premium and it is going to, \naccording to the CBO, amount to some $700 million on the States. We are \nnot providing that additional help to the States.\n  I am asking the Senator how he justifies that particular unfunded \nmandate? We heard a lot about unfunded mandates, and I want to know how \nthe Senator responds to that.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to. I think if my colleague had listened \nto my speech, I mentioned this home health program, which is currently \n100 percent Federal with no State match. Right now the States are not \npaying anything. So to have this in Medicaid, where Medicaid will pick \nup for lower-income beneficiaries a small portion of that--I might \nmention the Federal Government picking up, in most cases, 60 percent, \nin some cases 70 percent--is not the problem.\n  What we are asking to do, what you are talking about, we are saying, \n``Beneficiaries pay $5; pay $5 out of a total cost of a $70 visit.'' So \nthe Federal Government is paying 65 percent, and the individual would \npick up $5, and in some low-income cases, for some low-income \nindividuals, the State might pick up 30 percent, or in some cases 40 \npercent, in some States maybe 50 percent of that share.\n  To me that does not seem unreasonable.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. This is the only point I make. That amounts to $700 \nmillion for the States. That amounts to a $700 million unfunded \nmandate; $700 million unfunded mandate to the States, according to the \nCBO.\n  I have listened to the Senator very eloquently talk about unfunded \nmandates, and here we are finding, according to the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, that for individuals who are going to fall below the \npoverty line, the State is going to pick that premium up, and that, \naccording to CBO, amounts to $700 million. It will amount to $900 \nmillion by the Federal Government but $700 million to the States. I am \njust interested in listening to the Senator, who speaks about unfunded \nmandates and about the Federal Government imposing requirements on the \nStates, here we have a beauty, $700 million you are putting on the \nStates. That is according to CBO, because that is going to be the cost, \nover 5 years, for them to pick up the $5 copay.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. If I understood the Senator's statement, the $700 \nmillion the States would have to pick up, this is a program that will \ncost $121 billion next year for the Federal Government and that is \ngrowing at an unbelievable, unsustainable rate. So you are talking \nabout a program over the next 5 years that is going to be well over \n$100 billion, and we are asking beneficiaries to pay $5, and in some \ncases the States may pick up a portion of that, maybe $700 million out \nof a total cost of over $100 billion. I don't find that unreasonable in \nany way.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator; $700 million. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield to the Senator from Texas such time as he may \nrequire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I think that with all of the loud talking \nand discussion of subsidiary issues, people have by now forgotten what \nthis whole issue is about. So I would like to give a little bit of \nhistory and then appeal to reason and responsibility on behalf of the \nFinance Committee on this issue.\n  First of all, the President proposed taking the fastest growing part \nof Medicare out of the trust fund and transferring it to general \nrevenue in order to hide home health costs and claim that we have \nextended Medicare solvency for a decade. As a result, we have included \nthe transfer into the budget agreement, even though I think it is \ntotally and absolutely irresponsible and indefensible. We are simply \ntaking the fastest growing part of Medicare, home health care, out of \nthe Medicare trust fund and putting it into general revenue, which \nequates to taking a bill from one pocket and putting it in another. As \na result, we can now claim that we have saved Medicare for a decade. As \nI pointed out when we started this debate, I could save Medicare for \n100 years by taking hospital care out of the trust fund and putting it \ninto general revenue. But, does anybody believe that that represents \nany kind of reform?\n  So, that is what started this debate. Now, having agreed in the \nbudget agreement to make the transfer, the Finance Committee has sought \nto find ways to be responsible. One of the ways of being responsible is \nto note that there is a difference between services covered by part B \nand services covered by the part A trust fund. Those items that are in \nthe part B program, which are outside the trust fund, have historically \nrequired two things. No. 1, beneficiaries pay 25 percent of the cost \nout of their own pocket in a part B premium; and, No. 2, they have a 20 \npercent copayment. That, basically, is how Medicare has worked.\n  Now we have followed the President's dictate and transferred home \nhealth care out of the part A trust fund into general revenues--part B \nor voluntary part of Medicare. But we have not instituted an immediate \n25 percent payment in the part B premium to pay for 25 percent of the \ncost. Instead, responding to concerns raised by the President and \nothers, we phase that up over a 7-year period. But, to address \nspecifically the issue raised by Senator Kennedy, the norm for types of \ncare covered under the part B section of Medicare is for beneficiaries \nto pay 20 percent copayment.\n\n  Recognizing that this was a dramatic change in policy, in \ntransferring home health care from part A to part B, rather than having \na 20-percent copayment, which would be the norm, we simply asked for a \n$5 copayment. This is not only eminently responsible, it is clearly \nsomething we have to do. Home health care is the fastest growing item \nin Medicare. It used to be that you qualified for it only right after \nyou got out of the hospital. But Congress changed the law to let people \nqualify for home health care whether they have been to the hospital or \nnot. As a result, this program has exploded. It has grown \nexponentially, averaging some 30 to 40 percent a year in growth. It is \nnow bigger than the total funding for the National Institutes of Health \nand the space program. It has become the most explosive element of \nMedicare.\n  We are not doing what we ought to do, which is to put it into part B. \nIf we were required to do that, we would have a 25 percent premium \nwhere people would have to pay 25-percent of the cost like they do \nother programs under part B. Instead, we are phasing it up over 7 \nyears. We are not requiring a 20-percent copayment, which is the norm \nunder part B. But the one thing we have done, which is responsible, is \nrequire a $5 copayment; the logic basically being that even very small \npayments affect people's behavior. What we are trying to do is to \nprovide the service for people who need it while trying to cut down on \nthe explosive growth and the abuse of this program.\n  Our colleague from Oklahoma referred to a front-page article in the \nWall Street Journal, but I don't think he did it justice. What that \narticle did was outline the rampant abuse in this program, pointing out \nthat people have even gotten out of the garbage collection business and \ngone into the home health care business and become almost instant \nmillionaires.\n  This is a program that demands change. We have made a very, very \nmodest change. However, if every time we try to do something \nresponsible, we end up having people jump up and down and saying, ``You \ncan't do anything that is responsible,'' then there is no way we are \ngoing to be able to maintain Medicare.\n  The program will be insolvent in 4 years under any kind of \njustifiable accounting. It will be a $1.6 trillion drain on the Federal \nTreasury over the next 10 years. The unfunded liability in Medicare is \nalready $2.3 trillion. We have guaranteed two generations of Americans \nbenefits, and we never set aside money to pay for the benefits. And now \nwe hear all this screaming and hollering when we try to put a $5 \ncopayment on the most explosive part of Medicare.\n\n[[Page S6112]]\n\n  Mr. President, if we are not going to begin to do these kinds of \nthings, it is going to be only a very short period of time until this \nprogram is going to be bankrupt. I don't know if the Senator from \nMassachusetts is going to be here proposing to triple the payroll tax \nto pay for it, but that is what is going to be required 25 years from \nnow if we don't do something about this program.\n  I support this change because it is absolutely essential that we do \nsomething to stop the explosive growth in this program. I support this \nchange because I don't think a $5 copayment is asking too much. I \nsupport this change because I don't want to have to pick up the phone 4 \nyears from now and say to my 83-year-old mother, ``Well, mom, Medicare \nwent broke today. Of course, I have known it was going broke for years, \nbut I didn't have courage enough to do things, like vote for a $5 \ncopayment on home health care.''\n  I believe this is something that is absolutely essential. It is the \nabsolute minimum we should do. We should be doing a lot more. We are \nnot because of exactly the kind of attacks that we have heard on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The Finance Committee, on a bipartisan basis, supported this $5 \ncopayment. It is a very small reform, but the principle of it is \ncritically important. I think it would be a major, major setback for \nthis bill if we lost this component. Losing this component would mean \nthat we have simply played a shell game. We will have taken the fastest \ngrowing part of Medicare out of the trust fund to hide the explosive \ncost. Even though it is growing at 30 to 40 percent a year, we will \nhave done absolutely nothing to try to deal with that explosive cost.\n  I know the administration says, in the sweet by-and-by, they are \ngoing to have some kind of prospective payment system, and they can't \ntell us what it is today, but we need to do something right now. The $5 \ncopayment is the absolute minimum we ought to do. I urge my colleagues \nto stay with this very small modest reform. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the Senator from Rhode Island 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I think today, as we go on to further \nconsideration of this Medicare legislation, we are going to really see \nwho is concerned about the future of this program and who is concerned \nabout it being there, not just to the end of this century, which is 3 \nyears from now, but well into the next century.\n\n  I think everybody who has taken the trouble to read the report of the \ntrustees of Social Security and Medicare has seen the danger this \nprogram is in. It is going broke. It isn't something that is just \nautomatically going to be there; we are used to these things. Somehow \npeople think, ``Oh, it can't happen.'' Well, it can happen. So from the \nFinance Committee has come a series of proposals to do something about \nthe security of the Medicare Program to ensure that it is going to be \nthere, hopefully well into the next century.\n  What is the particular issue before us today, Mr. President? The \nissue is, is it all right, proper, to have a $5 copayment in some \ninstances--in some instances, Mr. President--for those who are visited \nby the home health care agents, officials, the nurses and those who \ncome in a home health care visit.\n  First, it is important to stress that after a hospital stay, for the \nfirst 100 visits, there is no charge. There is no charge for the first \n100 visits after a hospital stay. Subsequent to that, there is a $5 \ncharge.\n  Under part B, for physicians' visits, and so forth, that an \nindividual makes, there is a 20-percent copayment, and if that were \napplied to the home visits, 20 percent of a $90 visit--and that is the \naverage cost of these visits from the visiting nurses or whoever it \nmight be--20 percent of that is $18. Is the suggestion that there be an \n$18 copayment, 20 percent? No, there isn't, Mr. President. There is a \ncharge of $5, which is in the neighborhood of 6 percent. Not a 20-\npercent charge, a 6 percent charge. It seems to me that that is very \nfair. First of all, it helps reduce the cost to Medicare, obviously. \nSecond, it clearly, to some small extent, affects the behavior of the \nindividual who has asked for the home health care visit.\n  I think this is a fair charge, $5. It is not for everybody. As I say, \nthe first 100 visits go without a charge whatsoever. One hundred visits \nis a lot of visits. Then it goes to this very modest, not 20-percent \npayment, but 6-percent payment.\n  Mr. President, I hope that the amendment to remove this provision in \nthe bill will be rejected. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 5 minutes of the 15 minutes of Senator \nLautenberg's time to myself.\n  Mr. President, if we have to deal with the overutilization of the \nhome care services, let's address that issue. We understand that the \nperson who suggests the kind of medical procedure is the doctor. We, \nthe Finance Committee, are not making this statement in a vacuum. They \nhave already included interim payment systems to deal with this issue \nfor the elderly people. They already have prospective payments. They \nhave made important changes already to address this issue.\n  I would think that those Members who are standing on the floor of the \nU.S. Senate and saying, ``Well, this is just a very modest kind of a \nprogram, and we ought to be able to afford it,'' also ought to be there \nto tell us how they are using the $5 billion to strengthen Medicare \ninstead of using it for tax cuts. But, no, you haven't heard one of \nthem say that. You haven't heard one of them say, ``We're going to \nreduce the overutilization so we can treat our elderly people better by \nadditional kinds of services.'' Absolutely not. They are silent on that \nissue--silent on that issue.\n  The President of the United States had a more generous preventive \nprogram than the Finance Committee, and it was paid for without \ncopayments. You can't have it both ways, I say to my colleagues. The \nPresident of the United States had a more generous preventive health \ncare program for our senior citizens without the copay in the Finance \nCommittee. No, no, they want to juggle the numbers, and that is what \nthey have done. They have taken those billions of dollars, put an \nunfunded mandate on the States, required the Federal Government to max \nthe Medicaid with $900 million and are putting that kind of $5 burden \non the seniors.\n  Who are these people? Just about half of them earn less than $10,000; \n25 percent of them are over the age of 85; two-thirds of them are \nwomen; one-third of them live alone. As any profile shows, these are \nthe most vulnerable in our society. Mr. President, $5 might not be much \nwhen we are talking about the size of these budget items, but it is a \nkey factor, certainly it was in the marvelous testimony that we had \nfrom a wonderful resident who talked about what $5 meant for her \nability to receive services at home.\n  As we say, the doctors are the ones who are making those decisions. \nIt is just amazing to me, as we are beginning this debate, to say we \nare going to put the $5 copay in there that the Senate made a decision \nnot to put there as a result of extensive hearings. It was reported \nbipartisan, with bipartisan leadership. So they say that we are going \nto just wipe that out, that was never talked about during the time we \nwere talking about a balanced budget.\n  The final point that I will make is that we are going to require \ntaking $5 billion out of the pocketbooks primarily of elderly women and \nputting it right over here for tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals, \nwhich we will be voting on. That is what is out there. If we are going \nto change the process of procedures in terms of treatment of people at \nhome, let's do it, but let's do it in sunlight, let's do it as a result \nof hearings, let's do it as part of the overall Medicare debate rather \nthan the one that was done by the Senate Finance Committee.\n  Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is no time left on the amendment?\n\n[[Page S6113]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 30 seconds \non the amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield back his time? Do we have time \nleft?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We yield back any time we have on the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take the 30 seconds to just add to \nthe point not only on the substance of this that we have debated but \nalso CBO. Everyone who votes against my particular amendment will be \nsaying to the States, $600 billion--$600 billion--in CBO spending for \nthe poorest of the poor. This is the granddaddy of all unfunded \nmandates. It is going to be so interesting, all those people who make \nall the speeches about unfunded mandates, how they are going to vote on \nthat.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the excellent letter from \nformer Senator Ted Moss that is related to this subject be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 1997.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: The Senate is currently considering \n     legislation to fundamentally change the nature of the \n     Medicare program. I agree that it is time we examined \n     Medicare; however, I would hate to see us repeat some of the \n     mistakes we made in the past.\n       I was the author in 1965 of the amendment which included \n     home health care coverage under Medicare. Congressman Claude \n     Pepper introduced the legislation in the House. Our original \n     legislation required seniors to pay some portion of their \n     home care costs out-of-pocket. However, studies by the Senate \n     Committee on Aging and the General Accounting Office \n     persuaded me in 1972 to work with Senators Edmund Muskie (D-\n     ME) and Gaylord Nelson (D-WI) to delete the copayment \n     provision. Our studies clearly indicated that copayments: \n     cost Medicare more to collect in administrative costs than \n     they saved the program; denied access to care and fell most \n     heavily on those who can least afford it; pushed families \n     into poverty and loved ones unnecessarily into institutions, \n     resulting in increased costs to the states and the federal \n     government through the Medicaid program; and increased costs \n     to Medicare because people put off care until they had to be \n     hospitalized.\n       I am writing to you today because a provision was added in \n     the Senate Finance Committee proposal to require seniors to \n     pay a $5.00 copayment beginning with the very first visit, up \n     to a total of $760. Copayments were a bad idea in my original \n     bill in 1965 and for the same reason they are a bad idea \n     today. I am writing to urge you not to repeat the mistakes \n     that we made in the past.\n       The home care portion of Medicare is small, representing \n     9.7 percent of the total, and yet home care has been saddled \n     with disproportionate cuts--fully 17 percent of all of the \n     Medicare reductions. Most of these reductions come at the \n     expense of home care providers, which is bad enough, but the \n     copayment provision is particularly intolerable because it \n     comes at the expense of consumers.\n       A strong case can be made for expanding the scope of home \n     care under Medicare to cover long-term care. Approximately \n     ten million individuals who suffer from multiple disabilities \n     are struggling to care for themselves, going without the care \n     that they need, or waiting until an expensive admission to a \n     hospital emergency room is the only answer. Let's do our best \n     to improve Medicare and not make it less responsive to the \n     needs of our seniors.\n       I am writing to ask that you support an amendment by \n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy that would delete the copayment \n     proposal. I encourage you to support Senator Kennedy in his \n     amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Frank E. Moss,\n                                              U.S. Senator (ret.).\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the remainder \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has been yielded back.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to table the Kennedy amendment and \nask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. SARBANES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). The Senator from \nMaryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator from New Jersey yield me 5 minutes?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am pleased to yield the Senator from Maryland up to \n10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I want to commend the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts for offering the amendment just voted upon. \nI think the failure of this amendment dramatically illustrates one of \nthe difficulties plaguing this spending reconciliation bill. This bill, \nwhen combined with the tax breaks approved by the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways and Means Committee, places a \ndisproportionate share of the burden of deficit reduction on ordinary \ncitizens. You can't consider the spending reconciliation bill separate \nand apart from the tax bill we will debate later this week; the two are \nlinked in the budget plan. And when considered in connection with the \ntax cuts we will soon discuss here, the spending cuts in this \nreconciliation bill reflect a flawed set of priorities for the Nation.\n  Now, this spending bill contains program reductions impacting \nnumerous Americans, many of whom face extreme financial difficulty and \nare at the low end of the income scale. At the same time, the tax bill \nthat is also part of the budget gives benefits to people at the top end \nof the income and wealth scale. That is the set of priorities that is \nreflected in this spending bill and in the budget as a whole.\n  Take as an example the home health copayment provision just voted \nupon. As the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out in discussing his \namendment, 43 percent of home health users have incomes under $10,000 \nper year--I repeat, 43 percent have incomes under $10,000 per year. \nTwo-thirds of the people requiring home health visits are women, and \none-third of those are women living alone. The Office of Management and \nBudget has stated: ``We are concerned that a copayment could limit \nbeneficiary access to the benefit.'' These are the kinds of people \naffected by the program cuts in this bill such as the one that the \nSenator from Massachusetts sought to strike--people who lie at the \nbottom end of the income scale, and who can ill-afford even a $5 \ncopayment requirement.\n  At the same time that we require this $5 copayment and other similar \ncost-cutting provisions, we also include tax cuts in the budget plan. \nNow, given the objective of a balanced budget, the inclusion of tax \ncuts in the budget plan necessitates program reductions substantially \ngreater than would be needed to eliminate the deficit if tax breaks \nwere not part of the budget plan. Let me repeat that. Given the \nobjective of a balanced budget, toward which we are all embarked, the \ninclusion of tax\n\n[[Page S6114]]\n\ncuts in the budget plan requires program reductions substantially \ngreater than would be needed to eliminate the deficit if tax breaks \nwere not a part of the plan.\n  The math is simple. The budget resolution provides for $85 billion in \nnet tax cuts over the next 5 years and $250 billion in net tax cuts \nover the next 10 years.\n  In the framework of a balanced budget, these tax cuts require \nadditional program reductions of $85 billion over the next 5 years and \n$250 billion over the next 10 years over what would otherwise be \nrequired.\n  In other words, because you are approving tax cuts, you need to \nlocate program reductions sufficient to offset the tax cuts. Now, the \nstructure of the tax bills reported out by the tax committees makes it \nclear that those at the very top of the income pyramid will receive \nvery substantial tax breaks--thereby absenting themselves from the \ndeficit reduction effort, indeed shifting the burden to others--while \nordinary people will carry a greater burden of program reductions to \ncompensate for the tax breaks.\n  Many programs important to ordinary citizens are being reduced to pay \nfor capital gains tax cuts, inheritance tax cuts, and IRA expansion \nthat will benefit the wealthiest people in the Nation. The cuts in \nMedicare and Medicaid--such as the one the Senate just voted to \nsustain--are examples of such reductions in vital programs.\n  After looking at which Americans are affected by the program \nreductions in this bill, look at the distributional effects of the tax \ncuts that are also part of the budget. The tax bills reported from the \nFinance and Ways and Means Committees give the top 1 percent of the \nincome scale the same percentage of the tax benefits as the bottom 60 \npercent on the income scale. At the same time, in order to make room \nfor these tax breaks, we are reducing programs such as the one that we \njust voted on, which impact heavily on people who really cannot afford \nsuch reductions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will please come to order.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, Members need to ask themselves whether \nthey support the priorities reflected by these choices. For every \ndollar lost to the Treasury in tax cuts, a dollar must be added to the \nTreasury through reductions in programs that are essential to many of \nour citizens. If there were no tax cuts, or if the tax cuts were less \nthan what is being projected, we wouldn't have to cut the home health \nprogram. These two things--tax cuts and program cuts--have to be \nunderstood together, even though they have been separated into two \nbills. The fact of the matter is that the whole budget plan, in order \nto provide for upper income tax breaks, has to reduce programs to \noffset the cost of the tax breaks. And the vote we just had is one \nexample of a program that is being reduced.\n  So, in assessing this reconciliation bill that is before us, we need \nto ask ourselves whether providing tax breaks to the very well to do \nshould be a higher priority than adequate funding for programs \nessential to the well-being of ordinary citizens. On each amendment we \nhave to ask this very question: I repeat, is it more important to give \na upper income tax breaks--and, in order to compensate for them, to cut \nprograms such as the very program that we just voted on with respect to \nhome health copayment, a program which clearly helps people at the very \nlower end of the income scale--or to preserve programs vital to \nordinary Americans?\n  I think that question needs to be asked again and again as we \nconfront these various proposals to deal with the program reductions \nthat are contained in the reconciliation bill that is before us.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address one other item with respect to \nwhat we are confronting in this budget debate because it looks to the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, the Los Angeles Times just yesterday published an \narticle entitled ``Tax-Cut Plans Could Reseed Deficit.''\n  I quote: ``Analysts liken House and Senate bills as time bombs set to \nbegin detonating shortly after 2002--the target date for balancing the \nFederal budget.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this article points out that under \nversions of the tax bills approved by the Tax Committees in the two \nHouses, the revenue loss to the Treasury would take off, starting in \nthe year 2003 and continuing for many years thereafter. What has \nhappened is the tax cuts have been crafted in such a way that they \nartificially are held down in the early years to stay within the terms \nof the budget agreement. But because of back loading the principal \nrevenue impact comes in later years.\n  Robert Reischauer, the former head of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, said, and I quote him:\n\n       . . . warns that of all the debate surrounding the \n     House and Senate tax bills--whether the reductions are \n     skewed too much toward the wealthy, or whether they would \n     overheat the economy--``this is the critical issue.''\n\n  I again quote him:\n\n  If the tax bill explodes, it will explode just at the time that the \nbaby-boom generation is beginning to retire and when we will need every \npenny we can get our hands on to pay for Medicaid, housing, \ntransportation, and food stamps.\n\n       Moreover, many of the tax cuts contained in the two bills \n     ``would not be easily reversible'' if the Government decided \n     that it needed the extra revenue after all to pay for these \n     vital programs.\n\n  The figures are very stark.\n\n       [The figures] . . . compiled by the congressional Joint \n     Committee on Taxation show that during the first five years, \n     the tax cuts would result in a net loss to the Treasury of \n     $85 billion--precisely what the budget agreement has \n     allocated . . .\n\n       But the figures also show that the House tax writers have \n     held down the initial costs by phasing in some of the \n     reductions slowly. Once the provisions are fully in effect \n     the cost of the package jumps dramatically.\n       As a result, while the House provisions would drain about \n     $18.4 billion from the Treasury in 1999, by 2007, the annual \n     cost would soar to $41.8 billion--more than double the \n     earlier amount.\n\n  So, in other words, you come to the end of the 10-year period upon \nwhich limitations have been placed by the budget agreement and you have \nthe revenue loss projected on trend lines that simply take off over the \nsecond 10 years. Some estimates have placed this loss at $600 to $700 \nbillion over the next 10 years--2008-17--compared to a $250 billion \ncost over the first 10 years, 1998-2007.\n  The same criticism applies to the Senate Finance Committee version--a \nlittle less, but not much. Moreover, as I have noted, both bills \nthreaten the deficit through backloaded, phased-in tax cuts, which \nprincipally benefit the wealthy.\n  Mr. President, as pointed out in this Los Angeles Times analysis, \nthree of the main provisions in these tax bills--IRA's, capital gains, \nand inheritance taxes--make heavy use of gimmicks, including delayed \neffective dates, slow phaseins, and timing shifts in revenue \ncollections to minimize the revenue losses that these tax cuts cause in \nthe early years. But then the costs begin to rise sharply, and they \naccelerate as you move into the outyears.\n  In short, these cuts place the whole deficit reduction effort at \nrisk.\n  So we have two things happening here. First of all, the tax cuts are \ninequitable as we have just seen because you do something like this \nhome health copayment charge at the same time that you give a tax break \nat the top of the income scale. Forty-three percent of the people who \nuse home health services have incomes of less than $10,000 a year, and \nnow will have to make a payment of up to $760 a year under this bill \nfor home health care before they get some assistance. At the same time \nyou are giving a tax break to people at the top end of the income scale \non capital gains, on inheritance tax, and on delayed IRA's.\n  Second, the broader question, what Reischauer called the critical \nissue, is the fact that the tax bill is structured in such a way that \nthe cost of the tax bill will simply take off after the year 2007. It \nwill start moving out after the year 2002, the so-called balance year, \nand then after the year 2007 it will really take off and we will then \nbe confronted with a major threat to our fiscal stability. As this Los \nAngeles\n\n[[Page S6115]]\n\nTimes article said, the ``Tax-Cut Plans Could Reseed Deficit.''\n  The whole purpose of this exercise is to eliminate the deficit, which \nis not being done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   Tax-Cut Plans Could Reseed Deficit\n\n                             (By Art Pine)\n\n       Washington.--Prospects for keeping the federal budget \n     balanced after 2002, the year that President Clinton and \n     Congress hope to eliminate the deficit, are being threatened \n     by a ticking time bomb: the tax-cut bills that Congress will \n     take up this week.\n       Under versions approved by the Senate Finance Committee and \n     the House Ways and Means Committee, the revenue loss to the \n     Treasury would take off, starting in 2003, and continue for \n     many years after that, most budget experts say.\n       Robert Greenstein, an analyst for the nonpartisan Center on \n     Budget and Policy Priorities, says both tax-cut measures have \n     been crafted to keep the impact of the cuts ``artificially \n     low'' for the first few years to stay within the bipartisan \n     balanced-budget agreement.\n       Such ``back-loading'' of the maximum revenue impact, he and \n     other fiscal experts say, could threaten the government's \n     fiscal integrity just as it is likely to be saddled with \n     added costs related to the aging of the baby boom generation.\n       Robert D. Reischauer, a Brookings Institution budget-\n     watcher, warns that of all the debate surrounding the House \n     and Senate tax bills--whether the reductions are skewed too \n     much toward the wealthy, or whether they would overheat the \n     economy--``this is the critical issue.''\n       ``If the tax bill explodes, it will explode just at the \n     time that the baby boom generation is beginning to retire and \n     when we will need every penny we can get our hands on to pay \n     for Medicaid, housing, transportation and food stamps,'' \n     Reischauer said.\n       Moreover, many of the tax cuts contained in the two bills \n     ``would not be easily reversible'' if the government decided \n     that it needed the extra revenue after all, Reischauer \n     contends. Adjusting capital gains for inflation, for example, \n     would be difficult to undo\n       The figures are stark by any standard.\n       Estimates compiled by the congressional Joint Committee on \n     Taxation show that during the first five years, the tax cuts \n     would result in a net loss to the Treasury of $85 billion--\n     precisely what the budget agreement has allocated for the \n     measure's cost.\n       But the figures show that the House tax writers have held \n     down the initial costs by phasing in some of the reductions \n     slowly. Once the provisions are fully in effect, the cost of \n     the package jumps dramatically.\n       As a result, while the House provisions would drain about \n     $18.4 billion from the Treasury in 1999, by 2007, the annual \n     cost would soar to $41.8 billion--more than double the \n     earlier amount.\n       And Greenstein's group estimates that if the cost of the \n     Ways and Means Committee package escalates at its 2004-2007 \n     pace, the cumulative revenue loss for the second 10 years--\n     from 2008 to 2017--would surge to $600 billion or more.\n       The Senate Finance Committee version of the bill is only \n     slightly less explosive. The revenue drain rises from $19.7 \n     billion a year in 1999 to $40.2 billion in 2007--again \n     totaling $85 billion for the five years covered by the \n     bipartisan budget accord.\n       Once more, however, calculating the second decade's cost \n     once the provisions have been fully phased in raises the \n     annual revenue shortfall to $74 billion in 2017, Greenstein's \n     group estimates. For the measure's second decade--from 2008 \n     to 2017--it swells to $550 billion.\n       Greenstein and Iris J. Lav, another researcher at the \n     center, attribute the bulk of the explosion in 2004 and \n     beyond to a handful of provisions that provide primarily \n     benefit higher-income taxpayers: cuts in the taxes on capital \n     gains, inheritance and individual retirement accounts.\n       All three provisions ``make heavy use of gimmicks--\n     including delayed effective dates, slow phase-ins and timing \n     shifts in revenue collections--to minimize the revenue losses \n     [that] these tax cuts cause during the first five years,'' \n     the two analysts argue.\n       ``Their costs then begin to rise sharply, with the pace at \n     which these costs increase accelerating in 2006 and 2007.''\n       The House provision to allow taxpayers to adjust their \n     capital gains to eliminate the impact of inflation is \n     particularly vulnerable to cost spiraling. Under the terms of \n     the House bill, taxpayers would not actually begin using it \n     to lower their taxes until 2004.\n       Republicans are unapologetic about the apparent trends. \n     Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) told a news \n     conference Friday that while Republicans deplore the \n     possibility that the cost of the tax cut might explode, that \n     is not the important point.\n       While Lott said Republicans ``agreed we would not take \n     actions'' that would cause fiscal distress beyond 2002, he \n     added. ``The idea of having significant tax cuts for working \n     Americans, I love it! ''\n       But Reischauer and other critics are less sanguine. The \n     nation already is facing a possible revival of large budget \n     deficits when the baby boom generation reties, they say, and \n     the prospect that policymakers will be able to cut spending \n     then is dubious.\n       Many budget analysts predict that the bipartisan accord \n     Congress and Clinton reached this past spring already runs \n     the risk that the budget balancing--if it actually does occur \n     in 2002, as predicted--will be brief and that the deficit \n     will begin widening again.\n       ``With the vanguard of the baby boom generation having \n     already reached age 50, the nation cannot afford to budget \n     with this type of sleight of hand,'' Greenstein said.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes to respond to \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland.\n  First, let me suggest that there are some Senators who want tax cuts. \nThere are some Senators who want only certain kinds of tax cuts. I have \nnever found a tax cut that the Senator from Maryland agrees with.\n  So we ought to start the argument by understanding that he is against \nthe tax cut in this bill and probably any comparable tax cuts because \nhe just doesn't like to cut taxes.\n  Having said that, let me just talk about some of the arguments he \nmade. First of all, I am very pleased that this is a bipartisan effort \nto create some sense out of the havoc that is going to come down on the \nTreasury of the United States if we don't find some way to control home \nhealth care costs under part B for the seniors of our country.\n  Everybody should understand, including the seniors, that what we did \nin this package and what is being done in the House package is very, \nvery beneficial to the senior citizens. In each bill we took half of \nthe home health care costs--the fastest growing program in America, on \naverage, 30 percent--we took half of that program out of the trust fund \nthus eliminating imminent bankruptcy. And we said, ``Seniors, you don't \nhave to pay for that out of your trust fund.''\n  We did not hear anything from seniors, or the AARP, other than the \nAARP said ``thank you'' because, obviously, that is a very big gift \nwhich we did in order to make that trust fund solvent. We then put that \namount of money down, and said let the taxpayers pay for it. So the \nFinance Committee came along and said, well, if the taxpayers are going \nto pay for it, we ought to start putting some control in it so that it \nwill make sense in terms of costs. And the argument has been made by \nthose who oppose what the committee did--and I don't serve on the \ncommittee--but the argument has been made that there are many poor \nseniors who can't afford the deductible.\n  Let's repeat again. If they are poor, the Medicaid Program of America \npays their deductible. Let me repeat. For poor seniors, the Medicaid \nProgram pays their deductible.\n  Frankly, I believe every other aspect--I am not an expert but I asked \nabout this--every other aspect of delivering health care, hospitals and \nothers, all have some kind of deductible. They do not have a deductible \nbecause we like to charge people where we could afford to give them \nsomething free. But we have deductibles so that everybody understands, \nincluding the recipient, that the program costs some money. \nHistorically it has been a pretty good way to get that message across \nto the users.\n  The last argument being made by my friend from Maryland is a New York \nTimes article that says the tax bill, which will come up next in the \nSenate and which already is on the House side, except ours is a little \nbetter in terms of the middle-income people--and he has an article from \na newspaper which says that the tax bill is not good for middle-income \nAmericans.\n  Let me suggest to the Senate that we don't have a New York Times \narticle. We have the Congressional Budget Office. We have the Joint Tax \nCommittee and every major accounting firm in the country that looks at \nthis say to the contrary. In fact, let me tell you what the \noverwhelming evidence is that will soon be available from the Joint Tax \nCommittee but also what our own firm that does our work for us says. \nThey say that, at a minimum, 75 percent of the tax cut goes to those \nAmericans who earn $75,000 and less. That is not a bad distribution.\n  In fact, I believe before we are finished, when we take into account \nthe other things the Finance Committee did, it will probably be more \nlike 78 percent of all of the tax cuts that are in this package will go \nto people in America earning $75,000 and less.\n\n[[Page S6116]]\n\n  Now, that leads me to believe that those who want to attack the bill \nbecause of its distribution among taxpayers just do not want any tax \ncuts or, and here I will say unequivocally, that the White House \nchooses to attack this package because they have their own method of \nfiguring out how much the American taxpayers earn and, believe it or \nnot, the White House criticism--I yield 5 additional minutes off the \nbill--believe it or not, under the White House approach taxpayers \nshould understand--and I say this to my friend from Texas--if they own \na house, they are charged under the White House approach to this with \nreceiving rent from the house equivalent to its value. So if you earn \n$25,000, and you have a house worth $100,000--the rent should be \n$10,000 on the house--you have earned $35,000.\n  Now, in addition, they also say if you have any capital gains--listen \nto this--they impute to you the value of the capital gain.\n  Now, the point of it is that the Joint Tax Commission approaches it \nin a completely different way. Accountants who have looked at it--and I \nwill put a letter in from a major accounting firm--tell us that, \nindeed, this distribution under this tax bill, which is probably made \nbetter when they put $250 into the earned-income tax receipt--that \nprobably makes the distribution better, but they tell us it is like 75 \npercent for $75,000 and under.\n  Now, I want to try to make a point because already the American \npeople have been told, principally by White House spokesmen, that this \ntax bill is for the rich. We ourselves must set about to tell the \nAmerican people the truth, and that will not be easy because every time \nsomebody stands up who opposes the capital gains tax or the like, they \nare going to immediately say this tax bill is not good for average \nAmericans.\n  So 3 years ago, in 1993, now on 4 years, the White House used, I say \nto Senator Gramm, this same method of distributing earnings in another \nventure with the Congress, and I want to read and quote what David \nBrinkley said on one of his ABC wrapups of his own show about the way \nthe White House figures the distribution of taxes, and so let me start. \nAll of this is a quote from him.\n\n       A few words about Federal taxes and what some of the great \n     minds in the United States Treasury are thinking about. The \n     Treasury likes to calculate the American people's ability to \n     pay taxes based not on how much money we have but on how much \n     money we might have or how much we could have. For example, a \n     family that owns a house and lives in it, the Treasury \n     figures that if the family didn't own the House and rented it \n     from somebody else, the rent would be $500 a month, so it \n     would add that amount, $6,000, to the family's so-called \n     imputed income. Imputed income is income you might have had \n     but don't--\n\n  Said the distinguished news man Brinkley.\n\n       They don't tax you on that amount.\n\n  Nobody taxes you on that amount.\n  Now, concluding:\n\n       The IRS does not play silly games like this. Instead, the \n     Treasury calculates how much you could take away from us if \n     you decided to. If that were the system, consider the \n     possibilities. How about being taxed on Ed McMahon's $10 \n     million magazine lottery.\n\n  Maybe you might get that so why not tax you based on that.\n\n       I didn't win it, you say, but you could have. The Treasury \n     must have something better to do----\n\n  He said.\n\n       If not, there's a very good place for Clinton to cut some \n     spending. From all of us at ABC--\n\n  He went on to say--\n\n       Thank you.\n\n  We are going to start today, Mr. President, with this little sermon. \nWe are going to start wherever anyone will listen to us and wherever \nany columnists are who write about this tax bill and we are going to \ntell them the truth, and we are going to ask them to read the Brinkley \ncolumn about how the United States Treasury Department figures out what \nincome people are earning. And frankly, they are also going to say, I \nsay to Senator Gramm, that this method of figuring out what somebody \nwas earning was dreamed up in a Reagan administration. That is true.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We killed the guy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. But essentially you can do all of these kinds of models \nfor different purposes. The purpose that it is being used for now is \ntotally distorted in terms of what the American people themselves are \ngoing to realize and who is going to realize the benefits of this tax \nbill. So wherever anyone will listen, we will hope to get our oar in \nalongside of the Democrats--some, not all--who say this tax bill does \nnot help average Americans.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I still have the floor, and I want to \nask unanimous consent that the Senate stand in recess from the hour of \n12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly policy luncheons to meet and, further, \nthat the recess time count equally against the remaining statutory time \nallotted for the reconciliation bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator from New Mexico yield \nfor a couple of questions?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been told by the chairman of the \nFinance Committee that they want to proceed on the amendment that is \npending and so I----\n  Mr. SARBANES. If the Senator will yield me just 2 minutes to respond \nto the point that was made.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator from Maryland will indulge me for just \na minute. The chairman said proceed, and I am wondering how far we want \nto proceed because if we are going to suspend at 12:30 until 2:15, \nthere is a vote pending, I assume, I ask the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, and would you want to establish a time certain \nnow for voting after lunch?\n  Mr. ROTH. I would like to have a vote before we recess for lunch.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. There is, I understand--I ask the Chair--an hour's \nworth of debate evenly divided for the discussion of the waiver of the \npoint of order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. If we have just had a unanimous-consent agreement to \nleave here at 12:30, how does one accommodate an hour's worth of time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. One doesn't. One assumes that both sides would like to \ntake less.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Well, I think in a survey of my side, Mr. President, \nI cannot accommodate that notion. Now, if the Republicans are willing \nto give up their side, we can do it in a half hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me try this on with everybody who is \nhere.\n  Senator Durbin wants a full hour?\n  How much time does the chairman think he needs?\n  Senator Durbin gets a half hour.\n  Mr. ROTH. We want the half hour.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You want the half hour.\n  That means we could not vote until after lunch. Very well, why don't \nwe do this. We want to use the whole time. It is 5 minutes of 12. We \nwould then go until 12:30. That is 35 minutes and then 25 minutes upon \nreturn.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. At 2:15. So that would be at 20 to 3.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The first 25 minutes upon return to the floor will be \nused on this amendment and then a vote will follow.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. At that time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. At this point we will, the time preceding our recess \nwill be used on the motion to waive as equally divided as possible.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Maryland asked for a couple of \nminutes before we start the debate on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object and \nacknowledging the fact that the Senator from New Jersey may yield to my \nfriend and colleague from Maryland, can we say that the calculation be \nbased on how much time is remaining on the debate when we do break at \n12:30?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, that is fine.\n  I do not want to use any additional time. I want them to use it. But \nif the Senator insists on 2 minutes, I am not going to object.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I therefore yield 2 minutes of the time on the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May we indicate the unanimous-consent request is that \nas soon as the 2 minutes is up we immediately move to the 65-67 issue?\n  Mr. GRAMM. May I just ask a question? Are we going to have the full\n\n[[Page S6117]]\n\nhour to debate this thing, so we will debate it some when we come back \nfrom lunch?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. So nothing we are doing in going to lunch or listening to \nthe rich people getting a tax break, none of that is limiting our time?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No. He is only going to take 2 minutes on that issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I sought the 2 \nminutes because I wanted to respond to the points made by the chairman \nof the Budget Committee. First of all, he said, if these senior \ncitizens had difficulty with the copayment requirement, they could get \nMedicaid. That is true if they are at the poverty level or below--\napproximately $9,000 of income or less. But you have a lot of people \nthat are above the poverty level who cannot afford this, and who, \nwithout Federal assistance, will suffer these program reductions at the \nsame time that those at the upper income level receive tax breaks.\n  Second, we are told that the distribution tables show that these tax \ncuts are not going disproportionally to the upper end of the scale. \nWell, that is because of the backloading gimmicks that are in the tax \nbill. In fact, the capital gains and IRA proposals on which the \ndistribution tables are based through the year 2002 show no net revenue \nloss--no net revenue loss--for that 5-year period of time, which is the \nsole subject of the distribution table. Yet, the combined revenue loss \nfrom those provisions for the period 2003 through 2007 is $51 billion. \nAnd that is never calculated in the distribution tables, let alone the \ncost of these tax breaks in the years after 2007, which, as I mentioned \nbefore could well be staggering and totally destructive of the deficit \nreduction effort.\n  Moreover, as a consequence of such backloading, the upper income tax \nprovisions account for a growing proportion of the tax package over \ntime. In the year 2003, outside the scope of the distribution tables \nthat the chairman was citing, they will account for 30 percent of the \ngross cost of the tax cuts. By 2007, the figure is 42 percent. And as \nyou move out into the next decade, they very quickly eat up more than \nhalf of the tax breaks.\n  Now, the way these cuts are structured makes the Joint Tax Committee \nanalysis an inadequate indicator of the distribution effect of these \ntax cuts. Because of the way they are structured, with the backloading, \na 5-year distribution table shows that they are not costing any \nrevenue. But if you carry the cuts out beyond the 5-year period, they \ncost very significant revenue. And by the year 2010, it is estimated \nthat a majority of the tax cuts in the package will be directed to the \nupper income sector of the population.\n  Now, as I stated earlier, the fact that you are making those tax cuts \nrequires you, since you are trying to reach a balanced budget, to make \nprogram cuts. So you have to look at the tax cuts reported by the \ncommittee and weigh them against the program cuts. Here you have home \nhealth care being cut, with 43 percent of the people who use home \nhealth care making under $10,000, and here you also have tax breaks \ngiven to people at the very top of the income scale. These are not the \nright priorities for the Nation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the ranking member for yielding me time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield all the time on this issue to \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, for his control under the Budget \nAct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question pending is the motion to waive \nthe Budget Act in response to a point of order raised against section \n5611 on the grounds that it violates section 313(b)(i)(A) of the \nCongressional Budget Act.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I asked for a waiver because I oppose the point of \norder on the age of eligibility in the bill. What we are proposing to \ndo is to make the age of eligibility for Medicare conform with Social \nSecurity. The age of eligibility will change from 65 to 67, which will \nbe phased in over a 24-year period beginning in 2003 and ending in \n2027. This is a very, very modest approach to an extremely serious \nproblem. What we are concerned about is the solvency of Medicare. The \nsolvency of Medicare is of critical importance as part A is seen going \nbankrupt by the year 2001. By the year 2007, if we do not make \nsignificant change, the program is at a loss of one-half trillion \ndollar. What we are seeking to do here, by making the age of \neligibility for Medicare reform conform with Social Security, is to \ntake a modest step forward to assure the solvency of this most \nimportant program.\n\n  The bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare will be required \nto analyze and report back the feasibility of allowing individuals \nbetween age 62 and Medicare eligibility the option to buy into \nMedicare. As I said, our provision will help us extend solvency in the \nprogram. It is, I think, the very least we should do. The average life \nexpectancy for a man or a woman over age 65 has been steadily \nimproving. People are living longer, they are leading more vibrant \nlives, and this means that changing the eligibility age for Medicare \nwill follow our natural demographic progression. In fact, around the \ntime Medicare was enacted, the average life expectancy for men at age \n65 was about 13 years, for women about 16 years. In 2030, when this \nprovision is fully phased in, average life expectancy at age 65 for men \nis anticipated to be about 17 years, and 20.5 years for women. This is \na very modest step to bring about significant reform. It is critically \nimportant that we show that we have the courage to take these steps on \nbehalf, not only of our senior citizens of today, but the increasing \nnumber that will join this group in 2010 and later.\n  It is, in a way, very ironic that a point of order was made on this \nmatter, because while it is true that it will not have a significant \nimpact on revenue in the early years because of the very, very \ncompassionate way we are introducing changing the age of eligibility, \nthe fact is that this very modest approach will do a very, very great \ndeal in the long term in helping the solvency of this program.\n  I cannot emphasize too much the importance of this change. As I \npointed out, it merely conforms to what already has taken place in \nrespect to Social Security. It is a change that will make the program \nsignificantly more solvent in the long term, and I hope the Senate will \nassure that this language continues as part of the agreement.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I assume the distinguished chairman \nwill be yielding further time on his side. At this point we have no \nrequests for time now.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, when Social Security started in the mid-\n1930's, the average person paying into Social Security, given the \nlifespan projections, was not projected to live long enough to get any \nof the benefits. In fact, we forget that when Social Security started, \nthe average life expectancy of Americans was substantially less than \n65.\n  By 1983, Social Security had become insolvent. We were in danger, in \nthe spring, of not being able to send out July checks. We had a crisis \nin Social Security, so we instituted a series of reforms to try to pull \nSocial Security back in the black. One of those reforms was raising the \nretirement age beginning in the year 2003. Then over the ensuing 24 \nyears it would be raised in small increments up to 67. We did it under \ncrisis circumstances. I remember the vote. I was a young Member of the \nHouse at the time. It was adopted on a bipartisan vote. Nobody liked \nit, but everybody recognized that it had to be done.\n  We did not make a similar change for Medicare then because Medicare \nwas in the black. Today, our circumstances with Medicare are very, very \ndifferent. If you look at this chart behind me, we currently are in \nthis last small part of blue. Medicare is now in the process, very \nrapidly, of going bankrupt and the Medicare part A trust fund, which \npays\n\n[[Page S6118]]\n\nfor hospital care, within 4 years will be insolvent. We expect \nMedicare, based on everything that exists now, to be a drain on the \nFederal Treasury of $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Our problem is not only exploding costs, but the fact that we have a \nbaby boomer generation that was born immediately after the war which \nmade Medicare possible as all these baby boomers came into the labor \nmarket beginning in 1965. But 14 years from today, the first baby \nboomer retires. We will go from 200,000 people retiring a year to 1.6 \nmillion people retiring a year. The number does not change for 20 \nyears. We go from 5.9 workers per retiree in 1965, to 3.9 workers per \nretiree, to 2.2 workers per retiree. We are facing a very great crisis \nin Medicare.\n  We also face a timing crisis. Everybody knows we are going to have to \nraise the retirement age for qualifying for Medicare as we did for \nSocial Security. Everybody knows it is going to have to be done. If we \ndo it today, we are going to have time for it to phase in. But if we \nwait another 3 or 4 years, the phase-in for Social Security will have \nstarted and we are going to be forced to tell people who have planned \nfor retirement that their Social Security benefits and their Medicare \ncoverage are not going to cut in when they plan to retire.\n  If we make this change today, people will have time to adjust. For \nexample, I was born in 1942. If we pass this bill today, I will know \nthat if I plan to retire at 65, that my Social Security benefits and my \nMedicare coverage will not cut in until I am 65 years 10 months of age. \nSo I have 11 years, if I were looking forward to that retirement, to \nplan for it. If we keep waiting, knowing we are going to have to do \nthis, we are going to end up having to force change on people when they \nare not ready. The advantage of doing what we have done is that it \nphases in between now and the year 2027, and people have time to plan \nfor it.\n\n  It is the ultimate paradox that we have a point of order against this \nprovision because we did this provision without claiming any savings \nfor the budget. We made this change to save Medicare. We dedicate every \npenny of savings to the Medicare trust fund, we don't count a penny of \nthe savings toward balancing the budget or funding tax cuts, and now we \nhave a point of order against the amendment because we are not claiming \nsavings.\n  So we try to answer the charge that is often made on the other side \nof the aisle that you are cutting Medicare to balance the budget or you \nare cutting Medicare to cut taxes. We try to respond to that by taking \na long-term view of saving Medicare. We do not count it toward reducing \nthe deficit, we don't let any of it be spent, and we don't let any of \nit be used for tax cuts. We simply are trying to do something that is \nfundamentally important.\n  Medicare is going broke. We have an unfunded liability for Medicare \ntoday of $2.6 trillion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator has spoken for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. May I have 1 additional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The plain truth is we have guaranteed two generations of \nAmericans benefits under Medicare, and we have not set any money aside \nto pay for it. We have an outstanding liability of $2.6 trillion. If we \nwait 10 years to do something about it, it will be $3.9 trillion. If we \nwait 20, it will be bigger than the entire national debt of the country \nat $6.1 trillion. The Finance Committee, in an extraordinary act of \ncourage, decided to make this change and not count any of it toward \nbalancing the budget and not count any of it to pay for the tax cut but \nto simply do it so we will never have to call up senior citizens and \ntell them Medicare went broke today.\n  I supported this provision because I have an 83-year-old mother who \ndepends on Medicare, and I don't want to pick up the phone someday and \nsay, ``Mama, Medicare went broke today. I knew it was going broke, but \nI did not have courage enough to do anything about it.''\n  We have an opportunity over the next 30 years to phase up the \neligibility date for Medicare to conform to Social Security, something \nwe have already had to do under crisis circumstances. Let's not wait \nuntil the house is on fire to do something about the problem.\n  I urge this point of order be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know if I need permission from \nSenator Lautenberg on our side, but I am going to presume there is no \nobjection to speak on behalf of our side in relation to this motion to \nwaive. I see Senator Lautenberg on the floor now.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield so much time, up to 10 minutes, as the \nSenator from Illinois requires.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my colleague for making this legitimate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, what is this all about? Well, you say the \nword ``Medicare'' and senior citizens start listening. ``Medicare, wait \na minute, that is my mother's health insurance protection, it is my \ngrandfather's health insurance. What are they doing to Medicare?''\n  Let me tell you for a moment, if you are 65 years old or older, \nlisten with interest; if you are 59 years old or younger, listen to \nthis debate with great interest. It is about you and when you will be \nable to retire. It is whether or not you will have the protection of \nhealth insurance in your old age.\n  This is the committee print for the bill we are considering, a very \ninteresting document. There is a provision in here that we are now \ndebating which you might overlook, but it is so important that \nvirtually everyone under the age of 59 years in the United States of \nAmerica, because of a handful of sentences here, may have to change \ntheir plans as to when they are going to retire. That is how important \nthis debate is, that is how important this issue is, because buried in \nthis committee print on page 161 at the bottom of the page is a Texas \ntwo-step for America's working families. A Texas two-step--step, step, \nslide, slide, and guess what? It raises the eligibility age for \nMedicare from 65 to 67.\n  What does that mean? It means if you were counting on retiring at age \n65, taking your Social Security, taking your Medicare, guess what? You \nnow have to wait a couple of years, or at least retire without the \nprotection of Medicare.\n  Is that important to people? I think it is very important. Do you \nknow how many people now at the age of 65 have health insurance in \nAmerica? Thirty percent; 70 percent do not. They are people who count \non Medicare to protect them. And the Senator from Texas offers an \namendment which says, ``Oh, you can count on Medicare to protect you, \njust wait 2 years, wait 2 years, and then we will start protecting \nyou.''\n  What if you should retire at age 60, what if your employer says to \nyou, ``Oh, take your retirement, we'll give you health insurance \nprotection,'' and changes his mind? Have you ever heard that story? I \nhave heard it plenty. People who retired say, ``I'm taken care of, the \ncompany I work for gave me a watch, they gave me a health insurance \nplan, this is going to be great, I'm going fishing.'' Then what \nhappens? The company is sold two or three times, a couple mergers, a \ncouple cutbacks, and the next thing you know, they are saying, ``Sorry \nwe have to send you a letter and tell you the bad news. No more health \ninsurance, Mr. Retiree. Thanks for working for us for 35 years.'' And \nthere you sit at age 61 without health insurance.\n  What does it cost you? I know what it costs in Chicago because we \nchecked. About $6,000 a year if you are healthy. If you are not healthy \nand in your sixties, 10,000 bucks a year. Did you count on that when \nyou decided to retire? I don't think so. And if you get stuck in that \nposition, you know what you start doing? You start counting the days to \nwhen you will be eligible for Medicare. How many more months before I \nreach age 65 and Medicare is going to come in and protect me and my \nfamily and my savings? You count the days.\n  The Senator from Texas, who offers this amendment, wants you to keep \ncounting for 24 months more, wants you to hang on until you are 67. \nThen he says we should make you eligible for Medicare.\n  I think that there is some question as to the statement in the \ncommittee print about its voracity. I know we are not supposed to say \nthat, but let me\n\n[[Page S6119]]\n\njust tell you why I say that. The committee says we are changing \nMedicare so that it tracks Social Security and, in their words, they \nsay, ``The committee provision will establish a consistent national \npolicy on eligibility for both Social Security, old age pension \nbenefits and Medicare.''\n  Let us concede the obvious. The age to retire under Social Security \nin the next century is going to go up from 65 to 67. This is true. It \nis the basis for this amendment. But it is not the whole story, I say \nto my friends. The whole story is this. You can draw Social Security at \nage 62. You won't get as much, but that is your option. ``I will take a \nlower retirement, I'm leaving at 62, that's it.'' But you can't do that \non Medicare. You can't draw Medicare benefits at age 62. Right now you \nwait until you are age 65, unless you are disabled, and the Senator \nfrom Texas wants you to keep on waiting for 2 more years to the age of \n67. I don't think that is an accurate statement when they say they are \ngoing to track Social Security. They don't track Social Security.\n\n  The Senator argues this gives people time to adjust. He talks about \ncompassion and courage. How much courage does it take to say to a \nsenior citizen who now has developed a serious heart problem, ``Keep \ndrawing out of your savings accounts to pay for your health \ninsurance.''\n  You know what will be compassionate and courageous, not raising the \nage to 67. What would be compassionate and courageous is universal \nhealth care. To say no matter how old you are, rich or poor, where you \nlive, black or white, regardless of your ethnic background, you are \ninsured in America. You are not going to be stuck in the situation we \nare creating with this bill, you are not going to be stuck in the \nposition with a terrible medical problem at age 62 and no health \ninsurance, waiting and praying for the day when you are eligible for \nMedicare. That would be compassion and courage. That would be \nresponsive to the 40 million Americans stuck today without health \ninsurance.\n  Let me tell my friends, my opposition to this provision to raise the \neligibility age for Medicare comes, of course, from the Democratic \nside, but I have some interesting allies in this battle. Eighty \ndifferent corporations have written to the Members of the Senate and \nsaid, ``Please, do not do this, do not accept Senator Gramm's proposal \nto raise the eligibility age for Medicare to 67.'' Among them, the \nNational Association of Manufacturers and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n  What is a Democrat doing arguing the position of the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce here? I will tell you why. These companies and their \nassociations now offer to their employees health insurance protection \nuntil they are eligible for Medicare. That is written in the contract. \nIf you make eligibility for Medicare age 67 instead of 65, these \ncompanies have a new liability that has been dumped in their laps by \nthe Texas two-step, and it is a disincentive for any other company to \noffer this benefit to their employees. They know it costs more, and \nthey don't know what the Senate is likely to do next year when it comes \nto Medicare eligibility. That is what this battle is all about.\n  When I look at the number of people currently covered by health \ninsurance at age 60 and 65 in America, it is clear. Fewer companies are \noffering protection. More people are on their own. The expense of \nhealth insurance when you reach age 60 goes through the roof, even \nwithout any kind of medical problem. That is what this debate is all \nabout.\n  You want to save Medicare? There are lots of things we need to do on \na bipartisan basis. There is a Commission created by this bill to study \nthose ways, to make sure that we do it in a sensible, fair, \ncompassionate way. But instead, my colleague from Texas and his friends \non the committee have decided, let's just take a flier, let's throw one \nof them out there. And the first one they throw out there does not \nimpose any new liability on health care providers, it imposes a new \nburden on seniors in years to come.\n  Those who retire after the year 2003 have to start waiting longer and \nlonger and longer. I say to my friends, I don't think that is what \nMedicare is all about. Many of the people who proposed this, frankly, \ndon't care much for Medicare. That came out in the last campaign. Some \nof the candidates stood up and said, ``Yeah, I voted against it, and \nI'd do it again.'' I am not one of them. I didn't have the opportunity, \nthe rare opportunity, to vote for this program. But I will tell you \nthis, I am going to vote to protect it. I am going to vote to protect \nit because of what it has meant to my family. Medicare has meant to my \nfamily that you can retire not only with the dignity with Social \nSecurity, but with the protection of Medicare.\n\n  Parents don't want to be burdens on their children. They want to live \nindependently, enjoy their lives because they played by the rules and \nthey have paid in. To change the rules at this point, to say we are \ngoing to raise the retirement age for Medicare really reneges on a \npromise that was made over 30 years ago. It is the wrong way to go. We \ncan make Medicare solvent in the long term, and we can do it in a \nsensible way.\n  At this point, I yield, for purposes of debate, to my colleague from \nCalifornia, Senator Boxer.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask how much time does the Senator \nfrom Illinois have remaining that I gave him?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. He has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me first point out that when our \ncolleague talks about people waking up and finding that age of \neligibility is changed by 2 years, let me say that those people are 37 \nyears old today. It will be between now and the year 2027 that this \nretirement age will phase up.\n  One of the reasons we want to do this now is we don't want people to \nwake up and discover that this has happened and they have not had time \nto plan on it. By doing it now, this will affect the full 2-year \nincrease; it will affect only people born after 1960. That is, they are \ngoing to have 30 years in which to change their life's plan in order to \naccommodate this change.\n  Our colleague acts as if tomorrow they are going to wake up and \ndiscover that the eligibility has changed.\n  Let me remind my colleague, unless the note I have been passed is \nincorrect, that in 1983, on March 24, our colleague voted to raise the \nretirement age for Social Security, is that correct?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield for an answer to that question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The amendment offered was the Pickle-Pepper amendment in \nthe House of Representatives. I voted with Mr. Pepper and against \nraising the retirement age.\n  Mr. GRAMM. You voted for final passage on the bill on March 24. My \npoint is, we are going to have to do this. Everybody knows we are going \nto have to do it. Should we wait until there is a crisis so that we \nwill literally do what the Senator from Illinois says and make the \nchange so it will go into effect immediately?\n  That is what is going to happen when you look at the exploding \ndeficit of Medicare. We will have a $1.6 trillion loss to the Treasury \nin trying to maintain the program in the next 10 years alone.\n  Our colleagues are not telling us that by the year 2025 when we will \nbe going into the final phase up, we will have to triple the payroll \ntax--triple the payroll tax--to pay for Medicare if we don't begin to \nmake changes. They are not proposing today to triple the payroll tax. \nThey are simply saying, ``Don't act now, wait until there's a crisis; \nwait until Medicare is flat on its back and then make the change.''\n  Let me tell you why we can't do that. We can't do it because the \nphase in is already underway in Social Security, something that both \nHouses of Congress approved, and the President signed. It was voted for \non a bipartisan basis raising the effective retirement age for full \nretirement benefits to 67. That is already the law of the land, and \nthat phase up begins very slowly, a matter of months each year, very \nslowly, but it begins in the year 2003.\n\n[[Page S6120]]\n\n  If we wait, we are going to end up doing what our colleague accuses \nus of today. But the truth is, by doing it now, for those who will have \nto wait an additional 2 years, they will have 30 years to adjust. This \nis the responsible way to do it. It is the way it should be done, and I \nhope it will be done. If we don't do it, we will be back here in 3 or 4 \nyears doing it under crisis circumstances and doing it immediately.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Texas has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set aside \ntemporarily the motion before us to consider a technical amendment that \nhas been cleared on both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 431\n\n             (Purpose: To provide for managers' amendments)\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Moynihan and myself and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself and Mr. \n     Moynihan, proposes an amendment numbered 431.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard. The clerk will read \nthe amendment.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to read the amendment.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I withdraw my objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is withdrawn.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, none of this time is charged, I \nassume, to the waiver amendment that the Senator from Delaware has \nproposed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as you can imagine, drafting a piece of \nlegislation this large in such a short timeframe and having to \nincorporate over 50 amendments resulted in some technical errors and \nomissions. The items contained in this amendment are those which are \ntechnical in nature, and replace inadvertent omissions or are necessary \nto bring the legislation into compliance with the committee's budget \ninstructions.\n  The amendments accepted or adopted in the committee markup were done \nso with the proviso they would not bring the committee out of \ncompliance with its instruction.\n  Therefore, now that the Congressional Budget Office has completed \nscoring of the entire package, certain revisions to these amendments \nare necessary. A description of the items contained in this amendment \nis located on each Senator's desk.\n  I ask this amendment be adopted and be considered original text for \nthe purpose of amendment.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 431) was agreed to.\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6105-6", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, \napproximately 6 hours remain for debate with respect to the Balanced \nBudget Act, basically equally divided. There are approximately 30 \nminutes remaining on the motion to waive the Budget Act with respect to \nthe Medicare age increase issue. Therefore, a vote will occur on that \nmotion to waive around 3 o'clock, or maybe shortly before that.\n  As was mentioned in both luncheons today, the Senate will remain in \nsession this evening until all time is consumed. If any Senator intends \nto offer an amendment after the time has expired, they will be required \nto do so this evening. It will then be my intention to stack all votes \non the amendments and the final passage, after the time has expired \nthis evening, until approximately 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday.\n  So all debate time and all amendments will be offered tonight, and \nthen we will begin a series of votes at 9:30. We don't know exactly how \nmany amendments that could entail. It could be as few as five, I hope. \nIt could be many more than that. We will begin voting at 9:30 and \ncontinue voting until we complete all the amendment votes and final \npassage. Then, of course, we will go to the taxpayers' relief act.\n  Senators can expect additional votes today and a series of votes \nbeginning at 9:30 on Wednesday, the last of the series being final \npassage of the Balanced Budget Act.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to ask the majority leader a \nquestion. As I understand it, suppose somebody has an amendment this \nafternoon and is prepared to go to a vote this afternoon; would there \nbe a vote this afternoon?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes, there can certainly be votes this afternoon. In fact, \nwe expect votes throughout the afternoon, probably until all time has \nexpired, or around 8:30 this evening. So you could have votes at least \nuntil 7 or 7:30, and then we will put the rest of the votes over until \n9:30.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n\n                     Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to address the matter before \nus, and I believe the time is running anyway, is it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time is being charged against the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act, which is the pending business.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask that I might have 5 minutes on Senator Roth's time \non this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized to speak for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there is an organization set up to report \nto the Congress every year on the status of Social Security and the \nstatus of Medicare. This group is a very distinguished group. It \nconsists of the Secretary of the Treasury; the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services; the Secretary of Labor, or Acting Secretary of Labor; \nand the Commissioner of Social Security, or the Acting Commissioner of \nSocial Security. These are the people, plus two members of the public. \nI might say, of the first four--and there are six in all--four of these \nare Democrats. They are not Republicans; they are Democrats. They \nsubmitted a report to us in the Congress in April of this year. What \ndid they say?\n\n       As we have reported for the last several years, one of the \n     Medicare trust funds, the Hospital Insurance--\n\n  The HI, the so called part A.\n\n     will be exhausted in 4 years without legislation that \n     addresses its fiscal imbalance.\n\n  This isn't a bunch of right wing Republicans saying there is trouble\n\n[[Page S6121]]\n\nahead. These are the very prestigious, qualified Cabinet Members of the \nPresident of the United States--every single one of them a Democrat. It \ngoes on to say:\n\n       We are urging the earliest possible enactment of \n     legislation to further control Hospital Insurance program \n     costs because of the nearness of the Hospital Insurance Trust \n     Fund exhaustion date.\n\n  Mr. President, these are serious matters. They go on to explain why \nthis is happening.\n  On page 6 of its report it says:\n\n       Why do costs rise faster than income? The primary reason \n     for these costs of Social Security and the Hospital Insurance \n     costs are because of the baby boom generation retirees, \n     while the number of workers paying payroll taxes grows \n     more slowly.\n\n  Mr. President, we are facing an emergency here. This legislation, \nwhich came from the Finance Committee, proposes to do something about \nit. What is the situation? In 1950, which is 47 years ago, there were \n16 workers for every retiree--16 workers in the United States paying \ninto the Hospital Insurance Fund and paying into Social Security.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I will.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to yield control of the bill to \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee, even to the extent of his \nyielding time off the bill, if he sees fit. He may run out of time, and \nSenator Breaux may need time. I am going to leave for about a half \nhour, so you can take it off the bill if you need it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. As I said, 47 years ago, in 1950, there were 16 workers \nfor every retiree. Today, there are 3 workers for every retiree--not \n16, but 3. Twenty-eight years from now, in the year 2025, the ratio \nwill fall to two workers for every retiree. So something has to be done \nif this Medicare trust fund is going to survive.\n  What we have proposed is increasing the Medicare eligibility age to \nconform with that of Social Security. In 1983, we raised the age of \nSocial Security eligibility gradually. It comes into full force in the \nyear 2025. By the year 2025, the retirement age will be 67, not the 65 \nthat it is today.\n  We have proposed that the Medicare Program step up in similar \nfashion. The key thing, Mr. President, is to take these actions now; \ndon't wait until the baby boomers are all there collecting and we can't \ndo anything about it. Now, if we act, we can take these very gradual \nsteps. For example, the first step will be in 2003, 6 years from now, \nwhen the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare will go from \n65 to 65 and 2 months. Then it goes up to 65 and 10 months by the year \n2007. Then we take a break for 11 years--excuse me. In 2008, it will be \nat age 66, and then gradually it goes up by 2 months and 4 months and 6 \nmonths until the year 2025, when the retirement age for Social \nSecurity----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair advises the Senator that his 5 \nminutes have elapsed.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask unanimous consent that I may have 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Social Security is already set. That goes to 67. We did \nthat in 1983. That goes to age 67 in 2025. What we do in this program \nis to have Medicare conform to that.\n  Mr. President, unless we take these actions, there isn't going to be \nany Medicare for the future. A lot of people say, ``Do nothing.'' Well, \nI think that is totally reckless. Other people can say, ``Well, just \nincrease the tax.'' That would mean increasing the tax on Medicare by \n250 percent. That is what would be required to increase the payroll \ntax. It would have to be increased from the current amount of 1.45 \npercent of payroll to 3.6 percent, which is nearly a threefold \nincrease.\n  So, Mr. President, this is a very wise provision that we did, in a \nbipartisan manner, in the Finance Committee, and I certainly hope that \nit will withstand any attacks. I thank the Chair and I thank the \ndistinguished chairman of our committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I support the Senator \nfrom Illinois in his attempt to keep the age of Medicare eligibility at \n65.\n  Mr. President, raising the eligibility age to 67 in the future is \npart of the bill that is before us and was an amendment offered by the \nSenator from Texas, Senator Gramm.\n  Now, had the Senator from Texas and his supporters had an alternative \nin place for those who would be unable in the future to get Medicare \nbetween the ages of 65 and 67--if there was an alternative in place, if \nthis bill said that we will, in fact, raise that age, but only after we \nhave an alternative in place for those people, I would be here \nsupporting it.\n  But it is so reckless, Mr. President, to take away Medicare from \npeople who pay for it their entire working lives--to take it away from \nthem for 2 years unless there is an alternative in place. I do not know \nif any of my colleagues know about our health insurance, but we have a \npretty good plan around here. As a matter of fact, I voted in during \nthe health care debate to offer that plan to every American. That \ndidn't fly. ``Oh, we are covered. What do we have to worry about? We \nare fine.'' But to take away Medicare from people who have been paying \nfor it out into the future without any way to replace it, I don't know \nwhat we are doing here.\n  The Senator from Texas says he is concerned about the solvency of \nMedicare. That is what the Senator from Rhode Island said--if we care \nabout solvency, we will support this. We all know there are many ways \nto address solvency.\n  By the way, the committee does it in some other areas that I support, \nbut not this one.\n  My friends, it isn't that tricky to preserve the solvency of \nMedicare. If you want to really preserve the solvency, raise the \neligibility age to 90, and for the people who are on Medicare at 90--\nthere will be enough money to take care of them because everyone else \nwho would have been eligible previously, will have died.\n  Medicare solvency is the new mantra of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. First they want to vote against Medicare --now they \nsay they are going to save it. They are going to make it solvent by \ntelling people that in the future without any alternative means of \nhealth insurance in place, no universal health care, that they have to \nwait until they are 67 to be eligible for Medicare.\n  Medicare remains solvent because they don't talk about what happens \nto you when you can't get insurance and you don't get preventive care \nand you get sicker. What are people going to do? Either they have to go \nout and find it in the marketplace and pay thousands and thousands of \ndollars to get coverage, or they will fall down on their hands and \nknees and pray to God that they don't get sick.\n  That is not an option because, unfortunately, if you look at the \ntables and you see when Alzheimer's strikes, when Parkinson's strikes, \nwhen stroke strikes, when heart disease strikes, when prostate cancer \nstrikes, and even when breast cancer strikes, the older you get the \nmore you are apt to get these conditions. You cannot control it.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island said we have to save Medicare. What \nabout saving the people who are served by Medicare?\n  So this part of the Finance Committee bill puts the cart before the \nhorse. Don't just say we are going to raise the age at which people can \nget Medicare and have nothing in its stead and not even make it \ncontingent on having universal health care in place because when people \nreach the age of 65 they will not have an option.\n  Mr. President, we ought to look at what we are doing around here. It \nsounds great, ``save Medicare.'' I think we need to save the people who \nrely on Medicare.\n  We all know the horror stories of people getting sick. They don't \nexpect it. And then they try to tie it to the increased age of Social \nSecurity retirement which we phased in, which I support--phasing it in. \nBut there is one difference. People can still retire at age 62. If they \nchoose to retire at that age and go on Social Security, there is\n\n[[Page S6122]]\n\na penalty but it can be done. There is no such provision in here. This \nis just a cutoff. The proposal does not say if you need Medicare you \ncan get half coverage; you can pay 50 percent of your premium. No. This \njust takes people off the plan without any alternative--at a time in \ntheir life when they are apt to get seriously sick. If you have ever \nbeen in a hospital and you see some of these charges that come back at \nyou, thousands of dollars a day, we will put people into ruin. We will \ngo back to the days when people have to in fact rely on their children \ntaking care of them at the height of their lives when they need \nMedicare and they cannot get it.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Senator from \nIllinois. I want to save Medicare because I believe in it. I do not \nwant to hurt the people who need Medicare. When you have something in \nplace for those people to go to, when you have an alternative insurance \nplan, I'll am with you all the way. I will support you 100 percent.\n  We already have 40 million people who are uninsured in this country. \nThey have no health insurance. You are going to throw 7 million more of \nthese people onto the uninsured rolls, and you are going to do it in \nthe name of saving Medicare.\n  Something is wrong with this picture. It doesn't add up. My friend \nfrom Illinois calls it the ``Texas two-step.'' I think it is the \n``backward step.'' It is going back--back to the days when our senior \ncitizens were very sick with no place to go.\n  I hope you will support the motion by the Senator from Illinois.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware will be advised that \nthe time remaining under his control is 4 minutes and 22 seconds. The \nSenator may take time off the bill.\n  Mr. BREAUX. How much time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Four minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. ROTH. How many minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 4 minutes approximately left. The \nSenator may take time off the bill itself.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield a total of 5 minutes with 1 minute being off the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I thank the chairman \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. President, this is really an interesting dialog because on the \none hand we have some facts that are uncontested; that is, if we do not \ndo anything to fix Medicare, it is not going to be around for anybody \nby the year 2001 because that is the year when, if we do not do \nanything, we are not going to have enough money in the Medicare Program \nto pay benefits to nobody.\n  So it is very clear that Congress now has to do something if it is \ngoing to be around for everybody who is counting on it when they reach \nretirement age.\n\n  It is really interesting. In the Finance Committee we have had people \ncome before the committee all of the time saying, ``You all have to fix \nMedicare. If is very important. It is the lifeblood or lifeline for \nseniors in this country.''\n  Then we ask them when they tell us to fix it, ``All right. Do you \nwant to increase premiums?\"\n  ``No. We don't want you to do that.''\n  Then we say, ``Well, would you want to decrease the payments going to \ndoctors and hospitals?\"\n  They generally say, ``Don't do that either because doctors and \nhospitals will soon quit treating Medicare patients because they are \nnot getting paid enough for those services.''\n  Then we say, ``Well, would you like us to increase the age limit of \npeople who are eligible for Medicare?\"\n  They say, ``Oh. No. Don't do that.''\n  But then, the bottom line: They say when they leave the committee \nroom, ``Be sure you fix it, by the way. Make sure it doesn't go broke \nin the year 2001. Fix it. But don't, don't, don't do anything that is \nnecessary in order to fix it.''\n  That is an impossible suggestion for the members of the committee and \nthe Members of Congress to adopt. If we do nothing it will not be \naround for anyone.\n  In 1965, when Congress in its wisdom passed the Medicare Program, the \nlife expectancy for people at that time was 66.8 years of age for men; \n73 years of age for women. So Congress in its wisdom at that time said, \n``Well, let's make an appropriate date for the beginning of Medicare \nbenefits at 65.''\n  Guess what has happened since 1965? For every year the life \nexpectancy of Americans has increased. But the eligibility age for \nMedicare has not been increased one time. We did it for Social \nSecurity. What this committee does is to say, ``Let's put the glidepath \nfor Medicare eligibility the same as Social Security, recognizing that \npeople in fact live substantially longer and draw Medicare benefits \nsubstantially longer, I might add as well. It almost sounds like we are \ngetting these calls in our offices from people who are retiring, none \nof which are affected by this amendment--not a single one because they \nalready are on Medicare. In fact, it goes down quite a ways before \nanybody is affected whatsoever.\n  An interesting point is that it sounds like we are talking about \nhaving all of this going into effect immediately, when just the \nopposite is true. The amendment that was offered, I guess by Members \nfrom our side, takes 24 years to increase it 24 months. It doesn't \nincrease it the first year to the age 67. You start off right where you \nare today, and it is increased 2 months a year and over 4 years we get \nto the age of 67 which is comparable to what we have in Social \nSecurity.\n  Would it be nice if we didn't have to do that? Sure. Would it be nice \nif we didn't have to do anything to fix Medicare? Absolutely. The \nproblem is we have a system that is in the tank as far as being able to \nsurvive, if we do not do anything. It would be wonderful to say make no \nchanges and everybody continues to get exactly what you get at the time \nyou are eligible for it. That is not an option. None of the options are \neasy. This one I would argue is far easier than any of the others, and \nit helps allow for Medicare to continue for a long period of time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Did the Senator say under his proposal that for each year \nthat the age increased by 2 months?\n  Mr. BREAUX. Two months per year.\n  Mr. HARKIN. In 6 years it would increase by 1 year and, therefore, in \n12 years it would increase by 2 years, not 24 years.\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is increased 2 years over 24--2 months. The whole \nthing takes 24 years to get to the age 67; 24 years before 67. It takes \n24 years to reach the age of 67, however that calculates out.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is 1 month per year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes off the regular time to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the point \nof order that has been raised against this provision.\n  Raising the eligibility age from 65 to 67 is fair. Raising it, too, \nfrom 65 to 67 will change the future course of this program and enable \nus to say that we are taking a long-term as well as a short-term view; \nand enables us to accomplish the objectives that we were instructed to \naccomplish which is to preserve and protect Medicare.\n  If you want to have universal health insurance as the objective, I am \nfor that. I would love to change the eligibility under law saying if \nyou are American, or a legal resident, you are in. But I can't keep \nMedicare, Medicaid, VA, and income tax deduction all sitting out there.\n  This establishes I believe a basis for us to be able to say that for \nthe long-term Medicare is a solvent program, and it is eminently fair.\n  As the Senator from Louisiana pointed out, in 1965 the life \nexpectancy for men was 67; for women it was 76; today it is 73 for men, \nand it is 80 for women. It is going to be even greater. We are enabling \npeople to live longer and\n\n[[Page S6123]]\n\nlonger as the consequences have changed in behavior and with changes in \nhealth care technology. And, as a result, the Medicare Program as well \nneeds to be adjusted.\n  For those who have come expressing the concern for people not being \nable to get health care from 65 to 67, that problem exists today from \n62 to 65 and sometimes even earlier. We have in this law a commission \nand there is language in the law as well to recommend strongly to this \ncommission to consider allowing people to buy into Medicare. There is \nplenty of time for us to get that done.\n  For Americans that are listening to this debate, if you are 65--if \nyou are 64 today, your eligibility age is 65. If you are 63, your \neligibility age is 65. If you are 62, your eligibility age is 65. If \nyou are 61, it is 65. If you are 60, it is still 65, all the way down \nto 59. If you are 59 years of age and you are listening to this debate, \nplease don't fall into the trap of presuming that all of a sudden your \neligibility age is going to go to 67. It is still 65. If you are 58, it \ngoes to 65 years and 2 months. The Senator from Iowa and the Senator \nfrom Louisiana engaged in a colloquy earlier. This thing does not fully \nphase in until the year 2024 or 2025.\n  Mr. President, I have had many people come up to me and ask, many \npeople call and ask, why is this necessary? Well, I have a fact. I have \na very difficult fact I have to deal with. Again, the objective here is \nto preserve and protect Medicare. That is the idea. This law has lots \nof great provisions to move to market and get more competition, lots of \nterrific provisions in it that I think will enable us to seek customers \nand consumers who like Medicare more than they do as a result of \nchoice, great cost controls in here, some courageous efforts on \ndisproportionate share in this bill.\n  There are lots of good things in the bill. But the fact out there in \nthe future that all of us need to accommodate and think about as we \ndecide how we are going to vote on this amendment is that from the year \n2010 to the year 2030--that is 20 years--the baby boomers retire. You \ncan't change that number. The 76 or 77 million of them that will \nretire, they will become eligible for Medicare in that 20-year time \nperiod. We are going to have an increase in the number of Americans who \nare in the work force of 5 million people, and the number of retirees \nwill increase 22 million over that period of time.\n  That is a fact, Mr. President. I may wish it wasn't so. I may wish it \nwas a different number, but that is the number. Unless you are prepared \nto come down here and argue for a tax increase or some other change, \nyou have got to move the eligibility age in order to be able to \npreserve and protect Medicare out in the future.\n  It is an imminently fair thing to do given what has happened with \nlife expectancy. If we were putting Medicare into law today, I don't \nbelieve we would put this program, given the costs of the program, in \nplace at age 65. This does not affect Americans immediately. It is \nphased in. It gives people a chance to plan. Those who argue that it \ndoesn't have a budget impact and use that as a reason not to support \nthis provision are wrong. It is precisely because we are phasing it in, \nthat it produces long-term savings, that they should support it. We are \ngiving people a chance to plan. We are saying we are going to adjust \nthe law in order to be able to account for this change out in the \nfuture.\n  I hope that my colleagues will resist the political temptation to \ncast an easy vote and will enable this provision to remain in this law. \nIt is one of the most significant long-term changes that we make in \nMedicare. And whether you are a Republican or whether you are a \nDemocrat, you ought to be standing on this floor saying I want to be \nremembered out there in the future for casting a vote that did \nsomething good. ``No'' on the motion to strike this provision is the \ncourageous position.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts 4 minutes, \nMr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we are moving through this debate, we \nhave to recognize that in the proposal before us, we have a number of \nattacks on Medicare, with all due respect to our colleagues. We \naddressed one earlier today. Collecting $5 billion under Medicare. You \nare going to permit double billing, which this body has long refused to \ndo in order to protect our senior citizens. Now we are going to permit \ndoubling billings.\n  The Finance Committee failed to make up the $1.5 billion that was \npart of the budget agreement. It refused to do that, and now we have a \nproposal to change the eligibility age from 65 to 67.\n  I thought we had a commission that was going to study the long-term \nimplications of Medicare. The President submitted a program that \nprovides for the financial stability of Medicare for 10 years. We can \nconsider a variety of different options. I daresay that I don't happen \nto be one who thinks you should just increase the age of eligibility or \notherwise increase the taxes as some have suggested. We know that 90 \npercent of Medicare recipients cost $1,400 a year, the other 10 percent \nmore than $36,000. You do something about that 10 percent to reduce \ndisability, and chronic illness, and you are going to have a dramatic \nimpact in terms of Medicare spending.\n  That has not even been considered here, Mr. President. Why should we, \nat a time when we are increasing the total number of Americans who are \nuninsured, take action in the Senate that is going to add to that \nproblem. The idea that this can be compared to Social Security makes no \nsense, and the Senator from Louisiana understands that. You can retire \nnow at 62 and get some benefits, but you can't with regard to Medicare. \nIt is basically a lifeline to our senior citizens. The Finance \nCommittee failed to give any assurance to those millions of people who \nare watching today that they are not going to be sent right off the \ncliff.\n  With all of the signed contracts containing terms to terminate health \ninsurance in corporate America now at 65, all the workers across this \ncountry whose contracts end health care coverage at 65, and nothing \nfrom the Finance Committee gives them any kind of assurances that there \nhas been any attention to what is going to happen to them.\n  Sure, pull up the ladder. We can make this Medicare financially \nsecure by just continuing increase the age from 65 to 67 to 69. Let us \nlook at this over the long term, not the short term, and let us stop \nthis wholesale assault on Medicare that is part of this whole proposal. \nIt makes no sense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized to speak \nfor 4 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I want to echo what the Senator from \nMassachusetts just said. If anything, this provision is the ultimate \nanti-blue-collar provision that I have ever seen on the Senate floor. \nThis strikes right at the heart of the Americans we ought to be here \nprotecting today. There is a difference. There is a difference between \na corporate executive for Xerox and someone who is out there working \nhard every day of their life on a construction job, in a factory, in a \nplant. There is a difference between a Senator sitting on this floor or \na Member of the House and that worker who is out there on the line day \nafter day, the women who suffer from carpel tunnel syndrome, the people \nwho work in our packing plants. Try that on for size. Do that for 5 \nyears, 10 years, 20, 30, 40 years of your life. There is a difference.\n  Sure, if you are a corporate executive, you have nothing to worry \nabout. If you are a Senator, you have nothing to worry about. But I \nwill tell you, if you are a blue-collar worker out there and you have \nworked hard all your life, you have raised your kids, you have sent \nthem to school, you are now 62, you are worn out, maybe you are not \nphysically able to continue working. Have you ever thought of that? So \nthey retire. They get Social Security. God bless them. But they can't \nget health care coverage.\n  What this amendment does, it just sticks it right in their back one \nmore\n\n[[Page S6124]]\n\ntime. You can say, oh, it's just 1 more month a year, 2 more months a \nyear for 6 years. Then there is this gap and it takes all this time. \nBut if this provision stays in there, the die will be cast. And we will \nhave sent a strong message to our seniors: Sorry, when it comes to \nhealth care, you're out of luck; you're on the street some place.\n  We have a commission, a national bipartisan commission looking at \nthis. It is supposed to report next year. Why are we jumping the gun on \nit?\n  Now, I would agree with Senators who are supporting this provision \nthat, yes, we have to do things to ensure the viability of Medicare. \nThere are a lot of things we can do to preserve the viability of \nMedicare. But this is not one of them. This will destroy Medicare \nbecause it destroys the compact we have had all these years. This is an \nantiworker provision. That is all it is.\n  Now, if you want to vote for this provision, sure, fine, keep it in \nthe bill, but I am telling you, for that working stiff who is out there \nwho wants to retire, their physical health may not be the best; they \nhave to retire at age 62, if anything, what we ought to be doing on \nthis Senate floor is we ought to be closing the gap. We ought to \nprovide medical care for elderly who have to retire early. But, no, we \nwon't even do that. Now we are going to make it even a longer period of \ntime. Well, I think this provision is really unconscionable, should \nhave no place in this bill, and I hope that we will vote to strke it \noverwhelmingly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Is the Senator aware that there are 40 million uninsured \nAmericans today and about 7 million in this category age 65 to 67? So \nthe Senator is so right. We are talking about adding millions more to \nthe uninsured rolls. This committee did nothing, mentioned nothing \nabout any kind of way to get people through this timeframe. They just \ntook it out without even writing anything in there that said only if we \nhave replacement insurance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from California. \nIt just seems that when I hear this debate about this provision and I \nhear proponents of this provision talk, it is as if everybody in \nAmerica is like us. Everybody in America is not like us. They do not \nhave the kind of health care benefits we have. They do not have the \nkind of protections we have. They do not have the incomes that we have. \nThey do not have the lifestyles we have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Iowa has expired.\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is time we start fighting for the working people in \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nPennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized to \nspeak for 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, we have all now just seen and heard why it is so hard \nto change anything in Washington. Because anything you try to do is \nwrong. You can look at all the facts. And the Senators from Louisiana \nand Nebraska and Texas and New Mexico and Delaware laid out chart after \nchart. For anyone listening to this debate, the facts stare you smack \nin the face. This fund runs out of money in the year 2001 with the baby \nboomers retiring in the year 2010. This program is not sustainable in \nits current form. Everybody who can read a simple arithmetic chart can \nunderstand that. Yet, you have everybody flying to the floor saying, \noh, yes, it is a problem, but not this.\n  Well, then, what? We are going to raise taxes? How many are for \nraising taxes? There will be a few over there who want to raise taxes. \nBut that is the option: Raise taxes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts talked about rationing care. It is \nthose people who use all that Medicare who are the problem. And unless \nwe start rationing that care, we are not going to get to the problem \nhere. So we can ration care to people who are over 65. That is another \noption. Or we can cut reimbursements to providers. The Senator from \nLouisiana talked about that. But if we do that, all of us know if you \ncut reimbursements to providers, people cannot get care because they \ncannot afford to provide the care and rural hospitals close, inner-city \nhospitals close. So you cannot take that option.\n  We can cut benefits. How many here are for cutting back Medicare \nbenefits? OK. Well, so there we are. What are we going to do? We have a \nproblem. It is not going to go away. We can sit here and demagog on the \nissue and say, well, this is not the right thing.\n  The only reasonable course is to look at the demographics and see \nthat I, right here, am the first Member of the Senate who is going to \nretire at age 65--right here, age 39, born in 1958. I will retire at \nthe age of 67. I am ready, willing, and able to take on that \nresponsibility. I feel I have been adequately warned, giving myself \nabout 30 years in advance to be able to figure this out. And I think we \nare capable of taking it. I am not going to live as my mother and my \nfather and those before me, whose life expectancies were, as I think \nthe Senator from Nebraska said, 73 for a female, 68 for a male. At age \n65, my life expectancy, the Lord willing, as a group anyway, is going \nto be well over 80. I am quite willing and prepared as a generation to \nsave my generation, the folks who are paying the bills, big-time bills \nthat previous generations did not pay. We are paying 1.45 percent of \nevery single dollar we earn. And I would like to say for that dollar \nyou are going to have a program that is going to be there and provide \nadequate benefits when you retire, and, yes, I am willing to take a \nlittle sacrifice. I am willing to pay a little bit more, but I am also \nwilling to take my share of sacrifice to make sure that it is there for \nnot just me but for everyone else in my generation and future \ngenerations.\n  What we are talking about here is being responsible, not standing up \nand demagoging to get votes back home. We have got a problem. There are \npeople in my generation who are tired of this language.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I ask for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Pennsylvania \nexpired. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. One additional minute? May have 1 additional minute?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I go around and I have talked to hundreds of high \nschool students, thousands of them. I have been to over 100 high \nschools since I have been in office. I ask them, how many believe \nMedicare and Social Security will be here when you retire? Not a hand \ngoes up. I ask them, how many believe in UFOs? And about 20 percent of \nthe class raise their hand. They believe we are all just joking around, \nthat any time a serious issue comes up about their long-term future, we \nrun away. We hide behind our desk and wait for the bombs to explode \naround us.\n  Stand up for the future. Stand up for these young people who pay and \nare going to be paying the rest of their lives very dearly for this \nprogram, and stand up and make sure it is healthy for them.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself just a couple of minutes because I \nlistened with interest. One could not avoid listening.\n  The fact of the matter is, it is so easy, so easy to stand here at \n$135,000 a year with all kinds of benefits and everything and say, ``I \nam willing to sacrifice, I am willing to sacrifice. I am willing to do \nwhat I have to. I have 35 years.'' Go down to the factory and talk to \nsomebody who is hanging on to his job by his fingernails, ask the poor \nfellow who has been downgraded as companies shrink their size. I love \nthese heroics we get in this place, big speeches on lofty pinnacles. \nTalk to the people who are doing the work every day, bringing home the \nlunch pail, and see what we have.\n  Sacrifice? I'll tell you how to sacrifice. Cut the benefits here. Cut \nthem now. Stand up and say we will take less for our health insurance \nand our retirement and everything else. If you want to pull a nice \nheroic stand--somebody's\n\n[[Page S6125]]\n\nlast stand--stand up here and recommend a cut in benefits instead of \ntalking about, shrieking about, how people have to sacrifice--from this \nlofty place.\n  I will not say anything further. I yield 2 minutes to my friend from \nIowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I will not even take 2 minutes. I listened \nto the impassioned argument of my friend from Pennsylvania. I just had \ntwo observations. No. 1, along the lines of what Senator Lautenberg \nsaid, No. 1, what retirement income will a Senator have when a Senator \nretires here? What is that retirement income going to be? A lot of \nmoney. When a Senator retires at age 65, you get a lot of money--big \ntime money for retirement. It is not a blue collar worker retiring on \nSocial Security, No. 1.\n  No. 2, if you retire as a Federal Government employee or as a U.S. \nSenator, you can keep your Federal employee's health benefits. There is \nno gap for you. You can keep it. It costs you, what, $100-something a \nmonth, $110, $120 a month. So it is easy for a Senator to stand here \nand talk about saving his generation. But those in his generation are \nnot all U.S. Senators. Those in his generation are not all people who \ncan go on Federal Employee health benefits when they reach age 62. They \nneed Medicare. That is where most of America is, not sitting in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the bill to the \nSenator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have heard a lot of passion on both \nsides of this issue. I understand the passion that this issue \ngenerates. But I hope we will think quietly for a moment of where we \nare headed in this country.\n  We have heard pleas to think of the working people. I agree with \nthat. I came to this Congress wanting to fight for the working people \nof my State. The question is, how do we best do that? The hard reality \nis, Medicare is headed for a cliff. Social Security has problems and \nthey have problems because, No. 1, people are living longer. I was \nasked moments ago, why do you favor this change in Medicare \neligibility? It is very simple. People are living longer. In 1965, when \nwe started with Medicare, a male in this country could expect to live \nto be 66.8 years of age. A female, 73.8. In 1996, a male could be \nexpected to live to the age of 72.5, a female to the age of 79.3.\n\n  In 2025, when this change is fully phased in, a male is projected to \nlive to 75.6 years of age, a female to 81.5. These are facts. They are \nindisputable. People are living longer, and the hard reality is, this \nprogram that we have put in place only extends the solvency of Medicare \nfor 10 years. This provision is an attempt to deal with the longer term \nproblem of Medicare, just as we have done it with Social Security, to \nslowly phase in and move up the age of eligibility to treat Medicare \nentitlement the same way we treat Social Security. Why? Because we do \ncare about working people, because we do care about providing for those \nwho are less fortunate, because we do care about preserving and \nprotecting Medicare. That is precisely why this Finance Committee \nagreed, on a bipartisan basis, to extend the age of retirement for \nMedicare eligibility.\n  We have another problem. The other problem is a demographic time \nbomb, and that demographic time bomb is the baby boom generation. As I \nlook around this Chamber, there are a number of baby boomers here. All \nof us in the U.S. Senate understand, if we fail to act, all of these \nprograms are going to be in deep trouble. The harsh reality is, the \nnumber of people eligible for these programs is going to double in very \nshort order. Starting in the year 2012, when the baby boomers start to \nretire, the number of people eligible for these programs is going to \ndouble. The entitlements commission told us 2 years ago that in the \nyear 2012, if we fail to act, every penny is going to go for \nentitlements and interest on the debt. There is not going to be any \nmoney for parks. There is not going to be any money for highways. There \nis not going to be any money for education. There is not going to be \nany money for law enforcement. There is not going to be any money for \none thing after another. If that is the course we want to stay on, \nagree with this amendment.\n  Some people say let's wait for a commission. Two years ago we had a \ncommission. We had the entitlements commission. What did they tell us? \nThey told us, if you fail to act, you are headed for a cliff. Now we \ncan choose to continue to fail to act. If we do, we know the results. \nThere is no question what will happen. We will go right over the cliff. \nUnfortunately, it will not be just us going over the cliff, but we will \nbe taking our fellow Americans right with us.\n  We do not need another commission. It is time to act. It is time to \nprotect Medicare for the long term. It is time to reject this \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to support the point of \norder by Senator Durbin to strike the language increasing the \neligibility age of Medicare from 65 to 67.\n  I oppose raising the eligibility age because it breaks the promise of \nhealth insurance at age 65 for all Americans. The change was made to \nbalance the budget. It was not to make a better, more efficient health \ncare system. The change will hurt people who work hard and play by the \nrules.\n  In 1965, our country realized that it was important to make sure that \nall Americans over the age of 65 had health insurance. For those \nAmericans that did not have the ability to purchase health insurance, \nMedicare was there.\n  It was a promise that America's seniors had somewhere to go. Now, we \nare breaking that promise. I can't support that. Promises made must be \npromises kept.\n  We can't turn our backs on people who have planned their lives \ndepending on our promises.\n  This change wasn't done to help people. It wasn't done to improve the \nsystem. It wasn't done to make sure that seniors in Maryland and the \ncountry will have a longer and happier life.\n  It was done to balance the budget. It was done to save a few dollars.\n  No thought was given to the real life effects on America's seniors.\n  Raising the eligibility age hurts people when they need insurance \nmost: in their sixties, at the end of their working lives.\n  Retirees cannot afford insurance at that age if they can even find \nit.\n  What do we say to the factory workers and construction workers whose \nbodies are worn down by age 60?\n  Now when they need insurance the most, it isn't there. The government \njust moved the Medicare age another 2 years away.\n  Before we start to make big changes in Medicare, we need to talk to \nthe most important people to consider: The people who use the program.\n  We need to ask them what works, what could be better, and what we \nshould change.\n  We need to have a national bipartisan debate on what Medicare should \nlook like.\n  We need Presidential leadership.\n  I want the people of Maryland to be a part of that debate.\n  That way, if we need to make big changes, everyone will have had a \nchance to speak up and be heard.\n  Everyone will understand the changes.\n  Raising the eligibility age penalizes the citizens of Maryland and \nthe rest of the country who have worked hard, saved, and played by the \nrules.\n  I ask the other Senators to join me and Senators Durbin and Reed to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Let's strike the increase in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to \n67.\n  We do not serve in the Senate to tell Americans, ``we needed a few \nmore dollars for our budget so you'll have to change your plans.''\n  We should listen to people, debate options, and make the hard choices \nopenly.\n  Let's not change the rules during the middle of the game and the \nmiddle of the night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n[[Page S6126]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That will consume all the time of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I understand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have listened to a number of my \ncolleagues come to the floor and say we are heading toward the cliff, \nwe have to do this because people are living longer and, if we do not \ndo this, we are not going to be able to save Medicare.\n  It is true that people are living longer. But it is not true that \nthis is the only way to save Medicare. The notion that we have to be \nforced to have a choice on the floor of the Senate, with the idea that, \nin order to make up for a fixed amount of money that we are supposed to \nfind to make up for cutting, that we have to take it out of that gap \nbetween the age of 65 and 67, is absolutely specious. What they have \ndecided to do is find a fixed amount of money so we can give an $85 \nbillion tax cut. I mean, the tax bill is not on the floor today, but \nthis is related to the tax bill. The fact is, we are going to find our \ncapacity to give back $85 billion, the lion's share of which will go to \nthe wealthiest people in America under the current construction. And, \nin order to do that, we are forced to come here and tell people who are \n65 years old, in the future--even if it begins for somebody who is 60 \nor 65 today, if you are 61 and you are looking at the time when you are \n67 then you will be eligible for Medicare, you are forced to go out and \nfind it somewhere in the marketplace. For a whole lot of people in \nAmerica that age they cannot find it in the marketplace. They cannot \nafford it. There is no provision in this measure that provides some \nkind of stopgap capacity for those people to be able to afford the \npremiums they will be charged in the marketplace.\n  So the choice of the U.S. Senate is, so we can give an $85 billion \ntax bonanza to a lot of people in America, people between the age of 65 \nand 67 in the future are going to have to do whatever they can to get \nhealth care. Do whatever you can; we are cutting you off. We are moving \nexactly in the opposite direction from what everybody in the health \ncare industry in this country says--that we ought to be covering more \npeople, not less. What is the rationale for that? What is the \nphilosophical connection between saying we want more people covered in \ntheir health care in America, particularly in the later years of their \nlife, but we are going to come along here now and facilitate this great \ntax give-back by making sure that we fix Medicare. What is the \nconnection between the tax and the Medicare?\n  Everybody says we have to fix it. Well, it is money that is \navailable. This is a zero sum game. There is money here. There is money \nthere. You have the ability to find it if you want to. You do not have \nto necessarily do that, but, instead, we are making a choice to do it.\n  I recognize obviously people are living longer. I know what the \ndemographics say about Medicare in the long run. Maybe in the long run \nthe commission would come back and say it makes sense to lift the age \nbut it also makes sense to guarantee that nobody falls through the \ncracks. The way you are going to guarantee that nobody falls through \nthe cracks is raise the premiums on the richest people in America, for \nwhom the average person is paying for their ability to be able to ride \nthe Medicare train, and ask them to contribute more so the people who \nwill fall through the cracks won't in fact fall through the cracks. \nThis is not that hard a choice.\n  But rather than even try to do that, we are being presented at the \n11th hour with something that the White House didn't cut in in the \ndeal. This wasn't in the budget agreement. This is right out of the \nsky. We are going to reach out and do this because in a certain respect \nit seems to make sense on paper. I do not think it makes sense in the \nlives of a lot of people who will not be able to buy health care, who \nwill be squeezed out of the system, even if you can say it is not going \nto cut in until the year 2002 and people are going to have plenty of \ntime for it. Somebody who is downsized and out of work at that age and \ndoes not have the ability to provide additional income does not have \nthe capability of paying $6,000 or $7,000--and it will be more by then, \nincidentally, for the annual health care premiums.\n  So what you are really deciding to do is cut off and not include \npeople, poor people, in coverage. You are going to exclude people from \ncoverage, and that is the exact opposite direction than we ought to be \nmoving in.\n  I yield back whatever time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the motion to waive.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator give me 5 minutes off the bill?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I wish to compliment several \nspeakers, Senator Kerrey of Nebraska and Senator Conrad of North \nDakota, for excellent statements, and Senator Gramm and others who \nspoke out on the need for policy change.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side say it was not in the budget \nagreement. That's right. The reason they can make a point of order is \nit has no financial impact over the next 5 years. The reason is, as \nproponents of this amendment, we wanted to give people plenty of time \nto make this change, to get rid of the eligibility time to be \nconcurrent with Social Security. I urge my colleagues on the other side \nwho are opposing this amendment to take a look at the estimate of 1997 \nHospital Insurance Trustee Report regarding what the health of Medicare \npart A trust fund will be. It is going broke and it is going broke \nrapidly.\n  Some of my colleagues say this bill keeps the trust fund solvent for \n10 years. You will not hear this Senator say it because I do not think \nit is the case. We are making some changes. We are going to save $115 \nbillion in Medicare. In addition, we are going to transfer home health, \nover a period of years phase it into part B, three-quarters of which is \npaid for by general revenues, by taxpayers. I do not think it keeps the \ntrust fund solvent for 10 years.\n  I am looking at the trust fund report. It says that by the year 2005 \nMedicare part A is going to have a $97.3 billion revenue shortfall, \ndeficit; in Medicare alone, almost $100 billion by the year 2005, only \n7.5 years from now. I fail to see how we are going to keep it solvent \nfor 10 years.\n  To address some long-term reforms, the Finance Committee passed some \ngood policy changes that will make eligibility for Medicare concurrent \nwith Social Security, and, yes, that means somebody my age is going to \nhave to wait another year before he or she is eligible for Medicare.\n  Well, guess what? Life expectancy has increased since 1965. Males age \n65 are now expected to live 15.5 years and females age 65 will live 19 \nyears. In 1965, a male age 65 would live on average only 13 years and a \nfemale 16 years. People are living longer. And the percentage of people \nwho are paying into the system is decreasing. In 1965, we had 5.5 \nworkers for every beneficiary. In 2030, there will only be 2.3 workers \nfor every beneficiary.\n  Some people seem to think the solution is raising taxes. If we want \nto keep the trust fund solvent for the next 25 years, the trustees say \nwe should increase payroll taxes by 66 percent, and if you want to keep \nit solvent for 75 years, they say we should raise the current 2.9 \npercent tax--that is 1.45 percent for employee and employer--we should \nraise that to 7.22 percent immediately. I don't want to do that. I \ndon't want to have that big a payroll tax increase.\n  So what can we do to make the system more solvent? What can we do to \nmake sure the money will be there when people need it? One of the \nthings we can do, and one of the things that will come out of any \nreport--any report--will say that we should have eligibility age be \nconcurrent with Social Security. It is the right thing to do.\n  I compliment my colleagues on the Finance Committee who have spoken \non behalf of this amendment, as well as the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee for putting it in. We didn't get any scoring for it. If \nanybody says we are doing it so you can pay for tax cuts for wealthy \ncitizens, that is absolutely, totally, completely false. We got zero \nscoring for this, but it happens to be the right thing to do, and it \nhappens to be in the long term, that this will help\n\n[[Page S6127]]\n\nkeep Medicare more solvent, it will help ensure there will be a \nMedicare program when I reach retirement age. It still won't solve the \nproblems. I will tell my colleagues, even in spite of the fact we do--\nand we have to do it and the earlier we do it the better off so people \nhave more time to know the changes are coming--in spite of this, we are \nstill going to have to make further changes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a report of the \npart A trust fund by the hospital trustee report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   PAYROLL TAX DATA FOR EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYERS

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, let's have a \nbipartisan vote for responsibilities not to score some points, but \nreally try to make sure Medicare funds will be there when promised. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on the motion to waive.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes off the bill to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to follow the Senator from California, if \nthat would be all right.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Just 1 minute.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Fine. The Senator from California can have 1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Just 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized for \n1 minute.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for yielding. People \nare living longer, so what are we doing about that? We are punishing \nthem in the committee bill, saying, ``You're living longer, therefore, \nyou have to\n\n[[Page S6128]]\n\nwait until you are 67 to get onto Medicare.''\n  I say to my colleagues, why do you think people are living longer? \nBecause we have Medicare. In the old days, we didn't have it and people \ngot very, very sick. Take a look at Russia. The average man there lives \nto 58 because they have no access to health care. People are living \nlonger because they go to a doctor early, they don't wait for a crisis. \nThey get preventive care, and what this bill does is say, ``American \npeople, you're living too long, we're going to have to send this \nback.'' Do we want to go back to when people died at 58 and 60? Then \nyou will really have a strong Medicare Program because no one will be \nable to use it. Thank you, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized for 4 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. President, just two points in 4 minutes, the first one being, I \nwas listening to my colleague from Oklahoma, and I know he had to leave \nthe floor, but I heard him say this has not been scored and it has \nnothing to do with the tax cuts. But, I think only here in the Senate \ndo we sort of decontextualize what we are doing. I don't think most \npeople in the country do. Most people in the country see a clear \nconnection between the reconciliation bill on tax cuts, the lion's \nshare of benefits going to the very top of the population and, at the \nsame time, what is, indeed, the functional equivalent of a cut in \nMedicare benefits.\n  I am troubled by the discussion because, Mr. President, I think that \nwhat some of my colleagues are talking about in the name of saving or \npreserving Medicare will have just the opposite effect. Maybe that is \nthe problem. We do it on a reconciliation bill, there is not a lot of \ntime, and we don't really know what the consequences are of what we are \ndoing. But, I will suggest to you that if we are serious about \ncost containment and we are serious about what we need to do to deal \nwith the estimates of how many people will be living to be over 65 and \n85 when we get to the year 2030 and, at the same time, how many people \nare working, and all of what has been presented here by way of \ndemography, then what we will do is not just focus on Medicare, we will \ngo back to looking at this overall health care system, and we will \nfigure out ways in which we contain costs so that, indeed, we can \nprovide decent health care coverage, not just to the elderly but to \nother citizens as well.\n\n  What we are doing now, philosophically, is we are moving in exactly \nthe opposite direction. Whatever happened here? Just a couple of years \nago, we were talking about Medicare for all. We were saying that we \nought to make sure that other people have the same opportunities as \nelderly people. Now what we seem to be doing is saying, My gosh, there \nare some people in the country who don't have good coverage; what we \nnow need to do is downsize Medicare instead of improving Medicare and \nimproving health care for people in this country. It makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  Mr. President, this is a huge mistake--a huge mistake. We ought to be \ntalking about providing good health care coverage for elderly people. \nWe ought to be talking about keeping this as a universal coverage \nprogram. We ought to be talking about health care reform systemwide. \nAnd we ought to be talking about not downsizing Medicare but, as a \nmatter of fact, taking this very good program and making sure that all \nof our citizens have the opportunity for decent health care coverage.\n  This proposal coming out of the Finance Committee takes us exactly in \nthe wrong direction. It is profoundly mistaken, and I thank Senator \nDurbin for his leadership and am proud to support his effort. I yield \nthe floor.\n  Mr. COATS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. COATS. I wonder if the Senator from Delaware will yield me a \ncouple of minutes off his time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 2 minutes off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, I was sitting in the Chair and listening to \nthe debate and listening just now. I came to the Congress in 1980, and \none of the first issues we tried to do was the pending Social Security \nproblem.\n  Over an 18-year period of time, we have been debating Medicare and \nSocial Security and what changes need to be made to guarantee solvency \nfor the future. I don't think there is any Member on this floor who \ndoesn't understand the facts. The trustees have reported over and over, \nwe have had commissions, we have had demographers, we have had \npoliticians--everybody has been talking about the problem that we all \nknow is coming very, very soon: The problem that if we don't make \nstructural changes within the programs, we are going to face imminent \ncollapse of the system. It just can't sustain. The numbers are clear to \neverybody.\n  There are a number of ways to fix it. As the Senator from \nPennsylvania said, we can raise taxes, cut spending, impose penalties \non providers. I find it somewhat stunning that a proposed phase in of a \nfix--which doesn't fix the problem, it defers the problem for another \n10 years so the Congress in 2008 can deal with it as we are dealing \nwith it here and every Congress before that--something that phases in \nover a period of 24 years that basically doesn't affect anybody in the \ncurrent system, raises such a level of passion as if we are destroying \nthe program.\n  We are going to probably lose this vote. We will have postponed for \nthe umpteenth time any solution proposed by anybody. No matter what is \nsuggested, it is rejected. I have seen dozens of proposals out here. \nEvery one rejected. The language always turns to--well, I don't want to \nuse the word demagoguery--it always turns to pitting one class against \nanother class, and those who are trying to get a fix proposed basically \nare labeled as people who want to destroy the system. Actually, they \nwant to save the system.\n  I don't think we have the political will to do it. Probably when the \nsystem collapses or is near collapse, the people will rise up and \ndemand their representatives do something. I hope they look back at the \nrecord of all those who tried to do something over 18 years and, \nbasically, were shouted down in the process time after time after time. \nWe will undoubtedly lose this one, too. We will move on. Hopefully, we \nwill get to the brink of collapse sooner rather than later, so it will \nnot cost as much to fix it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the bill to the \nSenator from Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey.\n  So it is understood what we are debating, there is a provision in \nthis bill which would raise the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to \n67. There are those of us who think that is unwarranted and are \nopposing it and there are those, of course, who are defending it.\n\n  It is interesting to me to consider what we are debating here. Five \nyears ago, we debated on Capitol Hill the premise that not enough \nAmericans had health insurance. Forty million Americans uninsured, \nmillions underinsured, what would we do as a nation? Would we rise to \nthe challenge? Would we come to the rescue of these families and \nindividuals? We debated it long and hard, and we failed.\n  When it was all said and done, nothing was done. A lot of ridicule \nand scorn was heaped on the White House and the First Lady and nothing \nhappened.\n  So 5 years later, we return to the debate of health insurance \ncoverage, but this time with a different premise. Instead of helping \nmore people receive insurance coverage, we now have in this bill a \nproposal to take more people off insurance coverage.\n  Have we come full circle? Five years later, there is a proposal to \nincrease the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to 67, and the \nyounger Members of the Senate stand over there and say, ``People can \nprepare for it, people can get used to it, people can save for it.''\n\n[[Page S6129]]\n\n  Think of the real-life challenges. Someone I know personally at age \n60 retired from management in a company in California with health care \nbenefits and a gold watch. Along came some changes in management, a \nlittle downsizing, and guess what? They sent him a letter saying, \n``Sorry, no more health insurance for you as a retiree from the \nmanagement of our company.'' As he received the letter, he started \nhaving heart problems, two different heart surgeries, and this \nindividual who had derided big Government programs overtaking your \nlives started counting the days until he would be eligible for \nMedicare, realizing that uninsured and uninsurable, he had no \nprotection.\n  What is the proposal in the Finance Committee? Let him hang out for \nanother 24 months, let him count another 24 months and days wondering \nif he can live long enough to be covered by Medicare. It is shameful. \nIt is shameful that we have not preceded this debate with a discussion \nabout how we will provide more coverage for people across America.\n  They want to create a commission in this bill to study the problem, \nand we should. One of the provisions the commission is supposed to \nstudy is whether or not to extend Medicare to those age 62 and beyond. \nBut before the commission comes back and reports, the Finance Committee \nwould say to us, before we know what the fix is for Medicare, let's \nstart with the premise that we are going to raise the retirement age, \nlet's start with the premise that people will pay more out of pocket, \nand then let's talk about reform of Medicare.\n  Excuse me; excuse me. This program was designed to help people in \ntheir retirement. It has worked. It is successful. Some of my friends \non the other side resent it because it is a Government program that \npeople respect and admire. For them to now have a shot at raising this \nretirement age to age 67 is unfortunately going to put more people in \nthe lurch. People who have made their plans and want to make them \ncannot anticipate whether they will be wealthy enough to pay for \nhospitalization insurance, whether they will be healthy enough to take \ncare of themselves. Instead, we should be providing protection. What we \nare doing is putting more and more people into jeopardy. I think that \nis shameless.\n  Look at this, too. This comes to us as part of a debate about a tax \ncut. This was supposed to be a tax cut that families across America \nwould cheer. Which family will cheer the prospect of 2 more years of \nuninsurability under health insurance? You and I know we value this as \nmuch as anything.\n  When my young daughter, fresh out of college, got a new job, the \nfirst thing her dad asked was, ``What about health insurance, \nJennifer?''\n  ``Oh, dad, I have a little bit of this and a little bit of that.'' \nAnd I worry about it every step of the way. She is a healthy young \nwoman, but think about a situation where you are 60 or 62 and you are \nnot healthy, you don't have insurance, and it costs $10,000 a year out \nof your pocket. The folks in the Finance Committee say this is part of \nreform, this is responsible, this is compassion, this is courageous. \nI'm sorry, this is just plain wrong.\n\n  Let us have a national debate to make sure that Medicare is there for \ndecades to come for everyone who needs it. Let us say to the high \nschool classes that are skeptical, yes, you have to sign up to help \nyour parents and grandparents, as your children will sign up to help \nyou. It is part of America. It is part of our responsibility as a \nfamily in America. Instead, we have these potshots at Medicare to raise \nthe retirement age to 67 without so much as a suggestion of what it \nwill mean to the American family. This is wrong. We should defeat it.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing the motion to waive the \nbudget agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will use my leader time to address the amendment.\n  I rise to associate myself with the remarks so eloquently made by the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois. He speaks for many of us and has \ndone so on several occasions.\n  This issue really does define us. It is an issue that, in many \nrespects, reflects our party's approach to the larger issue of access \nto health care in this country. Year after year and time after time in \nCongress after Congress many of us have come to the floor expressing a \ndesire to expand ways to protect people from the serious problems they \nface when they have inadequate health coverage.\n  Many of us have had personal family experiences in recent times that \npersonalize this issue for us. Those of us who have parents who have \nsuffered as a result of illnesses can thank our predecessors for the \nforesight they demonstrated in bringing Medicare to people that \notherwise would not have had any health coverage. Indeed, other \nprovisions of this legislation recognize the importance of expanding \nhealth coverage by encouraging States to find new ways to insure \nchildren. So how ironic, at the very time we are expanding health care \nfor one segment of our population we are taking it away from another. \nHow ironic.\n  Mr. President, this is too important an issue to be left to a brief \ndebate on an amendment in a reconciliation bill. This ought to be the \nsubject of a weeklong debate. We ought to be debating this in depth, \ndebating all of the ramifications of this amendment, because this issue \nis as important as they get.\n  This legislation essentially tells millions of Americans that their \ncoverage is no longer available to them, at the very time when they \nneed it the most.\n  As many of my colleagues have noted, we have hundreds if not \nthousands of companies that have mandatory retirement at age 65, and \nalong with that retirement comes a termination of health benefits. What \nis going to happen to these people? What is our message to them?\n  Now, if we had done the right thing a few years ago and ensured that \neverybody, regardless of age, had access to health care, I probably \nwould not be standing here at this moment. But we did not do that. \nInstead, we said we will address this problem step by step, that we \nwill find ways to expand coverage incrementally. Never once did I hear \nanybody come to the floor and say we should be taking insurance away \nfrom people.\n  Mr. President, I cannot support an effort that will increase the \nnumber of uninsured Americans. I cannot be a part of it. I hope that my \ncolleagues on this Senate floor, before they vote, will think about \nwhat it means for millions of people who are watching right now, hoping \nthat we have the good sense not to take away the only option they will \nhave for good health care in the future. This is a critical vote. I \nhope all of my colleagues will weigh very carefully all of the \nconsequences of this legislation prior to the time they cast their \nvote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself 3 minutes. Mr. President, a \nsignificant part of the discussion has been why it is that we do not, \nto use the expression, bite the bullet, get it going, set the program \ninto place so that over the years this will work its way into the \nsystem and we will have done better by Medicare.\n  Well, Mr. President, I was the senior Democratic negotiator in \ndeveloping the budget resolution, and we shook hands and we came to the \nconsensus, and this bill before the Senate, part of the reconciliation \npackage, now is supposed to put into place, as I understand it, the \nthings that we agreed to in the extensive meetings that we had, \nincluding participants from the White House and the House of \nRepresentatives, as well.\n  Having gotten that into place, suddenly now we are approached with \nsomething that I describe and Senator Kerry from Massachusetts before \ndescribed as coming in from nowhere, coming in from outer space. I say \ncoming in from left field. Suddenly, we had a new proposition to \nconsider whether or not we will say to those who are anticipating that \ntheir coverage would fall into place at age 65, well, no, we have a new \nkind of novel idea. We are going to extend it to age 67 and we want to \nget it into place now.\n\n  Mr. President, in the development of this bill, this big booklet I am \nholding, there is a chapter on commissions, and we say that the \ncommission shall meet and within 12 months after their appointment--it \nis a 15-person commission, bipartisan in character, with 3 appointees \nby the President--we say in 1 year we will have a report, we will have \nrecommendations. It is not going to be\n\n[[Page S6130]]\n\ndone in a half hour or half day on the floor of the Senate. We are \ngoing to take good time and thoroughly review it. We will debate it, as \nour leader said just now, debate it, have hearings, review it, make \nsure we are all certain about what we want to do. But, no, suddenly \nthat is too slow. We want, in reality, to take 20 or 30 years to \ndevelop it, but it has to be done today to kick it off. I think that is \npart of the absurdity of this, Mr. President.\n  I look at this legislation, and I am wondering what happened between \nthe Finance Committee's final deliberation and this moment here.\n  We talk about the purpose of this. The purpose of this is purportedly \nto present more solvency to the Medicare Program. There is only one \nproblem: The program will perhaps be more solvent, but more individuals \nwill be insolvent. That will be the outcome. There is nothing more \nworrisome today--and I see it in conversations, social, business and \notherwise--than any other time that I ever remember, people saying, ``I \nhope I don't lose my health insurance if my company closes down.''\n\n  I understand that even now in separation agreements in marital \ndisputes that a part of the responsibility that is being asked of the \nincome earner is, ``I want to be provided,'' says the person being \nleft, ``with health insurance. I need to protect myself. I can't be \nthere with the children and be exposed to a sickness or an accident.''\n  People worry about that all the time. People who have saved all their \nlives so they would have a little nest egg for retirement are saying, \n``Wow, you see what it costs to be in the hospital these days, see what \nit costs to have an operation. It costs so much I would be bankrupt if \nI had to go through one of those things.''\n  We are dealing with a very sensitive issue, a very complicated issue. \nI hope, Mr. President, that all of our friends on the floor of the \nSenate will give this a chance for the commission to get to work to \nreview it and not introduce this new--I will call it--extraneous \nsubject, and I am not defining it in terms of the budget process but in \nterms of the place that it holds.\n  I hope we will work, Mr. President, not to permit the waiver of the \nbudget agreement.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes off the bill to the \ndistinguished Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, today the Senate is considering two \nimportant changes approved by the Finance Committee for the Medicare \nProgram: increasing the eligibility age from 65 to 67, and increasing \npremiums for higher income beneficiaries. Raising the eligibility age \nwill simply bring Medicare into line with the retirement age under \nSocial Security. And means-testing the part B premium is in fact \noverdue.\n  I was a member of the administration of President Johnson when \nMedicare legislation was developed and enacted, and I remind Senators \nthat at that time the part B provision for physician's bills was meant \nto be paid one-half by the individual and one-half out of general \nrevenues--50-50.\n  In 1972, we limited the increase in the part B premium to the rate of \nincrease in Social Security benefits, which are tied to the Consumer \nPrice Index. Inasmuch as medical costs grew at a much faster rate than \nthat, generally, of prices, that 50-50 share gradually dropped to what \nis now a quarter, 25 percent. In no way do we change that 25-75 \narrangement that has emerged, but we do ask that high-income retired \npersons pay a higher premium. About 6 percent to 7 percent of retirees \nwill be affected.\n  Retired couples with incomes under $75,000, will not in any way be \naffected; individuals with incomes under $50,000 will not in any way be \naffected. We are really only returning somewhat to the original \nintention and the original provisions of Medicare part B.\n  If my distinguished chairman would permit me, I yield the balance of \nmy 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. ROTH. That is fine.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the distinguished chairman and the distinguished \nranking member. There is no easy answer to this problem. Everybody \nwants us to fix Medicare, but nobody wants us to do anything in order \nto fix it.\n  When you say, ``Do you want to increase premiums,'' everybody says \nno. When you say, ``Do you want to reduce benefits,'' everybody says \nno. When you say, ``Do you want to reduce payments of doctors and \nhospitals,'' they say no because they may not serve us any more. When \nwe say, let's gradually, by the year 2027, forewarn people that that \nwill be the eligible age of Medicare, we are now saying do not do that, \neither.\n  The fact is that in the year 2001 Medicare becomes insolvent. What \nare we going to tell the people then? Are we going to say we did not \nhave the political courage to do anything, so there is no more Medicare \navailable for anybody, regardless of age? That is what is facing us \nnow. This is probably one of the easiest steps toward ensuring that \nMedicare will be solvent. There are no easy answers, and I suggest that \nthis is one of the easier ones. If we do not have the political courage \nto do this, how are we going to handle the question about what happens \nwhen there is no more Medicare available for anyone?\n\n  I think this ought to be adopted.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield back to the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first, I apologize to the distinguished \nchairman for not being on the floor, but I understand that everybody \ndid a great job. I wish I could have been here to listen to it all.\n  I had a chart printed in the Record. I do not think the numbers and \nyears can be disputed off of this chart. I want to make sure everybody \nknows what this fight is about.\n  First of all, for anybody age 59, nothing changes. When you get to be \n58, it will have changed by 2 months. If you are today 58, this has \nbeen changed by 2 months. If you are 57 today, it is changed by 4 \nmonths. If you are 56, it is changed by 6 months. If you are 55, it is \n8 months, and if you are 54, it is 10 months.\n  Now, there is after that period of time if you are 53, 52, 51, 50, \n49, 48, 47, 46, 45, 44, 43, 42, it is 1 year--1 year for all of those, \n1 year. If you are 41 today, it is changed by 1 year and 2 months. If \nyou are 40, it is 1 year and 4 months. I will skip to 37, where it is 1 \nyear and 10 months, and if you are 36 or under, it is 2 years.\n  Those are the facts regarding the changes that are going to cause the \ninsurmountable damage that has been alluded to here on the floor.\n  Let me repeat, these are the actuarial numbers and the numbers in \nthis statute. They are not dreamed up; they are written. Essentially, \nit says what I have just said. Now, let me ask--somebody 59, there is \nno change, OK. So anybody talking about that, there is none. If you are \n58, it is changed by 2 months. And then let us go all the way down to \n42 years of age; it is changed by 1 year. So if you are 42 today, \nplanning on getting Medicare when you come of age, instead of 65, it \nwill be 66 for that person; is that right, Senator Gramm?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That's right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. A person 42, a 1-year change. If you are all the way \ndown to 36 years of age, in order to have a Medicare that is solvent, \nit will be changed 2 years for you.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the chart was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            MEDICARE ELIGIBILITY AGE                                            \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                         Current                                                \n           Age today--                 Born in--           law           Proposed                Change         \n                                                         (years)                                                \n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOver 65.........................

Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator a question. At age 65, \nhow long would you be willing to go without insurance if you had a \nmedical problem and you realize that your medical bills could bankrupt \nyour family and squander your family savings?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will answer that for the Senator. If you are 36 years \nof age and you start planning for this and then you are 65 years of age \nand you still don't have coverage between 65 and 67, then something is \nwrong with you. You have 31 years to get ready for it. If you are 65 \ntoday, you don't even get any impact.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is the Senator suggesting that we pass a law to guarantee \nthat insurance be available to every one at age 65?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I might say we didn't pass any that required 65; it \njust happened because it is reasonable. People are working longer. They \nare going to be working longer than 65. They are going to have coverage \neveryplace. You are suggesting they are going to be denied coverage \nbecause we say you have to wait a year 25 years from now?\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield further, 70 percent of the \npeople of age 65 today have no health insurance. The Senator suggests \nit is just going to vanish. This is reality, what families face.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If there are people 65 who don't have any health \ncoverage, then I assume they don't have Medicare. If they don't have \nMedicare, that is going to be the same situation later on. There is no \ndifference.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Of course.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point I am trying to make is that of the people \nbetween ages 60 and 65, 30 percent of them have health insurance \nthrough employment and 70 percent do not. These are people who are \nretiring without health insurance. The Senator is suggesting this is \ngoing to get better automatically. I don't think so.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, Mr. President, I am suggesting that for those \npeople who are covered by Medicare today and those who are going to be \ncovered by it in the future, it has been discussed on the floor of the \nSenate today that people are going to be shocked and they are going to \nhave no insurance. I submit, if you are 36 years of age now, when you \nget to be 65, you will have 2 years added. So for people 36 years of \nage, it will be 67. How do any of the arguments made about not having \ncoverage apply to that? Are they not going to have coverage? Of course, \nthey are. If they have Medicare today, they are going to be working 16, \n18 years from now, too--unless we assume everybody is no longer going \nto work, so you won't even qualify. Frankly, maybe we will not do this \nbefore the time this finishes conference. I don't know. The House \ndidn't do it.\n  But all I am trying to say is, if this is a major issue between the \ntwo parties--and luckily it isn't because some Democrats have the \ncourage to face up to the truth--so no matter how much the leader on \nthat side says this is distinguishing between the parties, there are \nsome Democrats who agree with us. If it is being said that this is \ngoing to just annihilate senior citizens, I thought we ought to put a \nchart in and let Americans look at it. Let's ask a 36-year-old, would \nyou rather have a chance of having Medicare solvent so it will be there \nfor you? Or would you rather insist that when you get to be 65, you get \nit, even if we were to tell you we greatly enhanced the chance of it \nbeing there if you wait until 67? If it is a chasm between our parties, \nlet me suggest that it is a little, tiny chasm. It has nothing to do \nwith great philosophical differences about who is for seniors and who \nis against them. That is just rubbish.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield time to the Senator from Massachusetts for 1 \nminute because this debate is just about over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 1 minute.\n  Mr. KERRY. I wanted to ask the Senator a question. I think there are \ntwo truths here. I don't think the gap is that great. All of us accept \nthe fact that the demographics are changing. We accept the fact that we \nare going to have to do something. We accept the fact that people are \nliving longer. You are going to have an increasing number retiring that \nwe don't have a sufficient capacity to cover. We understand that.\n  But the other truth is the truth that the Senator from Illinois spoke \nof--the fact that you have this very large proportion of people today \nwho aren't covered and who haven't reached the age of eligibility. The \nquestion that is avoided by the Senator from New Mexico, which would \nbridge the gap, is: How do you guarantee, as you raise the age, that \nyou are not going to lose more people in that gap? That is the only \nissue that separates us. As I have talked to colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, they have agreed that the commission will probably \nrecommend that solution. We could have provided some kind of capacity \nfor a stopgap and we would all walk out of here having done the right \nthing, but also having guaranteed that we are not going to lose more \npeople without coverage.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  All time having expired, the question now occurs on the Roth motion \nto waive the Budget Act in response to the point of order of the \nSenator from Illinois. The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question occurs on the Harkin amendment, \namendment No. 428. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized. May we \nhave order, please?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that we may proceed with a committee \namendment with reference to means testing. I believe this process has \nbeen cleared with the manager on the Democratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Hearing none, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield time on the amendment which will be sent to the \nfloor by Chairman Roth, I yield time to manage it under the Budget Act \nto the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 434\n\n  [Purpose: To provide for an income-related reduction in the subsidy \n   provided to individuals under part B of title XVIII of the Social \n Security Act, and to provide for a demonstration project on an income-\n                       related part B deductible]\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Moynihan and myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth], for himself and Mr. \n     Moynihan, proposes an amendment numbered 434.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, this amendment does two important things. \nFirst, it would raise part B premiums for seniors who could afford to \npay more. Second, the amendment would provide new part B premium \nassistance for low-income beneficiaries. Regarding the income-related \npremium, the amendment would reduce the Federal subsidy of part B \npremiums--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold for a moment, \nplease? The Senate will please come to order so we can hear the \nsubstance of the amendment.\n  The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, as I was saying, regarding the income-\nrelated premium, the amendment would reduce the Federal subsidy of part \nB premiums for some seniors. Today, the Federal Government pays 75 \npercent of the cost of the part B program and Medicare beneficiaries \npay just 25 percent. The Federal Government funds part B, which is a \nvoluntary program, and pays for such things as doctors' bills out of \ngeneral tax revenues which are raised from all taxpayers, rich, poor, \nand middle income. This amendment would require those single seniors \nwith incomes of $50,000, to pay a bit more for part B; single seniors \nwith incomes over $100,000 paying all of their share of part B costs.\n  The corresponding income range for couples would be $75,000 to \n$125,000. But, even under this proposed increase, the cost of \nparticipation in part B will remain relatively modest. Next year, it \nwould cost a senior with an income of $100,000, paying his or her \nentire share of part B costs, an additional $1,620. The savings from \nthis amendment would go into part A trust fund, helping to ensure its \ncontinuing solvency. In addition, the amendment would provide premium \nassistance for more low-income seniors. Today, for poorest seniors, \nthose individuals with incomes below 120 percent of poverty, part B \npremiums are paid by Medicaid. The amendment would give States \nadditional funds to help seniors with incomes between 120 and 150 \npercent of poverty. This amendment meets the terms of the budget \nagreement which provided for $1.5 billion in additional premium \nassistance for low-income beneficiaries over the next 5 years. In \nshort, this amendment helps protect the most vulnerable seniors and \nkeeps our word with the President.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask this amendment be adopted and considered \noriginal text for purposes of amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Could we have a little more order around the \noutside periphery here, please, so we can hear the proceedings? Will \nstaff please take their conversations in the cloakroom.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator from Delaware, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, just gave us an assurance that the \ntext here will be considered original text for the purpose of further \namendment. It is acceptable on our side. This amendment, as we have \nheard, just to repeat for a moment, has three major elements. It \nincludes $1.5 billion to protect low-income individuals with incomes \nthat are up to 120 percent of poverty from having to pay additional \npremiums in the future. This provision is designed to bring the bill \ninto compliance with the bipartisan budget agreement. The amendment \nalso would change the means-tested deductible into a means-tested \npremium. This is in response to the broad criticism of the Finance \nCommittee's original bill as unworkable and inequitable. However, I \nwant to make it clear that I intend to support a motion that we are \ngoing to hear about shortly to strike the means-tested premium.\n  Finally, the amendment includes a modest initiative to explore the \nconcept of a means-tested deductible. This is a very limited test that \nwould not force any seniors to pay a means-tested deductible but would \nallow a very small number of them to do so, rather than paying a higher \npremium.\n  So we are again willing to accept this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 434) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I move we reconsider and then lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 440\n\n(Purpose: (1) To strike income-relating of the Medicare part B premiums \nand deductibles; (2) to delay the effective date of income-relating of \n  the Medicare part B premiums and deductibles; and (3) to means-test \n  Senatorial health benefits in the same way as the bill means-tests \n               Medicare part B premiums and deductibles)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and the Senator from Maryland, Senator Mikulski----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Harkin amendment is pending.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask that be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for himself \n     and Ms. Mikulski, proposes an amendment numbered 440.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 5542.\n       In section 5542(d)(1), strike ``1998'' and insert ``2000''.\n       On page 1047, between lines 5 and 6, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 6004. MEDICARE MEANS TESTING STANDARD APPLICABLE TO \n                   SENATORS' HEALTH COVERAGE UNDER THE FEHBP.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to apply the \n     Medicare means testing requirements for part B premiums to \n     individuals with adjusted gross incomes in excess of $100,000 \n     as enacted under section 5542 of this Act, to United States \n     Senators with respect to their employee contributions and \n     Government contributions under the Federal Employees Health \n     Benefits Program.\n       (b) In General.--Section 8906 of title 5, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, \n     each employee who is a Senator and is paid at an annual rate \n     of pay exceeding $100,000 shall pay the employee contribution \n     and the full amount of the Government contribution which \n     applies under this section. The Secretary of the Senate shall \n     deduct and withhold the contributions required under this \n     section and deposit such contributions in the Employees \n     Health Benefits Fund.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--This section shall take effect on the \n     first day of the first pay period beginning on or after the \n     date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I demand a division of the amendment as \nfollows: Division I being line 1, division II being line 2, and \ndivision III being the balance of the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I will be glad to withhold that request as long as I \ndo not lose the right to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to divide his \namendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. Let me just explain.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I make a point of order a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, might I ask a parliamentary \ninquiry. I understand--and is my understanding correct--that the second \namendment is subject to a point of order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Then I propose that we do the following, and I think it \nis going to be acceptable, that we not have a vote on the third \namendment but, rather, accept it, and then that we proceed thereafter \nwith debate on the first amendment. And I would ask on the first \namendment could we have a half-hour on each side?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. A half-hour on each side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On the first one. And on the second one, when the point \nof order is made on the motion, you would move to waive it, I assume?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time does the Senator want on that?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Half an hour on a side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could we do 15 minutes on a side?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Half an hour on that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let us say not more than. And you could maybe do it in \nless.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That is fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I put that unanimous-consent request to the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? The Chair hears none, and \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I reinstate my previous allocation on the time and \nmanagement to the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n\n\n                Vote on Amendment No. 440--Division III\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question then is on agreeing to division \nIII of amendment No. 440.\n  The amendment (No. 440), Division III was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 440--Division I\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question now is on agreeing to division I.\n  Mr. KENNEDY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand now there is a half-hour on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes, Mr. President.\n  This is what I consider another real assault on the Medicare-health \ncare concept that has served the American people so well. I think the \ntwo great experiments we have seen that have taken place since the \n1930's have been Social Security and also Medicare. We understand now \nthat the Medicare trust fund needs attention. The President has made \nthe recommendation that we have a period where we would have the \nopportunity to have a thorough discussion and debate about what steps \nmust be taken in order to remedy the long-term financial needs of \nMedicare.\n  That was what was recommended to go to conference and come back with \nrecommendations to work that process through. What we have here in this \nparticular Medicare proposal is not really dissimilar in many respects \nto some of the other proposals, and that is it has a very fundamental \nchange in the whole Medicare system. It has this important change.\n  For years, under the Medicare system, it was a universal system in \nthe sense that people would pay in all across this Nation, needy \npeople, poor people paid in and wealthy people paid in and people \nreceived the benefits under the Medicare system. Now that concept is \nbeing challenged and I believe undermined in a very important way for \nthis reason. We are using under the recommendation of the Finance \nCommittee effectively a means test for those of certain incomes--above \nthe $50,000 as individuals or $75,000 up to $100,000 and up to \n$125,000. That means that there will be an increase in the various \npremiums and the ability to pay.\n  Now, that will go into effect in another year. First of all, what is \nthe message that this sends to hundreds and thousands, millions of \nAmericans who are earning $50,000 a year and just about to go on \nMedicare? We are saying to them that their premiums are going to rise \nfrom $64 a month--it will rise in the current proposal by $2,000. It \ncan rise under this proposal from $259.60 a month up to $3,100 a year \nfor those at $100,000. We are saying to senior citizens this is going \nto be put upon you. They had little time to prepare for it, little time \nto plan for it.\n  Mr. President, $50,000 is a lot of money but for many Americans it is \nright there in the heart of working families with two members of the \nfamily working. So we are saying--and this is the fundamental point--\nthe first means test that we are going to provide on health care is \ngoing to be Medicare. We are not providing means tests for the \ndeductibility of health insurance for the self-employed, the doctors \nand professional personnel, as well as some others in our society. We \nare not saying we are going to means test your particular health \nbenefits. We are not saying to the wealthiest individuals who are going \nto be able to use the tax system to provide a deduction for their \nhealth benefits, we are not saying we are going to means test you. No. \nThe only people we are going to means test are those under Medicare. \nThat is the only group. We do not do it to those individuals who are \nself-employed. We do not do it to individuals who are deducting under \nmuch more costly health care programs. We are saying it's all right for \nyou to go ahead and deduct and let the taxpayers pick up your \ndeduction. We are saying, with regard to the self-insured, the same \nthing, but not with regard to Medicare--not with regard to Medicare.\n\n  Now, what is going to be the result of this? Mr. President, what you \nare going to find out is that the wealthy individuals who participate \nin the Medicare system--listen to this. Those with the highest incomes, \nthe top 25 percent\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\nunder Medicare will pay about $159,000 more than they will collect in \nbenefits. Do we understand that? The top 25 percent--that is what you \nare looking at in this particular amendment--they pay in $159,000 more \nthan they collect in benefits. In contrast, those in the lowest income \ncategory, the bottom 25 percent collect $72,000 more in benefits than \nthey will pay in taxes.\n  That is the current system. So it would seem to me that we ought to \ngive some consideration to those individuals from $50,000 to $100,000 \nwho have been paying into Medicare, because they have been paying in \nmore than they are paying out.\n  What are the financial implications of that loss? What we are going \nto see, when any individual is going to be paying $3,100 a year in \nterms of premiums, they are going to leave the system. They are going \nto leave the system. We don't have any studies on that. We have no \nguidance, no professional advice as to the extent they are going to \nleave the system, how fast they are going to leave the system, but they \nare going to leave the system.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 6 minutes have expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 more minutes.\n  So we are taking a high-risk kind of approach on something which is \nvery basic and fundamental, and that is the integrity of the Medicare \nsystem.\n  By means testing this premium, we are endangering the total Medicare \nsystem, because those who are contributing the most and adding to the \nMedicare system which needs those funds are going to leave the health \ncare system. We have not had 5 minutes of hearings on the implication \nof this program to the Medicare trust fund.\n  Beyond that, what we are saying is, of all the people in this country \nwho are going to be means tested, it is going to be those individuals, \nworking families, men and women who played by the rules, contributed to \nMedicare over the course of their lives, depending on the Medicare \nsystem, they are going to find that they are the first beneficiaries to \nwhom the means test is applied.\n  It is wrong in terms of the Medicare system. It is wrong in terms of \na health care policy. I don't know what it is about the Senate Finance \nCommittee. They are trying to drive more and more people out of \nMedicare health care coverage. They are doing it by raising the age of \neligibility, and they are doing it with regard to this particular \nprogram. I can understand why some would want to do it, because they \nwant to ship people out of Medicare and into the private insurance \nmarket so they can make profits in Medicare. We are endangering \nMedicare and taking a high risk. It is the wrong economic policy. It is \nthe wrong health policy. I hope the amendment will be accepted.\n  I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. \nI rise to support the Kennedy-Mikulski amendment, and I am proud to be \nan original cosponsor of this amendment. This amendment strikes the \nMedicare means-testing provision in this bill. I am adamantly opposed \nto Medicare means testing. I have two very grave concerns about the \nlegislation pending. First, it breaks the bonds of faith between the \npeople and their Government. Second, it overturns 30 years of Medicare \nin 3 days, without any hearings and no real debate.\n  This bill breaks faith with seniors. It breaks faith with workers \ncurrently paying into Medicare. This bill says if you paid into \nMedicare under one set of rules, you are going to receive your benefits \nunder a completely different set of rules. The bill penalizes those who \nwork hard, save and try to play by the rules.\n  This bill puts a previous condition on getting Medicare benefits: the \nmoney you saved. It tells the American people that their savings \naccount counts against them when they are ready for Medicare.\n  I believe that promises made must be promises kept. This bill breaks \nthat promise.\n  If I were a financial planner, I would advise the senior citizens in \nMaryland, ``Go to Ocean City for a vacation, buy a big car, live it up. \nDon't save your money for retirement, because the Government will take \nit away from you and increase Medicare deductibles, increase Medicare \npremiums and place a penalty on you for your savings. If you don't have \nany money, at least then you might qualify for Medicare.''\n  But I am not a financial planner. I am a U.S. Senator, and it is my \njob to stand sentry to protect Medicare.\n  Medicare was meant to be portable, affordable and undeniable. The \npurpose of Medicare was to provide health insurance to senior citizens \nbecause the private sector wouldn't do it in a way that was affordable, \nportable and universal for people over the age of 65.\n  Medicare premiums will now go beyond what some private insurance \npolicies now cost. This provision ends Medicare, as we know it, and \nturns it into a welfare program. This is unacceptable.\n  We must ask ourselves, who are we making Medicare affordable for? Is \nMedicare meant to be affordable for senior citizens, or was it meant to \nbe affordable for Government? I want to make sure that Medicare is \naffordable to the senior citizens who need it.\n  Let's be realistic, we do have a problem with Medicare. Yes, the \nclock is ticking on solvency. Yes, we do need to address this problem \nwith a sense of urgency.\n\n  As we are concerned about the future solvency of Medicare, we need to \nbe concerned about the solvency of senior citizens. They need Medicare \nnow. This bill attacks them when they are sick, when they are most \nvulnerable, and it does nothing or little to make Medicare solvent.\n  For those young people working who are now in their twenties, \nthirties, forties and fifties--the baby boomers--they should be \nconcerned. We have 78 million baby boomers in this country. They are \ngoing to be doubly squeezed. They will be taking care of their aging \nparents and paying the high cost of educating their children, and now \nwe would have them pay Medicare taxes for 47 years and then pay again \nwhen they are elderly.\n  If we want to talk about Medicare costs, we can begin cracking down \non the $23 billion of fraud in Medicare. We don't do anything by \nsticking it to the middle class in the middle of the night, and that is \nwhat this bill does.\n  This legislation is a direct attack on the middle class and the \nbeginning of a slippery slope for more attacks on work and savings. \nThis is not the time, this is not the place or the way to change \nMedicare. It should be the starting point for a national debate on how \nwe protect Medicare and reward work and saving.\n  It is too important not to have a debate, but there has been little \nor no debate. We should not have spent the time this year debating \ncontentious issues that are going nowhere. We should have spent the \ntime debating Medicare, its solvency and a variety of alternatives to \nbe able to educate the American people.\n  Instead, we are changing the rules in the middle of the game and the \nmiddle of the night. We need Presidential leadership. We need \nbipartisan cooperation. We don't need a middle-of-the-night attack on \nthe middle class that raises costs, does nothing to improve health care \nfor our citizens and threatens the very health care for the middle \nclass.\n  I will stand sentry to protect Medicare. I will stand sentry to make \nsure the promises made are promises kept. And I will stand sentry for \nAmerica's senior citizens. The means testing in this legislation before \nus breaks faith with those seniors.\n  Retired seniors, as well as those nearing retirement age, have \nplanned for that retirement with the understanding that they would have \nto pay about $100 in deductibles. Now they will be advised that they \nwill have to contribute anywhere from $550 to $2,000 a year for a \npremium on a Government insurance program and at the same time have to \npay Medigap insurance.\n  When you are retired, every dollar counts, and even those with \naverage incomes need to be able to count on every dollar. We must \npreserve the covenant that we established with our seniors to provide \naffordable accessible health insurance at old age. Out-of-sight \nadditional fees and new income reporting requirements break those \npromises. What we are telling people is, if they play by the rules, \nthey are now going to lose.\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\n  Those who planned and saved the most are penalized for their efforts. \nThe provision tells seniors that after a lifetime of hard work and \nsavings, the Government is going to add to your burden when you are \nsick.\n  So these provisions send a horrible message to seniors with higher \nincomes, but they also send a frightening message to every senior who \ndepends on Medicare. If we make this change now, what does it say to \nseniors who fall just below the income threshold of the provision in \nthe bill? What assurance do they have we won't be asking them to pay \nhigher out-of-pocket expenses in the years ahead?\n  I believe it is wrong to scare seniors this way, and it is \nunconscionable to undermine our commitment to people who depend on \nMedicare.\n  Honoring your father and your mother is a great commandment. I think \nit is a great public policy. The Medicare Program must embody the \nvalues of ``honor your mother and your father.''\n  Mr. President, that is why I support the Kennedy-Mikulski amendment. \nI believe we should strike this means testing, wait for another day \nafter we have had a national debate, a report of a national commission, \nand then look at the variety of tools best able to ensure the solvency \nof Medicare, and yet at the same time reward hard work and savings.\n  I yield back such time as I might have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Gramm.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to begin by reading from the report \nof the trustees of Social Security and Medicare programs. In their \nannual report dated April 1997 they state:\n\n       As we reported for the last several years, the Medicare \n     trust fund would be exhausted in 4 years without legislation \n     that addresses its financial imbalance. Further delay in \n     implementing changes makes the problem harder to solve. We \n     urge the earliest possible enactment of legislation extending \n     the life of the HI trust fund.\n\n  The HI trust fund is the Medicare part A trust fund. That is not me \ntalking. This is the trustees of Medicare, three of whom are Cabinet \nofficials of the Clinton administration.\n  No one disputes the facts. This chart represents the cumulative \ndeficit of Medicare as we look toward the future, and we know with \nrelative certainty that over the next 10 years, Medicare is going to be \na cumulative drain of $1.6 trillion on the Federal budget.\n  We now know about some of the things that the Senator from \nMassachusetts is against. We know he doesn't want to conform the \neligibility age for Medicare with the retirement age under Social \nSecurity. We know that he doesn't want to ask high-income retirees to \npay more of their share of the cost.\n  However, we don't know what he is for. We don't know if he is \nwilling, as will be required in the year 2025, to triple the payroll \ntax? It is very easy to say what you are against. It is easy to say, \nlet's not do this today, let's not do it this year, let's not do it \nthis decade, let's never do it. But the problem is, 4 years from now, \nMedicare will be in the red, and the system is going to be bankrupt if \nwe don't act.\n  What have we done? First of all, all this rhetoric about playing by \nthe rules of the game and paying into Medicare over our working lives \nis good rhetoric, but it has nothing to do with the bill before us. \nNobody pays for any part of part B of Medicare, which is basically \nphysician services, during their working lives.\n  Let me repeat that. During our working lives, we pay 2.9 percent of \nour wages into the part A trust fund which funds hospital care, but \nonly after we retire do we pay anything for our part B benefits. We now \npay 25 percent of the cost as a premium.\n  The bill before us means tests that premium. It says that for those \nindividuals who in retirement have incomes of $50,000 to $100,000, or \ncouples $75,000 to $125,000, that we are going to phase up the part B \npremium from 25 to 100 percent so that individuals who have $100,000 of \nearnings in retirement and couples who have $125,000 of income in \nretirement will be asked to pay another $1,577 a year in their part B \npremiums.\n  Let me remind people that part B of Medicare is voluntary; it is not \na mandatory program. Nobody makes anybody participate in this program. \nIf asking people who have incomes of $125,000 a year to pay $1,577 more \na year for this coverage is too much, they don't have to do it.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think you have raised a very significant point. It goes \nto the argument of the Senator from Massachusetts. What you are saying \nis today a person who participates in the Medicare system pays 25 \npercent of the costs of the part B premium.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That's right, and pays none of the cost during their \nworking lives.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. That means 75 percent of the cost is being paid by the \nwage earner.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That's right.\n  Mr. GREGG. By John and Mary Jones who happen to be working on a line \nin a factory in New Hampshire or working in Texas trying to raise a \nfamily, they are paying 75 percent of the cost of the premium of the \nperson who today is receiving part B Medicare benefits, is that not \ncorrect?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. So if you follow the logic of the Senator from \nMassachusetts, you are saying John and Mary Jones, the wage earner of \nAmerica, should be subsidizing the person who is earning $100,000, that \nwould be the practical effect of adopting Senator Kennedy's amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Not only would it have that effect, if we adopt Senator \nKennedy's amendment, we are going to be asking moderate-income-working \nfamilies to subsidize people in retirement who are making up to \n$125,000 per year. The program is voluntary. If they don't think it is \na good deal, they don't have to do it.\n  Can I have 1 additional minute, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Delaware yield \nadditional time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 1 additional minute.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, in order to keep Medicare solvent, we are \ngoing to ask very high-income retirees to begin to pay more of the cost \nof a benefit which they receive. It is a voluntary benefit which no one \npays for during their working life and for which they are currently \npaying 25 percent of the cost. We are going to phase that up to 100 \npercent of the cost for individuals with incomes of $100,000 a year and \ncouples with incomes of $125,000 a year in order to keep the system \nsolvent.\n  The alternative is to ask moderate-income-working families to pay the \ncost. We don't believe that is fair. This is a voluntary program. \nNobody is required to participate in part B of Medicare. It is a \nvoluntary program. So if very high-income people do not want to pay the \n$1,577 they do not have to pay it. They can drop out of the program. \nThey are not going to drop out because it is still a good deal.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Who yields time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  The material that the Senator from Texas was quoting was not focused \non this particular amendment. It was talking generally about the \nproblems of the Medicare.\n  The Senator has not responded to one of the principal criticisms of \nthis amendment and that is that the top 25 percent of the Medicare \nrecipients are paying into the Medicare system some $132,000 more than \nthey are taking out over a lifetime. You are raising their part B \npremiums to $3,100 and you are talking about it being voluntary.\n  How many of those individuals in the top 25 percent will leave \nMedicare? And what will the economic implications on the trust fund be \nthen? You have not had any hearings or any testimony. The answer that I \nhear is, ``Well, the very wealthy get 75 percent of their part B paid \nby general revenues.'' Yes, they do, and I can give you the studies \nthat show that the top 25 percent pay more into part B than they get \nback in terms of whatever services or assistance they get under part B.\n  So you are going to take steps here on means testing premiums for the \nfirst time, on a program that is working, and has no financial problems\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\nunder the proposal of President Clinton --$115 billion of savings. We \nwill make sure we have 10 years to set up that commission and to \nconsider a variety of different alternatives in terms of the Medicare \ntrust fund. But no, no, we have the answers to these problems today in \nthe Finance Committee. They were marking up these measures with 5-\nminute time limitations on discussion for each of the various \namendments.\n  Mr. President, this is not the way to treat senior citizens. I know \nthe Senator is against the Medicare system. I have listened to him \noppose it. I know he was part of a program in the last Congress to cut \nit by $256 million and use the money to pay for billions of dollars in \ntax breaks for wealthy individuals.\n  The Senator asked me what I am for. I am for preserving the Medicare \nsystem and not destroying it. And I am for giving careful consideration \nand study to the different alternatives, in the light of day. I am not \nfor having a seat-of-the-pants recommendation which can threaten the \nMedicare system. We are fast-tracking these proposals. We are debating \nthese issues on Medicare with a time limit of 1 hour.\n  I was here when the Senate debated Medicare for days and weeks, and \nnow it reverses itself over a period of 3 years. We are now asked here \nto make judgments and decisions in just a few moments. It is a \ndisservice to senior citizens. It is a disservice to all the men and \nwomen in this country who believe in a retirement that they can plan, \nknowing what they could expect in terms of the Medicare premium.\n  Finally, HCFA, which is the principle organization that is going to \nbe working through the process of administering this, keeps no income \nrecords. What is going to happen to an individual that makes $49,500 \nand somebody that makes $50,500? What happens when they make a certain \namount 1 year but not the second year? What if they make it in the \nthird quarter and not the fourth quarter? How do you administer this? \nWho will make those decisions? You are going to set up a massive \nbureaucracy. The Senator has not commented on that.\n  We were here debating just the other day a children's health bill, \ntalking about doing a cigarette tax and we already collect a cigarette \ntax. We were talking about distributing that money to the States \nthrough the agreement that Senator Hatch and I proposed, and we heard \n``Wow, a totally new administration will have to be set up.''\n  What the Senators in the Finance Committee are proposing will require \nthe grandaddy of all bureaucracies to be set up. A set up in a way that \nI think will seriously threaten the long-term security of the Medicare \nsystem.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  These arguments on the floor sometimes become very confusing. \nEverybody wants to fix Medicare. But what I hear from so many of our \ncolleagues when we can all agree on fixing it, no one can agree how to \nfix it.\n  We ask the question, when are we going to fix it? And some say, well, \nnot now. And we ask the question, well, who is going to fix it? And we \nsay, not us. And then they ask the question, well, how are we going to \nfix it? And the response is, well, not this way, but fix it.\n  I think that the politics of the issue at hand before the Senate is \nreally very confusing to me. I cannot imagine going to my State of \nLouisiana and talking to a truck driver who is making, say, $25,000 a \nyear, and supporting a wife and two children, and explain to him how it \nis correct and good policy to say that he and his two children and his \nwife are going to subsidize a retired couple that is making over \n$75,000 a year in retirement income.\n\n  As a Democrat, how do I handle that? I suggest as a Republican, how \ndo I explain that? It is not explainable. It is not good politics. Even \nmore important, it is not good Government.\n  Medicare is going to be insolvent in the year 2001. We have an \nobligation to try and fix it. I think it is good policy to say to that \nperson who works every day and maybe makes $25,000 that we no longer \nare going to ask you to subsidize somebody's doctor's insurance that \nmay be sitting home, in retirement, collecting over $100,000 a year, \nclipping coupons.\n  Now, you would think that good policy for both parties would be to \nsay we want to help the guy who is struggling to raise his two \nchildren, support his wife, who makes $25,000 a year, by asking someone \nwho is retired that makes over $75,000 a year in retirement to pay a \nlittle bit more of what he is getting from the Government.\n  We asked the Congressional Research Service--and certainly they are \nbipartisan, nonpartisan--how many people are affected by this change? \nThey said that approximately 1.6 million people in the Nation age 65 or \nolder, one-half of 1 percent of the noninstitutionalized people, not in \nhospitals or homes, have adjusted gross income at or above the \nthreshold that this bill provides for--$50,000 for a single person or \n$75,000 for a couple filing their return.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BREAUX. That means only 1.6 percent of the people filing returns \nwould be affected by this. How many millions of people do we have back \nin our States that are making $25,000 and continuing to subsidize those \nwho are in retirement income? The average income in my State for \nworking people is about $22,000 or $23,000. We have very few people \nthat are retired that make over $75,000 a couple--almost none.\n  I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The Senator just stated, according to CRS, it affects \nonly 1 million people. If the numbers are so modest then could the \nSenator explain in his remarks, and I will be glad to ask for \nadditional time, if the numbers are so modest in terms of population, \nthen how are the financial savings so great?\n  Mr. BREAUX. It is not necessarily just the financial situation we are \nlooking at. We are looking at something that is called fairness. When \nwe, as Democrats, look at trying to tax people that are making $25,000 \nand a blue-collar job, driving a truck in my State of Louisiana, and \ntelling that couple that they should be subsidizing someone who makes \n$100,000 a year who is retired, that is not good policy.\n  So this is a policy change as much as it is anything else. It is a \nquestion of fairness. We have a system that is going broke and we are \ngoing to make changes. The changes should be fair. I suggest this is a \nfair and equitable change to ask for those who can most afford it to \npay a little bit more so those who can least afford it will not have to \ncontinue to subsidize those who are very well-off in retirement. That \nis a fair test. It is a good proposal. I suggest that we support it.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask 2 minutes additional time for the Senator to \nanswer a question.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 4 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. How much, then, is this going to save, or is it, as we \nbelieve, just a ruse to create the principle of means testing to get \nwhat I call the slippery slope done--that really will not save very \nmuch money in Medicare, and it really does not deal with solvency of \nMedicare, it just lays the groundwork for additional means testing.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I respond to the Senator from Maryland who has been \nactive in this issue, in addition to the overriding fairness, it saves \n$3.9 billion over 5 years. I suggest that when you add the fairness \ntest plus $3.9 billion to a system that is nearly broke and insolvent, \nthat is a good deal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, one thing that occurs to me listening \nto this debate is that some very, very important principles followed by \namendments are being put before the Senate in a context that the \nAmerican people do not fully understand nor have they any reason to \nbecause it has not really been discussed with them.\n  In speaking quite honestly, this sort of grew up within the Finance \nCommittee, of which I am a member, and it became a kind of a fluent \nsubject within the Finance Committee. It got a credence--had people for \nit, had people against it--it got its own momentum, and the Finance \nCommittee was acting apart from the rest of the Senate, and apart from \nthe rest of America.\n  I am not by definition innately opposed to means testing but I am \noppose to doing things before they receive what I call a larger \nconsideration,\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\nwhich I think falls into the commission on Medicare which is what I \nintroduced as a bill 2 years ago. It seems to me when you are dealing \nwith something in a State, for example, like West Virginia, where the \naverage senior citizen income is $10,700 a year, you really do not make \ndecisions like this--or like a number of other issues that have been \nbefore us --without a larger discussion with the American people, a \nlarger context being placed before the American people. We have \ntraditionally done that with major pieces of legislation.\n  This discussion has come out of a kind of sanctuary of privileged \ndiscussion. I am not saying it is not without merit at some point, but \nI do not think it is at this point, because of the absence of the \nlarger discussion of the American people. When you are dealing with \npeople that have $10,700 a year to live on, every deductible, every \nsingle decision about a means test, all of it counts, and it really \ndoes in human terms. I am not being evasive. I am simply reflecting \nwhat a whole lot of people in this country are very afraid of.\n  So my plea would be that we would not let up on this but that we \nwould continue this, but in the larger context of the commission on the \nfuture of Medicare, which I think is the only place to really do that. \nThat reflects not just my feeling about this amendment but other \namendments that I have voted on during the course of the day in a way \nwhich I might not vote on after a commission had discussed it and a \nnational discussion had been held. That has not taken place to this \npoint. It is kind of a privileged conversation, and it is not one I am \nentirely comfortable with on behalf of the people I represent.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the proposal \nto means test Medicare part B premiums.\n  Mr. President, I am not opposed in principle to asking wealthier \nAmericans to pay more for certain Government services. At the same \ntime, I think we have to be very, very cautious before making \nfundamental changes in a program as important as Medicare. And it's not \nsomething that should be done on a fast-track reconciliation bill, with \nlittle opportunity for public input or debate.\n  Mr. President, Medicare is a universal program that can benefit each \nand every citizen. The universal nature of Medicare provides a broad \nbase of beneficiaries that helps maintain the program's economic \nviability. By covering all eligible individuals, no matter their health \nrisks, Medicare spreads those risks broadly, as an insurance program \nmust do.\n  Yet increasing the costs of Medicare to better-off individuals \nthreatens to drive wealthier and healthier individuals away from the \nvoluntary part B program. And, at some point, that could undermine the \nbroad base of beneficiaries that is necessary. I am not prepared to say \nthat the particular proposal in this bill would do so. I don't know. \nBut it's a serious issue that deserves careful consideration before we \nmove forward.\n  Mr. President, beyond the need to ensure Medicare's economic \nviability, there's also a need to ensure that the program maintains \nbroad support among the public and in the Congress. That's why so many \nMedicare supporters are concerned about turning the program into \nanything that resembles a welfare program.\n  Now, Mr. President, at some point, these concerns may have to give \nway to the stark economic realities of upcoming demographic changes. \nBut if we are to move toward some type of means testing, we need to do \nit very carefully, to ensure that the public understands, and supports \nthe change. The stakes are too high to rush into this without preparing \nthe way, and making sure we're doing it right.\n  Mr. President, beyond the broad economic and political concerns \ninvolved with introducing means testing into Medicare, there are \npractical issues to resolve, as well. If premiums are to vary based on \nincome, who is to evaluate a person's income, and how? Will the IRS \ntake on the responsibility? Or will we create a whole new bureaucracy \nto do the job--some might call it, Son of IRS.\n  This proposal seems to adopt the latter approach. But many believe \nthis is duplicative and inefficient. It also raises questions about \nwhether this new bureaucracy will adequately protect the \nconfidentiality of senior citizens' private financial information.\n  A related question is how we can monitor the changing incomes of \nbeneficiaries. Take an individual who last year received a sizable \nsalary, but who was laid off at the end of the year, and now has no \nincome. How are we supposed to know that this person now cannot afford \na higher premium? I wonder whether this type of issue has really been \nthought through.\n  Mr. President, all of these issues need to be considered carefully \nbefore we rush into a proposal of this magnitude. Yet the proposal to \nmeans test premiums comes to us now at the last minute. It has not been \nsubject to hearings. Nor has the public been involved in the debate.\n  Mr. President, there is a more appropriate avenue for considering \nthis kind of proposal. The bill before us calls for a commission that \nwould study long term changes needed to sustain the Medicare system. So \nmy suggestion would be to wait, and have the commission study the \nproposal and options for implementation. The commission is required to \nreport back within a year. So this issue will not get deferred \nindefinitely. But we need to do this right.\n  Mr. President, I would remind my colleagues that we do not need to \nmeans test Medicare premiums to balance the budget. Nor is it necessary \nto make Medicare solvent for an 10 additional years. We've accomplished \nthose goals in the bipartisan budget agreement, and without resorting \nto means testing.\n  So, Mr. President, I would suggest to my colleagues that we should \nact with caution when it comes to a program as important as Medicare. \nMeans testing has potentially huge implications for the economic and \npolitical viability for the Medicare Program. And, in my view, it's not \nsomething we should be doing on a fast-track bill with little \nopportunity for serious review and public input.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I would like to briefly review the bidding \nhere, if I might. Part B is a program that provides for payments to \nphysicians; it is an insurance program. Nobody who is in Medicare has \nto take out this insurance program. Those that do pay a $45-per-month \npremium currently, over 99 percent of all Social Security \nbeneficiaries, take the part B insurance. That is what it is--\ninsurance. What is this premium that they pay the $45? That is \ncalculated to cover 25 percent of the costs of the program, of the \nentire part B cost. Twenty-five percent is what an individual pays. So \nwhere is the other 75 percent coming from? The other 75 percent comes \nfrom the General Treasury. So you get this anomalous situation of a \nvery low-income individual that might be the person that cleans the \nstreets, if you will, or cleans up our offices early in the morning; \nthat individual's income taxes go into the General Treasury, and then \npart of them come out to pay some millionaire retiree's doctor bills--\n75 percent of them. Now, something is wrong here. Why should those \npeople be paying 75 percent of Warren Buffet's doctor bills?\n  So what we have proposed here is that there be what we call a means \ntest. The wealthier individuals will pay more for that premium instead \nof having it come out of the General Treasury. So did we start with \nlow-income people? Hardly. Before anybody has to start paying more than \nthe 25 percent premium, that individual, if he is an individual, as \nopposed to a married couple, that individual has to have an income of \nover $50,000 a year as a retiree. And it gradually comes in a greater \nportion, until finally that individual, if he is making $100,000 per \nyear, is paying 100 percent of the premium. He doesn't have to take it \nif he doesn't want it. If he can go out and find a better deal \nsomewhere, so be it. But I suspect he will find that this is a very, \nvery good insurance program and he is delighted to pay the 100 percent, \nand he surely can afford it. It will only be $135 a month more, if he \nis paying the total premium, than if he were just paying the 25 \npercent.\n  What about the married couple? There is talk here about how onerous\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\nthis is. It doesn't even start with a married couple to pay more than \nthe 25 percent until that couple is filing an income tax return showing \nthat a $75,000 income. They don't pay the entire amount of the premium \nuntil their income is $125,000 a year. Where I come from that is a \npretty good income.\n  So, Mr. President, what we are trying to do is overcome this, I \nthink, shocking situation where a very wealthy person is only paying 25 \npercent of the cost of a program with the taxpayers of the Nation. That \ncleaning woman, her taxes are going into that general fund to come out \nand pay some wealthy person's doctor bill--75 percent of them. That, \nMr. President, just plain isn't fair.\n  The question is whether we should debate it longer. I don't know how \nlong it takes to understand the particular program we are proposing \nhere this evening. Now, there are going to be savings. As the \ndistinguished Senator from Louisiana pointed out, the savings are \nnearly $4 billion over 5 years. You can say, oh, that's not much. Boy, \nthat is getting pretty inured to Washington spending if you say $4 \nbillion isn't much. All that savings goes into the Medicare Program, \nthe part A program, the hospital insurance, which is about to go under. \nIs it me that says that? No.\n  We previously, this evening, quoted from the report of the trustees \nof the Medicare fund. Those trustees have used the most alarming words. \nI have here the little booklet that they put out in which they use \nterms of the part A trust fund, namely the Hospital Insurance. They use \nterms like--these are the trustees, and four of the six trustees are \nCabinet officers, all Democrats. This is what they say:\n\n       Further delay in implementing changes makes the \n     problem harder to solve. We urge the earliest possible \n     enactment of legislation to extend the HI trust fund. The \n     Medicare trust fund, the HI, will be exhausted in 4 years \n     without legislation to address it.\n\n  It seems to me, Mr. President, that this is a very worthwhile \nundertaking. It is the right thing to do. It is not hurting anybody. If \npeople at a $125,000-a-year income can't pay their entire insurance \nbill, then they are not doing their budgeting very well.\n  So, Mr. President, I strongly support this measure, which was \nreported from the Finance Committee.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Unanimously.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield 2 minutes. I listened to my friend and colleague \nfrom Rhode Island talking about how Part B of the Medicare system is \nsubsidized by 75 percent from the general funds. Well, of course, the \nhealth insurance of every Member of the U.S. Senate is also subsidized \nby roughly the same amount. When he talks about how bad it is for \nupper-income seniors to pay only 25 percent of their Part B costs, it \nshould be clear that Senators--whose incomes are all above the maximum \nthreshold they have set for senior citizens--also pay only 25 percent \nof the health insurance premium.\n  This is the point, Mr. President. Under family coverage for Blue \nCross, we only $108.40 per month, while the taxpayers spend $292 a \nmonth on our coverage. So that is what happens right here in the U.S. \nSenate. If we are going to begin to means-test taxpayer-subsidized \nhealth insurance benefits, why are we starting with Medicare?\n  The third part of our amendment changes this by requiring Senators \nwhose annual income is over $100,000 to pay for 100 percent of their \nhealth insurance premiums. As we have seen under the Lewin-VHI study \ncommissioned by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and \nMedicare, the top 25 percent of wage earners of this country pay \n$159,000 more into the Medicare system than they take out. By contrast, \nthose in the lowest income category--the bottom 25 percent--will \ncollect about $72,000 more in benefits than they pay in taxes.\n  You cannot assure us that higher income group is going to choose to \nstay enrolled in Medicare under these new conditions. Studies have \ndemonstrated that those in the top 25 percent pay more into part B than \nthey receive back. All we are asking for is a hearing on this issue. \nThose are the figures. I have the studies right here to demonstrate \nthat. Now, if that is true, we don't want to lose this group because \nthey are providing help and assistance for other needy workers. I must \nremind my colleagues that health status generally rises with income, \nwhich means wealthier senior citizens are generally healthier. If they \nchoose to leave Medicare, they take their premium dollars with them.\n  So I believe that it is true, and we have the testimony to provide \nit. We ought to at least explore this proposals impact on Medicare \nenrollment before blindly voting for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator is up.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself another minute. The fact is, if that is \ntrue--and I believe it is--we have to make a calculation of how many \npeople are we going to drive out of the part B, because we are raising \ntheir annual premiums to well over $3,000. You can't tell us different \nhere this afternoon. So, Mr. President, I think that this measure ought \nto be given more consideration.\n  A final point. Ten years ago, Medicare recipients spent on average 18 \npercent of their income on out-of-pocket health care expenses. It is \nnow up to 21 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 additional minute. The elderly already \nspend a disproportionate share of their income on health care. While \nthose under age 65 spend only about 8 percent of their income on health \ncare, Medicare beneficiaries spend an average of 21 percent. This \namendment will only increase that disparity. It poses, I believe, a \nserious threat to the Medicare system and it should be given much more \nthought and consideration than it has here today. Medicare's success is \nbased in part on the fact that all groups are treated equally -- poor, \nrich, younger, older, sick, healthy. This provision undermines the \nfundamental promise of Medicare that says you will all contribute an \nequal amount and you shall all be guaranteed equal benefits.\n\n  I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I oppose the effort to strike this \nimportant provision in the Finance Committee's bill. Since Medicare was \nenacted in 1965, there have been many legislative efforts to make it \nmore fair, to make it more progressive. Most colleagues, I suspect, \nsupport the Qualified Medical Beneficiary Program, the QMB Program and \nthe SLMB Program, the dual-eligibility program. All of these programs \nare efforts not in 1965, but much later, to make the program fair, to \nhelp lower-income beneficiaries, to make it more progressive. That is \nwhat these programs do.\n  Dual eligibility in Medicaid is a terrific program. It enables that \nlow-income individual to be held harmless against all costs, premium, \ndeductibles, copayment, as well as additional Medicaid coverage. QMB \ndoes premium deductible and copayment for all Medicare beneficiaries \nunder 100 percent of poverty. And it made the program fair, more \nprogressive. SLMB is up to 120 percent. The chairman has added a \nprovision that would allow it to go from 120 to 150 percent because of \nthe changes recommended by the President, shifting home health from \npart A to part B.\n  Those who argue against this change say that we are on the slippery \nslope somehow. We have done this before. There have been constant \nefforts to try to evaluate Medicare and to try to make it fair. This \nproposal makes Medicare more fair on its face. Individuals earning up \nto $50,000 a year will continue to enjoy a 75 percent subsidy in part \nB. That doesn't change. That is for individuals at $50,000 and couples \nat $75,000. We begin to phase out the subsidy of that part B premium. \nIt will go from about $560 to about $2,100. That $1,500 or $1,600 \nsubsidy that we currently have in place will be phased out. For \nseniors, with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 for individuals and \n$125,000 for couples, they will pay an unsubsidized part B. They will \nstill receive part A with no change, but for part B, physician \nservices, they will pay an unsubsidized premium.\n  It makes the program more progressive, Mr. President. It has been \nnoted,\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\nand quite correctly, that for many seniors there is a significant \npercentage of income that goes for health care. But what we need to \nlook at is that inside that senior population, there are significant \ndifferentials. For lower income beneficiaries, they will pay for health \ncare a higher out-of-pocket amount than higher income beneficiaries--30 \npercent versus 3 percent for higher income beneficiaries. This is a \nproblem that we are trying to solve. We are trying to make this program \nmore progressive.\n  As to the suggestion that we need to study this, this is not a \nproposal that just came out of the blue. This is a proposal that has \nbeen around a long time. It has been discussed; it has been opposed; \nall kinds of arguments have been thrown up against it. There have been \nall kinds of good suggestions that perhaps we can improve it somehow. \nSo this is not a brandnew proposal. We don't need to study this, Mr. \nPresident.\n  I have great respect for the senior Senator from Massachusetts and \nthe Senator from Maryland, as well. They come to the floor because they \ncare deeply about Medicare beneficiaries, wanting to preserve and \nprotect Medicare, which is the goal of this piece of legislation. By \nmaking Medicare more progressive, I believe we have a much better \nchance of securing the intergenerational commitment that Medicare \nrepresents.\n\n  Medicare is an intergenerational commitment on the part of younger \npeople to allow themselves to be taxed so that we can provide benefits \nto the beneficiaries of Medicare. It is a strong commitment. It is a \ngood commitment. It has made our Nation better as a consequence of \nhaving it in law. This change, by making it more progressive and fair, \nwill strengthen the commitment that we have for this good program.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Can I ask the Senator a question on my time? Will the \nSenator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KERREY. I am kind of busy.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I heard the Senator say this has been around a long \ntime. I think it has been on the floor here for about an hour. This \nwasn't the proposal that came out of the Finance Committee, was it?\n  Mr. KERREY. No, it was not the proposal that came out of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Had that been around a long time, too.\n  Mr. KERREY. Is this a jury deal, where I get a yes-or-no answer? You \nhave lots of time here.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I don't have much time.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, we did get a proposal that came out of the \ncommittee to use deductible instead of premium and, as a consequence of \nthat being untested, we changed it back to premium. The premium is not \nan untested proposal. I have been asked about whether or not----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. KERREY. Another 30 seconds? I can't say hello in 30 seconds.\n  This proposal has been around--adjusting by income the part B premium \nhas been around a long time. I know I was asked about it when I \ncampaigned in 1988. This is not a new proposal. It has been argued. It \nhas been vented. It has been discussed. It is reasonable. It is fair. \nAnd I hope my colleagues will oppose the Kennedy effort to strike.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 37 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield whatever time remains to Senator Mikulski.\n  Can we get 2 minutes to wind up for Senator Mikulski to make a final \ncomment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request for 2 \nadditional minutes?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object--I shall not--how you \nmuch time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 8 minutes. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has 37 seconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I would like to take it off the bill, if we can.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. We will give the Senator from Maryland 2 minutes off \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, 32 years ago this summer I graduated \nfrom the University of Maryland School of Social Work. And my very \nfirst job was to go out to the Baltimore neighborhoods to tell people \nwhat this new bill called Medicare was; to tell them what medical \nservices they would be entitled to. As I went door to door to door in \nthe streets and neighborhoods, onto the white-marbled steps of \nBaltimore, people's eyes opened wide. They could not believe that the \nUnited States of America had passed legislation that would provide them \nuniversal affordable health care in their old age and that it would be \nthe next step to the Social Security commitment; that they would have \nin perpetuity a safety net that did not have a previous condition on \nit; that the premium would be affordable; that it would be undeniable.\n  Thirty-two years later we are changing the rules of the game. The \nvery people that were 30 years old then are now in their sixties. They \ndidn't know it was going to be means tested. I respect the Finance \nCommittee. But I will tell you that there has been no national \ndiscussion on what it means to the solvency of Medicare.\n  All we are asking is strike the means testing now. Let's have an \nAmerican national debate, not a time-limited rule which we agree to \ntemporarily. But let's have a national debate.\n  The Finance Committee might have studied it. It might not be a new \nidea to them. But I will tell you something. It is a new idea to the \nAmerican people. And the middle class knows that the minute you start \nthis class-warfare language of means testing people over $100,000 and \nsay it is fair, button down your hatches, blue-collar workers. They are \ncoming after you next.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER [Mr. Coats]. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. President, listening to this argument here, it seems to me that \nit is extraordinarily disjointed coming from the other side.\n  Let's remember what we are talking about. We are talking about people \nwho are making $75,000 or $100,000 a year being supported in their \nhealth care under part B by people who are making $25,000 a year, \n$30,000 a year, or $40,000 a year. People who are working on a line job \nin New Hampshire, at a restaurant in Texas, and at a garage in New \nMexico are supporting people who are retired who are making $75,000 to \n$100,000. And what is the complaint from the other side? The complaint \nfrom the other side is that somebody who makes $100,000 might have to \npay 2 percent of their income in their retirement years to buy part B \ninsurance--2 percent. You tell me where you can go out and spend as a \nsenior citizen in the private sector 2 percent of your income and buy a \nhealth care plan that is going to cover you for physician costs. You \ncan't do it.\n  The statement was made from the other side that somehow these \nextremely wealthy people have been paying into the system more; and, \nthey paid in more and, therefore, they should get some sort of \nextraordinary benefit as a result of that where they are subsidized by \npeople earning $25,000 to $30,000 a year. That is simply not true. They \nmay have paid more into part A, yes. But they have not paid more into \npart B. Part B is on a cash basis system. It is a pay-as-you-go system. \nYou buy that insurance on an annual basis. The people who pay more for \npart B happen to be the poor men and women who are working in America \nwho are paying payroll taxes, and who are paying into the general fund \nand then have to subsidize to the extent of 75 percent the person who \nis making $100,000. That is the person who is paying more--the wage \nearner. The concept that high-income individuals should not have to pay \nthe full cost of the health care benefit which they are receiving, the \ninsurance benefit they are receiving, makes no sense at all. It makes \nno sense that someone who is making $100,000 shouldn't have to bear the \nfull cost of the part B premium.\n\n  We heard earlier today that the other side was surprised that people \nare living longer, and that is why they don't\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\nwant to move too quickly into the issue of whether or not we should \nraise the retirement age. We heard earlier today from the other side \nthat people were, I guess, surprised that the part A trust fund is \ngoing broke. That is why they don't want to move too quickly into the \nissue of whether or not people should have their age of retirement \nraised.\n  I can't believe, recognizing the speakers from the other side who \nhave been carrying the water on this issue, that they are surprised \nthat there are rich people in America, and that is what this is about. \nThere are rich people in America, and they are not paying their fair \nshare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished Senator from New \nYork.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, some may have thought that there has \nbeen a leakage of reality about the social insurance programs of the \nAmerican Nation; that only crisis brings us forward to some sensible \nresponses. But I think today we proved just the opposite. The vote \nearlier on extending the eligibility age for Medicare over the next \ngeneration to 67 years parallels exactly the measure we took at a time \nof crisis in 1983 with respect to Social Security. This was recommended \nby a commission of which I was a member. Senator Dole, our beloved \nformer majority leader, was a member.\n  Sir, I don't know about other Members of this body but I have not \nheard a word about that. It has been accepted. It is something that is \ngoing to take place over a generation. It makes sense.\n  The same on this matter of contributions of high-income persons--what \nis basically an intergenerational subsidy on retirement benefits and \nhealth-care benefits.\n  In 1983, we began to tax Social Security benefits for high-income \npersons up to 50 percent of their benefit. In 1993, in legislation I \nbrought to the floor from the Finance Committee, we took it to 85 \npercent. That is the actuarial income that is not paid by the \ncontributor himself or herself.\n  Sir, there has been no response or reaction to that, save acceptance \nthat it is fair, and it makes sense. This is fair, and it is necessary.\n  I would say once again I was a member of the administration of \nPresident Johnson when the planning for Medicare and Medicaid took \nplace. On part B we specified that half the premium would be paid by \nthe person choosing to take the option of buying this form of health \ninsurance. In 1972, we limited increases in the premium to the rate of \nincrease in Social Security benefits, which are tied to the Consumer \nPrice Index. But because of the higher rise in medical costs in the \nyears that followed, above the rate of price increase, we dropped it to \n25 percent. It is 25 percent today--not what we planned when we began \nthis program, when the costs were much lower and unsustainable in the \nyears ahead. The annual part B subsidy right now per person is $1,600 \nof general revenue--not trust fund. And if we have to provide that a \n$500,000 earner pays 2.9 percent, why can we not do so? I think, Mr. \nPresident, we are going to.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. ROTH. I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished \nchairman of the Budget Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Do you have some additional time you would like, if I \ncan take 5 minutes off the bill?\n  Mr. ROTH. All right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You keep your 5. I will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes, with the time to come off the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes off the bill to just \ntalk a little bit to the Senate about where we are.\n  First, let me inquire.\n  How much time remains for both sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 hour and 15 \nminutes remaining, and the Senator from New Jersey has 1 hour and 21 \nminutes.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I wonder if I might propound a unanimous consent \nrequest to get us moving on two votes?\n  I understand, immediately after we are finished debating this \namendment, that the next thing that would come up would be the second \nKennedy amendment which is subject to a point of order; I would make a \npoint of order, and the Senator would move to waive. And he has \nindicated that he would be satisfied with 2 minutes of debate on each \nside on the motion to waive.\n  I put that unanimous-consent request to the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  I apologize for interrupting.\n  Second, I would ask that we proceed as follows: That as soon as we \nfinish the debate on the current amendment, that we vote on it, or in \nrelation thereto, and then we proceed immediately, before we proceed to \nvote, we take care of the 2 minutes on each side on the Kennedy motion \nto waive, and then we proceed on two votes back-to-back with the first \none being 15 minutes and the second one being 10.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I apologize to the chairman of the \ncommittee. So you want to yield back the time and we would then ask \nconsent that it would be in order to make the point of order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We just got that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was glad to accommodate the leader, and always try to. \nBut I would like to at least say that we eliminate the 2 minutes. I \nwould like to at least have the opportunity to perhaps address the \nSenate for that period of time before we vote. It will not save an \nawful lot of time just to go back to back, as the Senator knows. I \nwould like to make just a very, very brief comment about what that \ncommitment is. We have very different amendments.\n  I would appreciate that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator objects. Why don't we just do it in two \nparts? We will dispose of the first amendment in the manner we \ndescribed, and thereafter there will be 4 minutes after that vote is \ncompleted, 2 minutes to a side, and that will be the subject matter \nof--that vote will be a waiver of a point of order that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico will make on the Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object--I shall not--will the \nSenator indicate approximately what time this back-to-back vote will \noccur?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time do you want to use Senator--2 or 3 \nminutes?\n  I would say 6 minutes.\n  Do you want some time? Ten minutes maximum.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Is this additional time to be yielded off the bill, or \njust because we are going to have additional time? I think we are over.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A total of 2 minutes for the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I was willing in accommodation to go back and limit our \nside. Now we have been limited. And now the other side is getting \nadditional time for the amendment. Then I would ask for equal time to \nbe able to respond. I would be glad to move ahead as agreed on earlier.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going to do that. We will yield our 2 minutes \nremaining to Senator Nickles, and I believe 5 minutes off the bill for \nme to accommodate some time taken off the bill on your side. That makes \nit about even.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Whatever. That is fine.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As long as your arithmetic is right. I would ask the \nParliamentarian. How does that time projection stack up?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only 2 minutes has been yielded off the bill. \nIt was yielded to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. So what is being requested over here now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The remaining 2 minutes on our side goes to Senator \nNickles, and I asked for 5 minutes off the bill.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Massachusetts----\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for equal time, and I probably will not use it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. I will cut my time down to 2 minutes. Might I ask \nright now, please?\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be in order that I make the point of \norder against the second Kennedy amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, I have time at the conclusion or you \nwant me to make it now?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think now we ought to ask unanimous consent it be in \norder the Senator make his motion to waive at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. That I can be in order to waive.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico, I \nam not trying to hold things up. Just a question on the way we are \ngoing. I have been waiting for quite a while to introduce an amendment. \nIs there a way that we could have some understanding about introducing \namendments after we get through with this as far as unanimous consent \nis concerned?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would, if I may on this side, Mr. President----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Surely.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I had promised the Senator from Rhode Island early \nthis morning that he would have an opportunity. He has deferred and \nwaited to introduce an amendment that he wanted to have done. As we \nheard from the Presiding Officer, we have about 2\\1/2\\ hours, as I \ncalculate it, left in total. So certainly if we can divide these up \ninto proper sized pieces, why if we could just lay it out----\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me just suggest that if we are going \nto go back and forth, we will have disposed of two Kennedy amendments \nin a row. And then I assume we should get at least one, if not two, and \nthen return to that side. And I would like to do that. Senator Gramm \nhas a simple amendment that should not take very long. We would like to \ndo that next, but I am not asking that we have time agreed to. And then \nis there another one on our side?\n  We then move to your side. You have one for Senator Reed.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Senator Reed would be willing to take 20 minutes \nequally divided.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the Reed amendment?\n  Mr. REED. It would substitute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Substitute for the whole bill?\n  Mr. REED. Yes, it is, eliminating some of the provisions we have \nalready debated with respect to the age limitation, MSA's, et cetera.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I do not want to agree to that other than to say you \nare entitled to an amendment. But it may be subject to a point of order \nin raising the same subject matter that has already been debated today \nwith a motion to reconsider, table and reconsider having already been \nvoted on. But if the Senator will let us look at it--\n  Mr. REED. I would be happy to let the distinguished chairman do that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Does anybody need time to discuss a complete \nsubstitute?\n  Mr. GRAMM. It might be a substitute.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It might be. Let's not agree on your time yet. You \nmight take more time than your 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. There is a half-hour on each by statute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, again since I initiated this \ndiscussion, I wonder whether I could not be a part of this. I have two \namendments--one Senator Mikulski wants to do with me --and I wonder \nwhether they could be part of it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will you tell me which one Senator Mikulski is with \nyou?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. The amendment Senator Wellstone and I wish to do is a \nversion of the restoration of the Boren amendment on nursing home \nreimbursement to ensure safety standards and adequacy.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. In how much time do you think you could deal with \nthat?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are going too far ahead. I do not even have the \namendments listed on anything that was given to me by that side. I do \nnot have the Boren amendment's reinstatement on this list. I have your \nmental----\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is the one that I would like to get in right now \non this unanimous consent, on the mental health. That one I have been \nwaiting several days.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senators, let me just suggest that we get the votes out \nof the way and in the meantime any Senator who has any amendments, we \nwould like to have--we now have 18 amendments, and that is without any \nprocess amendments and there may not be any process votes on this bill. \nIt may be that they will be saved for another time. But if you can get \nus any amendments, and as soon as this vote is over, I will try to \narrange yours in sequence, I say to Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can we proceed then?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator from New Mexico will restate \nthe unanimous-consent request, the Presiding Officer is somewhat \nconfused as to what the correct state of affairs is.\n  Will the Senator restate the unanimous-consent request we will order.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My last one is that it be in order for Senator Kennedy \nright now----\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do not need the time. Four minutes to the Senator will \nbe fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I need the Senator to do something else. I ask it be in \norder that he waive the Domenici point of order and he do his now even \nthough it is reserved for later.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I do so now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It seems we have time on our side. Senator Nickles has \n2 minutes under the half-hour allowance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator going to make a point of order?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I make the point of order that the Kennedy amendment \nviolates the Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the Budget \nAct, I move to waive the point of order and ask for the yeas and nays \non the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are \nordered.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would ask, if the Senator from Oklahoma will excuse \nme just a moment, so that we have a little longer sequence planned, \nthat is, after the Senator from Oklahoma, after the vote on the budget \nwaiver, I assume that the chairman intends to go to the Senator from \nTexas?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. And thereafter we put in line the Reed amendment to \nbe reexamined, and we will take a look at the timeframe. If we could \nplan the next two, that would probably consume the remainder of the \ntime. What would the Senator from New Mexico expect would come up after \nthat?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Look, I would like to leave it at that. We have three \nor four Republican amendments that I have to discuss with them. So \nlet's just leave it there and try to finish the vote, and we will try \nto sequence the Wellstone amendment in.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to vote against \nSenator Kennedy's amendment which would eliminate--some people call it \nincome testing, means testing, but I would rephrase it. It would \neliminate subsidies for upper income individuals on part B premiums. \nRight now the Federal policy is the taxpayers pay $3 for every $1 for \nall persons on Medicare part B. It does not make any difference if the \nperson has $1 million of income. We are asking taxpayers with incomes \nof $20,000 to be paying general taxes to subsidize their premium.\n\n  I do not think that is good policy. I might mention the Finance \nCommittee, when we corrected this, we did it with bipartisan support. \nWe have all known this issue. Some people say, well, let us substitute \nit. Let us do it in\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\nthe commission. We know this should be done. We know this is good \npolicy.\n  I might also mention this was not done so we would have more money to \nspend someplace else. This was not done in order that we could have \nmore tax cuts. The Finance Committee took 100 percent of the savings, \nof this amount of reducing subsidies for higher income individuals, 100 \npercent of that money and put it into part A solvency.\n  So all the savings that come from the increased premiums on more \naffluent people by reducing subsidies, all the savings that come from \nthat will go toward extending solvency in part A. And as I mentioned in \nan earlier speech, part A, the hospital insurance trust fund, has \nserious problems. It is going to have a shortfall in the year 2005, \nwithout these changes, of about $100 billion per year, and it grows \nfrom there. So we need to do more to save part A, to make sure the \nhospital bills will be able to be paid.\n  The Finance Committee took this step. They took it for, I think, all \nthe right reasons, for good policy, to eliminate subsidies for upper-\nincome people. I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nrecommendation that came out of the Finance Committee and to vote no on \nthe Kennedy amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I believe I have 2 or 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the unanimous-consent agreement, the \nSenator from New Mexico has 3 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thought I would just suggest to the \nSenate and those listening how many senior citizens are covered by this \nmeans testing. And here is what I think it is. First of all, let me put \nit in dollars. The premiums collected over the next 5 years amount to \n$125 billion. The income-conditioned premiums, the means-tested \npremiums, amount to $4 billion. That is 3.1 percent of the premiums \nwill be means tested.\n  What does that amount to in numbers? The best we can figure, out of \n38 million Americans, it is 5 percent--5 percent will be financially \naffected by this amendment.\n  So if you are going into some neighborhood and talking to seniors \nabout this, chances are pretty good that you are not talking to a \nsenior that is affected by this because only 1 out of 20 will be \naffected by this and 19 will not be affected at all.\n  I think that is a pretty realistic approach to trying to change this \nbasic part B law to be more realistic to those people who are working \nhard, paying taxes, are not even earning as much money as the retirees, \nperhaps raising two or three children, and unless their employer is \npaying insurance for them many do not have insurance. So I believe this \nis a good approach, and I am prepared to yield back the remainder of my \ntime.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute 21 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield my remaining minute to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, above the Speaker's stand in the House of \nRepresentatives is a quote from Daniel Webster which talks about doing \nsomething worthy of being remembered. I believe that if we defeat the \nKennedy amendment, given what we have already done by changing the age \nof eligibility for Medicare, that we will have adopted two changes \nwhich will dramatically change in Medicare. They will be the first \nthings we have ever done that will permanently strengthen the Medicare \ntrust fund, and I believe that we will have done something truly worthy \nof being remembered.\n  We do not do that very often around here. It is not very often that \nyou see courageous votes cast. And I think we will have seen two major \nones today.\n\n  I thought some note should have been made of that fact. I do not want \nto congratulate us in advance of casting this vote. But I think we are \ndoing something very important here, something that 10 or 20 years from \nnow every Member who votes against this amendment and votes for these \ntwo important reforms will be able to say to their children and \ngrandchildren they did something worthy of being remembered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On this vote, for the Senator to prevail, must he get \n60 votes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The \nSenator from Massachusetts has 37 seconds.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield back the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has been yielded back. The yeas and nays \nhave been ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I asked a parliamentary inquiry and I believe I got the \nwrong answer. How many votes are required for Senator Kennedy to \nprevail on this? A simple majority on the first one; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The first vote is on the amendment. A simple \nmajority is sufficient to pass this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I make a motion to table. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  The result was announced--yeas 70, nays 30, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 113 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--70\n\n     Allard\n     Ashcroft\n     Baucus\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bryan\n     Bumpers\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Coats\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Enzi\n     Faircloth\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Frist\n     Glenn\n     Gorton\n     Graham\n     Gramm\n     Grams\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Jeffords\n     Kempthorne\n     Kerrey\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Mack\n     McConnell\n     Moynihan\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Robb\n     Roberts\n     Roth\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--30\n\n     Abraham\n     Akaka\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Byrd\n     Cleland\n     Coverdell\n     D'Amato\n     Daschle\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ford\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Moseley-Braun\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n  The motion to lay on the table the amendment (No. 441), Division I, \nwas agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n     Motion to Waive the Budget Act--Amendment No. 440, Division II\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The question is now on the \nKennedy motion to waive section 310(d) of the Budget Act. There are 4 \nminutes for debate equally divided between the two sides.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, may we please have order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order.\n  Mr. LOTT addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think it will be helpful to all Members if \nwe can engage in a colloquy now, and I hope the Democratic leader can \njoin us so we can discuss how we will proceed from here.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, we do need order, I say with all respect.\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. With due respect to all Members, may we please \nhave order in the body? Those having conversations, please take them \noff the floor.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, my intent, of course, is to go now to the \nsecond vote on the Kennedy amendment, and then that would probably move \nus close to 7 o'clock. We would proceed to use the remainder of the \ntime on other debate or amendments that will be offered. I presume that \ntime will expire about 8 to 8:30. And then other amendments will be in \norder and will be debated tonight.\n  All amendments that are going to be offered need to be offered \ntonight, and then we will stack all the votes on all the amendments and \nfinal passage beginning at 9:30 in the morning.\n  We have discussed this with the Democratic leader. I do have a \nunanimous-consent request to implement that, but we will go ahead and \nhave the vote now, and then we will make the UC request after that \nvote.\n  I wanted the Members to know my intent. If that is agreed to, then \nthis next vote will be the final recorded vote tonight. We will begin \nto vote on all the amendments and final passage in the morning at 9:30.\n  I yield to the distinguished chairman of the committee, Senator \nDomenici. Mr. President, I ask the chairman, is that his understanding \nand does he have some feel as to what we are talking about here?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I think the time runs out about 8:30.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. About 9, because the time for the vote does not come \noff, it just adds to it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So what we will do is Senator Lautenberg and I will \nstay here until that hour, let's use the example of 9 o'clock. There \nwill only be one vote; it will be on the Kennedy point of order. We \nwill spend the rest of the evening with Senators offering their \namendments. It looks like there are about 20 of them. With a little \ndebate tonight on each one, they then will be taken up seriatim \ntomorrow with 2 minutes to a side, but I think they have to be offered \ntonight. That is what the proposal will be.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. As a point of clarification for everybody, by what \ntime do the amendments have to be sent to the desk?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. By the time we close up here tonight at 9 o'clock.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. When the time expires on the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. That request will be made momentarily.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, can I ask, do we have a list of order of \npriority----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Let's have order in the body.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will be glad to yield for a question from the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I ask the majority leader or manager of the bill, we have \na list of priority. I am in line, and I don't want mine too far down \nthe line.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is pretty high up the line. He is about \nfourth or fifth.\n  Mr. LOTT. Maybe even higher, depending on who is here to offer their \namendments at the time. Does the Democratic leader wish to add anything \nto what we have advised Senators?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the arrangement just described by the \nmajority leader is one that he and I have discussed, and I have \nsubscribed to, as well. This would allow us to complete our work on \nthis bill and provide the opportunity to those Senators who wish to \nhave a debate on their amendments--the time to do so is tonight. We \nwould then begin voting as early as 9:30 in the morning and have votes \non all remaining amendments sometime tomorrow morning.\n  I think it is the appropriate way with which to resolve the remaining \nissues on this particular bill, and I encourage Senators to offer their \namendments and complete our work on it by the end of the evening.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all \nremaining amendments in order to S. 947 must be offered prior to the \nclose of business today, and any votes that will occur with respect to \nthe amendments occur beginning at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday in a stacked \nsequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, will \nthere be a time for each amendment, for the proponents and opponents?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to amend that \nrequest to provide for a minute to explain the amendment on both sides, \n2 minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Two minutes equally divided. Will that same time be \naccorded to people who offer second-degree amendments?\n  Mr. LOTT. It would be, but they would have to be offered tonight, I \nremind the Senator.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. A second-degree amendment cannot be offered until the \nfirst-degree is brought up.\n  Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry. A second-degree amendment in \nthis scenario cannot be offered until the first-degree amendment is \noffered, can it?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct, but once the first-degree amendment is \noffered, then the second-degree----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The second-degree could be in order, and it is not \nnecessary that the second-degree amendment be filed or any notice given \nprior to that time.\n  Mr. LOTT. It has to be filed tonight once the first-degree amendment \nis offered, but you would not have to give notice until the first-\ndegree amendment is offered, if it is offered, or you would still have \nthe option, of course, to offer it as a first-degree amendment if you \nwant to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Is that a correct \nstatement, that the second-degree amendment would have to be offered \ntonight and you would not know precisely what amendment you would offer \nit to until tomorrow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is correct. The first-\ndegree and the second-degree would both have to be offered this \nevening.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is the Parliamentarian saying that if I have a second-\ndegree amendment to any amendment that is going to be offered here \ntonight before we adjourn for the evening, that I will not be allowed \nto offer second-degree amendments tomorrow to any one of those \namendments unless that second-degree amendment is filed also this \nevening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The second-degree amendment must be offered \ntonight and only tonight.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Offered or filed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Offered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Has to be offered this evening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I am not sure about the language here. How can you offer \na second-degree amendment before a first-degree amendment is offered?\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Chair will allow me, the first-degree amendments \nwould be offered tonight if Senators wish to offer them, and then the \nsecond-degree amendment would be in order to be offered tonight once \nthe first-degree amendment is offered.\n\n  I do not understand why that is a problem. You have to stay here to \noffer your second-degree amendment or have some leadership person in \nyour behalf offer that second-degree amendment, but there would be \nample opportunity on both sides tonight to offer second-degree \namendments if a Senator so desires.\n  Under the rules, all time will expire between 8:30 and 9 o'clock, and \nthe only time remaining then will be to offer amendments and to have \nthe votes in order on those amendments.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I have to stay here then until 10 o'clock tonight to see \nwhether a first-degree amendment to which I can offer a second-degree \namendment would be filed this evening, is that correct?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Could I get a parliamentary ruling on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator wants to offer a second-degree \namendment, the Senator would have to stay this evening to offer a \nsecond-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What the leadership has proposed is that between now \nand 9 o'clock any amendment that is going to be offered to this bill be \noffered, and\n\n[[Page S6144]]\n\nthen it says anybody that has a second-degree amendment to any \namendment that is offered tonight must also offer the second-degree \ntonight, leaving the work tomorrow to be just votes on the amendments \nthat were offered tonight, and any second-degree amendments, if any, \nwill also be voted tomorrow under the 2 minutes equally divided rule.\n  Mr. LOTT. I might say, Mr. President, we have a list----\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I object to the unanimous-consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, since there is an objection, then we would \ngo ahead with the amendment, and we will have an opportunity to discuss \nfurther with the Senator his concerns, and we will renew our request \nafter this vote.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would like to ask the majority leader a question, if I \nmight. I have a question.\n  I have an amendment which I will be presenting this evening, but it \nmay well be tomorrow that there might be modifications that the \nleadership might want to make to it which would be acceptable to me, \nbut that cannot take place unless that is all filed tonight?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It can be done by unanimous-consent request tomorrow.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. It can be done by unanimous consent tomorrow, I see.\n\n\n                     Division II--Amendment No. 440\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the Kennedy motion to waive \nsection 310(d) of the Budget Act. There are 4 minutes equally divided \nbetween the sides on this motion.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, under the current bill approximately 2 \nmillion Medicare recipients will, starting in January of next year, pay \nmore for their Medicare premiums. They did not know that yesterday. \nThey did not know that this morning. They did not know that at noon \ntoday, and they did not know it until just a few moments ago when the \nSenate made its decision to retain this provision.\n  This particular amendment asks the Senate to postpone the effective \ndate of this amendment for 2 years to permit the commission to review \nthe effect of the means-testing proposal and to allow the retirees \naffected by this increase to make changes in their family budgets to \naccommodate the significantly higher premiums that will otherwise go \ninto effect in just 6 months. Unless Congress takes other action during \nthis time, the provision would take effect in January 2000.\n  This time would give us an opportunity to fully discuss and debate \nthis landmark decision.\n  That is the practical effect of waiving the point of order. This is a \nmatter of great importance to the Medicare system and the 2 million \nbeneficiaries who will be affected by the proposal, and we ought to be \nable grant a reasonable period of time for its assessment and for \nseniors to prepare to pay more.\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I think that the last vote overwhelmingly \ndecided this issue. Income-related premiums are fair.\n  I just point out that by delaying it 2 years, we would lose something \nlike $1.3 billion in a program that is already in difficulty. These \nfunds are necessary and they are needed.\n  Mr. President, if a means test is fair in 2 years, then it is fair \ntoday. I see no reason for the delay. Let me remind my colleagues that \nthe premium increase is very modest, given the part B benefits.\n  I urge my colleagues not to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, I supported the amendment which \nwould means test this program, but I think a 24-month delay on this, \nwhile there is some loss of revenue here, is a wise move to make. We \nare moving very rapidly here on some major changes. I believe the means \ntesting is the right way to go.\n  Mr. ROTH. Point of order. Is time limited?\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 minute, if I may, 1 \nminute on means testing Medicare.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 30 seconds \nremaining on his time.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Briefly, it seems to me, a 24-month delay on this--I \nsupported means testing, but I think we ought to know the full \nimplication of what we are doing, and while there is a loss of revenue \nhere by not implementing, it is for 2 years. It seems to me that \nproceeding with a degree of caution to make sure all the people that we \nwant to benefit will be benefited and those to be excluded will be \nexcluded properly, is not a lot to ask.\n  I urge the proposal of the Senator from Massachusetts be adopted. It \nseems to me we ought not to be fighting over 24 months. We have agreed \nto means test. We waited a long time to get to this. Now we should do \nit intelligently.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to use my 1 minute to inform the \nSenators that I did not tell the Senate, when our distinguished \nmajority leader was seeking unanimous-consent requests, I do not intend \nto offer any process amendments here tonight or tomorrow. They are just \nas much relevant to the finance tax bill as they are to this one, and I \nchoose not to put them on here.\n  People may have had second-degree amendments to my process. There \nwill not be any process amendments on this, at least from this Senator. \nOthers might want to do them, but they are not second-degreeing mine.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and \nsworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion is rejected.\n  The point of order is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                      Unanimous-Consent Agreement\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we have again conferred with the Democratic \nleadership, and I believe we have this unanimous-consent agreement \napproved.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all remaining amendments in order to S. \n947 must be offered prior to the close of business today and any votes \nordered with respect to those amendments occur beginning at 9:30 a.m. \non Wednesday, in a stacked sequence, with 2 minutes equally divided \nbetween each vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate reads S. 947 \nfor the third time, the Senate proceed to vote on passage of the \nbalanced budget reconciliation bill, all without intervening action or \ndebate, and when the Senate receives the House companion bill, the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration and all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\ntext of S. 947, as amended, be inserted, the bill be immediately \nconsidered as having been read for a third time and passed and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without further action \nor debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, we can announce that that would be the last \nrecorded vote tonight. We will begin our stacked votes in the morning \nat 9:30. We are ready to go with the remaining debate and amendments \nthat will be offered.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I yield to the Senator from Illinois for a unanimous-\nconsent request, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. I thank my friend, the Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                             Change of Vote\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 111, I voted \naye. It was my intention to vote no. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent \nthat I be permitted to change that vote. It in no way changes the \noutcome of the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 444\n\n(Purpose: To provide waiver authority for penalties relating to failure \n                 to satisfy minimum participation rate)\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Gramm] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 444.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 947, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (n) Failure to Satisfy Minimum Participation Rates.--\n     Section 409(a)(3) (42 U.S.C. 609(a)(3)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``not more than''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (C), by inserting before the period the \n     following: ``or if the noncompliance is due to extraordinary \n     circumstances such as a natural disaster or regional \n     recession. The Secretary shall provide a written report to \n     Congress to justify any waiver or penalty reduction due to \n     such extraordinary circumstances''.\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, the amendment that I sent to the desk is \nreally a technical correction. When we were drafting the welfare bill \nin the Senate, we had a 5-percent penalty for failure to meet the work \nrequirement. It went up from 5 percent the first year to 10 percent the \nsecond and 15 the third, up to 100 percent. In conference, we decided \nto reduce the penalty for noncompliance in consecutive years from an \nadditional 5 percent to an additional 2 percent. So the penalty would \nbe 7 percent in the second year and 9 percent in the third, with a cap \nof 21 percent. Inadvertently--and everyone agrees it was a technical \nmistake--the staff added three words, ``not more than,'' which gave the \nSecretary discretion over the size of the penalties.\n  Senator Graham of Florida raised the question in committee as to \nwhether or not we should give the Secretary the power to waive or \nreduce the size of the penalty where there was a natural disaster or \nwhere there was a regional economic crisis.\n  So my amendment goes back and puts the actual language that we had \nagreed to in conference on the welfare bill. But it also addresses the \nconcerns that Senator Graham of Florida raised. It gives the Secretary \nthe power to waive the penalties for not meeting the work requirement \nin two additional cases which were not included in the original bill. \nOne is a natural disaster, and the other is in the case of where you \nhave a regional economic problem.\n  I think this deals with the concern that was raised.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that Senator Gramm has \ncompleted the introduction of his, and the vote will occur tomorrow \nwith 1 minute on each side.\n  I think we agreed that Senator Reed could go next. He has 10 minutes \non a full substitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 445\n\n (Purpose: To provide for a complete substitute of division 1 of title \n                                   V)\n\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. President. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold for a moment?\n  If there is no objection, the pending amendment will be set aside, \nand the Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. I thank you, Mr. President,\n  Mr. President, my amendment this evening gives my colleagues of the \nSenate a clear choice to stabilize the solvency of the Medicare trust \nfund without including some of the provisions which we already talked \nabout this afternoon, and others which undermine the concept of a \nuniversal Medicare system. Medicare provides excellent health care for \nall of our seniors--it is a system that has operated for 30 years, a \nsystem that works, a system that is supported by the vast majority of \nAmericans.\n  Specifically, what my amendment will do is provide for the revenue \nsavings and the cost savings that are incorporated in the underlying \nbill, but remove from that bill those provisions that harm the \nstructural integrity of the Medicare program.\n  My amendment would retain the Medicare eligibility age of 65. It \nwould strike the home health copay. It would add the current law that \nprotects Medicare recipients with respect to balanced-billing \nprotection for those recipients and beneficiaries who may choose to opt \nfor private fee-for-service Medicare health coverage. It would also \neliminate the means-tested provisions for Medicare. And, finally, it \nwould eliminate the medical savings account as a Medicare option.\n  All of these provisions which I have mentioned are not necessary to \npreserve the solvency of the Medicare fund. We can achieve solvency by \nagreeing to the savings and reimbursement changes which are in the \nunderlying bill. And we can provide for a solvent Medicare system in \nthe future without endangering the Medicare program itself.\n  I would like to comment on the specifics in my substitute.\n  First, as I mentioned before, my amendment would strike the rollback \nof the Medicare eligibility age to 67. I realize that this has been \ndebated today. But this is such a critical point that it bears \nrestating.\n  Reducing the Medicare eligibility age is exactly the wrong way to \nproceed with respect to health care reform--not just Medicare reform, \nbut health care reform in this country. Our goal should be to encourage \nmore participation in health care, to extend health care benefits to \nmore Americans and not to reduce health care coverage.\n  Indeed, it is a cruel irony tonight that one of the beneficial \naspects of the underlying legislation is the extension of health care \nto more children and, yet, we are contracting the health care coverage \nof seniors.\n  I believe also that this provision will send shockwaves throughout \nour entire health care system as companies are forced to realize the \nadditional liability under current accounting rules. Many employers \nprovide health care to their employees until Medicare eligibility age. \nIf that age is rolled back, employers incur more costs. If they incur \nmore costs and have to show it on the balance sheet, they are going to \nhave to make very difficult choices not only about the coverage for \nretirees, but also if they are going to continue to provide coverage \nfor their current workers.\n  This is something that should not be done lightly and, indeed, \nrepresents, a retreat from our commitment to provide more and more \nAmericans with access to good quality health care.\n  Let me also suggest with respect to the home health copay that this \nis a provision which does not support those people who particularly \nneed this type of support. Forty-three percent of the individuals who \nwould have to pay this copay have incomes under $10,000 a year. Two-\nthirds of persons using these benefits are women, one-third of whom \nlive alone.\n  Just yesterday we heard from a woman--an 82-year-old woman --who \ndesperately relies upon home health\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\ncare services. She--and many others like her--would be in no condition \nto pay the increased costs. This provision should also be stricken.\n\n  With respect to medical savings accounts, this is the provision which \nI think will go toward the unraveling of the Medicare system as we know \nit. Under the MSA concept, a senior would be required to use Medicare \nmoney to buy a catastrophic health policy, and any savings left over \nfrom Medicare's payment could be put in the medical savings account.\n  This provision will attract wealthy seniors who, frankly, can pay for \nsome of these costs. It would also attract those people who are \nhealthy. Essentially, they would be making a judgment whether they are \nhealthy enough to run the risk of avoiding significant illness, and, if \nso, this is a good option. If they are not so healthy, then their best \nrational choice would be to go for fee-for-service, traditional \nMedicare. The consequence would be that we would see wealthy, healthy \nseniors leave the Medicare system and, with them, the proportion of \nmoney that is contributed in their behalf. The remaining seniors would \nbe sicker, older, and more likely to use services. This would put \nincreased pressure on the Medicare program.\n  Those who see this as a way of making the system more solvent and \nmore secure are missing the point. MSAs would lead to a situation in \nwhich the system is harmed, more costs are piled upon Medicare, \nMedicare becomes more difficult to fund and, indeed, to support.\n  Also, my substitute would eliminate the means testing provision. \nPhilosophically, I think Medicare works because it is seen as a health \ncare program and not a welfare program. To the extent that we make this \npart B premium differential between wealthy individuals and nonwealthy \nindividuals, this program will take on quickly the shades of a welfare \nprogram. It will undercut the tremendous support in all ranges of \nAmerican life for the Medicare system.\n  This part B premium adjustment is done in the context of a voluntary \nsystem, a system in which seniors might perceive--particularly wealthy \nseniors--that it is no longer a good deal to be part of part B. These \nseniors could voluntarily leave or buy other types of insurance--in \nfact the industry, I think, right now is probably planning to sell.\n  Once again, we will see the unraveling of the Medicare system as more \npeople leave and as their contributions are taken with them from the \nMedicare system.\n  All of these together will lead to a situation in which we hear the \nfirst crack in the system. And as time goes on, those cracks will widen \nto deep fissures, and the solid support that we have today will \nultimately erode.\n  A final point is with respect to a provision in the underlying bill, \nthe lack of balanced billing protections in the private fee-for-service \noption. Current Medicare law balance billing limits protect seniors now \nand would be undercut because of the options in the underlying bill \nthat allow beneficiaries to choose medical policies in which physicians \ncould charge beyond the Medicare limits. This balanced billing \nprotection exists for fee-for-service, traditional Medicare recipients. \nIt should be in place for all beneficiaries of Medicare regardless of \nthe program they choose. My amendment would add balance billing limits \nto the Medicare Choice provisions of the bill currently without them.\n  In a sense, what this amendment does in the nature of a substitute is \nsay that we can provide solvency for Medicare. We can go ahead and \nprovide the opportunities to make careful, comprehensive review of the \nsystem. We can make changes. But we don't have to do it today. We don't \nhave to have to do it hastily. We don't have to do it in an ad hoc \nfashion which misses the systematic impact of all of these changes we \nhave talked about today. Rather, we can--as I think the agreement \nreached with respect to the budget agreement several months ago \nindicates--we can stabilize the system, reduce the increasing costs \nassociated with Medicare by roughly $115 billion and not defer, but \nstudy carefully and comprehensively and thoroughly the impact of some \nof these proposed changes.\n\n  This amendment stabilizes the system. It eliminates precipitous \nchanges in Medicare that will undermine the program--changes in this \nbill that may leave us in a situation where Medicare is no longer a \nuniversal program in which all of our seniors can participate. Medicare \nshould continue to be a program in which all of our seniors can and \nwill participate, and a program in which all of our seniors will be \nguaranteed high quality health care that they can afford.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from \nRhode Island for bringing this up. He stood against overwhelming odds \nas he introduced this substitute, because it did go over some ground \nthat we had already covered. But, to Senator Reed's credit, he is \ndetermined to make certain that the system is as fair and as effective \nas it can be.\n  I compliment him for sticking to this. I know the prospects may be \ngrim. But hope springs eternal. And that is the attitude that I think \nSenator Reed always has. I hope that the best will come as everybody \nreflects overnight on what is in his amendment.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. President. Does Senator Reed \nhave any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island has 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thought he agreed to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Indeed, I did.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator agreed to 10 minutes, and we agreed to 10 \nminutes in opposition, which we will not use.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was not the understanding of the \nParliamentarian. Let me check that.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It was informal. I did not state it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We don't have a consent agreement to that \neffect. But if there was a formal agreement, the Parliamentarian and \nthe Presiding Officer is certainly willing to accept it.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I did not hear the amount of time remaining \nbased on 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. And he yields back.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is the amendment, 600 pages long. \nWe do not know what is in it. We do not know if it meets the budget \nreconciliation instruction. We do not know what the Congressional \nBudget Office says it does to reduce deficits. It is obviously subject \nto a point of order, which I will make in a moment.\n  But I just want to remind Senators so we will know tomorrow that this \nbill also forces us to vote again on at least three amendments that \npassed by rather large votes here today.\n  It retains the medical care eligibility at 65. We have already passed \nan amendment that over the next 30 years implements an age increase to \n67.\n  It strikes the home health copay, which passed by rather substantial \nmargin.\n  It eliminates the means testing of Medicare, which we just finished \ndebating about 35 to 40 minutes ago and which passed with a rather \nsignificant vote.\n  It eliminates medical savings accounts as a Medicare option. Now, we \nhave not voted on that yet.\n  But those are some of the things that I know are in it.\n  I yield back any remaining time that I have.\n  I make a point of order that the amendment violates the Budget Act, \n310(b).\n  Mr. REED addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, pursuant to Section 904, I move to waive any \npoint of order against my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think everything from this point on is \nrather informal, so maybe we can work together on it. If we go to our \nside, we will have Senator Chafee, and then we will return to Senator \nWellstone, if that is satisfactory to him. He has been\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\nwaiting a long, long time. How much time would you like, Senator \nChafee?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Let me try 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten minutes. OK. And, Senator Wellstone, you need how \nmuch? And I need some of your time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Ten minutes will be fine.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And I can use part of that time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Ten minutes equally divided.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. How much time does he have--equally divided?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes. That's all right, you go now, and we will go next.\n  Senator Lautenberg, can we go ahead and set up times so all Senators \nwill know what to expect?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I think that is a good idea.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Whatever I am stating here, I am asking these will be \nthe times.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Rhode \nIsland will be recognized for 10 minutes, followed by the Senator from \nMinnesota, to be recognized for 10 minutes, with 5 minutes of that time \nto be given to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMEINICI. Is there somebody who wants to oppose Senator Chafee's \namendment?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. No.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Senator Chafee shook his head no.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator D'Amato?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Between the two of you.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Ten minutes each.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I will take 5 minutes and the Senator 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Ten minutes. I need about 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten minutes between you?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would like to have 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator D'Amato.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Just 5.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I don't know whether we are going to oppose it, but I \nwould like to keep 5 minutes. I think I am opposed to it.\n  Senator Hutchison.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would like 5 minutes on an amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Might I suggest that Senator Hutchison's amendment is \ngoing to be acceptable. Perhaps we can give you the 5 right now. We ask \nunanimous consent she have 5 minutes, but we may just let her go out of \norder to get hers taken, if that would not be objectionable.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Senator Durbin wants 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will try to make it short.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is that it? Senator Burns.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I have an amendment to offer, but I am not \ngoing to require any time. I can do mine in the morning, and after you \nlook at it, it may be acceptable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. You do it in the morning, but we will offer it for you.\n  Mr. BURNS. I want to do it tonight.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will offer it for you, and you will be able to \ndebate it in the morning.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is exactly right.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Any other Senators want any other time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection, we will add to the \nprevious request 15 minutes for the amendment of the Senator from Iowa, \nto be divided 10 minutes to the Senator from Iowa and 5 minutes to the \nSenator from New York; 5 minutes to the Senator from Texas for her \namendment; and 10 minutes to the Senator from Illinois on his \namendment.\n  Is there objection? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Now, Mr. President, I wonder if Senator Chafee would be \nso good as to let Senator Hutchison, whose amendment is going to be \naccepted--is your amendment acceptable also?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I would be delighted if my amendment would be acceptable.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. OK. We are going to let you go right now, and to the \nextent that violates the agreement, we ask unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished \nchairman.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 446\n\n(Purpose: To require States to verify that prisoners are not receiving \n                          food stamp benefits)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself and \n     Mr. Santorum, proposes an amendment numbered 446.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       At the end of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 10____.

The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I understand this has been cleared by \nboth sides. This is an amendment that I offer. It is an amendment that \npassed on a record vote of 409 to zero in the House. It basically \ncloses a loophole in the Food Stamp Program.\n  The GAO did a study and determined that the Federal Government is \nlosing nearly $4 million a year to provide food stamps for prisoners \nwho obviously do not need food stamps. Prisoners do not qualify for \nfood stamps because, of course, they are being fed in prison. But \nnevertheless, there is food stamp abuse going on where someone in a \nhousehold claims a prisoner to add to the food stamp benefits.\n  Mr. President, I am very pleased that this amendment is going to be \naccepted because I think it is very important that the States do a \nbasic check of their prison rolls with their food stamp rolls to make \nsure that the food stamps are being used for the purpose for which they \nwere intended.\n  Food stamps are an entitlement, as they should be. They are given to \nanyone who is in need. But I think it is not fair to double dip, and we \ncan save $4 million. In fact, that $4 million will go into some of the \nother very important programs that will be covered by this \nreconciliation bill.\n  So I am very pleased that we are closing this loophole, and I am very \npleased that we are also adding another part that provides nutrition \neducation for the low-income households through a network of social \nservice organizations. This is something that Senator Rick Santorum has \nbeen a leader in doing, and he is a cosponsor of this amendment. I \nthink we can do a lot of good.\n  So I thank the managers of the bill for accepting this amendment. I \nurge adoption of the amendment and ask that we have a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just wonder if I could ask--I was just informed of this \namendment as ranking member on authorization. I just want to make sure \nI understand it fully. I would ask the Senator from Texas to yield for \na question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, I would be happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. HARKIN. As I understand, what the Senator is saying is that right \nnow under the food stamp rolls, if there is a person in the household \nwho is incarcerated, that you just want to ensure that the changes are \nmade to reflect that there is one less person in that household for \npurposes of food stamp eligibility and food stamp allotment?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think what the Senator is asking is, is this going \nto affect the rest of the family? The answer is no. It is just that the \nprisoner would be taken out of the equation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is a good amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That had been accepted. We had failed to tell you we \nhad already agreed.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I appreciate that. It is a good amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Iowa for accepting the \namendment. I ask unanimous consent that it be adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 446) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will send another amendment to the \ndesk and ask for its immediate consideration. Then I want it to be set \naside for future consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is this being submitted pursuant to the unanimous \nconsent that it would be taken care of tomorrow?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. This is an amendment that we are placing--it is on \nthe ``DSH'' issue, and we are going to do a place-holder amendment, but \nit was suggested I go ahead and put it in.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. It was on the list. Could you send it to the desk?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I just want to formally submit the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 447\n\n(Purpose: To modify the reductions for disproportionate share hospital \n                               payments)\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Rockefeller, Senator \nJeffords, and myself, I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Chafee], for himself, \n     Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 448.\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment with Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Jeffords to ensure that the children's health \ninsurance block grant, which is what we provided for from the Finance \nCommittee, provides adequate health coverage for children and that it \nis affordable for most low-income families.\n  Let me say I am very pleased in this package we have $24 billion, $24 \nbillion set aside to provide health insurance coverage for some of the \n10 million children in our Nation who are currently uninsured. I thank \nthe chairman of the committee for helping us in many respects in \nconnection with how this health care money is dispensed.\n  There are two areas which remain of concern to me, namely what \nbenefits are we going to provide to these children and how much are we \ngoing to require their parents to pay toward health insurance; in other \nwords, deductibles and copayments. Under the Finance Committee bill, it \nprovides that the benefits should be actuarially equivalent to the \nbenefits provided under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. \nThis, of course, is not a single plan. It is a menu of plans that \nFederal employees may choose from. These plans are designed to meet the \nneeds of adult Federal workers and retirees, not children. Stating that \nthe benefits must be actuarial equivalent, which means the same dollar \nvalue, does not spell out what benefits the children will get. Children \ncould be denied critical benefits, such as vision and hearing care.\n  Some may say the States will offer the benefits that children need, \nbut that is not what the record shows. A survey by the National \nGovernors' Association of the 28 non-Medicaid--in other words programs \nthat are not pursuant to Medicaid-- State health programs for children \nfound that they did not cover vision care in 16 of these plans; 16 out \nof 28 did not cover glasses for these poor children, and 10 didn't \ncover hearing defects.\n\n  The amendment I am offering today would require that the benefits be \nat least the same as those under the standard Blue Cross/Blue Shield \nbenefit package, including hearing and vision services.\n  We are talking about very low-income children here. These are \nchildren who live in families of three where the gross income is under \n$18,000. We are talking about children at 133 percent of the Federal \npoverty level. They do not have extra money to provide for eyeglasses \nor hearing aids. What we do is provide that the package be the same as \nthe Blue Cross/Blue Shield package as far as benefits go. This is a \nstandard package and it includes eyeglasses and hearing aids.\n  In addition, we provide deductibles and copayments be eliminated for \nthose who are--not eliminated, but be nominal for those from these very \nlow-income families. So, that is the essence of it. It is a very good \namendment. I wish it would be accepted. And I yield now--how much time \ndo I have left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes and 40 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I yield 4 minutes to my colleague from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague \nfrom the State of Rhode Island. My comments on the amendment, this \nSenator's comments, would echo those of the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  In the present bill before us, there is a requirement that benefits \nprovided be actuarially equivalent to the benefits provided under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program or FEHBP, it sounds good. \nBut, in fact, since there are so many plans out there, you do not know \nwhat kind of benefits that is going to get you. Actuarial equivalence \nsimply guarantees a dollar amount that the insurance for each child has \nto add up to. It does not specify an actual level or set of benefits, \nwhich is the true meaning of decent and necessary health insurance. In \nfact, the child could very well not get inpatient services or not get \noutpatient services or not receive prescription drugs. Our amendment \nties benefits that would need to be provided to a child to a specific \nhealth plan that is available under FEHBP. Sixty percent of Federal \nworkers select the BC/BS standard PPO option. Our amendment says that \nbenefits provided to children must be at least up to that level, plus \nvision and hearing. We want our children to get hospital care, we want \nthem to get primary care, we want them to get preventive care. Basic \nprotections that a majority of Federal workers choose for their own \nfamilies.\n  The cost sharing requirements in our amendment would also set a \nstandard that would allow nominal cost sharing for families with \nincomes under 133 percent of poverty. For children in families with \nincomes above 133 percent of poverty, the Secretary must certify that \nthe cost sharing requirements are reasonable.\n  Mr. President, GAO did a study that found that several States fell \nshort in terms of providing adequate benefits. Alabama only provides \noutpatient care. Pennsylvania, which has been a national model, \nprovided only limited inpatient care. According to a NGA survey of 30 \nstatewide voluntary programs, only 8 States provide dental care, only \n11 States provide hospital care, only 14 provide vision care, and less \nthan half cover physical therapy services.\n  With the fresh infusion of Federal dollars that the Senate Finance \nCommittee is choosing to commit and spend on health insurance for \nchildren, there needs to be an assurance that the benefits provided are \nadequate and geared to meet the health needs of children. Under the \nproposal before us, the Federal Government will be picking up more than \nhalf of the costs of children's health insurance.\n  A GAO report found that Alabama and Pennsylvania and Florida and \nMinnesota still have a long way to go in addressing the needs of \nuninsured children in their States. For example, in the case of Alabama \nthey have covered less than 6,000 kids and they have 182,000 uninsured, \nin New York they have covered 104,000 but there is almost 600,000 they \nhave not covered. Yes, they are trying, but they need the resources we \nbring to them. The amendment I am offering with Senator Chafee will \nensure that children get the benefits they need to grow up healthy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, there are some saying, ``Oh, you are \ngiving them a Cadillac package.'' It is just not so. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record a comparison between what \nMedicaid provides, which some could say is a Cadillac package, and what \nwe have in here, which we provide, which is just what the Blue Cross \nprovides. You can see as you look down the list that Blue Cross does \nnot cover shoes and corrective devices, transportation to medical \nservices, family counseling, hearing care or vision care. So we go with \nthe Blue Cross package with the exception of adding vision care and \nhearing assistance.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n      COMPARISON OF BENEFITS OFFERED UNDER MEDICAID AND BLUE CROSS      \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n              Benefit                   Blue Cross          Medicaid    \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nInpatient hospital care............

We are talking about children at 133 percent of poverty \nor less. So I do not think this is going overboard. I very much hope \nthis could be accepted.\n  Mr. President, it is a good amendment and all it does is provide that \nwe know what the benefits are going to be for these children and we \ninclude with the standard package known throughout the country through \nthe FHEPA\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\nthat we provide for the vision care and hearing assistance.\n  Mr. President, I am delighted to support this package and would be \ndelighted to have any other assistance, cosponsors.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Could I just point out one thing? I want to \ncompliment the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and his staff \nbecause they were, in fact, as I understand it seriously considering \naccepting a version of our amendment. It was not ultimately accepted \napparently because some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ndid not want to have hearing and vision services included in the \nbenefits package. I deeply regret that. This really is a good \namendment, does deserve support, and reflects thinking on both sides.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That's not true.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I cannot vouch for what my distinguished \ncolleague from West Virginia was saying in that last statement, about \nwho was willing to accept it. I am not sure of all that.\n  All I know is I worked with the distinguished chairman of the \ncommittee and his staff. We were making some progress but I can't \naccount for what resulted in it not being finally accepted. That is \nbeyond my knowledge.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. I would say we did seek to work with the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island. No agreement was reached. Undoubtedly there \nis opposition to this proposal so we will have to deal with that in the \nmorning.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I appreciate that. Again, I join with the comments the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia said about the chairman of the \ncommittee. He worked hard with us on how this originally started, and \nwe are grateful to him coming as far as he did. We would be even more \ngrateful if he came a little further.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have taken a quick look. I would \nsay from our standpoint we think this is a pretty good amendment. I say \nto the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from West Virginia, we \nthink it is a pretty good amendment. Apparently there is some question \nyet to be resolved.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, that means this amendment goes on the \nlist for tomorrow with 1 minute on a side, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If it is subject to a point of order, that point of \norder is reserved for tomorrow?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, the Senator from New York, Senator \nD'Amato, asked to be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, are we ready for another amendment?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 449\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for full mental health parity with respect to \n  health plans purchased through the use of amounts provided under a \n                         block grant to States)\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Domenici, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Conrad, proposes amendment \n     numbered 449.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 862, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 2107A.--MENTAL HEALTH PARITY.\n\n       ``(a) Prohibition.--in the case of a health plan that \n     enrolls children through the use of assistance provided under \n     a grant program conducted under this title, such plan, if the \n     plan provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental \n     health benefits, shall not impose treatment limitations or \n     financial requirements on the coverage of mental health \n     benefits if similar limitations or requirements are not \n     imposed on medial and surgical benefits.\n       ``(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall \n     be construed--\n       ``(1) as prohibiting a health plan from requiring \n     preadmission screening prior to the authorization of services \n     covered under the plan or from applying other limitations \n     that restrict coverage for mental health services to those \n     services that are medically necessary; and\n       ``(2) as requiring a health plan to provide any mental \n     health benefits.\n       ``(c) Separate Application to Each Option Offered.--In the \n     case of a health plan that offers a child described in \n     subsection (a)(2) or more benefit package options under the \n     plan, the requirements of this section shall be applied \n     separately with respect to each such option.\n       ``(d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       ``(1) Medical or surgical benefits.--The term `medical or \n     surgical benefits, means benefits with respect to medical or \n     surgical services, ad defined under the terms of the plan, \n     but does not include mental health benefits.\n       ``(2) Mental health benefits.--The term `mental health \n     benefits' meant benefits with respect to mental services, as \n     defined under the terms of the plan, but does not include \n     benefits with respect to the treatment of substance abuse and \n     chemical dependency.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this past fall for me as a Senator, one \nof the proudest moments was when the Senate passed the Domenici--and I \nwas pleased to join him--Wellstone Mental Health Parity Act. This \nbecame part of the VA-HUD appropriations bill and became, really, \neventually the law of the land. This was a first and important step in \nending the discrimination when it comes to health care coverage for \npeople struggling with mental illness, to say we take another step \ntoward punching through some of the prejudice and some of the ignorance \nabout mental illness.\n  Mr. President, I thank, and I say to my colleague from New Mexico \nthis is really what it is all about--we have in the gallery, family \ngallery, people representing the National Alliance for the Mentally \nIll, the American Psychiatric Association, and the National Mental \nHealth Association. They have been here all day. This has been several \ndays we worked on this. I believe, thanks to the strong support of \nSenator Domenici, that we have now an amendment that will be approved. \nI thank him for his fine work.\n  I thank the people who have been here today, thank you for your help, \nand I would like to thank also Margaret Halperin who works with me in \nthe mental health area.\n  This amendment just says that now what we have done is we have \nfocused on children's health care, we have some $16 billion of \nadditional money. I thank the distinguished Senator from Delaware for \nall of his fine work on this. What this amendment says is--it does not \nmandate anything. What it says is when it comes to providing health \ncare coverage, now that it goes to States, as there is additional \nfunding to provide health care coverage for children if there is going \nto be mental health coverage in any package that we do not have any \ndiscriminatory treatment toward those children that are struggling with \nmental illness.\n  This is terribly important. What we are doing again is we are just \nkind of breaking through more prejudice. It is another step toward \nending discrimination and it is so important, I say to colleagues. This \nis passed now at night. Tomorrow I hope we will focus on it, if not on \nthe floor of the Senate I know there will be many people in the country \nwho will want to focus on it, groups and organizations here that will \nwant to focus on this.\n  What this means for families and for children, I cannot even begin to \nexplain. But let me simply say all too often it has been devastating. \nThere has been no coverage. All too often it is children who could be \ndoing well in school but are not able to, it is children who could live \nfull lives but are not able to. What we do with this amendment is we \ntake another step toward breaking through the prejudice, toward \nbreaking through the discrimination and, we say, now that we have funds \ngoing to States and now we are going to be focusing on the health care \nof children, please, colleagues, please remember that when we talk \nabout the health of children we are also talking about the mental \nhealth of children.\n  That is what this amendment says. That is what this amendment is all \nabout. I am so pleased that this amendment is going to be accepted. We \nwill work very hard to keep this in conference committee and this, \nagain, is\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\nan amendment with, I think, strong bipartisan support. And more than \nanybody here in the Senate I thank Senator Domenici for all of his \nhelp.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I obviously would be remiss if I did not \nthank Senator Wellstone for his diligence in this regard. I think the \ntime is now upon us, with the overwhelming passage of an amendment last \nyear which I sponsored along with my friend Senator Wellstone, which \nessentially said for the private sector, if you are going to cover \npeople that have mental illness, you have to create some parity for the \nmentally ill; that is, you cannot say they have less coverage per year \nor less coverage for the life of the policy. That set a very big wave \nof movement in the country to try to establish nondiscrimination in \nthese kinds of efforts. I think business is beginning to work its way \nthrough it.\n\n  Today, we offer an amendment very similar. It says the coverage that \nis going to be afforded to children under this bill, if mental illness \nis covered, it shall be covered with the same kind of coverage that you \nprovide for the physical illnesses.\n  There is a escape clause of a sort that has to do with making sure we \nare not impeding the formation of HMOs and managed care.\n  Nonetheless, I believe the time is right to try this one on in the \ncountry. We are moving step by step, leading to a point where mental \nand physical ailments will be treated the same in terms of coverage. We \nneed not make long speeches tonight. We made those to the Senate \nheretofore and we received very warm response.\n  On this one we do not have that much time. I yield whatever remaining \ntime I have. I understand the chairman and ranking member of Finance \nhave no objection to the amendment.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 449) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized for up to 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment----\n\n\n                         Privilege Of The Floor\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator to withhold. \nMr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Rick Werner, a detailee to \nthe Finance Committee from the Department of Health and Human Services \nbe granted the privilege of the floor for the duration of the debate on \nS. 947, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I know the hour is late but the subject is \nvery important and in a few moments I would like my colleagues to \nconsider what this amendment would do. During the course of passing the \nwelfare reform bill, we made many changes in many programs in an effort \nto move people from welfare to work. There were several aspects of that \nbill--even though I supported the bill in its entirety--there were \nseveral aspects of that bill which were troubling, not the least of \nwhich was the reduction in nutritional assistance for children in the \nUnited States. The purpose of this amendment is to correct what I \nconsider to be a very serious error and a serious problem in this \nlegislation, because with this amendment we will restore food stamps \nfor the children of legal immigrants.\n  Keep in mind that I have said legal immigrants. These are children \nlegally in the United States who are in poverty and have been denied \nthe protection and sustenance of the Food Stamp Program. It is a \nsignificant problem nationwide. Over 4,000 immigrant children in \nIllinois have lost their food stamps because of this welfare reform \nbill; over 283,000 nationwide. According to the Food Research Action \nCouncil survey of families living below 185 percent of poverty, hungry \nchildren suffer from two to four times as many individual health \nproblems such as frequent colds and headaches, fatigue, unwanted weight \nloss, inability to concentrate and so on.\n  These children--hungry children--are often absent from school. They \ncan have a variety of medical problems arising from nutritional \ndeficiencies, not the least of which is anemia. Hungry children are \nless likely to interact with other people, explore and learn from their \nsurroundings, and it has a negative impact on the ability of children \nto learn. We should be focusing on healthy children in America, not \nhungry children in America.\n  This amendment seeks to correct that problem by giving to these \nchildren the basic protection of food stamps.\n  Just a month or so ago, I visited the Cook County Juvenile Detention \nCenter, a facility which, unfortunately, is doing quite a large \nbusiness in juvenile crime. I spoke to the psychologist at that center \nand asked him what traits these kids who committed crime had in common. \nI would like to focus on one which he said was very common, a learning \ndisability, a neurological deficit.\n  I said, ``Where does that come from?''\n  He said it can come from improper prenatal nutrition, improper infant \nnutrition. These kids get a bad start, and with that bad start, they \ndon't learn as well, they become frustrated, they fall behind, they \nbecome truant, they drop out, they become statistics, crime and welfare \nstatistics which haunt us in this Chamber as we consider all of the \nramifications of a child's failed life.\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\n  Many times we overlook the basics. I am happy that my colleagues \ntonight have addressed children's health. I think that is something \nthat should be a given in America, that we provide basic health care \nprotection to all children. But can we then argue that children should \ngo hungry at the same time? The children that would be protected by \nthis bill would now be qualifying for food stamps. In my State of \nIllinois, many of the soup kitchens and other food providers have \nexperienced a dramatic increase in demand for services by children \nsince enactment of the welfare reform bill.\n  The Reverend Gerald Wise of the First Presbyterian Church in Chicago \nrecently came to tell me that the pantry at the First Presbyterian in \nthe extremely distressed Woodlawn neighborhood and the Pine Avenue \nUnited Presbyterian Church in the Austin neighborhood are stretched \nbeyond capacity.\n  Fifty-two percent of the cities participating in the U.S. Conference \nof Mayors' 1995 survey reported emergency food assistance facilities \nwere unable to provide necessary resources, and that is before the \nwelfare reform bill.\n  This amendment, which I have been joined in offering by Senator \nWellstone and Senator Boxer, restores food stamp benefits to legal \nimmigrant families with children 18 years and under. According to the \nCBO, it would cost the Treasury $750 million over 5 years.\n  We have established an offset in this bill from the administrative \nmoneys being given to the Governors so that they can administer the new \nwelfare reform bill, food stamps and other programs. Our amendment \ntries to ensure that Federal dollars are being used efficiently to make \nsure that direct benefits are given to needy children.\n  I am going to stop at this point, as I know some of my colleagues are \nwaiting to offer an amendment and others have been here a long time. I \nhope tomorrow when this amendment comes to the floor that my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle will join in a bipartisan spirit to help the \nchildren of legal immigrants. These children are likely to become \nnaturalized citizens in America. We want them to be healthy, productive \ncitizens, good students making this a better nation in which to live. \nIf we are pennywise and pound foolish and cut these children short when \nit comes to one of the basic necessities of life, food itself, we may \nend up paying the price for decades and generations to come.\n  Let us do the right thing, the compassionate thing, yes, the American \nthing. Let us make sure that hungry children are provided for.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have nothing other than we will take \nour minute tomorrow. Again, if this amendment is subject to a point of \norder, we have not waived the point of order tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 451\n\n (Purpose: To improve health care quality and reduce health care costs \n    by establishing a national fund for health research that would \n   significantly expand the Nation's investment in medical research)\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin, Senator \nSpecter, Senator Mack, Senator Rockefeller, Senator Daschle, Senator \nBoxer, Senator Kerry, Senator Durbin, and myself, I offer this \namendment and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], for himself, Mr. \n     Harkin, Mr. Specter, Mr. Mack, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Daschle, \n     Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Durbin, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 451.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 1027, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n             Subtitle N--National Fund for Health Research\n\n     SEC. 5995. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``National Fund for \n     Health Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 5996. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly 4 of 5 peer reviewed research projects deemed \n     worthy of funding by the National Institutes of Health are \n     not funded.\n       (2) Less than 3 percent of the nearly one trillion dollars \n     our Nation spends on health care is devoted to health \n     research, while the defense industry spends 15 percent of its \n     budget on research and development.\n       (3) Public opinion surveys have shown that Americans want \n     more Federal resources put into health research and are \n     willing to pay for it.\n       (4) Ample evidence exists to demonstrate that health \n     research has improved the quality of health care in the \n     United States. Advances such as the development of vaccines, \n     the cure of many childhood cancers, drugs that effectively \n     treat a host of diseases and disorders, a process to protect \n     our Nation's blood supply from the HIV virus, progress \n     against cardiovascular disease including heart attack and \n     stroke, and new strategies for the early detection and \n     treatment of diseases such as colon, breast, and prostate \n     cancer clearly demonstrates the benefits of health research.\n       (5) Health research which holds the promise of prevention \n     of intentional and unintentional injury and cure and \n     prevention of disease and disability, is critical to holding \n     down health care costs in the long term.\n       (6) Expanded medical research is also critical to holding \n     down the long-term costs of the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act. For example, recent \n     research has demonstrated that delaying the onset of \n     debilitating and costly conditions like Alzheimer's disease \n     could reduce general health care and medicare costs by \n     billions of dollars annually.\n       (7) The state of our Nation's research facilities at the \n     National Institutes of Health and at universities is \n     deteriorating significantly. Renovation and repair of these \n     facilities are badly needed to maintain and improve the \n     quality of research.\n       (8) Because discretionary spending is likely to decline in \n     real terms over the next 5 years, the Nation's investment in \n     health research through the National Institutes of Health is \n     likely to decline in real terms unless corrective legislative \n     action is taken.\n       (9) A health research fund is needed to maintain our \n     Nation's commitment to health research and to increase the \n     percentage of approved projects which receive funding at the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n\n     SEC. 5997. ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of \n     the United States a fund, to be known as the ``National Fund \n     for Health Research'' (hereafter in this section referred to \n     as the ``Fund''), consisting of such amounts as are \n     transferred to the Fund under subsection (b) other amounts \n     subsequently enacted into law and any interest earned on \n     investment of amounts in the Fund.\n       (b) Transfers to Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall transfer to the Fund amounts equivalent to amounts \n     described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Amounts.--\n       (A) In general.--Amounts described in this paragraph for \n     each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002 shall be equal to \n     the amount of Federal savings derived for each such fiscal \n     year under the medicare program under title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and the medicaid \n     program under title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) \n     that exceeds the amount of Federal savings estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office as of the date of enactment, to \n     be achieved in each such program for each such fiscal year \n     for purposes of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (B) Determination by secretary.--Not later than 6 months \n     after the end of each of the fiscal years described in \n     subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall--\n       (i) make a determination as to the amount to be transferred \n     to the Fund for the fiscal year involved under this \n     subsection; and\n       (ii) subject to subparagraphs (E) and subsection (d), \n     transfer such amount to the Fund.\n       (C) Separate estimates.--In making a determination under \n     subparagraph (B)(i), the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services shall maintain a separate estimate for each of the \n     programs described in subparagraph (A).\n       (D) Limitation.--Any savings to which subparagraph (A) \n     applies shall not be counted for purposes of making a \n     transfer under this paragraph if such savings, under current \n     procedures implemented by the Health Care Financing \n     Administration, are specifically dedicated to reducing the \n     incidence of waste, fraud, and abuse in the programs \n     described in subparagraph (A).\n       (E) Cap on transfer.--Amounts transferred to the Fund under \n     this subsection for any year in the 5-fiscal year period \n     beginning on October 1, 1997, shall not in combination with \n     the appropriated sum exceed an amount equal to the amount \n     appropriated for the National Institutes of Health for fiscal \n     year 1997 multiplied by 2.\n       (c) Obligations From Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--Subject to the provisions of paragraph \n     (4), with respect to the amounts\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\n     made available in the Fund in a fiscal year, the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services shall distribute--\n       (A) 2 percent of such amounts during any fiscal year to the \n     Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health \n     to be allocated at the Director's discretion for the \n     following activities:\n       (i) for carrying out the responsibilities of the Office of \n     the Director, including the Office of Research on Women's \n     Health and the Office of Research on Minority Health, the \n     Office of Alternative Medicine, the Office of Rare Disease \n     Research, the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences \n     Research (for use for efforts to reduce tobacco use), the \n     Office of Dietary Supplements, and the Office for Disease \n     Prevention; and\n       (ii) for construction and acquisition of equipment for or \n     facilities of or used by the National Institutes of Health;\n       (B) 2 percent of such amounts for transfer to the National \n     Center for Research Resources to carry out section 1502 of \n     the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 \n     concerning Biomedical and Behavioral Research Facilities;\n       (C) 1 percent of such amounts during any fiscal year for \n     carrying out section 301 and part D of title IV of the Public \n     Health Service Act with respect to health information \n     communications; and\n       (D) the remainder of such amounts during any fiscal year to \n     member institutes and centers, including the Office of AIDS \n     Research, of the National Institutes of Health in the same \n     proportion to the total amount received under this section, \n     as the amount of annual appropriations under appropriations \n     Acts for each member institute and Centers for the fiscal \n     year bears to the total amount of appropriations under \n     appropriations Acts for all member institutes and Centers of \n     the National Institutes of Health for the fiscal year.\n       (2) Plans of allocation.--The amounts transferred under \n     paragraph (1)(D) shall be allocated by the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health or the various directors of the \n     institutes and centers, as the case may be, pursuant to \n     allocation plans developed by the various advisory councils \n     to such directors, after consultation with such directors.\n       (3) Grants and contracts fully funded in first year.--With \n     respect to any grant or contract funded by amounts \n     distributed under paragraph (1), the full amount of the total \n     obligation of such grant or contract shall be funded in the \n     first year of such grant or contract, and shall remain \n     available until expended.\n       (4) Trigger and release of monies.--\n       (A) Trigger and release.--No expenditure shall be made \n     under paragraph (1) during any fiscal year in which the \n     annual amount appropriated for the National Institutes of \n     Health is less than the amount so appropriated for the prior \n     fiscal year.\n       (d) Required Appropriation.--No transfer may be made for a \n     fiscal year under subsection (b) unless an appropriations Act \n     providing for such a transfer has been enacted with respect \n     to such fiscal year.\n       (e) Budget Treatment of Amounts in Fund.--The amounts in \n     the Fund shall be excluded from, and shall not be taken into \n     account, for purposes of any budget enforcement procedure \n     under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 or the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I guess it was about 5, 6 years ago, my \nfriend and colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, came to me and said, \n``You know, we haven't been able to get sufficient funding for breast \ncancer research because there are those who object to our attempt to \ntake it from defense and transfer it over to NIH.'' I think we had just \nbeen rebuffed 50 some odd to 42 or 43.\n  Then he said, ``How about us keeping that money in the defense \nbudget. After all, a significant portion of the military will be women. \nThis is a matter of national health in our defense of our families.'' \nAnd we came forth with that proposal, and we were able to get a huge \nvote.\n  Since that point in time, forget about votes, we have produced, in \naddition to what was being funded by NIH, something in excess of $600 \nmillion for breast cancer research, and it has made a difference.\n  My colleague, once again, has come forth and said this time, \n``Alfonse, why don't we look to meet the needs that this body itself \nhas acknowledged in their overwhelming vote on January 21, 1997,'' when \nSenator Mack and my friend from Iowa, Senator Harkin, myself and \nothers, who offered an amendment which was designed to say, let us \ndouble, we call it the biomedical commitment research resolution, and \nit is so easy for us to vote for it because we voted to say yes, we \nwant to double the amount of money going into NIH for biomedical \nresearch because the demands are incredible, absolutely incredible. So \nwe voted 100 to 0.\n  Now comes the problem. How do we fund it? Notwithstanding that the \nchairman of the subcommittee, Senator Specter, is making every effort \nto find the funds, where does he get them? Where does he get them? What \nprogram does he cut? Does he cut food stamps further? We just heard an \neloquent presentation as it relates to the needs of children. What \nsenior citizen program does he cut it from? We have already seen the \nbattles when we look for funds. Do we give more money to breast cancer \nresearch at the expense of diabetes? What about emerging infectious \ndiseases? Incredible, frightening if you read what is going on.\n  Let me tell you, the investment of moneys into biomedical research \nwill pay great dividends, it will save lives, it will result in savings \nmany, many, many times more than what we invest, and it is so \nnecessary. I think about 80 to 90 percent of the worthy applications by \nsome of the great medical research centers of this country are being \nturned down, not because they are deficient, but because we simply \ndon't have the money.\n  I have to tell you something, there is nothing better that we can be \ninvesting money in than in terms of medical research for the prevention \nof illnesses, for finding out the cures, for doing the genetic \nresearch, for doing all of that work that so many of us talk about. We \ngo home and say, ``Yes, I am going to vote to increase it.'' Here is \nwhat we do.\n  Let us take the cumulated savings annually from Medicare and Medicaid \nthat this bill provides. Let me tell you, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Roth, deserves the appreciation and accolades of \neveryone, Democrat and Republicans, because he has crafted a bill that \nis designed to control costs and to produce savings. Let CBO, the \nCongressional Budget Office, look at the end of each fiscal year how \nmuch in the way of savings have been accumulated and provide these \nmoneys be set aside to be used exactly for that which we voted 100 to \n0, biomedical research in NIH.\n  Let us not fight to take money from one program that is so \ndesperately needed, whether it be for senior citizens, whether it be \nfor food stamps, and then say we are going to make winners of some at \nthe expense of others and not nearly meet the needs.\n  If we looked at the last 4 years, we will see we increased the total \nappropriations in these accounts by about $400 million a year. That is \nnot going to meet our commitment when we are talking about increasing \nit by $2.5 billion annually.\n  Mr. President, again, this does not impact, it does not need a \nrevenue offset. If the revenues are not generated, the savings, no \nexpenditure. If they are, I suggest we couldn't find a better and finer \nplace to put those moneys. If someone wants to then come in and make an \namendment to take part of those moneys and put them someplace else, \nthey can come to the floor and we can argue it out. But I believe the \nestablishment of that trust fund keeps the promise we made, that we \nattempt to look for ways to find the moneys that we all came out here \non the floor and voted for.\n  I commend my colleague. It has been a great privilege and pleasure \nfor me to work with him in this endeavor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New York for his \nkind words, but also, more important, let me thank him for his \nstalwart, unwavering support through the years for medical research.\n  I have been involved in this battle for a long time, and I have never \nfound anyone who has fought harder to make sure we had adequate funding \nfor all of the biomedical research we need done in this country than \nSenator D'Amato from New York. I thank him for that unwavering support \ndown through the years and for his support on this amendment also.\n\n  Mr. President, this amendment does have strong bipartisan support. \nSenator Specter and Senator Mack are cosponsors, as well as a number on \nour side--Senator Rockefeller, Senator Daschle, Senator Boxer, Senator \nDurbin, Senator Kerry. So it has strong bipartisan support.\n  I want to pick up on what the Senator from New York said. We voted \nnot long ago, the entire Senate, every one of us voted to double \nfunding for NIH by 2002. We are all in favor of that. But\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nit is very hard finding the money. I worked very hard with Senator \nSpecter when I was chairman and he was ranking member. Now he is \nchairman and I am ranking member. We have worked very hard to get \nadequate funding for NIH every year. It is getting more and more \ndifficult, and with this balanced budget which I am supporting \nstrongly, which I have continued to support in the past and will \ncontinue to support, it is going to be even harder.\n  If we wanted to double NIH funding by 2002 out of our discretionary \naccount, if we zeroed out all the other accounts we have--maternal-\nchild health care, the Centers for Disease Control, mental health block \ngrants and a host of others--if we zeroed all those out and shifted it \njust to NIH, we would still be $2 billion short of doubling it. We are \nnot going to zero out mental health block grants and the Centers for \nDisease Control and everything else. So we have to look for someplace \nelse to find this money.\n  Without our action, the investment in NIH research is only going to \ndecline in real terms. The only way that we can get it is by going \noutside of the regular discretionary spending process. I guess what \nthis amendment is, more than anything, is there was a book of \n``Thinking Outside the Box.'' We get put in these boxes and sometimes \nwe have to think outside of the box.\n  What this amendment does, again, to repeat, to reemphasize what \nSenator D'Amato said, this research trust fund would work in the \nfollowing way. Every year, CBO and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices would look back to determine whether the annual Medicare and \nMedicaid savings actually achieved as a result of the changes made by \nthe Balanced Budget Act exceeded the savings called for in the budget \nresolution. In other words, are there more savings than what was called \nfor to balance the budget? If that is so, if there are excess savings, \nthen that excess savings would be deposited each year into a health \nresearch fund to be distributed to NIH for the purposes of medical \nresearch. It is a very simple, a very elegant amendment, so offset is \nneeded.\n  As we consider long-term changes to the Medicare Program--and we will \nbe--the creation of a medical research trust fund is only common sense. \nI know a point of order will be made against the amendment that it is \nnot germane. I accept the fact that this amendment is not germane to \nthe bill before us. But I submit to you, it is every bit germane to the \nissue of saving Medicare and how we are going to deal with Medicare.\n  A number of recent studies have shown that investments in medical \nresearch can lower Medicare costs through the development of more cost-\neffective treatments and by delaying the onset of illnesses. Duke \nUniversity recently did a study that said the financial crisis in \nMedicare can be resolved without raising taxes or cutting benefits by \nimproving the health of older Americans through biomedical research. It \nis the key investment, it is the key to reducing health costs in the \nlong run. If we can find cures for things like breast cancer, lung \ncancer, Alzheimer's, the savings would be enormous.\n  Unfortunately, while health care spending devours nearly a trillion \ndollars annually, our medical research budget is dying of starvation. \nThe United States devotes less than 2 percent of its total health care \nbudget to health research.\n  Look at it this way, the Defense Department spends 15 percent of its \nbudget on research, and yet, in health care, we spend less than 2 \npercent. So we have smart bombs and smart missiles and everything that \ndefends our country, and we are all happy about that, but look what \nthey have done with research.\n  If we want a smart bomb and a smart missile to knock out lung cancer \nor breast cancer or Alzheimer's, or to help us with mental illness, \nthis is where we have to put the money.\n  Take Alzheimer's alone: Funding for Alzheimer's research is about \n$300 million a year. Yet, it is estimated that the 4 million people in \nAmerica who suffer from Alzheimer's is costing us about $100 billion a \nyear. That is about $25,000 per person who has Alzheimer's on average. \nIf we could just delay the onset of Alzheimer's for 5 years, that would \ngo a long way toward solving our Medicare problems.\n  Gene therapy, treatments for cystic fibrosis, Parkinson's--this is a \ntime of great promise. Almost every day new stories are coming out \nabout one advance or another. We are not suffering from a shortfall of \nideas. We are suffering from a shortfall of revenues.\n  Also, in the last several years the number of young people going into \nresearch is declining. The number of people under the age of 36 even \napplying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent in the last 10 years. \nWhy? Because when they submit their proposal, it gets peer reviewed. \nThey say it is a good grant, and there is no money. And so young people \nwho would want to pursue research look for other careers.\n  Well, again, health research saves money. It saves lives. And the \ntime is right. This fund will allow us to pursue the innovative cures, \ntreatments and therapies that will help us solve the Medicare Program.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, \nand Senator Mack, Senator Specter, with whom I work on the \nAppropriations Committee, and all the others who have worked so hard.\n  This is a very simple and elegant amendment. I hope that Senators \nwill take that step, sort of outside the box, to think newly, to think \nanew, to think about how we start getting more money into NIH, through \na process that will still help us balance the budget as we all voted to \ndo.\n  So, Mr. President, again, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Is there anything further on your side?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have two amendments I would like to just lay down.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Well, let me just make a couple comments, because we \nwill not be able to say much tomorrow.\n  It is with regret that I oppose this amendment, and actually I will \nraise a point of order because I believe it is subject to a point of \norder. I will do that tomorrow.\n  But, you know, it is kind of interesting. I do not know what money we \nare going to be using. You see, what the amendment says is, you take \nthe estimates of what we are supposed to save in this reconciliation \nbill from Medicare and Medicaid, and then you, whatever those estimates \nwere, you take a look and see if the new estimates say we save more.\n  Well, this is an estimate of an estimate. And I do not really know \nwhere the money comes from. I mean, do you wait until the end of 5 \nyears and then get the reality check, or do you do this based on \nestimates?\n  Now, that is just purely technical and budgetese. But, frankly, as \nmuch as I would like to put more into NIH, I believe it is not right to \ntake savings that accrue on the entitlement side of the ledger that are \nestimates and attribute that in advance to any function in Government, \nwhich is what we are doing here. If we are clairvoyant enough and wise \nenough in the future, and understand the future well enough to say if \nwe are saving money in Medicare and Medicaid, all that savings ought to \ngo to just this one program, how do we know there are not some health \nprograms that need some of that money? How do we know they should not \nbe used for tax cuts? That is what they are permitted to be used for \nnow.\n  And last but not least, I just do not think we need another trust \nfund. We have plenty of trust funds. We ought not create another one, \nto use the sense-of-the-Senate vote by which every Senator expressed an \nopinion and said, as I read it, we sure hope that within 5 years we \ncould double NIH. If you asked 100 people that voted for that, if they \nthought we were going to be able to achieve that, I believe 100 percent \nof them would have said probably not. So to turn around and use that to \ntake a slice of savings that might be applied either to the deficit, to \ntax cuts, to other entitlement programs, and say we just think now we \nought to cut that off and we ought to put them in the NIH, I do not \nbelieve is good budgeting. I do not believe it is a very good way to \nadvance fund anything.\n  So I will use my minute tomorrow. I will not have as much time as \ntonight to indicate what great respect I have\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\nfor these two Senators. Everybody knows that. Senator D'Amato from New \nYork is one of my best friends in the world. But I do not believe this \nis the right approach, and I have to resist it.\n  Mr. President, I make a point of order that the amendment violates \nthe Budget Act.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I move to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). What point of order does the \nSenator make?\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I move to waive the point of order on the budget.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thought the Parliamentarian knew so well what part of \nthe Budget Act this violates that I would not have to pick it out for \nhim. But if you give me a minute here, we will.\n  It is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive has been made.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. First of all, let me say there is no one that I have \ngreater respect for and no one who I admire more than my colleague and \nfriend from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. And I would ask, if the \nSenator might be willing, between now and the time the amendment comes \nup, to look at the question of the trust fund. As far as I am \nconcerned, and I think I speak for my colleague, if that were one of \nthe important issues, I think we could put that aside and have those \nmoneys allocated directly into NIH.\n  I would also indicate that I think in the draftsmanship of this we \nprovided that it would be only the year after on the look-back that the \nCongressional Budget Office would ascertain whether or not the mark we \nhave set, which would be set in law, by the way--this will no longer be \nan estimate, be set in law--that if it has been achieved and there has \nbeen an excess in the way of savings, that those dollars then would go \ninto this account at NIH for biomedical research.\n  Understand, it is exactly my friend's point that no one really knows \nwhere to get the money and that here is an opportunity to say that if \nwe do achieve these savings, yes, that we are making a judgment now; \nthat if we do, we are making a judgment to see that these dollars will \nbe allocated for these areas, whether it is Alzheimer's research, \ndiabetes, cancer, research on the brain.\n  I mean, the fact is, we desperately, desperately need these moneys. \nAnd here is an opportunity to identify with specificity and, yes, to \ncome forward and say, yes, if we have an extra $500 million or $1 \nbillion, that it will go into that account. And we will be making that \ncommitment that we talked about a reality.\n  So I ask my colleague and friend to just look at it in terms of if \nthere needs to be some additional language to tighten this up and to \ndeal with some of the parliamentary objections. And if there is a real \nquestion whether or not you want to set up a trust fund for this, that \npossibly we could deal with that in the manner that would facilitate \nthe spirit of that resolution that was passed saying we must do more. \nBecause I believe that the spirit was there and the recognition that we \nhave to do more in biomedical research.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I just want to again thank my colleague from New York.\n  And I want to say to the Senator from New Mexico, again, I know his \nstrong feelings on medical research. We fought side by side in the past \nwhen I was privileged to chair the Appropriations Subcommittee in \nworking with the Senator to increase funds for medical research. I know \nhis strong feelings, and I appreciate that.\n\n  Again, I just hope we can sort of think outside the box, as I said \nearlier, of looking at this and get this money into research. We have \nto do it, get more money into medical research. I mean, they are \nstarving out there. And the young people who want to go into research--\nright now, less than 25 percent of the peer-reviewed grants at NIH are \nbeing funded.\n  I always talk about medical research as sort of like you have doors \nthat are closed. You want to look behind the closed doors. Well, if you \nonly are looking behind one out of every four doors, the odds are four \nto one that you are not going to find the answer. If you look at two \nout of four, or three out of four, your odds are a lot better that you \nare going to find the answer. That is what we are attempting to do with \nthis amendment.\n  So, again, I hope that we can have a resolution of this and get on \nwith getting the increased funding for NIH.\n  Mr. President, I want to ask the Senator from New Mexico, before I \nleave, I have two amendments that I would just like to lay down. Should \nI do those now, send those up?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If you have not given them to the ranking member and \nwant to do them separately, he can. He is submitting all of your \nDemocratic Senators' amendments en bloc. He will do those for you, too.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will give them to Senator Lautenberg. I thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I do not want to leave with any the \nimpression that I am stubborn or unwilling to consider things when I am \nasked to. I will. But every time I consider, I think of more reasons \nwhy we should not do it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Don't think about it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. So I better not be thinking for a while. The $3.9 \nbillion that we transferred into the trust fund for Medicare from part \nB savings, what if we are over by $3.9 billion? Do we take the $3.9 \nbillion out of the trust fund and make it less weak and put that money \nin here?\n  Second, I was just thinking, where have we done this before? You \nmight all look at this. We did this because Senator Byrd at one time \nwanted to set up a trust fund so we could use a lot of appropriated \nmoney on crimefighting, because we had found kind of a bird's nest of \nmoney when some Senator decided that we were going to cut payroll for \nthe Government.\n  And so Senator Byrd said, well, if we are going to do that, let us \nput that trust fund in crime prevention. But, you know, over time all \nit has done has been--it is a business, it is an accounting thing. You \ngive that committee, to start with, that entrusted money, but that does \nnot mean that the appropriations give as much money to the committee \nthey would have if you did not put that in, and you end up getting no \nmore money for crimefighting. You cannot solve that riddle with \nadditions from an entitlement program.\n  So I will think about it. I will be glad to do that.\n\n\n                   medicare payment review commission\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Delaware, Senator Roth. As chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, I commend him for guiding this budget process through the \ncommittee with overwhelming bipartisan support and bringing these \nissues before the full Senate in a timely manner.\n  The legislation before us, establishes a new Medicare Payment Review \nCommission to replace the Physician Payment Review Commission [PPRC] \nand the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission [ProPAC]. The \nMedicare Payment Review Commission is required to submit an annual \nreport to Congress containing an examination of issues affecting the \nMedicare Program. The commission will review, and make recommendations \nto Congress concerning payment policies under both the Medicare Choice \nprogram and Medicare fee-for-service.\n  I have heard criticism that the Health Care Financing Administration \n[HCFA] does not keep up with the latest medical supply products, even \nif they prove to be cost-effective. HCFA has stated its intent to \nbecome a more prudent purchaser. Indeed, that goal requires analysis of \nboth the cost and quality of various products and requires constant \nreview of medical developments.\n  I understand that the new Medicare Payment Review Commission will \nhave broad authority and should include the ability to review and make \nrecommendations on procurement reimbursement and reform issues, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\nthe effect, impact and cost implications of competitive bidding, \nflexible purchasing and inherent reasonableness on the provision of a \nfull range of effective medical products and services to Medicare \nbeneficiaries.\n  Mr. President, I simply ask my colleague if that is correct?\n  Mr. ROTH. In response to Senator Frist's question, it is the \ncommittee's intent that the Medicare Payment Review Commission shall \nhave broad authority to study and make recommendations to Congress on a \nvariety of issues relating to the Medicare Choice program and the \nMedicare fee-for-service program. The committee recognizes that the \nprevious two advisory committees did not have explicit authority to \nstudy issues relating to reimbursement of durable medical equipment and \nmedical supplies. However, it is the committee's intent that the \nMedicare Payment Review Commission will have broad authority in these \nand other areas regarding the review of all Medicare reimbursement \nissues.\n\n\n                              dsh payments\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I would like to take a moment to clarify the intended \nmeaning of the changes in State allotments for disproportionate share \nhospital [DSH] payments as they impact States that have received \nwaivers to adopt managed care programs statewide, using DSH funds to \nhelp finance expanded care to the uninsured. Two such States are \nTennessee, which initiated the TennCare program in January 1994, and \nHawaii, which has operated the QUEST program since mid-1994.\n  In these cases, the States combine their DSH allotment and their \nregular Medicaid dollars to fund capitation payments to managed care \nproviders who are responsible for service not only to existing \nMedicaid-eligible recipients but to a substantial portion if not most \nof the children and adults who would not otherwise qualify for Medicaid \nbut who do not have coverage under other insurance programs. Direct DSH \npayments to hospitals have been essentially eliminated, because the \nhospitals and other providers receive payments to cover care to the \nuninsured through the waiver program, either from managed care \nproviders or, in the case of some hospitals, from the State under \nsupplementary pools.\n  The committee's legislation provides that DSH payments relating to \nservices to persons eligible under the State's Medicaid plan must be \nmade directly to hospitals after October 1, 1997, even where the \nindividuals entitled to the service are enrolled in managed care plans, \nand cannot be used to determine prepaid capitation payments under the \nState plan that relate to those services. That provision does not by \nits terms apply to States operating under waivers where the DSH funds \nare used to fund a broader range of services to the uninsured. I would \nlike your confirmation of this understanding, for it would be \ninconsistent with the TennCare and QUEST programs to apply the new \nprovision to them.\n  I also seek your concurrence that the adjustments to State DSH \nallocations are not intended to impact on the funds available to these \nwaiver States to operate their programs. Both Tennessee and Hawaii no \nlonger use their DSH allotments for DSH payments. As a result, CBO's \nestimates showed no impact on those States of the committee's provision \nadjusting DSH allotments and payments. That is entirely appropriate, \nfor these States are subject to limitations on their Medicaid funding \nby reason of the budget terms of their waiver. Moreover, they no longer \nmake DSH payments as we have come to know them, but instead have \ndeveloped more efficient means of delivering health services and have \nextended them to a broader segment of the population.\n  Can the chairman confirm my understanding of these two DSH-related \npoints?\n  Mr. ROTH. I am happy to confirm the Senator's understanding on both \npoints. There is no intention to alter the manner of distribution of \nfunds under demonstration waiver programs as long as those programs are \nin effect. Further, we do not intend any change in the budget and \nfinance provisions of these demonstration waivers, where the DSH funds \nare used to expand coverage to the uninsured.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 452, 453, and 454, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have three amendments that are going to be accepted. \nOne is for Senators Lieberman, Chafee, Jeffords, Kerrey, Breaux, Wyden \nand Kennedy, to require Medicaid managed care plans to provide certain \ncomparative information to enrollees. One is for Senator Feinstein to \nrequire managed care organizations to provide annual data to enrollees \nregarding nonhealth expenditures. And a third is a Craig-Bingaman \namendment to study medical nutrition therapies by using the National \nAcademy of Sciences to do that.\n  I send the three amendments to the desk and ask that they be agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendments.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] proposes \n     amendments numbered 452, 453, and 454, en bloc.\n\n  The amendments (Nos. 452, 453, and 454) en bloc are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 452\n\n  (Purpose: To require medicaid managed care plans to provide certain \n                 comparative information to enrollees)\n\n       At the end of proposed section 1941(d) of the Social \n     Security Act (as added by section 5701), add the following:\n       ``(3) Provision of comparative information.--\n       ``(A) By state.--A State that requires individuals to \n     enroll with managed care entities under this part shall \n     annually provide to all enrollees and potential enrollees a \n     list identifying the managed care entities that are (or will \n     be) available and information described in subparagraph (C) \n     concerning such entities.

Mr. President, I send this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Murkowski to the desk in compliance with the unanimous consent \nrequest for consideration tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 455.\n       On page 130, line 3, strike ``2002'' and insert ``2007''.\n\n                          medicare provisions\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, late last week the Senate Finance Committee \ncompleted work on one of the most significant and important pieces of \nlegislation considered in the U.S. Congress in recent memory. By a vote \nof 18 to 2, the Committee approved its portion of the Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1997, S. 947, the bill we are debating today.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I can vouch for the hard work \nthat went into the development of this historic legislation. It has not \nbeen an easy task by any stretch of the imagination.\n  The bill is not perfect. But it is a good start. And I hope it will \nget even better as it moves forward in the legislative process.\n  And, I want to take this opportunity to commend the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, Senator Roth, and the ranking minority member, \nSenator Moynihan, for their outstanding leadership in forging a \nconsensus on what has been one of the most contentious issues presented \nto the committee since I have been a member.\n  The committee was presented with budget reconciliation instructions \nearlier approved by both the House and Senate and tasked to provide for \nsignificant changes in federal spending and program authorizations \nprincipally in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\n  As my colleagues well know, these two entitlement programs are \ncurrently growing at unsustainable levels. Even the President's own \nhandpicked members on the Medicare Board of Trustees reported as early \nas April 1995 that the ``Medicare program is clearly unsustainable in \nits present form'' and that Medicare Part A will be bankrupt in the \nyear 2001 unless structural changes are implemented soon.\n  The legislation currently before the Senate attempts to address the \nnumerous and oftentimes conflicting issues associated with reducing the \nrate of growth in Medicare expenditures while preserving the level of \nservices available to current and future beneficiaries.\n  The one message that we must convey to our constituents is that we \nhave preserved the needs of Medicare beneficiaries while addressing the \nfiscal imperative of bringing some discipline in Medicare spending. \nBoth objectives are not mutually inconsistent.\n  Not only have we restrained Medicare growth over the next five years \nto a point that preserves fiscal integrity for now and the future, but \nwe have provided beneficiaries with greater choices of health care \nplans. ``Medicare Choice'' will now make it possible for beneficiaries \nto have greater options in how they want their health care provided.\n  In fact, not only will this legislation provide more options for \nbeneficiaries, it will offer them more information about those options.\n  Better Information about Coverage Options: One provision of the bill \nrequires that beneficiaries be provided with information about the \nextent to which they may select the provider of their choice, a concern \nof many elderly. The need for this provision was pointed out to me by \nthe Utah Psychological Association. The measure was included in the \n1995 Balanced Budget Act, and I am pleased that it was carried over to \nthe bill we are considering today.\n\n  Another information provision was suggested to me by Utah Governor \nMike Leavitt, who correctly pointed out that states are making \ninformation on managed care available to beneficiaries of state-funded \nprograms. Governor Leavitt suggested that the Federal government be \nrequired to coordinate the information it provides with state efforts; \nthat amendment is included in the bill today at my request.\n  The traditional fee for service systems, which all beneficiaries have \ncome to know, will still be there for those who wish to choose that \nsystem of health care delivery. But we are also going to provide more \nmanaged care options such as Health Maintenance Organizations and \nPreferred Provider Organizations as well as Medical Savings Accounts to \nbeneficiaries who desire to participate in those plans.\n  No longer will America's seniors be limited to one or two choices in \nhealth care. They will now have greater choices which will lead to more \ncompetition, a greater diversity of services especially in rural areas, \nand increased savings to the federal government which is fundamental to \nthe overall well-being of the Medicare program.\n  Home Health and Skilled Nursing Facilities: I am particularly pleased \nwith the provisions pertaining to home health care and skilled nursing \nfacilities or SNFs. In fact, the legislation reported by the Finance \nCommittee incorporates many of the important provisions contained in \nlegislation I introduced, S. 913, the Home Health Care Prospective \nPayment Act, and S. 914, the Skilled Nursing Facility Prospective \nPayment Act.\n  I have long supported efforts to enhance the quality and delivery of \ncare provided by home health care agencies\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\nand skilled nursing facilities. These organizations perform extremely \nvaluable services to our nation's elderly and disabled citizens. And, \nas our population increases in age, the role of these services in our \nsociety will become an even more critical component in the provision of \nhealth care.\n  It was also apparent from our hearings that the costs associated with \nhome health care and SNFs have been rising at a disproportionately \nhigher level compared to other components of the Medicare program. \nIndeed, part of this increase can be attributable to the fact that most \npeople prefer to be treated in the familiar surroundings of their home.\n  Accordingly to the General Accounting Office, ``After relatively \nmodest growth during the 1980's, Medicare's expenditures for SNFs and \nhome health care have grown rapidly in the 1990's. SNF payments \nincreased from $2.8 billion in 1989 to $11.3 billion in 1996, while \nhome health care costs grew from $2.4 billion to $17.7 billion over the \nsame period.'' Over that period, annual growth averaged 22 percent for \nSNFs and 33 percent for home health care, the fastest growing \ncomponents in the Medicare program.\n  Unquestionably, the rate of growth in home health care led to \nconsiderable discussion over the need for a new, minimal copayment for \nhome health visits as a measure to reduce over utilization. The \ncommittee approved a capped $5.00 copayment per visit which will be \nbillable on a monthly basis and limited at an amount equal to the \nannual hospital deductible under Part A.\n\n  I am mindful that we do not want to impose additional costs \nparticularly on the poor. But there was near universal agreement that \nsome method was needed to curtail the seemingly unchecked utilization \nof these services.\n  This is an issue we will have to monitor closely as the program is \nimplemented recognizing the administrative difficulties in collecting \nthese co-payments as well as the impact on beneficiaries.\n  Home Health and Skilled Nursing Facilities Prospective Payment \nSystem: Perhaps the most significant reform that is included in both \npieces of my legislation and which is now included in the Finance bill \nare the provisions for a prospective payment system for both home \nhealth and skilled nursing facilities. This provision will help create \nthe proper and needed financial incentives for providers to behave in a \nmore cost effective manner while protecting the quality and continuity \nof care for beneficiaries.\n  We have learned a great deal about Medicare reimbursement since we \npassed the Prospective Payment System for hospitals in 1983. We know \nthe value of a proper transition so providers can manage their agencies \ntoward a permanent system. We also know that we can model a payment \nsystem that encourages providers to manage costs and utilization \nbetter. We also realize that moving to a new reimbursement system is a \nmassive undertaking.\n  I believe the Finance bill moves in the right direction to ensure \ncost-effective care for millions of beneficiaries today, and well into \nthe next century.\n  Rural Health Care: The issue of health care in our rural communities \nwas also an item which received considerable attention. As we begin to \nprovide Medicare beneficiaries with greater choice in the delivery of \ntheir health care, it is apparent the financial incentives to providers \nto development of these systems in rural communities simply do not \nexist.\n  Accordingly, it was necessary to change the manner and level of \nreimbursement for managed care organizations that wish to provide \nservices in nonurban areas.\n  In 1983, Medicare began making payments to qualified ``risk-\ncontract'' HMOs or similar entities that enrolled Medicare \nbeneficiaries. The intent was to give Medicare beneficiaries the \nopportunity to enroll in HMOs as a more cost effective alternative to \nfee for service health care.\n  In effect, Medicare makes a single monthly capitated payment for each \nof the organization's Medicare enrollees. This payment equals 95 \npercent of the estimated ``Adjusted Average Per Capita Cost [AAPCC] of \nproviding Medicare services to a given beneficiary under a fee for \nservice system.\n  The committee legislation proposes to raise the Medicare payment for \neach year through 2002 which will have the effect of providing the \nnecessary financial incentives for managed care organizations to \ndevelop and sell products to beneficiaries in rural communities. This \nwill be particularly beneficial to residents of my state which has a \nstrong managed care presence in our urban areas but, as yet, little \npenetration in rural locations.\n  Debate on the AAPCC was extremely lively in Committee; it is a hard \ntask for set payment levels at an amount that will provide incentives \nfor managed care, but which will also encourage cost-efficiency with no \ndiminution of services for the elderly and disabled.\n\n  I want to comment on two issues associated with the AAPCC that will \nbe before the conference committee. The first is the transition from a \nlocally based payment rate to a rate that is decoupled from fee-for-\nservice reimbursement. The Medicare Equity and Choice Enhancement Act \nauthored by Senator Grassley establishes a five-year phase-in of a 50/\n50 blend of the input price-adjusted national average rate with an \narea-specific rate. I think this is a fair transition and one which I \nhope will be preserved in conference.\n  The second issue associated with the AAPCC is removing from the \ncalculation payments for graduate medical education and \ndisproportionate share hospitals. That change, reflected in the Finance \nbill, will allow a more equitable calculation of the AAPCC, one which \nwill help ensure that teaching hospitals receive the reimbursement they \nneed.\n  On the issue of reimbursement for managed care, I continue to remain \ndisturbed about the bill's provision which, in essence, discounts by \nfive percent payments for new beneficiaries. I fully appreciate the \nneed to find a ``risk adjuster'' which will provide us with a better \nmeasure of the cost per beneficiary, but to me the 5 percent discount \nis arbitrary. It will penalize organizations that are doing exactly \nwhat we are urging them to do: enroll new beneficiaries in managed \ncare. This is something at which I hope the conferees will take a \ncloser look.\n  Qualified Medicare Beneficiaries: Another payment issue, that of \nqualified Medicare beneficiaries (or ``QMBs'') is of great concern to \nme.\n  Current law requires Medicaid to pay Medicare cost-sharing charges \nfor individuals who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid \nassistance. These individuals are ``dual eligibles'' and QMBs who have \nincomes less than 100% of the federal poverty level (FPL) and meet \nother requirements.\n  Medicaid frequently has lower payment rates for services than would \nbe paid under Medicare. Medicaid program guidelines permit states the \nflexibility to pay either (a) the full Medicare deductible and \ncoinsurance or (b) cost sharing only to the extent that the Medicare \nprovider has not received the full Medicaid rate.\n  Several federal courts, including the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 11th Circuit \nCourts of Appeals, have interpreted current law as allowing providers \nto claim Medicare cost sharing for QMBs and dual eligibles in excess of \nMedicaid payment rates. Therefore, some state Medicaid programs are now \nreimbursing Medicare providers to the full allowable rates.\n  With the exception of one trial court decision in California, the \ncourts have overruled the HCFA policy that does not require the full \nMedicare payment.\n  I strongly prefer the outcome of the appellate courts and oppose the \nparticular provision of the Finance Committee version of the \nReconciliation bill that acts to reverse the four Federal Courts of \nAppeals decisions and will allow lower reimbursement for QMBs and dual \neligibles.\n  My position is consistent with the first of the principles adopted by \nthe Chairman in the Medicaid mark: ``Enhance the ability of the Federal \nand State government to meet the health care needs of vulnerable \npopulations.''\n\n  QMBs and dual eligibles are poor, and mostly elderly, individuals \nthat are dependent on both Medicare and Medicaid in order to receive \nquality health care.\n  Dual eligibles and QMBs are the very elderly (greater than 85 years \nold) and the very sick. For example, about 40 percent of QMBs have a \ncognitive or mental impairment (including many with out difficult \nchronic conditions such as stroke and Alzheimer's).\n  Minority group Medicare beneficiaries are more likely to be dual \neligibles. Compared with the general Medicare population, dual \neligibles are more likely to be women, living alone.\n  The QMB/Dual Eligible population is financially dependent on Medicaid \nto provide the needed supplemental insurance coverage to Medicare.\n  The bill, as reported by the Finance Committee, allows states to act \nin a fashion that would deny providers the full Medicare level of \nbenefits for these particularly needy QMB and dual eligible \nbeneficiaries, and will unintentionally fray the safety net precisely \nwhere it needs to be strengthened.\n  For example, a recent study by the\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\nPhysician Payment Review Commission reported that 43 state Medicaid \nprograms identified serious problems in maintaining adequate levels of \nphysician participation chiefly due to already low payment rates.\n  In fact, the study found that, over a 15 year period, sate spending \non physician services per Medicaid recipient failed to keep pace with \nMedicare by more than a threefold factor.\n  The better policy is to adhere to the precedent of the great majority \nof courts that have considered this issue and continue to compel these \npayments for these beneficiaries.\n  Frankly, it is difficult to see how the provision in the Finance bill \nto lower reimbursement for QMBs and dual eligibles will result in \nanything other than in undermining the willingness of providers to \ntreat QMBs and dual eligibles.\n  The Second Circuit, one of the several courts that have ruled in \nfavor of the framework I find preferable, reviewed the relevant laws \nand legislative history in concluding: ``* * * Congress sought to avoid \na wealth-based, two tiered system of health care for the elderly and \ncertain disabled and indeed wanted to integrate all of those who were \nMedicare-eligible into the existing health care system.''\n  As the 11th circuit said in the Smith Case, 36 F.3d 1074: ``we reject \n* * * attempts to wring ambiguity from a statute where there is none.''\n  The bill as reported by the Finance Committee is ambiguous, but is \nunambiguously a poor policy and will certainly affect the care received \nby those many physically frail QMBs and dual eligibles negatively.\n  I strongly prefer the House position on this particular issue because \nby not adopting the Senate Finance Committee policy it protects \nindividuals whose health and income status place them in a precarious \nmedical situation.\n  As the Washington Post editorialized, on June 16, 1997, on the \nproblem of the dual eligibles: ``* * * suddenly Medicare, which was set \nup to be a uniform, universal system for all the elderly and disabled, \nbecomes a two-tier system, with different levels of payment \nand therefore, in the long run, quite different levels of care for the \nbetter and the less well-off.''\n\n  We should not act to decrease access to quality health care for poor, \nsick and predominantly old individuals. We should retain and enlarge, \nnot reverse, a policy on QMB and dual eligible reimbursement that many, \nincluding four Federal appellate courts, have concluded is consistent \nwith the letter and spirit of both Medicaid and Medicare.\n  Chiropractic Care: Turning to another issue of great interest to me, \nthat of chiropractic care for Medicare beneficiaries, I am hopeful that \nthe conferees will be able to approve Representative Crane's provision, \nwhich I had hoped to offer in Committee.\n  Chiropractic services are currently provided in the Medicare program; \nhowever, the coverage is extremely limited to treatment by means of \nmanual manipulation of the spine. Moreover, current law requires \nchiropractors to obtain an x-ray before payment will be made even \nthough Medicare will not pay chiropractors to take the x-ray.\n  I had initially planned to offer an amendment identical to the \nlanguage in the House Ways and Means Committee that would remove the \nrequirement for x-rays as a condition of coverage and payment of \nchiropractic services. I would note that this provision also had the \nsupport of the Administration and was included in their budget proposal \nas well.\n  Unfortunately, the Congressional Budget Office scored the provision \nas costing $600 million over a five-year period. And, although it was \nincluded in the Ways and Means bill as I previously mentioned, the \nFinance Committee spending parameters did not allow for its inclusion \nprincipally due to the cost estimate.\n  Accordingly, I offered an amendment proposing a two-year \ndemonstration project to study the cost effectiveness of removing the \nx-ray requirement as well as allowing doctors of chiropractic to order \nand perform x-rays in both a fee for service and managed care setting. \nI am grateful that Chairman Roth indicated he would conditionally \naccept my demonstration amendment on the basis that a final CBO would \nbe de minimis. With that understanding, the committee unanimously \napproved my amendment.\n  I was astonished to learn yesterday that, in fact, the CBO scored my \namendment at $900 million--a third more than the entire provision in \nthe House! I have asked for a complete justification of this figure, \nbut pending that review, the Committee had no choice but to drop my \namendment.\n  I firmly believe that affording greater access to chiropractic \nservices by beneficiaries will not only result in reduced Medicare \nexpenditures but will also reduce the performance of needless surgery \nto correct back problems.\n  I hope that as this issue is addressed in the conference committee, \nthat the Ways and Means language will prevail, and will, therefore, \nbring a more pragmatic approach to the delivery of health care to our \nseniors.\n  Durable Medical Equipment: On reimbursement for durable medical \nequipment (DME), I am happy to report that the committee agreed to \ninclude an amendment I proposed which would allow beneficiaries to buy \nmore expensive equipment than that allowable under Medicare and pay the \nextra amount out-of-pocket. This is an amendment originally proposed by \nour former colleague, Senator Bob Dole, and I think it makes a good \ndeal of sense. Since this provision was contained in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1995, I am extremely optimistic it will become law this \nyear.\n\n  Orthotics and Prosthetics: On the topic of reimbursement for \northotics and prosthetics (O), I am grateful that the bill includes \nan annual update of at least one percent over the coming five years. \nO providers design, fit, and fabricate braces and limbs for persons \nwith physical disabilities. As such, this small industry is distinct \nfrom DME. O suppliers have much less control over the costs of their \nprogram than DME suppliers, given that it is hard to imagine ``induced \ndemand'' for O equipment. Consequently, I hope that any provisions \nundertaken to restrict the growth of DME, which I recognize is a \nconcern, will not be attributed to O as well.\n  Home Oxygen Services: One of the most contentious, and for me, most \ntroubling, issues associated with this bill was how to set the \nappropriate reimbursement level for home oxygen services.\n  None of us want to see quality diminished for this vital service. \nThat is clear.\n  But the Committee was presented with very compelling evidence that \npayment levels are too high.\n  For example, the General Accounting Office report comparing oxygen \nservices in the Veterans Administration to those under Medicare \nconcluded that the Health Care Financing Administration is paying \nalmost 40 percent too much for home oxygen.\n  I will be the first to admit that I do not know what the exact number \nshould be. Nor is there any statistical measure that can be reliably \nemployed.\n  I will say that there was virtual unanimity that the current payment \nlevels are too high. However, given the need to ensure continuing high-\nquality services for beneficiaries, I am much more comfortable with the \nHouse provision. Serious questions have been raised about the severity \nof the Finance recommendation and the effect that it could have on \nsmall, rural providers such as many who operate in my home state of \nUtah. If we are to err, I would rather err on the side of quality.\n  Fraud and abuse: I would also like to comment briefly regarding the \nnew fraud and abuse provisions in the bill. The bill, as amended by \nSenator Graham, contains new, significant and, in some respects, \nuntested anti-fraud and abuse penalties including additional Medicare \nexclusions and civil monetary penalty authority.\n  I believe that we need effective fraud and abuse enforcement tools. I \njust want to be sure that these provisions do not have any unintended \nconsequences or implications that would penalize innocent parties who \nare following the letter of the law.\n  Many of these provisions found in the Finance bill as amended are \nactually based on provisions contained in the Administration's fraud \nand abuse legislation introduced earlier this year, and on which no \nhearings were held in the Senate.\n  As a general rule, we in the Congress should not act without the full \nand open benefit of hearings so that all parties have an opportunity to \ncomment,\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\nand so that legislation can be modified as appropriate.\n  While I am not going to oppose these provisions, I do have \nreservations about some of them. And, I am encouraged to learn that the \nHouse intends to address some of these in conference.\n  The expanded authority with respect to the imposition of civil \nmonetary penalties was particularly troublesome.\n\n  The two provisions at issue included (1) the addition of a new civil \nmonetary penalty for cases in which a person contracts with an excluded \nprovider for the provision of health care items or services, where that \nperson knows or should know that the provider has been excluded from \nparticipation in a federal health care program; and, (2) the addition \nof a new civil monetary penalty for cases in which a person provides a \nservice ordered or prescribed by an excluded provider, where that \nperson knows or should know that the provider has been excluded from \nparticipation in a federal health care program.\n  While, certainly, no provider should contract with or furnish \nservices ordered or prescribed by another provider whom they know to be \nexcluded, the provisions also would subject providers to civil monetary \npenalties where they ``should know'' that another provider is excluded.\n  This ``should know'' standard has the potential to create anxiety \namong providers. What would rise to the level that a provider ``should \nknow?'' In my view, these provisions target the wrong providers--they \npunish the provider who is serving the patient based on a legitimate \nand legal prescription, rather than the excluded provider who is at \nfault.\n  For example, retail pharmacies fill thousands of prescriptions per \nmonth based upon prescriptions from numerous prescribers. It is not \nhard to imagine a situation in which a pharmacy would be unwilling to \nfill an emergency prescription for a sick child late at night in a \nrural community. The pharmacist might not have enough information about \nthe prescribing doctor to risk a $10,000 fine.\n  I think it is extremely important to clarify our expectations on this \nissue and others within the CMP section. Accordingly, I am pleased that \nChairman Roth agreed to the inclusion of report language that, in \neffect, clarifies that the committee ``does not intend these two new \ncivil monetary penalties--for arranging or contracting with an excluded \nprovider, or for providing items or services ordered or prescribed by \nan excluded provider--to impose an affirmative burden on providers to \nfind out if another provider has been excluded from a federal health \ncare program. Rather, only in instances where a provider acts in \ndeliberate or reckless disregard of another provider's excluded status \nmay the government seek to impose civil monetary penalties under these \nprovisions.''\n  Community Health Centers: Before turning to the final issue I wish to \ndiscuss, I just wanted to take a moment to mention my appreciation that \nChairman Roth agreed to continue the current reimbursement system for \nFederally-Qualified Health Centers.\n  FQHCs are the best way I know to deliver high-quality, low-cost care \nto underserved areas. They are increasingly being squeezed in today's \nmanaged care environment, in large part because they are providers of \nlast resort and have no insurers on which to shift costs if they are \nunderpaid. Studies have indicated that Community Health Centers, for \nexample, are only receiving about half of their costs from managed care \nentities. Faced with that situations, CHCs have little recourse, and \ncan only hope that their appropriated funds make up the difference.\n  This is a situation that I intend to follow closely. No one likes to \nargue for cost-based reimbursement; that is not a particularly \neffective payment mechanism. But, to require CHCs and Rural Health \nClinics (RHCs) to provide services at less than cost is also \ninefficient, and stifles the development of a cheaper alternative form \nof health care delivery which is proven to be high quality. There is no \neasy answer here, but let us not undercut these great little providers \nwhile we seek a solution.\n\n  Children's Health Initiative: Finally, I want to close by commenting \non what may be the most important provision of this bill: the \nchildren's health insurance initiatives.\n  Let me just say that a lot of progress has been made on the issue of \nchildren's health in the 105th Congress.\n  I believe that, when the history of this Congress is written, two of \nthe most important chapters will address the balanced budget agreement \nand the children's health initiative. It seems only fitting that this \nbudget reconciliation bill that brings the budget into balance includes \nthe key funding and program provisions on children's health insurance. \nOur kids will have a healthier future in both of these important \nrespects.\n  Let us be clear why we take these major actions to include $24 \nbillion in new spending over the next 5 years to pay for children's \nhealth insurance.\n  An estimated 10 million American children are without health \ninsurance.\n  This amounts to about 25 percent of the nation's uninsured \nindividuals.\n  In my state of Utah, about 10 percent of our children lack health \ninsurance. This amounts to about 55,0000 uninsured children in my \nstate.\n  Because the Medicaid program is targeted to provide health care to \npoorest of the poor, it is important to understand that many of the \nuninsured children in our nation come from working families with \nincomes just above the poverty level.\n  In fact, about 88 percent of these uninsured children come from \nfamilies where at least one parent works.\n  What I have been trying to do over the last few months is to help \nthese children from America's working families.\n  That's why I teamed up with Senator Ted Kennedy to introduce the \nChildren's Health Insurance and Lower Deficit Act (CHILD). In essence, \nthis twin legislation, S. 525 and S. 526, calls for an increase in the \nfederal tax on tobacco products in order to finance a voluntary program \nof state block grants for children's health insurance and to provide \nfor deficit reduction.\n  Because of our well-recognized divergent philosophies, Senator \nKennedy and I had hoped that, by drafting compromise legislation, we \nwould be able to attract support for our legislation across the \npolitical spectrum.\n  By and large, we have been successful with working with advocacy \ngroups like the Children's Defense Fund and the Child Welfare League to \nraise awareness of this issue. And, I believe we should give credit to \nthese organizations--as well as to health care providers such as \nchildren's hospitals and American Academy of Pediatrics--for their \ntireless and long-standing efforts to highlight the health care needs \nof children in our country.\n  And, although I do not see eye to eye with Senator Kennedy on all, or \neven most, matters, I must commend my friend from Massachusetts for all \nof his work and vision on this important issue. There is no more \ntenacious advocate in the United States Senate for a cause he feels \nstrongly about than Senator Kennedy.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts and I worked hard to arrive at a \ncompromise that would be attractive for many. As an ardent anti-tax, \nanti-big government conservative, the critical tasks were to devise a \nprogram that did not centralize decisionmaking in Washington and that \ndid not have the potential of growing out of control. It was also \nessential that it be paid for.\n  While I am generally loathe to increase taxes, the adverse health \neffects of tobacco and their concomitant costs to society, not to \nmention the costs to public programs, made raising the tobacco tax a \n``two-fer.''\n  Tobacco is a killer. I don't know of any other product that, when \nused as directed, will kill you.\n  Tobacco accounts for an estimated 419,000 American deaths annually. \nIn 1993, cigarettes killed more of our fellow citizens than AIDS, \nalcohol, car accidents, fire, cocaine, heroin, murders, and suicides \ncombined.\n  About 50 million Americans smoke.\n  About 1 in 5 deaths are smoking related.\n  4 of 5 smokers begin by age 18. About half by age 14.\n  Each day 3000 young Americans begin to smoke.\n  Experts believe that tobacco costs society $100 billion annually, \nincluding $50 billion in direct health care costs.\n  Of this $50 billion, there are $10 billion in annual costs to \nMedicare; $5 billion in Medicaid; $4.75 billion to other federal \nprograms; and, $17 billion in increased insurance premiums.\n  Not only does tobacco kill, it also results in a tremendous amount of \nunnecessary health care costs.\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\n  When all is said and done, use of tobacco products comprises the \nnumber one preventable public health threat.\n  A strong argument can be made that it is this unique public health \nthreat posed by tobacco that forms the basis of the justification for \nraising the tobacco tax.\n  The American public overwhelmingly approves of the idea of financing \nchildren's health programs through an increased tobacco tax.\n  An April 26, Wall Street Journal/NBC poll asked the public its \nopinion of financing state block grants for children's health care \nthrough an increase in the tobacco tax.\n  72 percent of Americans agreed with this proposal.\n  And this support cuts across almost every demographic category. For \nexample, more than 50 percent of smokers agree with the idea of \nincreasing tobacco taxes to pay for children's health insurance.\n  So the case against tobacco and for a tobacco users tax increase is \nstrong.\n  Overall, I am pleased with the children's health provisions of the \nreconciliation bill as reported by the Finance Committee.\n  Those involved in the efforts over the last few months to increase \nmaterially the funding for children's health insurance should take \ncredit for the addition of $24 billion in new funding over the next \nfive years.\n  Few could have thought that we could have come so far so fast in this \neffort.\n  I know that there are some that think we have, in fact, gone too far, \ntoo fast.\n  But I think that these critics who deny that we can utilize this \naverage $4.8 billion in funding wisely and prudently are just wrong.\n  If all of the states, for example, exercised the Medicaid option of \nthe block grant we know, applying the $860 per person average federal \ncontribution for a Medicaid covered child, about 5.58 million children \ncould be covered. This is barely half of our nation's uninsured \nchildren.\n  There are a number of ways to look at such a statistic. But in this \ncase, I think the glass is clearly half full. If we take care of more \nthan half of the uninsured children in our nation we will have achieved \na major accomplishment.\n  It is also possible that if states chose to exercise the block grant \noption, we will be able to take care of more kids than possible under \nMedicaid.\n  At this point, no one can know with certainty how many states will \nuse Medicaid and how many will use the block grants.\n  We do not know what eligibility criteria and financial requirements \nthat states implementing the block grants will chose to adopt. All of \nthese factors will affect how many children will be covered.\n  But before we get too caught up in focusing on the number of children \ncovered, we must not lose sight that it is also important to see what \nbenefits that covered children are going to receive.\n  The Finance Committee heard expert opinion from the Administrator of \nthe Health Care Financing Administration, Dr. Bruce Vladeck, that it \ncosts about $1000 per child for a quality children's health insurance \nplan.\n  So even with the increased flexibility of the block grants, do not be \nmisled to believe that $4.8 billion per year is somehow too much money. \nEven when we add in the required state matching rate and co-insurance \nand co-payment requirements, it is hard to project that even two-thirds \nof the nation's uninsured children will be taken care of by this $4.8 \nbillion a year.\n\n  Also, inflation in the health care sector will eat into the \npurchasing power of the average $4.8 billion per year allocation.\n  As I argued last week in the Finance Committee, I would have \npreferred to get the entire $20 bill in children's health insurance \nfunding over the $16 billion already set aside in the budget \nresolution. I pointed out that, taken together, these funds could have \ntaken care of the projected 7 million of the nation's uninsured that \nlive in families with incomes under 240 percent of the federal poverty \nlevel. This would represent about 70 percent of the uninsured children \nin this country.\n  While I was not able to persuade the full Finance Committee to \nallocate the full Hatch-Kennedy legislation on top of the initial $16 \nbillion set aside, I am pleased that the Committee did agree to the \nessence of the Hatch-Kennedy CHILD legislation by imposing an increased \ntobacco tax to finance children's health block grants to states.\n  Frankly, I think that one of the great watershed events of the return \nof Republican majorities in both chambers of the Congress is that the \ndays of tax and spend are over in favor of a more fiscally responsible \nclimate in which new taxes are seldom proposed and, if proposed, \nscrutinized with the highest degree of skepticism.\n  This is tough medicine but it is what we have to do to set our fiscal \nhouse back in order. We need to let working Americans keep more of \ntheir hard-earned money by looking for ways to tax and spend less of \ntheir income.\n  So, would I have preferred more money for children's health in the \nFinance Committee bill? Yes.\n  But, I would much more rather be in the position of having my \ncolleagues on the Committee nearly unanimously support a tobacco tax \nthat will generate, in part, an additional $8 billion over five years \nfor children's health that I would like to be in an uphill, all but \nhopeless, battle to win a major floor amendment on a fast moving \nreconciliation bill.\n  To me, the $8 billion in hand was more certain than the $20 billion \nin the bush--so to speak. Moreover, I believe that the positive, \nbipartisan support for the Finance Committee provisions bodes well for \nboth the success for the provisions and the program itself. The last \nthing I want is to make children the subject of an acrimonious debate \nover concepts and details.\n  This, of course, assumes that the Senate funding level and tobacco \ntax structure prevails in conference.\n  I have told my colleagues on the Finance Committee, some of whom--it \nis a matter of public record--are very much opposed to this source of \ntax revenue and this funding level, that if the Senate tobacco tax and \nchildren's health funding levels are changed in conference then I will \npursue, in every way that I know how, more funding. My goal is to get \nthis done, not just put out a press release about it.\n  Let me also say that it will be my firm position that any funds \nallocated toward children's health from the so-called ``global tobacco \nsettlement'' should be considered as distinct from, and additive to, \nthe funds earmarked for children's health in the Senate reconciliation \nbill.\n  One of the major reasons that I decided to compromise on the amount \nof funds that I would seek from the Finance Committee in the \nreconciliation process is because I was aware of the possibility that \nadditional funding may be available from the global settlement.\n  But let's not kid ourselves here. The global settlement faces a tough \nroad as it wends its way through the Administration, Congress, the \nCourts, and--perhaps most importantly--the court of American public \nopinion.\n  Suffice it to say that I will strenuously resist any effort to reduce \nin conference or subsequently any of the children's health funding \nalready secured. But, I also believe that my colleagues in both the \nHouse and Senate will see the merit in the provisions adopted by the \nFinance Committee. The need is compelling; the compromise program is \nreasonable; and it is paid for by taxing a commodity that not a single \nperson can defend as worthwhile.\n  While I did not get everything that I wanted in this legislation, it \nis seldom the case that any one legislator gets all that he or she \nwants. Since this is not a monarchy but a democracy, compromise and \nconsensus building is what distinguishes our form of government.\n  Given the original philosophical lines of scrimmage, I think the \nchildren's health provisions represent a good compromise. The bottom \nline is that we can all take pride in this provision.\n  The advocates for children and public health should take credit for \nsuccessfully raising the concern about the problem of uninsured \nAmerican children to the level of concern that a major funding \ncommitment--$24 billion over 5 years--was included in an otherwise very \nfrugal budget balancing bill. That's a big achievement that will \nbenefit literally millions of American children into the next century.\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\n  The governors should take credit for the fact that the final package \napproved by the Finance Committee gives the states a great deal of \nflexibility in devising programs and eligibility criteria that will \nwork best in their respective states. I am confident that the governors \nwill use their creativity to establish programs that deliver high \nquality health care to the children of working families.\n  Let me hasten to add that I recognize there are some provisions in \nthe bill of which the children's advocates and the governors do not \napprove. I understand those concerns. We all want to provide the best \npossible health care to our kids. But we also want the money to go as \nfar as possible. It is a balance, and we have endeavored to set the \nscales right.\n  But politics is the art of the possible. Only because of the debate \nthat we have engaged in over these last few months--a debate comprised \nof many perspectives and many heated moments--it will now be possible \nto help millions of American children to reach adulthood in good \nhealth.\n  I see this as both good public health and evidence that Congress is \ncapable of working constructively to address the nation's business.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n  In closing, Mr. President, I count myself among those who have worked \nhard for a balanced budget. As much as each of us wished otherwise, \nbalancing the budget is not some idle task. Indeed, it is the most \ndifficult of endeavors. We are faced with hard choices, choices that \nhave serious consequences for citizens everyday.\n  Again, if I were the only senator writing this bill, I would have \nwritten some provisions differently. I would have more tax relief, for \nexample. I would have spread spending reductions more evenly over the \nfive-year period.\n  And, if I can't have everything I want, President Clinton cannot have \neverything he wants.\n  But, on balance, I think that this bill lives up to its goals. \nSenators on both sides of the aisle, but especially the Senator from \nNew Mexico, deserve to be commended for developing this legislation.\n  When we pass this bill, Congress will have passed another balanced \nbudget bill. We will have preserved Medicare for the foreseeable \nfuture, and we have made a considerable downpayment on our children's \nhealth. And that is the most important legacy we can leave to our \ncountry's future.\n  I urge President Clinton to give this bill his unequivocal support.\n\n\n              medicare coverage of oral anti-cancer drugs\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, the budget reconciliation bill before us \npresents a historic opportunity to balance the budget, provide long \noverdue tax relief for families and ensure that important programs such \nas Medicare will be here for the next generation of Americans. I intend \nto support this legislation, but first, I would like to make a few \ncomments about the Medicare provisions.\n  We all know that Medicare is in serious trouble. For 2\\1/2\\ years, we \nhave been hearing that Medicare is going bankrupt. Today, we have an \nopportunity to do something to put Medicare back on the path to \nsolvency. This bill calls for reasonable structural reforms of the \nMedicare program. It extends Medicare's solvency and promotes more \nchoices for seniors--much like Members of Congress enjoy under the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits plan. If we truly care about \nMedicare--if we really mean it when we say that Medicare must be here \nfor our children and grandchildren, then it's not enough to just talk \nabout saving the program. We need to take action. And yes, we need to \nask the baby boomers and today's young people--who I might add are \nalready paying for a program which will not benefit them if we continue \nthe status quo--to accept some structural changes that are absolutely \nnecessary to protect and preserve this program. I commend those who \nhave had the courage to come to the floor and explain these reforms in \nspite of what the special interest groups say. On behalf of the next \ngeneration, I thank my colleagues who are constructively working to \nsolve Medicare's problems before it is too late.\n  Mr. President, reforming Medicare is not just about saving money. It \nis also about improving seniors' choices in health plans and treatment \noptions. One way to achieve these goals is by allowing Medicare \nreimbursements for orally administered anti-cancer drugs which cannot \nbe produced in intravenous form (I.V.). Unfortunately, this change was \nnot included in the bill before us. After considering that orally \nadministered anti-cancer drugs would simultaneously enhance the quality \nof life for cancer patients and save a significant amount of money, I \nhope the conferees will include this proposal in the final \nreconciliation bill.\n  Medicare's current policy with respect to coverage of anti-cancer \ndrugs is outdated. Medicare pays for injectable and intravenous anti-\ncancer drugs. Several years ago, Medicare law was amended to also allow \ncoverage for oral anti-cancer drugs, but only if they are available in \nintravenous form. This policy recognized that if a drug comes in both \nan oral and an I.V. form, it makes sense to provide coverage for the \ncheaper oral version instead of requiring patients to take the much \nmore expensive and often more toxic I.V. version. Since then, \nresearchers have developed oral anti-cancer drugs that are just as \neffective, easier to administer, and have fewer side effects, but are \nnot--and cannot be--produced in I.V. form. Because they have no \nintravenous formulation, Medicare does not cover them.\n  Efficacy, safety, and quality of life should be the primary factors \nwhen a patient and physician select the appropriate cancer treatment. \nUnfortunately, current Medicare policy forces many patients to make \nreimbursement the overriding factor. As a result, the patient is \nsubjected to procedures which are more invasive, more expensive, and \noften less appropriate simply because Medicare will pay for it. At the \nsame time, Medicare absorbs tens of thousands more in extra costs. For \nexample, the cost of intravenous treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer \nranges from $20,000 to $42,000 per patient per treatment course. At the \nsame time, the oral therapeutic alternative--which does not come in \nI.V. form--costs just $3,300. If Medicare covered the oral alternative, \nthe program could save between $17,000 and $39,000 per ovarian cancer \npatient, and the patient could enjoy a potentially better outcome and \nquality of life. Wealthy seniors can pay for the oral drug out-of-\npocket if that is their preference, but most seniors do not have that \nluxury.\n  Once again, I want to emphasize that when we talk about Medicare \nreform, we are not just talking about saving money. We also want to \ncreate incentives for individuals to seek the most appropriate care. \nChanging Medicare law to allow coverage of oral anti-cancer drugs meets \nboth tests. I urge my colleagues to incorporate this change in \nconference. The Health Care Financing Administration supports it. \nCancer patients deserve it. Medicare would save money because of it. \nThere is no reason not to do it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, although none of us received all of what \nwe wanted in this budget deal, I rise today not to point out its \ndeficiencies. Rather, I want to highlight the key strength of this \nagreement--It makes Medicare and Medicaid smarter.\n  It is smart to root out fraud and abuse; it is smart to permit \ncompetition; and it is smart to promote preventive health care.\n  Cracking down on those who abuse the system is smart. Paying less for \nmore goods and services is smart. And preventing diseases is smart.\n  My colleagues and I are here today not to eliminate Medicare and \nMedicaid. Nor are we here to preserve the status quo. We are here to \nmake these programs smarter--More efficient, more equitable, and more \nsolvent.\n  We were faced with the politically unenviable task for paring \nMedicare by $115 billion and Medicaid by $23 billion to accomplish the \noverarching goal of this legislation--a balanced budget by the year \n2002.\n  Both health care providers and senior citizens will share in the \nburden of meeting this goal.\n  Mr. President, before we ask providers and senior citizens to \nsacrifice, we should feel confident that this budget makes inroads into \ncutting fraud and abuse out of the program.\n  Just yesterday, my esteemed colleague, Senator Harkin, discussed\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\nsome of our mutual concerns in this area. Senator Harkin and I have \nlong been champions of anti-fraud measures and pro-competitive \nmeasures, sometimes to the consternation of health care suppliers and \nproviders.\n  Senator Harkin was right yesterday when he spoke strongly about \nMedicare's need to begin negotiating for the best deal on supplies and \nequipment, like other Federal agencies have done. It makes no sense \nthat Medicare--the largest single purchaser of health care services in \nthe country--has to follow a price list set out in seven pages of \nstatute rather than relying on competition.\n  Our efforts in this area have been bipartisan. Just last week in the \nSenate Finance Committee, I, along with Senator Nickles, sponsored an \namendment to give the Health Care Financing Administration the \nauthority to institute competitive bidding for part B services. My \ncolleagues on the Committee stood with me as we unanimously adopted \nthis proposal. It is my sincere hope that my House colleagues will \nfollow suit.\n  Implementation of competitive bidding is one way in which Congress \ncan show that we have finally gotten serious about preserving the \nintegrity of Medicare.\n  Another way is to begin a serious crackdown on fraud in not only \nMedicare, but Medicaid. Congress simply cannot be taken seriously when \nit asks for sacrifice if we are not willing to push as hard as we can \nto prevent people from ripping off the system.\n  Let me give you some brief examples of the rampant problems we face \nin this area:\n  In 1993, in my home town of Miami Lakes, FL, the Office of the \nInspector General reviewed 100 claims for Medicare reimbursement by a \nhome health agency. About out-fourth of these claims did not meet \nMedicare guidelines in that they either were unnecessary, not \nreasonable, or not provided at all. The home health agency made $8.5 \nmillion in claims, $1.2 million did not meet the reimbursement \nguidelines.\n  Two years ago, I spend a day working in the U.S. Attorney's Office in \nSouth Florida. There I learned that it is easier to get a provider \nnumber under Medicare than it is to get a Visa card. It is easier to \nget a blank check signed by Uncle Sam than it is to get a household \ncredit card.\n  Mr. President, we cannot repair the Medicare Program without first \ncracking down on fraud and abuse. Those who play by the rules should \nnot have to suffer at the hands of cheats and swindlers, and this \nCongress should put an end to the conditions in which cheats and \nswindlers thrive.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Roth for including many of the \nMedicare anti-fraud proposals contained in bipartisan legislation I \nintroduced with Senator Mack and Senator Baucus last month, including \nmandating that providers post a $50,000 surety bond to participate in \nthe Medicare program.\n  While a $50,000 bond is relatively inexpensive to post for scrupulous \ncontractors, at a cost of about $500, the requirement has achieved \ntremendous results in my State. Since implementation of the \nrequirement, the ``fly-by-night'' providers have scattered like so many \nroaches when the lights are turned on.\n  Durable Medical Equipment Suppliers have dropped by 62 percent, from \n4,146 to 1,565; home health agencies have decreased by 41 percent, from \n738 to 441; providers of transportation services have disenrolled from \nthe State's Medicaid program in droves--from 1,759 to 742, a drop of 58 \npercent. Fewer providers bilking the State's Medicaid Program is \nprojected to save over $192 million over the next 2 years in Florida.\n\n  Mr. President, we have expanded the surety bond requirement not only \nto Medicare in this bill--but the Finance Committee also adopted my \namendment to expand this requirement to Medicaid.\n  This is just one of the many anti-fraud provisions included in this \nbudget. I want to reiterate my thanks to Chairman Roth for his \nwillingness to take a tough stance to ensure that Medicare and the \nState Medicaid Programs are run efficiently, without the graft we have \nseen overrun the programs in recent years.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we must do as much as we possibly can to \nensure that our seniors receive preventive care--``health care'' not \n``sick care.''\n  In the long run, we stand to save billions of dollars by providing \nearly, regular, and preventive medical care, as opposed to acute, \nreactive, emergency care. It is both fiscally and physically prudent to \nprevent sickness before the fact and not after.\n  We can start by covering colon cancer screenings under Medicare. We \ncan save millions of dollars--and millions of lives--by detecting and \ntreating this cancer in its early stages. Colon cancer is the second \nmost frequent cancer killer in America, causing 55,000 deaths each \nyear. But while it is estimated that screening and early detection and \nintervention could eliminate up to 90 percent of these deaths, Medicare \ndoes not currently pay for these preventive measures.\n  Colon cancer screenings cost only $125-$300 apiece, and patients \ndiagnosed through early detection have a 90 percent chance of survival. \nBut if a patient isn't diagnosed until symptoms develop, the chance of \nsurvival drops to a mere 8 percent. Care for treatment in such cases \ncan cost up to $100,000. The cost of not covering colon cancer \nscreenings--in lives and in dollars--is unacceptable.\n  It is also imperative that we eliminate co-payments for mammography. \nAccording to a 1995 study in the New England Journal of Medicine, women \nin the Medicare Program who have to pay some of the cost of mammography \nare far less likely to actually undergo the procedure. Only 14 percent \nof those women who had to make some kind of cash payment actually had a \nmammogram. In contrast, among women who had some kind of insurance to \nsupplement their Medicare benefits, 43 percent had mammograms. Lack of \nsupplemental coverage should not be a barrier to necessary and \nultimately cost-saving medical treatment. Mammography should not be a \nluxury. It is a necessity.\n  Mr. President, another necessary preventive measure is Bone Mass \nMeasurement, the procedure which detects Osteoporosis.\n  Osteoporosis is a debilitating bone disease which afflicts 28 million \nAmericans and causes 50,000 deaths each year. Eighty percent of its \nvictims are women.\n  Osteoporosis fracture patients cost Medicare $13.8 billion a year. \nThis cost is projected to reach $60 billion by the year 2020 and $240 \nbillion by the year 2040 if medical research has not discovered an \neffective treatment. We can curb these skyrocketing costs by providing \nMedicare coverage of bone mass measurement.\n  Because we now have access to drugs which can slow the rate of bone \nloss, early detection is our best weapon in the fight against \nOsteoporosis. It is only through early detection that we can thwart the \nprogress of the disease and initiate preventive efforts to stop further \nloss of bone mass.\n  In order to ensure that we detect bone loss early, we need to ensure \nthat older women have coverage for bone mass tests. Unfortunately, \ncoverage of bone mass measurement is inconsistent from state to state. \nQualifications for testing, and the frequency of testing, differ from \ncarrier to carrier and region to region. The current system is \nconfusing and inequitable. Medicare Bone Mass Measurement Coverage \nshould be covered uniformly in all states.\n  Diabetes, with its tremendous financial and human toll, also deserves \ngreater protection under Medicare. By providing for Medicare coverage \nof blood glucose monitoring strips and outpatient self-management \ntraining services, we can expect to see significant reductions in \ncomplications and expensive treatments.\n  Coverage of test strips and self-management training services will \nallow people with diabetes to care for their own individual needs. In \nso doing, they can better prevent complications such as blindness, \nkidney failure and heart disease.\n  Mr. President, this budget agreement is smart. It cracks down on \nfraud and abuse. It makes medical goods and services cheaper. And it \npromotes preventive health, saving millions of lives and billions of \ndollars.\n  These are necessary and long overdue measures, and I thank my \ncolleagues who have supported them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6120-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6163-S6182]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MEDICARE SUBVENTION\n\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in support\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\nof Medicare subvention. I want to thank Chairman Roth and the Finance \nCommittee for including this important demonstration project in the \nbill now before the Senate. After 4 years, I believe that it is high \ntime the Congress enact Medicare subvention. This project is part of \nthe solution toward providing military retirees the quality health care \nthey deserve. For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to \nsupport Medicare subvention.\n  Mr. President, the Medicare portion of the reconciliation bill now \nbefore us on the floor includes two demonstration projects for Medicare \nsubvention. The first will reimburse the Department of Veterans Affairs \nwith funding from the Medicare Program for health care services \nprovided to targeted Medicare-eligible veterans. The second \ndemonstration project, Mr. President, will offer military retirees over \nthe age of 65 the option to use familiar medical treatment facilities, \nwith Medicare reimbursing the Department of Defense.\n  Mr. President, in my opinion, these two solutions will address the \nfrustrations many of our veterans endure after serving their country so \nhonorably. Subvention gives America's veterans an option to choose the \nbest possible medical care available. I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Medicare subvention demonstration project with the hopes that this \nyear we will pass this cost-saving, commonsense solution to some of the \nhealth care needs of our Nation's veterans.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, the legislation pending before the \nSenate is designed to provide sufficient savings to implement the \nbalanced budget blueprint we passed last month. While the balanced \nbudget plan set the broad framework for balancing the budget by 2002, \nit was up to the various committees to implement this plan. This bill \ncombines recommendations from eight Senate panels, including changes in \nMedicare, Medicaid, and spectrum auctions. I commend the committees for \ntheir work thus far because many of the provisions in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 are long overdue steps in the right direction. It is \nclear that unless we get our deficit under control, we will be leaving \nour children--and our children's children--a legacy of debt that will \nmake it impossible for them to achieve the American Dream.\n  The best news about this plan is that it will help balance the \nFederal budget. More work however, needs to be done to meet our \nobligations to future generations of Americans, to invest in people, \nand to protect their retirement security. Every generation of Americans \nhas addressed and resolved challenges unique to their time. That is \nwhat makes our country great. Now is the time to take steps toward \nensuring that our generation will honestly address its needs so that \nfuture generations will have at least the same opportunity. Our \ngeneration should leave no less than we inherited.\n  This is not a perfect bill before us today. My colleagues and I on \nthe Finance Committee held several marathon sessions last week in order \nto craft a large part of this legislation. I think we reached agreement \non a package of provisions about which everyone has some objections but \nalso, all the members of the Finance Committee were able to support in \nthe end. This unanimous support for the bill is a complete change from \nthe Balanced Budget Act of 1995 and a testament to the leadership of \nSenators Roth and Moynihan. I want to congratulate my colleagues for \nworking together in a bipartisan fashion aimed at not only improving \nthe Medicare and Medicaid programs but also the Nation as a whole.\n  I am however, particularly concerned about several provisions \nincluded in the bill. The first is the impact of increasing the \nMedicare eligibility age to 67. This provision will have a negative \neffect on millions of Americans. Many businesses and employees plan \ntheir retirement and health coverage around eligibility for Medicare. \nIncreasing the age to qualify will exacerbate the existing problem of \nbeing uninsured among people age 55 to 65. Given our goal during this \nCongress of increasing health coverage for vulnerable populations--\nthrough the kids health care and allowing the disabled to buy into \nMedicaid--this provision moves in the wrong direction.\n  Similarly, the proposed fourfold increase in the Medicare deductible \nfor some beneficiaries is particularly problematic. I voted against \nthis provision in the Finance Committee because I do not think the \nissue was sufficiently considered nor were we given the kind of impact \nanalysis that is essential before making a decision of such magnitude. \nSuch a significant increase in the deductible is essentially a tax on \nthe sickest seniors. Those people who have to use the doctor more are \nthe only ones who will incur the increased costs. Any \ndeterred utilization of services will likely be the result of a senior \ndeciding between needed health services or other expenses that must \ncome from their fixed income.\n\n  Furthermore, we have to be careful before preceding down this road. \nMeans testing stands to erode support for the Medicare Program. We all \nhave witnessed the backlash against so called welfare programs over the \npast 2 years. We must not allow Medicare to become regarded as transfer \nprogram solely for the poor. Americans pay into Medicare and expect to \nhave the insurance when they retire. We already make wealthier \nAmericans pay more in Medicare payroll taxes. It does not seem \nappropriate to be so hasty in increasing their cost-sharing obligations \nfor the program as well.\n  I also think that the Finance Committee went too far in its zeal to \nincrease managed care enrollment in rural areas. This by no means \nsuggest that I do not support enhanced managed care in rural areas--the \nmajority of my State is rural. However, essentially freezing payment \nrates in high cost area, which coincidentally also have the \noverwhelming majority of existing managed care enrollment, in order to \nincrease payment rates in rural areas may have the reverse effect. The \ncommittee bill contains so many incentives for rural areas that we may \nerode existing managed care enrollment and extra benefits that many \nhealth plans offer like prescription drugs and eye glasses. I hope that \na more appropriate balance between encouraging managed care in \nunderserved areas and maintaining existing enrollment can be achieve in \nthe conference with the House.\n  On the other hand, there are a number of good aspects of this \nlegislation. Increased choice for Medicare beneficiaries through the \ndevelopment of Provider Sponsored Organizations and the removal of teen \nparents from the limit on vocational education under the welfare \nprogram are just two example of very meaningful policy changes included \nin this bill. Removing teen parents from the vocational education limit \nwill facilitate states' promotion of education for 240,000 additional \nindividuals as a means of moving permanently from welfare to work.\n  The legislation would also cover diabetes self management training, \ncolorectal cancer screenings, and mammography screens without copayment \nobligations. This investment in mammograms without a copayment \nobligations will benefit over 2 million women. Mr. President, S. 947 \nprotects the vitally important Early Periodic Screening Diagnostic and \nTreatment [EPSDT] benefits for children under Medicaid. Despite \nrequests from Governors to diminish the benefit package for children, \nthis bill does not allow it to occur. Similarly, the legislation \nprotects disproportionate share funding for those hospitals that treat \nlarge volumes of indigent patients and are overly burdened by \nuncompensated care.\n  I am certain that members on both sides of the aisle believe that \nthis bill can be improved and there are a number of proposed amendments \nto do so; a number of which I plan to support. I hope that this body \ncan get through this process in the same bipartisan fashion displayed \nin the Finance Committee. Chairman Roth said it best both in the \nCommittee and on the Senate floor, that no one got everything but \neveryone got something that they wanted in this bill. That I believe, \nis the true mark of legislation through consensus.\n  As I said at the outset, this bill takes several steps in the right \ndirection--the direction of a balanced budget. However, Congress must \nnot only look at the 5 and 10 year effect of the policies we enact or \nrest on the laurels this package. We need to look to the future and \ncontinue to reform programs in a fashion that maintain a balanced \nbudget. The worse thing that we could do is\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nnot act again for another 60 years. Long-range economic forecasts are \nnotoriously unreliable, but our long-range demographic changes are a \nreality that cannot be ignored. The retiring baby-boom generation will \nplace considerable strain on our public systems. This budget bill only \nextends Medicare solvency through 2007--not even to the point at which \nthe baby-boomers begin to retire. The longer we wait to enact more \nsubstantive program changes, the greater the threat to the viability of \nthe Medicare Program.\n  Our actions now will impact future generations--our grandchildren and \ngreat grandchildren. We have to remind ourselves to look beyond the \nnext 5 to 10 years. I am not suggesting that we not celebrate being on \nthe brink of a victory--balancing the budget for the first time in 60 \nyears. I am simply stressing that Congress cannot retreat from its \ncommitment to ensuring that future generations will have at least the \nsame opportunity as we and our parents. Our generation should not leave \nno less than we inherited.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I think what both sides are waiting for \nnow is to prepare all of the amendments that we are going to offer en \nbloc in an appropriate unanimous consent request--both Senator \nLautenberg and myself. So the time is going to be much to our advantage \nbecause we will not be here very long after we get started on that.\n  Mr. President, when we first started negotiating with the President \nof the United States, the Republican and Democratic leadership, the \nBudget Committee chairman and some others asked how are we going to get \nthrough these contentious issues? Some Republicans on our side said how \nwill we be sure what we get done will be signed by the President? That \nhad to do with the reconciliation bill that we are going to finish \ntomorrow about noon, it had to do with the tax bill, it had to do with \nthe 13 appropriations bills.\n  My stock answer was it seems to me what we have learned over the past \n4 years is that the best way to get that done is to have the proposals \ndone in a bipartisan manner. That is, send to the President proposals \nthat are both Republican and Democratic in terms of the party \naffiliation of those who support it.\n  From what I gather, at least in the U.S. Senate, the epitomy of that \nis Senator Roth and his chairmanship, with his ranking member, Senator \nMoynihan. For even today, on almost all of the amendments that the \nFinance Committee either offered or were challenged on, almost every \nmember of the Democratic Party voted for--not all, but almost all--and \nyou saw the results. Some of the issues that we were never able to do \nbefore in a reconciliation bill following a budget resolution were done \ntoday and they were done with overwhelming votes.\n  The general understanding in this place that contentious, difficult \nmatters would never clear the point of order under the waiver because \nit requires 60 votes was dispelled today because of the bipartisan \nnature of the results desired. I believe that will hold true. I am \nhopeful when we go to conference that the same thing will happen, that \nthe distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, who has most of \nthese matters even if he splits it up into subcommittees, that it will \ncome out of there bipartisan and we will continue to work with the \nPresident.\n  We want to tell the White House that we know the bill which will be \ncleared tomorrow is deficient in at least two places and we will have \nto fix those in conference because we cannot fix them here today. We \nwill tomorrow in an amendment to be offered by Senator McCain, Senator \nLott, and myself, attempt to bring the revenues to be received from \nspectrum closer to the mandate in the reconciliation bill. We are \nhopeful everyone will support us on that. It will be short by a bit.\n  Unless other things mesh out when we go to conference, we will be \nshort the balanced budget by a couple of billion dollars in the last \nyear. We will work very hard on that in conference to try to fix it.\n  I look forward to the same thing happening. In fact, some said, how \nare we going to be sure we do not get Government closure on the \nappropriations bills when the President vetoes the bills and we close \ndown Government, and my response to most, there is no magic to it. We \nwill not be able to do it by some kind of statute. We tried that. \nObviously, it didn't work. I said the best way to do it is to have \nbipartisan appropriations bills that have been worked on in an effort \nto meet the agreement which the President joined us on and where there \nwas no joinder because it was not required, that the contents be at \nleast bipartisanly supported.\n  Now, our chairman is trying to do that in appropriations. If that \ncontinues, I think two things result: We get it done; and second, the \nAmerican people praise us for it because I believe that is exactly what \nthey want us to do.\n  Frankly, that does not mean we have to give away our philosophy or \nour ideas. In many instances it will take a long time to get where we \nwant to go. I assume the Democrats are saying the same thing on their \nside, wondering when they will take over again and be able to move it \nin their direction. None of it will occur in 1 year. It will take \nlonger. We will get only part of what we want.\n  The tax cuts are not sufficient when you take into consideration the \nhuge burden imposed on our people, but we also, some of us, recognize \nwe are also spending a lot of money and as we diminish that spending \nand decrease it, maybe we can have even more tax cuts in years to come. \nI hope so.\n  So that is the way I understand what is going on. I feel good about \nit and, in particular, the support that was so bipartisan on many \ncritical issues here today. If that can continue, I am almost positive \nwe will end up in early October giving the American people one of the \nbest legislative sessions with one of the most significant \naccomplishments in modern legislative history.\n  Staff is copying the lists so we can do the amendments en bloc, but \none amendment that did not get into that is one by Senator Abraham.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 456\n\n   (Purpose: To extend the moratorium regarding HealthSource Saginaw)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send the Abraham amendment to the desk \nand ask that it be read so it will qualify for tomorrow's stacking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mr. Abraham \n     for himself and Mr. Levin, proposes an amendment numbered \n     456.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     SEC.  . EXTENSION OF MORATORIUM.\n\n       Section 6408(a)(3) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act \n     of 1989, as amended by section 13642 of the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1993 is amended by striking ``December \n     31, 1995'' and inserting ``December 31, 2002.''.\n\n\n                           Uninsured Children\n\n  Mr. COATS. Mr. President, because we are waiting, already after a \nlong day, but because we are waiting for some material to come back, if \nI could ask the chairman of the Budget Committee a question that I \nraised at lunch. I know that the Budget Committee deliberated at great \nlength on the issue of providing insurance for uninsured children and \nthat after that deliberation, on a bipartisan basis, it was determined \nthat a $16 billion chunk of money for the 5-year budget plan be set \naside to address that problem. Many of us applauded the work of the \nchairman and others in not only that but in putting the entire budget \ntogether.\n  Having said that, I am aware that we will be addressing the second \nphase of reconciliation and a decision on the part of the Finance \nCommittee to add an additional $8 billion for that program in a block \ngrant to the States. I am also aware of the fact there may be an \namendment offered that may add to that an additional $8 billion, \nraising the total to double or more of what the Budget Committee \ndecided.\n  I am wondering if either the chairman of the Budget Committee or the \nchairman of the Finance Committee can explain to me what changed? What \nwas necessary? Why was it necessary? What new facts came to light that \nrequired the additional $8 billion, at least?\n  I know we will be debating this issue, and I do not mean to take up \ntime this\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\nevening to debate it. We will debate it under the tax bill. But in the \ninterim, I wonder if we can discuss that a little bit so this Senator \ncan better understand what it is we are attempting to do.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me try for a couple of minutes, and \nif Senator Lautenberg would like to chime in, and obviously the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee is here.\n  I think it is fair to say, for starters, that the issue of uninsured \nchildren--that is, children without any health insurance--has been a \nlongstanding issue. But in all honesty, it has only become an issue \nthat has been looked at diligently in an effort to see how you might \nchange the way we were doing things this year.\n  As a matter of fact, it is very interesting, if uninsured children as \na class were a big insurable group, it is interesting to note that you \ncould not buy health insurance for children. In other words, if some \nState had decided, ``Let's go ask Aetna or somebody else, do you have \nan insurance policy we can buy just to insure kids?'' it is within the \nlast 6 months, I understand, that for an exclusive child health care \ninsurance policy--it is a very short-lived instrument that exists. For \nstarters, nobody knew exactly what it would cost.\n  There were two other things that came into the discussion, and that \nwas there are at least two ways, maybe three, of getting insurance. One \nwas to expand the Medicaid system, which will cover some of these \nuninsureds in any event, but to expand it further so that it would \nencompass more. That amount was estimated by those who do that kind of \nwork. But there were not really any real estimates on if you did it the \nsecond way, which was to let the States either provide it or buy \ninsurance for them--those numbers were not readily available.\n  So some will say that the $16 billion was too much. In fact, one of \nour Senators who has studied it diligently believes you could cover all \nthe uninsureds for less than $16 billion. Others say when you are \nfinished with the $16 billion, there will still be some that are not \ncovered. I do not believe a magic formula was arrived at in the Finance \nCommittee. I believe there are those who said not enough prevailed. \nThey found a source of money in a compromise cigarette tax--$8 billion \nout of the total of $20 billion in revenues from that was used for that \none function.\n\n  Now, frankly, I'm hopeful for myself, I'm very pleased we did not go \nthe Medicaid route. Neither the House bill nor the Senate bill made it \nsingularly a mandate that you cover the children under expanded \nMedicaid. In both bills--in the Senate bill they are allowed the option \nof taking a block grant to be administered by the States, and that is \none of the amendments that was around here tonight--what kind of \ncoverage would that be?\n  I am hopeful when we are finished and get this implemented that we \nwill see to it that we are able to measure what we are doing with that \nmoney and how well we have covered people. It may very well be--\nalthough for Government money, I doubt it, because whenever you put it \nout there I assume it will get spent--but I am hopeful if it is more \nthan necessary, we will not spend it, although I assume that might not \nhappen. That is the best I have.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the chairman. Of course, he put his finger on my \nconcern, and that is that before we have identified the scope of the \nproblem and the resources necessary to address the scope of the \nproblem, we have set aside a chunk of money, a very significant chunk \nof money, $24 billion. I just wonder where that figure came from and \nwhat it is based upon, because as the Senator from New Mexico has just \nsaid and we all know, once the money is made available, those who are \nbeneficiaries of the money, whether it is the States or whether we put \nit in Medicaid or wherever we put it, they will find a way to spend it.\n  I do not think anybody is arguing that we do not want to address the \nissue of uninsured children, but I think what we were arguing is we \nwant to do it in a responsible way, a way that is responsible to the \ntaxpayers so that we do not just arbitrarily come up with a number \nwithout knowing the scope of the problem and what dollar amount needs \nto be applied to that.\n  So my question really goes to the rationale that was used in arriving \nat the $16 billion initially by the Budget Committee. I assume they had \nsignificant debate and research into that in arriving at that figure, \nbut what has changed from that point forward on the Finance Committee? \nWhat new information did they learn that was not available to the \nBudget Committee that caused the Finance Committee to raise that figure \nby $8 billion? Was it simply the availability of additional tax money \nthrough an identified tax and a decision to divide it up and throw $8 \nbillion here and $4 billion there and whatever, or was there a specific \nrationale or new piece of information that came forward that said, \n``No, we were short when we made our Budget Committee estimate. We now \nneed to put in an additional $8 billion to cover the problem that we \nhave identified''?\n  That goes to the nature of my question. That clearly is something \nthat we need to debate in the tax bill. I do not want to hold up the \nproceedings here this evening.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COATS. I am happy to yield to the Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I don't pretend to speak for the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, but I think it would be helpful to \nthe Senator's concern by expressing this.\n  There are 10 million uninsured children in this country, and that was \ndeemed to be unacceptable. The first approach was to try and insure 5 \nmillion children. That is what the $16 billion was for, to try to get \nthe first 5 million uninsured children covered. This came from the \nSenator's side of the aisle in the Finance Committee. We thought that \nmaybe we could go beyond that and approach beyond 5 million. But to be \nquite honest, I think as we have gone our way through this process, we \nhave come to understand that we can't judge exactly what the States are \ngoing to do and we can't be entirely sure. So the CBO is now beginning \nto give us figures that suggest we won't be able to reach the 5 million \nchildren mark, perhaps even with both the $16 billion and the $8 \nbillion program. But then again, we are not sure. But we know we have \nto try because having uninsured children is not acceptable in America. \nIt is not a question of throwing money at a problem or suddenly a \ndiscovery of a new source of money. There was simply the desire that we \nought to get health insurance to the 10 million children who do not \nhave it. We worked within the Finance Committee to try to accomplish \nthat.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. As the Senator from West Virginia \nknows, we had debate on that during the proposal offered by Senator \nKennedy earlier, which was defeated. But there was significant \ndisagreement on the floor. I don't know the answer, as to the number of \nuninsured children, cost policies to insure those children, or the best \nmechanism to use. Even the charts that the Senator from Utah had \ndesignating the number of uninsured children and the charts that the \nsponsor of the bill, Senator Kennedy from Massachusetts, had at the \nsame time they offered the bill; the two charts were off by several \nmillion, in terms of the number of uninsured children. So even the \nsponsors of the bill hadn't coordinated the numbers or checked with \neach other relative to how many uninsured children existed. We learned \nthat three-point-some million of the children were covered under the \nexisting Medicaid Program and several million of these children were \ntemporarily uninsured, not full-time uninsured, because their parents \nwere in and out of employment. And, normally, in employment you get a \nfamily policy that covers dependents.\n  So I was confused as to what the total number was, how many were \ninsured, and what mechanisms we ought to put in place and, more \nimportant, how we ought to derive a number. Obviously, we all want to \nbe responsible with the taxpayers' dollars and, at the same time, \nprovide the important coverage. I wasn't able to get an answer where \nthere is some unanimity regarding the number of children, who is \ncovered, who needs to be covered, how long they need to be covered, \nwhat the cost of the policy is to cover them. And it seemed to me that \nwe were pursuing a problem by addressing a solution designed in terms \nof the amount of\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\nmoney available, not necessarily in terms of the specifics of the \nproblem.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the Senator will further yield, I simply say that \nI really don't think this was a money chase where, in trying to find a \nsolution, they had to go find the problem. The problem was there. One \nof the most outstanding problems, which is vexatious, is there are 3 \nmillion children out there right now who are eligible for Medicaid, but \ntheir families do not know; they do not know that they are in fact \neligible for Medicaid. So part of the problem was, how do you find, \nthrough various public and State agencies, those 3 million children \nacross the country who are already eligible?\n  Mr. COATS. I ask the Senator, if we could not find them before under \nexisting State-run programs, how are we going to find them now under \nState block grant programs?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I say to the Senator up front, the Senator is asking \nfor kind of an exactitude in an area where exactitude is really very \ndifficult, which is the whole area of the uninsured--how much it would \ncost? Where are they? How long will they be on Medicaid or insurance? \nWhen will they go off? Does the State know about it? Will the State, \nunder a block grant money program, take children already on Medicaid \nand substitute that money, thus freeing the other money? I can't worry \nabout that.\n  I have faith in the chairman of the Finance Committee. I think this \nwas a bipartisan decision to do something about a problem that has been \nwith us throughout our history, which is no longer deemed acceptable. \nThe Senator is entirely correct when he says there are no simple \nanswers. I want to assure the Senator--because I sat through, \nobviously, all the Finance Committee meetings, both public and \nprivate--there was never an attempt to sort of grab at money for the \npurpose of saying let's put that toward health insurance for children. \nIt was a sense that we have a real problem here and we want to try \nto address it as responsibly and carefully as possible. That was \nfollowed by a bipartisan discussion and agreement.\n\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. I don't want to hold up the \nproceedings here this evening. I am happy to yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. ROTH. I will make one comment regarding the figures as to what it \ncosts to cover children. What we did in committee is agree that there \nshould be outreach, that we do want to ensure that all children that \nare not currently insured have the opportunity of having such \ninsurance. But there is a lack of precision in the information, and \nthat essentially creates the problem. I think all you have to do is \nlisten to the discussion that we are having here this evening and it \nshows you that you don't have hard figures on this. But it was agreed \nupon, in a bipartisan way, that we wanted to develop a program that \nwould assure all children health care with the enactment of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. COATS. I wonder if I can ask the chairman one last question?\n  Mr. ROTH. Yes.\n  Mr. COATS. If it is an undefined figure, or at least a loosely \ndefined figure--going back to a question the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee raised--is there a provision, or will there be a provision in \nthe law that would give us the ability to monitor or audit the State \nresponse and return of excess funds if States meet their uninsured \nchildren's needs, but have money left over from the block grant; is \nthere a basis upon which we can return that money and use it for, \nobviously, other important needs?\n  Mr. ROTH. Well, I think there is an accountability in the program. \nThere was considerable discussion about wanting to make certain that \nthese funds were spent by the States for the purpose of children's \nhealth insurance. So, yes, we did ensure that that had to be used for \nthat purpose.\n  Mr. COATS. I thank the Senator. I will be happy to get those \nmaterials from the staff and continue to work with him on this \nquestion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coats very much for the \ncolloquy this evening. I think it was very helpful. I am sorry, from my \nstandpoint, that I can't be more technical on the amendment. I believe \nthere is a lot of objectivity that is lacking, and I am sure that is \ngoing to evolve with time. Your question seems to be very relevant and \ngermane to a serious problem.\n  Mr. President, I believe on our side, and soon to be followed on the \nDemocratic side, we are prepared to ask unanimous consent that a series \nof amendments be in order for tomorrow's stacked event that we have \nspoken of.\n  I have an amendment that has been agreed to on both sides. This \namendment is made on behalf of Senator Harkin and Senator McCain.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 457\n\n        (Purpose: To reduce health care fraud, waste, and abuse)\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI.

Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment which would \nallow States to continue offering innovative cost effective health care \nthrough an 1115 Medicaid waiver on a permanent basis or on a continuous \nbasis for 3 years. In addition, this measure would ensure that State's \nare given credit for the cost savings which they have incurred by \noperating an efficient managed care Medicaid program.\n  Several States have led the way in innovation for expanding coverage \nthrough cost containment. These States have not used accounting \ngamesmanship to ask the Federal Government to do the job; they have \nused their own resources to revise their programs to expand coverage \nwhile reducing both State and Federal costs.\n  Among these States is Arizona, Oregon, Rhode Island, Florida, and \nTennessee. Any other State operating under an 1115 waiver may find \nherself in the same position.\n  In Arizona, 72 percent of her voters decided last fall that they \nshould cover everyone under the poverty line, whether man, woman, or \nchild. This initiative is the only hope for health care coverage for \n50,000 men who live under the poverty line. Arizona can afford to do \nthis because of the success of the Arizona statewide managed care \nprogram. AHCCCS [access] in containing cost and providing access to \ncare. This has been proven. The satisfaction of Arizona's health care \nproviders, members, and taxpayers further underscore the success of the \nprogram.\n  In spite of substantial savings documented by HCFA hired evaluators, \ndocumented savings since the program began in 1982, more than enough to \noffset the cost of expanding coverage, the Federal Government won't \nallow Arizona to reinvest the savings it achieved over a traditional \nfee-for-service program in expanded coverage. Nor will HCFA allow the \nState credit for their\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nprogram's savings over the next 5 years.\n  Other States have been allowed to use the savings managed care \nachieves over a traditional fee-for-service program in expanded \ncoverage including the States of Tennessee, Hawaii, Rhode Island, \nOregon among others.\n  The rationale for treating Arizona different from these other States \nboils down to timing. When Arizona's program began in 1982, HCFA did \nnot use a test of budget neutrality for approving section 1115 research \nand demonstration waivers. The budget neutrality requirement that is \nnow applied was put in place several years later. If Arizona had a test \nof budget neutrality in 1982 where the baseline was a traditional fee-\nfor-service program, then the State would be allowed to use its managed \ncare savings. Because the requirement did not exist, the State is \npenalized.\n  HCFA now indicates that the test of budget neutrality is the current, \ncost-saving, successful AHCCCS program, not the traditional fee-for-\nservice program.\n  Arizona should not be penalized for a change in Federal guidelines \nwhich occurred after the program began. No one is questioning whether \nAHCCCS saved the Federal Government millions. Arizona, as Tennessee, \nHawaii, Rhode Island, and any other State with such a proven track \nrecord, should be allowed to use the managed care savings it achieved \nover a traditional fee-for-service program to expand coverage as \nArizona voters overwhelmingly requested.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 461\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the treatment of certain Amerasian immigrants \n                              as refugees)\n\n       On page 874, between lines 7 and 8, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5817A.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to S. \n947, the Budget Reconciliation Act, that will redress what I assume to \nbe an inadvertent omission in a section of this bill that discriminates \nagainst Amerasian children of U.S. military personnel who served in \nVietnam.\n  My amendment will add a new provision to section 5817 to include \nAmerasian children to the category of legal aliens eligible for \nMedicaid. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity \nReconciliation Act of 1996 excluded from eligibility these children of \nAmerican soldiers because they are admitted as refugees under section \n584 of the Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \nAct of 1988, rather than section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct, under which refugees are excepted from the Welfare Region \nlegislation's ban on Medicaid, SSI, and other forms of assistance. This \namendment corrects that oversight.\n  Because there is a cost associated with this amendment, I propose to \noffset it by mandating that the Attorney General of the United States, \nacting through the Immigration and Naturalization Service, impose a \n$150 processing fee on each illegal alien deported from the United \nStates who committed a felony while in this country. According to CBO, \nthis will generate the revenue necessary to offset the cost of my \namendment over the 5-year period for which the welfare bill excludes \naliens from Medicaid eligibility.\n  I hope that I can count on my colleagues' support for this worthwhile \namendment.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 462\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nprovide medicare beneficiaries with notice of the medicare cost-sharing \n   assistance available under the medicaid program for specified low-\n                     income medicare beneficiaries)\n\n       On page 685, after line 25, add the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I would like to take this time to discuss \nan amendment that would give families with uninsured children the \nopportunity to obtain proper health coverage. Congress is constantly \nsearching for ways to provide children with adequate health care, and I \nhave proposed an amendment that would allow children the means to be \ncovered. My amendment would give the working poor health expense \naccounts to use for their families.\n  It is reported that there are 10 million children who are uninsured \nin the United States. Many of these children are uninsured because \ntheir parents have incomes that are high enough to be ineligible for \nMedicaid or do not have private or employer-sponsored health insurance.\n  My amendment would allow families to deposit money in a medical \nsavings account to use for health care services. I believe it is \ncritical to provide lower income families with the option to establish \nmedical savings accounts. MSA's allow consumers to pay for medical \nexpenses through affordable tax-deductible plans that are most suited \nto their needs.\n  Americans want choice in health care. It is time for the Federal \nGovernment to listen to the American people\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nand make medical savings accounts an available option. Medical savings \naccounts are a viable free-market approach to ensuring greater access \nto affordable health care coverage for the uninsured. Through MSA's, \nindividuals would be given the choice and opportunity to obtain \naffordable health services.\n  I believe our efforts need to be focused on providing uninsured \nchildren with accessible health care services. My amendment would give \nthese families the opportunity of setting aside MSA funds, especially \nbenefiting those who are self-employed, between jobs, or employed where \nhealth coverage is not available.\n  I am hopeful that in the 105th Congress, we will be able to expand \nthe availability of medical savings accounts. Medical savings plans \nallow individuals the freedom to shop for competitive health care \nservices, which in turn, can help keep the costs of health care down.\n  My amendment is one step to achieving the goal of decreasing the \nnumber of uninsured children by providing families with the option to \nreceive much needed health care coverage. By making more MSA's \navailable, we can make it easier for parents to finance their \nchildren's health care; after all, the health of our Nation's children \nis at stake.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 466\n\n(Purpose: To extend the authority of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n                     to collect fees through 2002)\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n          TITLE IX--COMMITTEE ON ENVIRONMENT AND PUBLIC WORKS\n\n     SEC. 9001.

Mr. President, I rise today to support the Wellstone/\nMikulski amendment which maintains the Boren amendment on nursing home \nreimbursement.\n  The Boren amendment ensures an adequate daily reimbursement rate for \nnursing homes under Medicaid. It helps nursing homes have the funds \nthey need to meet Federal quality and safety standards. The Wellstone/\nMikulski amendment will keep this guarantee in place.\n  Right now, the Boren policy is under attack. It is under attack by \nStates. And it is under attack by Congress. If we repeal this law, \nStates will be able to set their own rates of reimbursement to nursing \nhomes.\n  We all know the tough budget climate we are operating in. Without the \nBoren policy, we take away the Federal guarantee of adequate \nreimbursement rates. This threatens the health and safety of senior \ncitizens. States worry about reimbursements. I'm worried about seniors.\n  Without Boren, the State reimbursement rates may be too low to ensure \nthat nursing homes can continue to provide quality care. Do we really \nwant to return to the bad old days when senior citizens living in \nnursing homes faced inadequate care? Can we afford to forget the horror \nstories from the 1980's about living and quality conditions in some \nnursing homes?\n  Well, the Boren amendment helped to change that. We must protect the \nintegrity of the law. The amendment Senator Wellstone and I are \noffering will do that.\n  Our amendment protects senior citizens living in nursing homes. And \nit ensures that nursing homes get an appropriate level of \nreimbursement. It does this by requiring States to reimburse nursing \nhomes for the costs of daily care.\n  It ensures that States will have adequate reimbursement to provide \nquality services. It maintains Federal Government oversight. It \nmaintains quality standards and it will protect seniors.\n  We have been through the fight to keep Federal nursing home \nstandards. And Congress voted last year on a bipartisan basis to keep \nFederal standards and to maintain Federal enforcement.\n  In my State of Maryland, already the reimbursement rate is very low. \nMaryland gets $78 per day when it costs an average of $112 to provide \nnursing home care. Maryland nursing homes use this reimbursement to \nprovide room and board, around the clock medical care, three meals a \nday, and bathing, and feeding. You can't even get a good hotel room for \nthat rate. We cannot have the rates fall any lower without jeopardizing \npatients.\n  Mr. President, we must protect the Boren amendment. That is why I \nstrongly support the Wellstone/Mikulski amendment.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n  I would assume that the Senator would be willing to yield for \nadditional amendments that may be filed.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I rise to make a point of order that section 5822 of this \nbill is extraneous and violates section 313(b)(1)(D) of the Budget Act, \nthe so-called Byrd rule.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing what \namounts to a $2 billion blank check for one State, the State of Texas.\n  The bill before us would require the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to approve the privatization of all Federal and State health \nand human services benefit programs in the State of Texas without any \nhearings and without any opportunity to review the proposal or ensure \nthat the goals of these programs are furthered by the proposal.\n  Mr. President, this is truly unprecedented. If we look at the \npotential impact from this one State waiver, we see that it affects \n2.35 million Medicaid beneficiaries, 2.1 million food stamp recipients, \n10 percent of all the food stamp recipients in the United States, \nnearly 1 million WIC recipients, and 20,000 children who are up for \nadoption or qualify for foster care assistance.\n  The Texas waiver amounts to a $2 billion blank check without the \nbenefit of one hearing and without the benefit of any Senator knowing \nwhat is in the proposal, because this is a proposal that has not been \nrevealed to the U.S. Senate. There has been no waiver submitted.\n  We hear a lot of talk that it is a waiver. There has been no waiver \nsubmitted. This is a procurement document which, by law, is \nconfidential and cannot be reviewed by the U.S. Senate. There have been \nno public hearings on this proposal--not one. Not a single Member here \nhas had privy to what this procurement document involves. There are \nserious unanswered questions about whether taxpayers are protected from \nliability, mismanagement or fraud.\n  Mr. President, let me go to the next chart. The contracting of human \nservices has a very checkered record. I have produced reviews of just \nfour situations which have occurred around the country, because I think \nbefore we leap off this precipice, we ought to know what is in this \nagreement. What is in this proposal? None of us have been privy to what \nis here.\n  Let me just review with my colleagues what we have seen in other \nagreements like this around the country. In California, an agreement \nwith Lockheed Martin for a child support enforcement contract, harshly \ncriticized in the California Assembly, slated to cost $99 million, now \nprojected to cost $260 million, cost overrun of 163 percent. The State \nof California stopped payment in February of 1997; limited contractor \nliability of only $44 million. Taxpayers have to pick up the rest--a \ndisaster in California.\n  Do we want this to be repeated in Texas? Some will say, well, it \nwon't happen in Texas. On what basis do they say that? Not a single \nSenator knows what is in that procurement document --not a single one--\nbecause it is confidential.\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\n  Virginia: Electronic Data Systems, a Medicaid contract. By the way, \nthis is the same company that seeks to privatize all--let me emphasis--\nevery single Federal and State program in the State of Texas. The same \ncompany is involved in this Virginia matter.\n  This is a Medicaid contract in Virginia. The contract has been \ncanceled; 20 months behind schedule; error rate of more than 50 \npercent--error rate of more than 50 percent--alleged sweetheart deal; \nEDS selected over competitor whose bid was 50 percent less; alleged \nconflict of interest; company won contract after making revolving-door \nhire of a senior Virginia Medicaid official.\n  Texas: Anderson Consulting, a child support system contract; 559 \npercent over the budget; over 4 years behind schedule; design errors \nresult in inability to handle changes in Federal regulations; taxpayers \nto foot more than 78 percent of the project cost--another disaster.\n  Mr. President, before we do this, we ought to know what is in this \nprocurement document. We shouldn't be handing a blank check to Texas, \nor any other State. I wouldn't advocate this for my State--a blank \ncheck that could blow up on the taxpayers like these examples have \nblown up.\n  Let me just conclude with the Florida Unisys contract, a Medicaid \ncontract. Unisys employees arrested for grand theft; one pleaded guilty \nto fraud, forgery and money-laundering; two others charged with \nracketeering; more arrests expected; use of temporary employees, one of \nwhom stole almost a quarter of a million dollars.\n  And we are getting ready to approve this kind of deal for the State \nof Texas without any hearing, without any review, without a single \nSenator knowing what is in the proposed agreement?\n  Mr. President, we ought to think very carefully before we go down \nthis path.\n  In Florida, authorities investigating alleged Medicaid theft of $20 \nmillion.\n  Boy, if the warning lights aren't out on this one, I don't know what \nit will take.\n  Mr. President, we ought to review this circumstance, have a chance to \nreview it, have hearings, and make a determination if it makes any \nsense for us to proceed on this basis. I think there are serious and \nlegitimate questions surrounding this proposed procurement document.\n  The Texas waiver has serious unanswered questions. How do we prevent \nthe massive cost overruns and high error rates that plague similar \nprojects in other States?\n  How do we protect against revolving-door hiring, kickbacks, or other \nfraud?\n  Will the taxpayers be liable if a contractor fails to enroll eligible \nindividuals?\n  You know, this is a fundamental responsibility of Government to make \ncertain that those who are eligible get the benefits to which they are \nentitled.\n  Who pays for it if they enroll people who are not eligible?\n  What happens to vulnerable Americans who need these programs for \nbasic survival if the contractor has financial incentives to minimize \nenrollment, even of those who have every legal right to be qualified?\n  Mr. President, I would like to quote an editorial from the Salt Lake \nTribune of April 27th. This is what the Salt Lake Tribune said on April \n27 of this year:\n\n       Certain elements of a welfare program lend themselves well \n     to contracting, vouchers, or other forms of privatization . . \n     .\n\n  I think we all agree with that:\n\n       But when it comes to deciding who will receive public \n     assistance or who should lose custody of a child, the private \n     sector has its limits. If a private group's primary mission \n     is to make profits . . . services may be reduced . . . \n     Government employees, on the other hand, are subject to more \n     public scrutiny and are expected to promote the public good \n     within constitutional protections for individuals.\n\n  Mr. President, let's not fix what isn't broken.\n  Virtually every State is currently operating, developing, or planning \nthe development of an integrated, automated eligibility and enrollment \nsystem for TANF, food stamps, and Medicaid. Thirty-eight States with \nFederally certified systems; three States installing; five States \ndeveloping; two States planning; three States with State-developed \nsystems.\n  Let's not throw the baby out with the bathwater.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this well-taken point of order.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I move to waive the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n\n                     Motion to Waive the Budget Act\n\n  Mr. ROTH. I move to waive the point of order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. State the inquiry.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Parliamentary inquiry. The motion to waive the point of \norder has been raised. Will this be stacked in votes tomorrow? Would \nthat be the intention of the Chair?\n  Mr. ROTH. That would be the intent of the chairman.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That would be the intent of the chairman.\n  Mr. President, would that be the intent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That would be the procedure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from New \nJersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I can't let this moment pass without \ncommending----\n  Mr. ROTH. Could the Senator yield so I can send this amendment to the \ndesk for consideration?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Yes, of course. I would be happy to yield to the \nchairman of the Finance Committee. But I expect to regain the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 502\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I submit an amendment on behalf of Senator \nD'Amato on Medicare, on the duplication provision for consideration \ntomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Roth] for Mr. D'Amato, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 502.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Section 1. In 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395ss(d)(3)(A)(v), insert \n     ``(a)'' before ``For'', and after the first sentence insert:\n       ``(b) For purposes of this subparagraph, a health insurance \n     policy (which may be a contract with a health maintenance \n     organization) is not considered to ``duplicate'' health \n     benefits under this title or title XIX or under another \n     health insurance policy if it--\n       (I) provides comprehensive health care benefits that \n     replace the benefits provided by another health insurance \n     policy,\n       (II) is being provided to an individual entitled to \n     benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B on the basis \n     of section 226(b), and\n       (III) coordinates against items and services available or \n     paid for under this title or title XIX, provided that \n     payments under this title or title XIX shall not be treated \n     as payments under such policy in determining annual or \n     lifetime benefit limits.\n       Section 2. In 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1395ss(d)(3)(A)(v), insert \n     ``(c)'' before ``For purposes of this clause''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to commend our friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota for being aware of what is potentially \ntaking place here.\n  Mr. President, this is a small example of the kind of document that \nyou might have that has all kinds of bad goodies in here. One of the \nthings that you have to do around here is to make certain that \neverybody is on the alert to the fact that some things get into these \nbills without being discussed, without being formally introduced. It \nhas a way of sneaking in there. There is an osmosis process in which \nthey fall down from the sky and get in there. This is one that is \nreally kind of sky-high.\n  I express very serious concerns about the provision in this bill, \nthat it will allow, as the Senator from North Dakota said, in this case \nTexas, but any State--to have private companies determine the \neligibility for low-income benefits like Medicaid, WIC and food stamps.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a budget reconciliation bill, not a Government\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\nmanagement reform bill. In my view, the privatization provision does \nnot belong in fast-track legislation--fast track, that means to get it \nthrough here as quickly as you can--that is designed primarily to \nimplement the budget resolution. This provision has no real impact on \nthe deficit except to potentially make it worse in the years ahead, and \nit would represent a significant policy change with broad-ranging \nimplications.\n  I also note that this provision is outside of the bipartisan budget \nagreement. It was never discussed at any one of the negotiating \nsessions because I personally sat there at every one of them, and it \nnever appeared in any early drafts of the budget agreement.\n  This provision raises some very important policy questions. For \nexample, will these private companies have an incentive, as the Senator \nfrom North Dakota pointed out in his chart, to exclude people that they \nwould rather not carry from low-income programs. Will they receive \nbonuses for doing so? Will they feel inclined to do so in order to win \nother State government contracts?\n  Now, Mr. President, I kind of grew up, if I can say, in the computer \nbusiness, and we have seen some of the finest companies in the world \nmake mistakes. We have seen it here with the FAA contract, a fairly \ncomplicated piece of business, and it was pointed out that it was \nUnisys and EDS and names that are very well known in the computer \nfield. Mistakes are made and sometimes these things run way over the \noriginal cost estimate, as demonstrated in the example we saw, so we \ncannot afford to put all of our citizens subject to what might go awry \nhere and spend $2 billion to take care of an arrangement, whatever that \narrangement is. Ask every citizen here whether they would feel like \nkicking into this thing, and I am sure that given a proper \nquestionnaire they would say, ``Heck, no.'' This is not for us and no \nState ought to be so privileged as to get that kind of an advantage.\n  Mr. President, the Department of Health and Human Services reports \nthat there may be 3 million children eligible for Medicaid who are not \nenrolled in the program. It is a serious problem and I feel could even \nget worse under a privatization program. If private companies are put \nin charge of enrolling more children for Medicaid, would they really \nconduct aggressive outreach programs to enroll children, to encourage \npeople to bring them in even if it meant that the State's Medicaid \ncosts would go up? I would not bet on it.\n  I want to be clear. I am not necessarily opposed to privatization of \nsome Government services. However, it must be considered very \ncarefully, especially when the lives of vulnerable Americans are at \nstake. This proposal really breaks new ground. For the first time, \nprivate interests would be handed complete power to make benefit \ndecisions that are of critical importance to people with low incomes.\n  It is like turning our military over to private hands and letting \nthem design what conflicts we are going to get involved with. The fact \nis that much of the allure of privatization is to save money, and there \nis a place for that. For example, Congress has to decide to have \nprivate companies operate some of its cafeterias and do some of its \ncleaning, and perhaps that translates into more savings and better \nservice for congressional employees. But Congress has wisely limited \nthe roll of private companies in many functions of Government. Private \ncompanies are not allowed to operate our military installations, nor do \nwe have private companies administer our Social Security system. We \ndraw the line at some point.\n  I am concerned that privatizing decisions about benefits for low-\nincome individuals may go over this line. At least, at the very least, \nit needs careful and thorough study. Yet, I understand that the Finance \nCommittee has not reviewed the details of the Texas waiver, has never \nseen the full proposal, and since the Senator from North Dakota is also \na member of the Finance Committee and talks about the secret nature of \nthis agreement, that further confirms what the rest of us who are not \non the Finance Committee might not know and that is that it has never \nhad appropriate scrutiny, never had appropriate review.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield on that?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would be delighted.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator aware that the proposal before us forces \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to approve without comment \nor review any proposal submitted by the State of Texas which includes \nprovisions to contract out for eligibility determinations? Was the \nSenator so aware?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Not aware. I cannot even believe it would be \nsuggested, because that is such a dereliction of duty that I think \neverybody would be embarrassed if something like this took place. What \ndo you mean? That a Secretary has no right to review the conditions \nunder which we are spending the taxpayers' money?\n  Mr. CONRAD. If we think about this, these are programs with respect \nto food stamps and WIC that are 100 percent federally funded. The \nMedicaid Program is over 50 percent federally funded.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. The rest of it is State funded.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The rest of it is State funded. We would be in a position \nto endorse any proposal the State of Texas sent up here without any \nreview, without any comment by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. That is the situation we are in with the proposal in the \nunderlying legislation. I just ask the Senator, has he ever heard of \nsuch a proposal before the Senate?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Never, not even in the years that I spent in the \nprivate sector, and I ran a pretty good-sized company with 16,000 \nemployees when I left. It did better after I left. It now has 30,000 \nemployees.\n  Never have I seen it. Never, when one works with Government, have I \nseen this kind of an arrangement that has a peculiar odor, and it is \nnot Chanel No. 5. The fact is that to give away Government funds in a \nprogram as sensitive as this to take care of the poor--listen, all of \nus have seen the abuses of private sector companies that have taken \nover health care and things of that nature.\n  It just blows one's mind when you see that the president of a company \nthat is in the health care business made $22 million in a single year \nand meanwhile is squeezing down because that is where the profits are \ngoing to come from, from cutting conditions. They are cutting programs \nthat are supposed to take care of people's health.\n  Well, do you want to have someone up there whose bonus, whose stock \noptions, whose salary depends on making sure that they service as few \npeople as possible, reduce expenses as much as possible when, in fact, \nthe WIC Program is designed to take care of people who are really \nimpoverished, people who need the nutrition that comes through the \nprogram to sustain them? So do you want to have some executive sitting \nat some remote place--and I liked that executive life when I was there, \nbut it was never at the Government's expense--at Government expense. We \nsee constant reference to cases being tried, investigations being \nconducted where programs were turned over to the private sector. I talk \nabout things like jails--we have tried that in New Jersey--which were \ndismal failures because they could not protect the guards sufficiently \nin these jails because they did not hire the right kind of people. They \ndid not provide them with the right kind of tools. The facilities were \nnot built enough to make sure the inmates incarcerated were properly \ncared for.\n  So we see this time and time again, and here we walk in and say, \n``OK, here is a bunch of poor people. You take care of them. Do the \nbest you can at the best price you can.'' What an outrage.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a final question?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Sure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Is the Senator aware that under the proposal in the \nunderlying legislation, we could have a private company decide the \ncustody of a child? That this is so far-reaching without any limits we \ncould be in a circumstance in which a private concern has the authority \nto determine the custody of a child? How does that strike the Senator \nfrom New Jersey?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will tell the Senator how it strikes me. I say \nthank God that the Senator from North Dakota has brought this to the \nattention of the Senate and to the public.\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\n  My friend has done a real service in doing this. The notion that an \nindividual working for a private living, perhaps their salary dependent \nupon their ability to curtail services, is hardly the way you want to \ntreat a sick patient in the hospital. That is hardly the way you want \nto treat a family problem. That is hardly the way you want to protect a \nmother who has been battered. That is hardly the way we want to do \nthings in a society with the conscience this country has.\n  I am delighted, again, that the Senator introduced it. I am concerned \nthat privatization like this is not going to do the job. Before we go \nahead with approval of a waiver, we ought to at least hold a hearing \nand review the details. Mr. President, Congress has established these \nsafety net programs for people in our society who are truly in need, \nimpoverished. They are designed to ease suffering, to provide \nnutritional assistance to help children, help struggling people get \ninto the work force to get themselves off welfare, to do whatever they \ncan to sustain themselves. These programs can literally mean the \ndifference between homelessness and independence, and we ought not to \nrush to hand them over to a private interest at this time, perhaps \nnever, but we sure ought not to do it in the hasty manner that this is \nbeing undertaken. We can always revisit this issue, Mr. President, \nwithout constraints of a reconciliation bill.\n  I fully support the action being proposed by the Senator from North \nDakota and commend him for it, I must tell you.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from New Jersey. If I could just take \na moment to further point out--I want to rivet this point--there have \nbeen no hearings, not a hearing in the Finance Committee, not a hearing \nin the Agriculture Committee. Members have not been granted the \nopportunity to question witnesses, experts, company, or advocates on \nthe merits of privatizing eligibility determinations, protections \nagainst cost overruns or protections for recipients.\n\n  I really believe this is a totally unprecedented proposal that is \nburied in this very large document that sets a precedent that I believe \nis truly alarming. I hope my colleagues will support the point of order \nwhen we vote on it tomorrow. This is, I think, a circumstance in which \na very broad proposal is being attempted, being made to ram it through \nCongress as part of privileged legislation. That is wrong. That is \nsimply wrong. The issue deserves public hearings and full debate.\n  I thank the Chair, yield the floor, and I thank very much the Senator \nfrom New Jersey.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 503\n\n    (Purpose: To extend premium protection for low-income medicare \n               beneficiaries under the medicaid program)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, I want to bring to the attention of \nmy colleagues and other interested persons, a letter from the campaign \nfinance Project. As my colleagues are aware, this project is being led \nby two of our former colleagues, Nancy Kassebaum Baker and former Vice \nPresident Walter Mondale. They were asked by President Clinton earlier \nthis year to lead a bipartisan effort to develop a solution for \nreforming our campaign finance laws.\n  Last week, they issued an open letter to the President and to the \nCongress about their observations and what they believe should \nconstitute real and meaningful reform. They have identified several key \nareas that they believe are essential to these reform efforts: a \ncomplete ban on ``soft money;'' refine and sharpen the definitions of \n``issue advocacy'' and ``independent expenditures;'' improve disclosure \nof campaign finances; and strengthen enforcement and leadership at the \nFederal Election Commission.\n  I have the privilege to meet with both Vice President Mondale and \nSenator Kassebaum Baker. They are sincere in their efforts to reform \nour campaign finance system. They believe, as I do, that our failure to \nact in this issue will only fuel the public's cynicism about the \ninstitutions of the Congress, the Presidency, and the electoral process \nas a whole. I commend this letter to my colleagues attention and ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the letter was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n An Open Letter to The President and the Congress of the United States \n    from Nancy Kassebaum Baker and Walter F. Mondale--June 18, 1997\n\n       Dear Mr. President and Members of Congress: In March, the \n     President asked that we help in the cause of campaign finance \n     reform. Since then we have observed closely the national \n     discussion of this issue, which we believe is central to the \n     well-being of American democracy. We would now like to report \n     about our initial recommendations, with a plea, in the best \n     interests of our political process, that the Executive and \n     Legislative Branches commit themselves to a course of urgent \n     debate leading to early and meaningful action.\n       One of us is a Republican. The other is a Democrat. We are \n     inspired by the bipartisan efforts of Senators John McCain \n     and Russell Feingold, and Representatives Christopher Shays \n     and Martin Meehan, to achieve campaign finance reform. The \n     bipartisan effort of new members of the House, led by \n     Representatives Asa Hutchinson and Thomas Allen, is also a \n     foundation for hope. We are mindful that no change will occur \n     unless there is a consensus in both parties that reform is \n     fair to each. We also believe the imperative task of renewing \n     our democracy requires that we all look beyond party. Guided \n     by basic lessons from our Constitution and national \n     experience, we must identify specific measures and commit \n     ourselves to action where agreement is within our grasp, even \n     as we identify other questions for further consideration.\n       The Constitution, in this as in all public affairs, is our \n     first teacher. It directs that the Congress shall make no law \n     abridging the freedom of speech. The Supreme Court has \n     provided substantial guidance how that command applies to \n     campaign finance laws. Whether any of us might wish that the \n     Court had decided particulars of prior cases differently, our \n     national legislative task is to give full honor to its free \n     speech decisions.\n       The Constitution also enshrines political democracy. One of \n     its central purposes is to ensure that every individual has \n     the right to participate fully in the electoral process. As \n     Madison said of the Congress in The Federalist Papers (No. \n     52), ``the door of this part of the federal government is \n     open to merit of every description, . . . without regard to \n     poverty or wealth.'' Our campaign finance system must \n     respect, and do everything it can to bolster, the \n     constitutionally rooted primacy of individual citizens in our \n     political democracy.\n       In applying constitutional values to campaign finance, we \n     do not have to start from scratch. We have had a century of \n     debate and legislation about several essential matters, \n     including what we now describe as ``soft money.'' From early \n     in the twentieth century, federal law has prohibited \n     contributions from corporate treasuries to federal election \n     campaigns. Starting in the 1940s, this bar has been applied \n     equally to contributions to federal election campaigns from \n     union treasuries. The basic principle of these constraints, \n     upheld by the Supreme Court, is that organizations which are \n     granted special privileges and protections, provided by \n     federal or state law for economic advantage, should not be \n     permitted to leverage that advantage to cast doubt on the \n     integrity of our national government.\n       In the 1970s, in response to the constitutional crisis that \n     began twenty-five years ago this week, the Congress \n     established limits on individual contributions to candidates \n     and political parties, and barred large individual \n     contributions to them that threatened to undermine \n     governmental integrity in reality or appearance. Though it \n     subsequently invalidated several other reform provisions of \n     that time, the Supreme Court sustained this central element \n     of our campaign finance law.\n       At the end of the 1970s, the Federal Election Commission \n     began to erode these important protections. The Commission \n     authorized national party committees to spend the proceeds of \n     a new category of contributions\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\n     which we now know as ``soft money.'' This allowed previously \n     prohibited corporate and union treasury contributions, and \n     also unlimited contributions from individuals, to the \n     national political parties. The theory has been that if \n     contributions are not used directly in a federal election, \n     federal campaign finance laws do not limit them. At first, \n     the amounts of soft money involved were relatively small. But \n     as happens with cracks in dikes, the power behind the breach \n     has overwhelmed all defenses. The resulting flood of money to \n     the national parties and their campaign organizations now \n     threatens the credibility of our entire electoral process.\n       We believe that Congress, as a matter of high priority must \n     stop, unambiguously, all ``soft money'' contributions to the \n     national parties and their campaign organizations. The \n     Congress should also prohibit the solicitation of soft money \n     by those parties and organizations, any federal office \n     holder, or any candidate for federal office for the seeming \n     benefit of others, but in truth to circumvent the prohibition \n     of soft money to the national parties. These interrelated \n     acts would do much to reinvigorate the basic concept of the \n     Federal Election Campaign Act: that, while we must remain \n     mindful of the political parties' needs for resources to \n     perform their vital role in the political process, it is \n     individuals, subject to contribution limits established by \n     Congress, who are the heart of the system of private \n     contributions for federal elections. The prompt end to soft \n     money solicitations by presidential candidates, among others, \n     would also assure that the public gets full value for its \n     investment in publicly financed presidential elections.\n       A recurring observation about the 1996 and other recent \n     federal elections is that candidates have lost control of the \n     conduct of their campaigns. Indeed, many candidates are at \n     risk of becoming bystanders to campaigns waged by others in \n     the name of ``issue advocacy.'' As a result, the \n     accountability of the candidates for the conduct of campaigns \n     is seriously compromised. Part of the problem is the need to \n     sharpen definitions, that may have worked twenty years ago, \n     to distinguish campaigning for candidates from a more general \n     public debate of issues. Another part is the need to update \n     the disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign \n     Act. Progress on both counts is necessary to assure that our \n     political process achieves the substantial benefits that \n     should result from an end to the ``soft money'' system.\n       First, it is essential that Congress establish, on the \n     basis of the experience of recent elections, an appropriate \n     test consistent with the First Amendment for distinguishing \n     advocacy about candidates from the general advocacy of \n     issues. The purpose of this test should be to identify for \n     consistent treatment under the Federal Election Campaign Act \n     significant expenditures for general communications to the \n     public, at times close to elections, that are designed to \n     achieve specific electoral results. The Supreme Court has \n     said that Congress may regulate federal campaign activity to \n     avoid corrupting influences or appearances. In doing so, the \n     Congress should look at reality, not the self-applied labels \n     of partisans. Our objective should be to assure that \n     comparable expenditures are treated comparably.\n       The gains from ending ``soft money'' will be incomplete if \n     money currently spent by parties is only redirected into so-\n     called issue advertisements, including those by surrogate \n     organizations established to circumvent campaign finance \n     laws. A tightened, realistic definition of statutory terms \n     will not foreclose communications to the public on behalf of \n     the interests of business enterprises and unions even up to \n     Election Day, under regulations evenly applied to their \n     political action committees. It will mean that communications \n     to the general public in periods close to elections that are \n     designed to achieve electoral wins or losses are financed \n     through the voluntary contributions of individuals, such as \n     to their parties, political action committees, or candidates.\n       Second, disclosure is an essential tool because it allows \n     citizens to hold candidates accountable for the means by \n     which campaigns are financed. On election day voters can only \n     express themselves about candidates on the ballot. Even \n     candidates, however, may not know the true identity of \n     entities that dominate the airwaves during the closing weeks \n     of a campaign with electoral messages patently targeted to \n     favor or disfavor them or their opponents. Broader disclosure \n     of the sources of financing of campaign advertisements would \n     contribute to the robustness of political debate. It would \n     ensure that candidates know to whom they might respond, and \n     that the electorate knows who can be held accountable for the \n     accuracy or demeanor of advertisements.\n       Additionally, we should take advantage of an electronic age \n     in which information can be transmitted rapidly from, and \n     updated frequently by, party and campaign officials, and made \n     readily available to the public with equal rapidity.\n       No limitations and no disclosure requirements are worth \n     much in the absence of timely and effective enforcement. \n     Indeed, the absence of credible enforcement causes damage \n     beyond the campaign finance laws by engendering real doubts \n     about the application of the rule of law to powerful members \n     of our society. The American public believes resolutely that \n     a fundamental premise of our constitutional democracy is that \n     high elected officials, like ordinary citizens, are subject \n     to the rule of law, and to the timely application of it. The \n     Congress and the President need to work together to assure \n     the public that campaign finance laws are not pretenses.\n       The President and the Senate should take immediate action \n     to assure that vacancies on the Federal Election Commission \n     are filled by knowledgeable, independent-minded individuals \n     who are not subject to the suggestion that they are appointed \n     to represent political organizations. We say this because we \n     need a clean break from the past, not to be critical of any \n     former, present, or potential member of the Commission. It is \n     within the President's power to accomplish this new start for \n     the Commission, beginning today. We urge the President, in \n     consultation with the leadership of the Congress, to name an \n     advisory panel of citizens whose task would be to recommend \n     highly qualified candidates for the President's consideration \n     for appointment to the Commission, subject of course to the \n     Senate's advice and consent.\n       Congress can take further steps to protect the independence \n     of the Commission. If commissioners were limited to one term, \n     they would have no occasion to measure the impact of their \n     decisions on the possibility of reappointment. The \n     independence of the Commission can also be furthered by \n     placing its funding on a more secure, longer term basis.\n       The potential for deadlock inheres in the requirement that \n     the Commission have an even number of commissioners. Because \n     the Congress also has made the Commission the official \n     gatekeeper to the United States courts, judicial action to \n     resolve complaints under the Federal Election Campaign Act is \n     impeded unless permitted by a majority of commissioners. \n     Thus, a deadlocked Commission is an obstacle to the \n     adjudication of meritorious claims. It is important to rely \n     on the expertise of the Commission, but when the Commission \n     is unable to resolve complaints, our respect for the rule of \n     law requires that complainants have the right to a fresh \n     start through a direct action in the United States courts \n     against alleged violators. The law should be amended to \n     provide for this in the event that the Commission is unable \n     to act because of deadlock or a lack of resources.\n       We have not attempted to set out an exhaustive list of \n     reforms which may be attainable and would make a significant \n     contribution. Other important proposals by members of \n     Congress or students of campaign finance reform merit \n     consideration, such as encouraging small contributions \n     through tax credits, or providing greater resources to \n     candidates through enhanced access to communications media or \n     through flexibility by the parties in supporting candidates \n     with expenditure of hard money contributions. Rather, our \n     purpose is to illustrate that it is possible to identify and \n     act on particular, achievable improvements, which should not \n     be postponed or neglected. We very much encourage and support \n     a larger debate about other changes at the federal and state \n     levels in the manner in which political campaigns are \n     financed. Additional changes will be essential to renewing \n     American democracy. The enactment of immediate reforms may \n     give us a measure of time to address other reforms, but \n     should never become an excuse for avoiding them.\n       We urge that the work of the Congress over the next few \n     months be spurred by one overriding thought: no one would \n     create, or should feel comfortable in defending, the campaign \n     finance system that now exists. Public cynicism about our \n     great national political institutions is the inevitable \n     product of the gaps that exist between our principles and the \n     law, and between the law and compliance with it. The trend \n     lines, also, are all wrong. If we were unhappy about campaign \n     financing in the election of 1996, as the public is and as \n     members of both parties ought to be, then we should \n     anticipate with great trepidation the election of 2000, \n     absent prompt reforms.\n       The challenge for this Congress is to put in place changes \n     for the presidential and congressional election cycle that \n     will start the day after next year's elections, a little more \n     than sixteen months from now, to enable an election in the \n     year 2000 in which we will have pride and the public will \n     have confidence. Your leadership in that endeavor will serve \n     the interests of American democracy, and command the enduring \n     appreciation of all of us who know how needed that leadership \n     is.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Kassebaum Baker.\n     Walter F. Mondale.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6183-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6184-S6185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, today the House in effect approved \nPresident Clinton's renewal of most-favored-nation status for the \nPeople's Republic of China. The House failed to adopt a resolution \ndisapproving of Mr. Clinton's renewal of MFN for China.\n  The House thus squandered its opportunity to send a strong signal to \nthe Clinton administration that its policy of engagement with China has \nnot worked.\n  The administration, and others supporting MFN, insisted that they \nwere willing to pressure China on human rights, on trade, on \nproliferation, and on Hong Kong. They just didn't believe, they \ninsisted repeatedly, that MFN is the way to do it.\n  Fair enough, Mr. President. Taking supporters of MFN at their word, I \nhope Senators will make clear that if MFN isn't the proper tool to use \nin trying to influence China on such matters, what is the proper tool? \nBy renewing MFN, President Clinton and supporters of MFN for China, \nhave taken on a new burden--to show they are serious about finding a \nway to persuade China to stop abusing its citizens rights, stop unfair \ntrade practices, stop sending weapons of mass destruction to rogue \nregimes, and live up to its commitments on Hong Kong.\n  The debate over China policy is far from over. During the coming \nweeks and months, I will be considering new measures on China.\n  For example, Mr. President, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee \nwill hold hearings on legislation to deal with serious problems in the \nUnited States-China relationship, and on the commercial activities of \nthe People's Liberation Army in the United States.\n  I do hope that Senators who have asserted that there is a better way \nto influence China than revoking MFN will work with the Foreign \nRelations Committee in finding that better way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6185-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE ZINZERS ON THEIR 60TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, families are the cornerstone of America. \nThe data are undeniable: Individuals from strong families contribute to \nthe society. In an era when nearly half of all couples married today \nwill see their union dissolve into divorce, I believe it is both \ninstructive and important to honor those who have taken the commitment \nof ``till death us do part'' seriously, demonstrating successfully the \ntimeless principles of love, honor, and fidelity. These characteristics \nmake our country strong.\n  For these important reasons, I rise today to honor Dorothy and Roy \nZinzer of Affton, Missouri, who on June 19, 1997, celebrated their 60th \nwedding anniversary. My wife, Janet, and I look forward to the day we \ncan celebrate a similar milestone. The Zinzers' commitment to the \nprinciples and values of their marriage deserves to be saluted and \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6185-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Goetz, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1532.

A bill to reestablish the Office of Noise Abatement and \nControl in the Environmental Protection Agency; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n                   THE QUIET COMMUNITIES ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenator Sarbanes, the Quiet Communities Act of 1997. It is estimated \nthat noise levels in communities across the country have increased more \nthan 10 percent over the last decade. Studies indicate that noise \naffects one's ability to concentrate and can cause sleep deprivation, \nresulting in deleterious effects on health. Air noise is polluting our \ncommunities, and we must face and address this reality that affects the \nquality of life of our constituents.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration predicts there will be 36 percent \nmore flights in 2007 than there are today and that 60 of the 100 \nlargest airports in this country are proposing to build new runways. A \nrecent study by the Natural Resources' Defense Council found that the \nFAA's noise policy threshold is far too high for residential \ncommunities. Additionally, the study found there are over 250,000 \npeople residing near Newark, JFK, and LaGuardia suffering from more \nnoise than even the FAA deems fit for residences.\n  In the 1970 Clean Air Act, Congress authorized $30 million for the \nestablishment of the Office of Noise Abatement and Control [ONAC] \nwithin the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA] to study noise and its \neffect on public health and welfare, and to consult with other Federal \nagencies on noise related issues. In 1982, ONAC's funding was \nterminated and the Office has been virtually dormant since.\n  Each year, new studies show potential links between high noise levels \nand health and quality of life issues. Few issues are as volatile or as \ncontroversial as air noise. The EPA has consistently differed with the \nFAA--and advocated stricter measures--on the selection of noise \nmeasurement methodologies, on the threshold of noise at which health \nimpacts are felt, and on the implementation of noise abatement programs \nat airports around the Nation.\n  It is time to properly address the aircraft noise that affects \nmillions of people every day in manners that are both short and long \nterm. The Quiet Communities Act of 1997 will reestablish within the EPA \nan Office of Noise Abatement and Control which will be responsible for \ncoordinating Federal noise abatement activities, updating or developing \nnoise standards, providing technical assistance to local communities, \nand promoting research and education on the impacts of noise pollution. \nThe Office will emphasize noise abatement approaches that rely on State \nand local activity, market incentives, and coordination with other \npublic and private agencies. The act will also provide for the EPA to \nsubmit recommendations to Congress and the FAA regarding \nrecommendations on new measures that could be implemented to mitigate \nthe impact of aircraft noise on surrounding communities. I ask \nunanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 951\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Quiet Communities Act of \n     1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) for too many citizens of the United States, noise \n     from aircraft, vehicular traffic, and a variety of other \n     sources is a constant source of torment; and\n       (B) nearly 20,000,000 citizens of the United States are \n     exposed to noise levels that can lead to psychological and \n     physiological damage, and another 40,000,000 people are \n     exposed to noise levels that cause sleep or work disruption;\n       (2)(A) chronic exposure to noise has been linked to \n     increased risk of cardiovascular problems, strokes, and \n     nervous disorders; and\n       (B) excessive noise causes sleep deprivation and task \n     interruptions, which pose untold costs on society in \n     diminished worker productivity;\n       (3)(A) to carry out the Clean Air Act of 1970 (42 U.S.C. \n     7401 et seq.), the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 U.S.C. 4901 \n     et seq.), and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 (Public Law \n     95-609; 92 Stat. 3079), the Administrator of the \n     Environmental Protection Agency established an Office of \n     Noise Abatement and Control;\n       (B) the responsibilities of the Office of Noise Abatement \n     and Control included promulgating noise emission standards, \n     requiring product labeling, facilitating the development of \n     low emission products, coordinating Federal noise reduction \n     programs, assisting State and local abatement efforts, and \n     promoting noise education and research; and\n       (C) funding for the Office of Noise Abatement and Control \n     was terminated in 1982 and no funds have been provided since;\n       (4) because the Administrator of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency remains responsible for enforcing \n     regulations issued under the Noise Control Act of 1972 (42 \n     U.S.C. 4901 et seq.) even though funding for the Office of \n     Noise Abatement and Control has been terminated, and because \n     that Act prohibits State and local governments from \n     regulating noise sources in many situations, noise abatement \n     programs across the United States lie dormant;\n       (5) as the population grows and air and vehicle traffic \n     continues to increase, noise pollution is likely to become an \n     even greater problem in the future; and\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\n       (6) the health and welfare of the citizens of the United \n     States demands that the Environmental Protection Agency once \n     again assume a role in combating noise pollution.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require certain Federal agencies to protect the \nright of private property owners, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n              THE PRIVATE PROPERTY OWNERS' BILL OF RIGHTS\n\n  Mr SHELBY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation that \nreaffirms one of the basic principles that formed our Nation--\nprotection of private property rights. The Private Property Owners' \nBill of Rights is intended to reaffirm this constitutional right.\n  The right to private property is an essential freedom. While the \nfifth amendment to the Constitution recognizes that the Federal \nGovernment may take property for public use; it explicitly mandates \nthat Government must compensate the private property owner. In recent \nyears, this fundamental right has been blatantly ignored in the name of \nhabitat and species preservation.\n  Since the inception of our Nation, ownership of private property has \nbeen a cornerstone of economic liberty and prosperity. The current \nFederal regulatory polices are an ominous cloud hanging over every \nlandowner from the established developer to the hardworking \ngenerational farmer.\n  Myriad new environmental regulations stemming from the Endangered \nSpecies Act and the wetlands statues of section 404 of the Clean Water \nAct have rendered countless acres of private land useless. Thus leaving \nproperty owners deprived of the ability to farm, develop, or even \nrepair existing structures on their own land. This bill does not \nchallenge the integrity of the Endangered Species Act or the wetlands \nstatutes; it simply attempts to shift the burden of enforcing these \nlaws from the individual back to the Government. For too long, the \npolicies of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Army Corps of Engineers, \nor the Environmental Protection Agency, with respect to these statutes, \nhave gone unchecked.\n  Property owners should not be singled out to bear the costs of public \npolicies. If our Government determines that a certain parcel of land \nshould be conserved or a species protected, it should purchase the land \nat a fair and just price. Current regulations punish individuals that \nhappen to own land that the Government wants to manage without \npurchasing. Enforcement of land use statutes can range from exorbitant \nfines to the inability to use one's own land or even to time in prison. \nCurrently, expensive and lengthy mitigation is the only recourse \navailable to contest the Government's actions. Simply put, this is an \nintolerable situation.\n  Continuing the punitive approach to conservation will only serve to \nalienate those that are in the best position to assist with the \nefforts. It is estimated that three-fourths of these lands that meet \nthe Federal Government's definition of a wetland through section 404 of \nthe Clean Water Act, are privately owned. It is time to change the \nbureaucratic viewpoint that protecting a private property owners' \nconstitutionally guaranteed rights comes at the cost of protecting the \nenvironment. Contrary to the Government's actions, both are \nintrinsically linked.\n\n  Throughout my tenure, I have heard countless stories of landowners \nbeing denied the right to use their own land--the very property that \nthey purchased or inherited, cared for, developed and pay taxes on--\nbecause the Government determines there is a need to preserve the \nproperty for a wetland or species. These citizens find themselves in a \nregulatory nightmare--unable to live off the land yet unable to sell it \nto the Government, or anyone for that matter, for full market value. \nOnly on paper is the land truly theirs.\n  For example, a farmer in Missouri was accused of destroying wetlands \nsimply for moving dirt while repairing a broken levee on his family's \nproperty. In another disturbing instance, Texan Marge Rector spent \n$830,000 to purchase 15 acres of land for her retirement. Soon after, \nit was determined that her land was a potential habitat for the black-\ncapped vireo and the golden-cheeked warbler. Within 5 years, her land \nwas determined to be worth approximately $30,000. Her retirement dream \nturned into a nightmare.\n  Unfortunately these are not isolated cases, there are hundreds of \nindividuals in similar predicaments across our country. This issue is \nnot limited by geographical boundaries, socio-economic status or \noccupation. Any individual that owns land is subject to unexpected, \nunpredictable environmental regulation that--at the very least--will \nrob a person of the economic value of their land or, worse, force a \nlandowner into prison for rightfully using their land.\n  Mr. President, the time has arrived to realistically address the \nmatter at hand by creating a clearly defined policy for Federal \nagencies to follow. Abusing the rights of private property owners in \nthe name of the environment must end. Congress needs to act before the \neconomic future of more citizens is put at risk.\n  Therefore, I am pleased to reintroduce the Private Property Owners' \nBill of Rights with my colleagues, Senators Nickles and Hutchison. This \nbill would reaffirm the Federal Government's constitutional \nresponsibility to protect private property by requiring the Federal \nGovernment and its agents, to include private property owners in any \nprocess or action to take private land.\n  The Private Property Owners' Bill of Rights requires a Federal agency \nand its representative to give notice and gain consent from property \nowners prior to entering a property owner's land for the purpose of \ngathering information to enforce the Endangered Species Act or any \nwetlands statute. Private property owners also would be guaranteed the \nright to complete access to that information and the right to debate \nits accuracy prior to the Government's use of it.\n\n  Additionally, this legislation requires Federal Government agencies \nto create an administrative appeals process for owners of property \nadversely affected by environmental regulations. The Endangered Species \nAct will be amended to require that private property owners are \nnotified and included in any management agreement that would affect \ntheir land. These provisions will assure that the landowner's voice is \nheard.\n  Most importantly, the private property owners' bill of rights \nguarantees compensation for landowners whose property is devalued by \n$10,000 or 20 percent of its fair market value by Federal action. \nUniform guidelines would be created that all Federal agencies and \nlandowners would follow when developing a compensation agreement. If \ndisagreements arise between the parties, they may request arbitration. \nIn\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\nno manner does this option limit the availability of alternative legal \nmeasures. These are reasonable protections to ensure that landowners' \nrights, guaranteed under the Constitution, are not violated and that \nGovernment affirmatively meets its constitutional obligation to protect \nprivate property.\n  Our Nation is built on the principles of individual freedoms and \nrights. It is time that the Federal Government abide by the laws of our \nland and stop the practice of regulating private property without the \nbenefit of compensation. These abuses must end. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support of this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Private Property Owners' Bill of \nRights Act of 1997 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 953\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Private Property Owners' \n     Bill of Rights''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Our democracy was founded on principles of ownership, \n     use, and control of private property. These principles are \n     embodied in the fifth amendment to the Constitution, which \n     prohibits the taking of private property without the payment \n     of just compensation.\n       (2) A number of Federal environmental programs, \n     specifically the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) and section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution \n     Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1344), have been implemented by \n     employees, agents, and representatives of the Federal \n     Government in a manner that deprives private property owners \n     of the use and control of their property.\n       (3) As new Federal programs are proposed that would limit \n     and restrict the use of private property to provide habitat \n     for plant and animal species, the rights of private property \n     owners must be recognized and respected.\n       (4) Private property owners are being forced by Federal \n     policy to resort to extensive, lengthy, and expensive \n     litigation to protect certain basic civil rights guaranteed \n     by the Constitution.\n       (5) Since many private property owners do not have the \n     financial resources or the extensive commitment of time to \n     proceed in litigation against the Federal Government, a clear \n     Federal policy is needed to guide and direct Federal agencies \n     with respect to the implementation by the agencies of \n     environmental laws that directly impact private property.\n       (6) While all private property owners should and must abide \n     by nuisance laws and should not use their property in a \n     manner that harms their neighbors, these laws have \n     traditionally been enacted, implemented, and enforced at the \n     State and local levels where the laws are best able to \n     protect the rights of all private property owners and local \n     citizens.\n       (7) While traditional pollution control laws are intended \n     to protect the health and physical welfare of the general \n     public, habitat protection programs in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act are intended to protect the welfare of \n     plant and animal species, while allowing recreational and \n     aesthetic opportunities for the public.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to provide a \n     consistent Federal policy to--\n       (1) encourage, support, and promote the private ownership \n     of property; and\n       (2) ensure that the constitutional and legal rights of \n     private property owners are protected by the Federal \n     Government and employees, agents, and representatives of the \n     Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, of all the freedoms we enjoy in this \ncountry, the ability to own, care for, and develop private property is \nperhaps the most crucial to our free enterprise economy. In fact, our \neconomy would cease to function without the incentives provided by \nprivate property. So sacred and important are these rights, that our \nforefathers chose to specifically protect them in the fifth amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution, which says in part, ``nor shall private \nproperty be taken for public use, without just compensation.''\n  Unfortunately, some Federal environmental, safety, and health laws \nare encouraging Government violation of private property rights, and it \nis a problem which is increasing in severity and frequency. We would \nall like to believe the Constitution will protect our property rights \nif they are threatened, but today that is simply not true. The only way \nfor a person to protect their private property rights is in the courts, \nand far too few people have the time or money to take such action. Thus \nmany citizens lose their fifth amendment rights simply because no \nprocedures have been established to prevent Government takings.\n  Many people in the Federal bureaucracy believe that public protection \nof health, safety, and the environment is not compatible with \nprotection of private property rights. I disagree. In fact, the \nterrible environmental conditions exposed in Eastern Europe when the \ncold war ended lead me to believe that property ownership enhances \nenvironmental protection. As the residents of East Berlin and Prague \nknow all too well, private owners are more effective\n\n[[Page S6190]]\n\ncaretakers of the environment than communist governments.\n  Yet the question remains, how do we prevent overzealous bureaucrats \nfrom using their authority in ways which threaten property rights?\n  Today I rise to join my colleague Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama \nin introducing legislation which will strengthen every citizen's fifth \namendment rights. Our bill, the Private Property Owners Bill of Rights, \ntargets two of the worst property rights offenders, the Endangered \nSpecies Act and the Wetlands Permitting Program established by Section \n404 of the Clean Water Act.\n  Our bill requires Federal agents who enter private property to gather \ninformation under either the Endangered Species Act or the Wetlands \nPermitting Program to first obtain the written consent of the \nlandowner. While it is difficult to believe that such a basic right \nshould need to be spelled out in law, overzealous bureaucrats and \nenvironmental radicals too often mistake private resources as their \nown. Property owners are also guaranteed the right of access to that \ninformation, the right to dispute its accuracy, and the right of an \nadministrative appeal from decisions made under those laws.\n  Most importantly, the Private Property Owners Bill of Rights \nguarantees compensation for a landowner whose property is devalued by \n$10,000, or 20 percent or more, of the fair market value resulting from \na Federal action under the Endangered Species Act or Wetlands \nPermitting Program. An administrative process is established to give \nproperty owners a simple and inexpensive way to seek resolution of \ntheir takings claims. If we are to truly live up to the requirements of \nour Constitution, we must make this commitment. I believe this \nprovision will work both to protect landowners from uncompensated \ntakings and to discourage Government actions which would cause such \ntakings.\n  The time has come for farmers, ranchers, and other landowners to take \na stand against violations of their private property rights by the \nFederal bureaucracy. The Private Property Owners Bill of Rights will \nhelp landowners take that stand.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERREY:\n  S. 954. A bill to assure competition in telecommunications markets; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n             THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPETITION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was to \nusher in a new era of competition, choice, jobs, universal service, and \ninfrastructure investment.\n  Much of the promise of the new act remains unfulfilled. Most \ndisappointing has been progress on the competition front. Rather than \nand explosion of competition, in the year since the law was enacted, \nthere has been a disturbing trend toward consolidation.\n  I rise to express serious concern about the Department of Justice's \napproach to mergers in the telecommunications industry. I feel very \nstrongly that the Justice Department approval of the Bell Atlantic and \nNynex merger is bad competition policy and bad telecommunications \npolicy.\n  With this merger, two strong potential competitors with two vibrant, \nrich markets are now one. This loss of competition follows the equally \ntroublesome merger between Telecomm giants Pacific Telesis and \nSouthwestern Bell. Perhaps most troubling is that these approvals have \nopened the door for even larger mergers.\n  What was unimaginable a year ago, the reconstruction of the old Bell \nSystem monopoly is very much within the realm of possibility.\n  Mr. President, the urge to compete should not be replaced with the \nurge to merge.\n  A little more than a year ago, the Congress enacted landmark \nlegislation to open telecommunications markets to competition, preserve \nand advance universal service, and spur private investment in \ntelecommunication infrastructure. Over the last year, the Federal \nCommunications Commission has worked around the clock to implement the \nnew law. It has been a daunting task, frustrated by litigation and \nregulatory wrangling.\n  While the FCC and the States struggle with implementation of the new \nlaw, it is important to remember that a key part of that legislation \ndid not rely on regulation, it relied on the marketplace. The idea was \nto unleash pent up competitive forces among and between \ntelecommunications companies. Mega mergers between telecommunications \ntitans quell these market forces for increased investment, lower rates, \nand improved service.\n  To unshackle the restraints of the Court supervised breakup of AT, \nthe Congress gave Regional Bell Operating Companies instant access to \nlong distance markets outside of their local service regions and access \nto long distance markets inside their regions when they opened their \nmarkets to local competition.\n  In addition to responding to the lure of long distance markets, \nRegional Bell Operating Companies and other local exchange carriers \nwere expected to covet each other's markets. The attraction of serving \nnew local markets was to be a key catalyst for breaking down barriers \nto competition.\n  With these mergers, local competition and long distance competition \nis lost. In addition, potential internet, video and broad band \ncompetition has disappeared.\n  The promise of the new law was that competition, not consolidation \nwould bring new services at lower prices to consumers. Where \ncompetition failed to advance service and restrain prices, universal \nservice support would assure that telephone rates and services where \ncomparable in rural and urban areas.\n  When certain large telecommunications companies combine, they not \nonly eliminate the potential of competition with each other in each \nother's markets, but they can create a market power which may be \ncapable of resisting competition from others. They can also create the \npossibility of an unequal bargaining power when they compete with or \ndeal with small, independent and new carriers.\n  The promise of the Telecommunications Act was improved service and \nlower rates for consumers through competition and the advancement of \nuniversal service. If properly implemented, the Telecommunications Act \nof 1996 can deliver, but the disappointing merger decisions of the \nDepartment of Justice will make that task much more difficult.\n  The legislation I introduce today would clearly institute an \nappropriate level scrutiny for mergers between large telecommunications \ncompanies. I believe that the antitrust laws and the Telecommunications \nAct would permit this type of analysis, without the adoption of a new \nstatute, but to date, the Department of Justice has not seemed willing \nto pursue this approach.\n  Under the Telecommunications Monopoly Prevention Act, new mega-\nmergers would not be prohibited but be required to be reviewed in the \ncontext of their contribution to competition.\n  This legislation is by no means a moratorium on mergers. Indeed, some \nmergers, even among large telecommunications companies, may be very \nmuch in the consumers interests and in the interest of competition. \nThis legislation simply requires a level of review consistent with the \nvision of the Telecommunications Act.\n  It is my view that the Justice Department is presently pursuing a \nstandard of review for telecomm mergers which would be appropriate for \ncompetitive companies tending toward monopoly, but not for monopolies \nwhich should be moving toward competition.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the Telecommunications Monopoly \nPrevention Act be printed in the Record as read and urge my colleagues \nto review and support this needed piece of legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n

TRANSFERS OF SENSITIVE EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY BY \n                   THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Credible allegations exist that the People's Republic \n     of China has transferred equipment and technology as follows:\n       (A) Gyroscopes, accelerometers, and test equipment for \n     missiles to Iran.\n       (B) Chemical weapons equipment and technology to Iran.\n       (C) Missile guidance systems and computerized machine tools \n     to Iran.\n       (D) Industrial furnace equipment and high technology \n     diagnostic equipment to a nuclear facility in Pakistan.\n       (E) Blueprints and equipment to manufacture M-11 missiles \n     to Pakistan.\n       (F) M-11 missiles and components to Pakistan.\n       (2) The Department of State has failed to determine whether \n     most such transfers violate provisions of relevant United \n     States and Executive orders relating to the proliferation of \n     sensitive equipment and technology, including the Arms Export \n     Control Act, the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of \n     1994, the Export Administration Act of 1979, the Export-\n     Import Bank Act of 1945, and the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-\n     Proliferation Act of 1992, and Executive Order 12938.\n       (3) Where the Department of State has made such \n     determinations, it has imposed the least onerous form of \n     sanction, which significantly weakens the intended deterrent \n     effect of the sanctions provided for in such laws.\n       (4) The Clinton Administration decided not to impose \n     sanctions on the People's Republic of China for its transfer \n     of C-802 anti-ship cruise missiles to Iran, finding that the \n     transfer was not ``destabilizing''.\n       (5) That finding is contrary to the judgment of the \n     commander of the United States Fifth Fleet, elements of which \n     are frequently deployed in and around the Persian Gulf.\n       (6) Despite the fact that officials of the People's \n     Republic of China were responsible for the sale to Pakistan \n     of specialized ring magnets, which are used to enrich uranium \n     for use in nuclear weapons, the Clinton Administration did \n     not impose sanctions on either the People's Republic of China \n     or Pakistan for such sale, even though sanctions are required \n     for such sale under law.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the transfers of equipment and technology by the \n     People's Republic of China described in subsection (a)(1) \n     pose a threat to the national security interests of the \n     United States;\n       (2) the failure of the Clinton Administration to initiate a \n     formal process to determine whether to impose sanctions for \n     such transfers under United States laws intended to halt the \n     proliferation of sensitive equipment and technology \n     contributes to the threat posed to the national security \n     interests of the United States by the proliferation of such \n     equipment and technology; and\n       (3) the President should immediately initiate the \n     procedures necessary to determine whether sanctions should be \n     imposed under United States law for such transfers.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 60 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to Congress \n     a report, in both classified and unclassified form, setting \n     forth--\n       (1) the date, if any, of the commencement and of the \n     conclusion of each formal process conducted by the Department \n     of State to determine whether to impose sanctions for each \n     transfer described in subsection (a)(1);\n       (2) the facts providing the basis for each determination \n     not to impose sanctions on the Government of the People's \n     Republic of China, or entities within or having a \n     relationship with that government, for each transfer, and the \n     legal analysis supporting such determinations;

The \n     Secretary may add to, modify, or substitute for such classes, \n     if such changes will improve the determination of actuarial \n     equivalence.\n       (B) Recommendations.--\n       (i) In general.--In addition to any other duties required \n     by law, the Physician Payment Review Commission and the \n     Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (or their \n     successors) shall each develop recommendations on--\n\n       (I) the risk factors that the Secretary should use in \n     adjusting the standardized payment amount and premium under \n     subparagraph (A), and\n       (II) the methodology that the Secretary should use in \n     determining the risk factors to be used in adjusting the \n     standardized payment amount and premium under subparagraph \n     (A).\n\n       (ii) Time.--The recommendations described in clause (i) \n     shall be developed not later than January 1, 1999.\n       (iii) Annual report.--The Physician Payment Review \n     Commission and the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission \n     (or their successors) shall include the recommendations \n     described in clause (i) in their respective annual reports to \n     Congress.\n       (c) Payments to Plan Sponsors.--\n       (1) Monthly payments.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to paragraph (4), for each \n     individual enrolled with a plan under this subchapter, the \n     Secretary shall make monthly payments in advance to the \n     Medicare Choice organization of the Medicare Choice plan with \n     which the individual is enrolled in an amount equal to \\1/12\\ \n     of the amount determined under paragraph (2).\n       (B) Retroactive adjustments.--The amount of payment under \n     this paragraph may be retroactively adjusted to take into \n     account any difference between the actual number of \n     individuals enrolled in the plan under this section and the \n     number of such individuals estimated to be so enrolled in \n     determining the amount of the advance payment.\n       (2) Amount of payment to medicare choice plans.--The amount \n     determined under this paragraph with respect to any \n     individual shall be equal to the sum of--\n       (A) the lesser of--\n       (i) the standardized payment amount for the applicable \n     Medicare Choice payment area, as adjusted for such individual \n     under subsection (a)(4), or\n       (ii) the premium charged by the plan for such individual, \n     as adjusted for such individual under section (a)(4), minus\n       (B) the amount such individual paid to the plan pursuant to \n     section 5043 (relating to 10 percent of the premium).\n       (3) Payments from trust funds.--The payment to a Medicare \n     Choice organization or to a Medicare Choice account under \n     this section for a medicare-eligible individual shall be made \n     from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the \n     Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund in such \n     proportion as the Secretary determines reflects the relative \n     weight that benefits under parts A and B are representative \n     of the actuarial value of the total benefits under this part.\n       (4) Limitation on amounts an out-of-plan physician or other \n     entity may collect.--A physician or other entity (other than \n     a provider of services) that does not have a contract \n     establishing payment amounts for services furnished to an \n     individual enrolled under this subchapter with a Medicare \n     Choice organization shall accept as payment in full for \n     services that are furnished to such an individual the amounts \n     that the physician or other entity could collect if the \n     individual were not so enrolled.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``National Fund for \n     Health Research Act''.\n\n     SEC. 5996. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Nearly 4 of 5 peer reviewed research projects deemed \n     worthy of funding by the National Institutes of Health are \n     not funded.\n       (2) Less than 3 percent of the nearly one trillion dollars \n     our Nation spends on health care is devoted to health \n     research, while the defense industry spends 15 percent of its \n     budget on research and development.\n       (3) Public opinion surveys have shown that Americans want \n     more Federal resources put into health research and are \n     willing to pay for it.\n       (4) Ample evidence exists to demonstrate that health \n     research has improved the quality of health care in the \n     United States. Advances such as the development of vaccines, \n     the cure of many childhood cancers, drugs that effectively \n     treat a host of diseases and disorders, a process to protect \n     our Nation's blood supply from the HIV virus, progress \n     against cardiovascular disease including heart attack and \n     stroke, and new strategies for the early detection and \n     treatment of diseases such as colon, breast, and prostate \n     cancer clearly demonstrates the benefits of health research.\n       (5) Health research which holds the promise of prevention \n     of intentional and unintentional injury and cure and \n     prevention of disease and disability, is critical to holding \n     down health care costs in the long term.\n       (6) Expanded medical research is also critical to holding \n     down the long-term costs of the medicare program under title \n     XVIII of the Social Security Act. For example, recent \n     research has demonstrated that delaying the onset of \n     debilitating and costly conditions like Alzheimer's disease \n     could reduce general health care and medicare costs by \n     billions of dollars annually.\n       (7) The state of our Nation's research facilities at the \n     National Institutes of Health and at universities is \n     deteriorating significantly. Renovation and repair of these \n     facilities are badly needed to maintain and improve the \n     quality of research.\n       (8) Because discretionary spending is likely to decline in \n     real terms over the next 5 years, the Nation's investment in \n     health research through the National Institutes of Health is \n     likely to decline in real terms unless corrective legislative \n     action is taken.\n       (9) A health research fund is needed to maintain our \n     Nation's commitment to health research and to increase the \n     percentage of approved projects which receive funding at the \n     National Institutes of Health.\n       (10) Americans purchase health insurance and participate in \n     the medicare program to protect themselves and their families \n     against the high cost of illness and disability. Because of \n     this, it makes sense to devote 1 cent of every health \n     insurance dollar to finding preventions, cures, and improved \n     treatments for illnesses and disabilities through medical \n     research.\n\n     SEC. 5997. ESTABLISHMENT OF FUND.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury of \n     the United States a fund, to be known as the ``National Fund \n     for Health Research'' (hereafter in this section referred to \n     as the ``Fund''), consisting of such amounts as are \n     transferred to the Fund under subsection (b) other amounts \n     subsequently enacted into law and any interest earned on \n     investment of amounts in the Fund.\n       (b) Transfers to Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall transfer to the Fund amounts equivalent to amounts \n     described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Amounts.--\n       (A) In general.--Amounts described in this paragraph for \n     each of the fiscal years 1998 through 2002 shall be equal to \n     the amount of Federal savings derived for each such fiscal \n     year under the medicare program under title XVIII of the \n     Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) and the medicaid \n     program under title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) \n     that exceeds the amount of Federal savings estimated by the \n     Congressional Budget Office as of the date of enactment, to \n     be achieved in each such program for each such fiscal year \n     for purposes of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.\n       (B) Determination by secretary.--Not later than 6 months \n     after the end of each of the fiscal years described in \n     subparagraph (A), the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall--\n       (i) make a determination as to the amount to be transferred \n     to the Fund for the fiscal year involved under this \n     subsection;

and\n       (D) the remainder of such amounts during any fiscal year to \n     member institutes and centers, including the Office of AIDS \n     Research, of the National Institutes of Health in the same \n     proportion to the total amount received under this section, \n     as the amount of annual appropriations under appropriations \n     Acts for each member institute and Centers for the fiscal \n     year bears to the total amount of appropriations under \n     appropriations Acts for all member institutes and Centers of \n     the National Institutes of Health for the fiscal year.\n       (2) Plans of allocation.--The amounts transferred under \n     paragraph (1)(D) shall be allocated by the Director of the \n     National Institutes of Health or the various directors of the \n     institutes and centers, as the case may be, pursuant to \n     allocation plans developed by the various advisory councils \n     to such directors, after consultation with such directors.\n       (3) Grants and contracts fully funded in first year.--With \n     respect to any grant or contract funded by amounts \n     distributed under paragraph (1), the full amount of the total \n     obligation of such grant or contract shall be funded in the \n     first year of such grant or contract, and shall remain \n     available until expended.\n       (4) Trigger and release of monies.--\n       (A) Trigger and release.--No expenditure shall be made \n     under paragraph (1) during any fiscal year in which the \n     annual amount appropriated for the National Institutes of \n     Health is less than the amount so appropriated for the prior \n     fiscal year.\n       (B) Phase-in.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall phase-in the distributions required under paragraph (1) \n     so that--\n       (i) 25 percent of the amount in the Fund is distributed in \n     the first fiscal year for which funds are available;\n       (ii) 50 percent of the amount in the Fund is distributed in \n     the second fiscal year for which funds are available;\n       (iii) 75 percent of the amount in the Fund is distributed \n     in the third fiscal year for which funds are available;

Mr. President, I submit for the Record a letter \nfrom Richard Longstreth, first vice president for the Society of \nArchitectural Historians and professor of american civilization at \nGeorge Washington University to the chairman of the Commission on Fine \nArts, J. Carter Brown, regarding the site selection for the proposed \nmemorial to World War II.\n  Professor Longstreth, editor of ``The Mall in Washington, 1791-\n1991,'' is deeply concerned, as am I, by the selection of the Rainbow \nPool site as the location for a proposed memorial to World War II.\n  I deeply support honoring those who served our Nation during the most \npivotal event of the 20th century, as does the professor. I would even \nargue, Mr. President, that a memorial is not enough. That a museum is \nnecessary to tell the complete story to future generations of our \nvictory over the Axis Powers and our defeat of Nazi Germany. This a \nstory that must be told and retold.\n  But I am deeply opposed to the selection of this expansive, \nreflective space at the key axis of the National Mall, lying between \nthe Lincoln Memorial and Washington Monument as the site of a memorial.\n  The idea of constructing a 50-foot-high, 7.4-acre memorial on this \nsite--smack in the middle of the National Mall--is quite troubling. Any \nstructure of such size and magnitude would forever alter the openness \nand grandeur that is America's front lawn.\n  Professor Longstreth states in his letter: ``The whole meaning of one \nof the greatest civic spaces that exists anywhere in the world today \nwill be irreparably cheapened by any proposed scheme for a major \nmemorial on this site.''\n  I could not agree more.\n  Just as disconcerting is the idea that a World War II memorial \nconstructed on this site will have to be closed on the Fourth of July \nweekend, as ruled by the National Parks Service, for safety reasons \nrelated to the fireworks display.\n  This does not make sense.\n  As the Commission on Fine Arts, National Capital Planning Commission, \nand the Secretary of the Interior continue their deliberative process \nconcerning this proposed memorial, you will hear more from me in the \ncoming months, Mr. President. Especially, as my office continues to \nmonitor the process of the environmental and urban impact studies yet \nto be conducted on this site.\n  That is right, Mr. President this site was selected without any \nstudies conducted on the impact on The Mall or the city. Currently, the \nCouncil on Environmental Quality is reviewing my request for \ninformation on the urban and environmental impact on this site. I will \nkeep the Senate informed as to how this process progresses.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                        Society of\n\n\n                                     Architectural Historians,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, June 9, 1997.\n     J. Carter Brown,\n     Chairman, Commission of Fine Arts, Pension Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Brown: As a scholar of the built environment, an \n     officer of the Society of Architectural Historians, and \n     editor of The Mall in Washington, 1791-1991, I am writing to \n     express my very strong personal opposition to current plans \n     for the World War II memorial. My objection lies not with the \n     design. In the abstract I consider the design to possess the \n     sophistication and dignity called for in a work of this \n     nature. I also admire the members of the design team, one of \n     whom I count as an old friend. Rather it is the site that is \n     inappropriate, so much so that I believe this ranks among the \n     very worst proposals ever made for the monumental core. \n     Nothing--from John Russell Pope to Maya Lin--would be \n     suitable at the proposed location.\n       The basic arguments against the site have been made, often \n     eloquently, by others in recent months. From the practical \n     standpoint, the location on a major artery--one that cannot, \n     and should not be closed if the Mail is to remain a part of \n     this city--will prove a logistical nightmare that could never \n     be solved adequately, no matter how many egregious \n     encroachments were made to what is now grass and \n     pedestrianways.\n\n[[Page S6285]]\n\n       As a matter of design, the memorial would introduce a major \n     focal point at a location never intended to have one and \n     would constitute a serious deviation from the McMillan Plan--\n     indeed, a grotesque deviation, the likes of which we have \n     heretofore never seen come to fruition. The extent of space \n     between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial, as \n     well as the distinctness of its two parts, separated by \n     Seventeenth Street, represents more than an apt \n     representation of the vastness and complexity of American \n     space; it is an essential open ground for those two symbols \n     of America's greatest leaders and of American greatness. Any \n     substantial intervention, especially one on the scale of the \n     proposed memorial, would hideously violate that order, \n     detracting from both the established landmarks and also from \n     itself. The Mall is not a commercial pleasure ground--despite \n     some attempts to make it one. The whole meaning of one of the \n     greatest civic spaces that exists anywhere in the world today \n     will be irreparably cheapened by any proposed scheme for a \n     major memorial on this site.\n       Perhaps most significantly of all is the terrible symbolic \n     message conveyed by siting a memorial to any war on the \n     Mall's primary axis. It may be argued, of course, that World \n     War II had transcendent importance for the nation and its \n     position internationally, but no war should be accorded so \n     pivotal a place in the national capital. Is this not more a \n     siting characteristic to dictatorships--Napoleon's Paris; \n     Hitler's Berlin? Any number of messages can be read into this \n     locational strategy, the great majority of them distasteful \n     for a democracy.\n       I would like to end on a personal note, for while I was \n     born after World War II, it was very much a part of my youth. \n     My father served with distinction as executive officer, then \n     as commanding officer, of two Naval repair bases in the South \n     Pacific. Early on I learned from him and from others how \n     important that conflict was and how profoundly it had \n     reshaped the world. It sickens me to think of an event of \n     this order of magnitude degraded by what appears to be a \n     press for expeditious resolution. The site of the memorial \n     should not spark the kind of amazement and anger it is doing \n     from reasonable, well-informed, and intelligent people all \n     over the country. The legacy deserves better. Cannot the \n     imagination and resourcefulness be found to place this \n     memorial in a really magnificent site, fully appropriate to \n     its place in American history?\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard Longstreth,\n         Professor of American Civilization, George Washington \n           University, First Vice President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6284-3", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF JOHN AND CARMELLA GANDOLFO\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate John \nGiovanni and Carmella Seminerio Gandolfo of Lynbrook, NY. After 50 \nyears of love, hard work and spirit, the two are about to renew their \nmarriage vows and celebrate their 50th wedding anniversary. As I remark \non this union, created in Aragona, Sicily, half a century ago, I must \ncomment that their unconditional love for each other is equal to the \none they share for their community.\n  John and Carmella reside in Lynbrook where John is now retired from \nthe construction industry and Carmella is a dedicated homemaker. Mr. \nand Mrs. Gandolfo have been blessed with three children, and five \ngrandchildren. Family and friends see the couple as a tower of \nstrength, support, understanding, and limitless love. They have passed \nthese same attributes on to their loved ones, creating a model family \nthat is admired by their community. Their marriage serves as a \nmilestone to be duplicated by others.\n  This record does not do justice to commemorate the longevity of such \nan event of triumph, tenacity, and joy. John and Carmella's marriage \nembodies what all citizens should try to achieve, and captures the true \nmeaning of love and citizenship. Once again, I would like to \ncongratulate John and Carmella on their joyous day. I hope these \nrenewed vows will add another 50 years of fortune to their \nlives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6285-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             BETTY SHABAZZ\n\n Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, tragedy has beset the family of \nMalcolm X and Betty Shabazz with such abundance that I doubt few of us \ncan comprehend their grief.\n  Yesterday, Betty Shabazz the proud educator and activist wife of the \nlate Malcolm X, died of complications that ensued after she suffered \nburns over 80 percent of her body in a fire at her Yonkers apartment on \nthe first day of this month. Dr. Shabazz had battled her way through \nfive extensive operations since the fire, but the injuries proved too \nextensive for her to overcome this final tribulation. Having witnessed \nthe assassination of her husband, defended one of her children against \ncharges of an alleged murder plot, and sought to ease the troubles of \nher grandchildren, Dr. Shabazz rose above it all to defy critics and \nsymbolize an ability to overcome all means of adversity.\n  In trying to reconcile this tragedy, I recall the words of Oscar \nWilde who wrote: ``It often happens that the real tragedies of life \noccur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude \nviolence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, \ntheir entire lack of style.'' My deepest sympathy goes out to this \nfamily that has too often been forced to grapple with the ``absolute \nincoherence of tragedy.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6285-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO ANI DANIELIAN, PHILLIPS EXETER ACADEMY STUDENT AND RECIPIENT \n   OF THE 1997 JAPAN-UNITED STATES SENATE YOUTH EXCHANGE SCHOLARSHIP\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nexhaustive and exemplary disaster assistance efforts of those at \nCavalier Air Station, near Cavalier, ND.\n  As my colleagues are aware, my State has suffered the worst winter \nand spring of its history. A record eight blizzards dropped over 100 \ninches of snow on North Dakota, and brought with them sub-zero \ntemperatures well into the month of April. The worst and final \nblizzard--Hannah--coated the State in ice, knocked out power for much \nof the State, and made the snowmelt that followed much worse. The flood \nthat followed was a 500-year flood, driving thousands from their homes \nand farms all along the Red River. Livestock losses were in the \nhundreds of thousands, economic losses in the billions, and the \ndisruption to the lives of those affected were incalculable.\n  In the face of this, everyone in North Dakota pulled together, \nincluding the able men and women of our Armed Forces stationed in my \nState. The outstanding snow removal efforts of the National Guard and \nAir Force personnel from the Minot and Grand Forks bases were well \ndocumented, and brought the Secretary of the Air Force, Dr. Sheila E. \nWidnall, to North Dakota in February to say a personal ``thank you.'' \nThe accommodation of thousands of flood refugees at Grand Forks AFB--\nwhich helped preserve a sense of hope and community for Grand Forks--\nalso made for unforgettable images on\n\n[[Page S6286]]\n\nCNN and front pages of newspapers across the Nation. This exemplary \nassistance will be long remembered, but it is also important that the \nexceptional contributions of the men and women of another Air Force \ninstallation in North Dakota are not forgotten.\n  Mr. President, that facility is Cavalier Air Station. For those of my \ncolleagues who are not familiar with Cavalier, this phased array radar \nbase was constructed during the 1970's as part of the Safeguard ABM \nsystem. The motto of Cavalier's unit--the 10th Space Warning Squadron--\nis ``instant to watchful instant.'' For 20 years this has meant \nproviding early warning of nuclear attack for the Pentagon and tracking \nmillions of bits of deadly space junk in Earth orbit for NASA, but this \nyear this motto had new meaning.\n  As the commander of the installation, Lt. Col. Donald T. Kidd, \ndescribed to me, this spring this unit of 33 people--28 active duty Air \nForce and 5 civilians employed by the Department of Defense--\ncontributed over 900 hours of around-the-clock labor to monitoring and \nfighting the rising flood waters in the northern Red River Valley. They \nfilled and stockpiled sandbags, deployed them around threatened homes, \nevacuated threatened city offices in Pembina, and watched the leves for \nleaks. They carried sandbags hundreds of yards in Drayton when there \nwere not enough hands to simply pass them down a line, and built a dike \naround the entire town of Neche. At the station itself, they provided \nsafe refuge for families forced to flee their homes and farms, giving \nshelter to over 100 people during the worst of the flooding. Many of \nthe 70 civilian employees who work at the station under contract with \nthe ITT Corp. also were there when their communities needed them, \nmaking important contributions to disaster relief.\n  And all the while, Mr. President, the men and women of Cavalier Air \nStation continued their critical mission, on top of preparing for the \nyear's most important inspection. I am pleased to inform my colleagues \nthat the 10th Space Warning Squadron passed this inspection with flying \ncolors, taking home some of the highest marks in the U.S. Space \nCommand.\n  Colonel Kidd wanted the efforts of everyone in the 10th Space Warning \nSquadron recognized, writing in a letter to me that ``I can't begin to \ntell how proud I am of each and every one of them.'' On behalf of the \nU.S. Senate and all in North Dakota who benefited from their tireless \nlabor, allow me to extend my most sincere thanks to everyone at \nCavalier Air Station.\n  I and countless North Dakotans are thankful for your efforts, and \nglad that you were there. Every one of you went beyond the call of \nduty, proving yet again that Cavalier Air Station is part of ``Team \nNorth Dakota.'' Again, sincere thanks. You have made a State grateful, \nand your Nation proud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6285-4", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n Mr DOMENICI.

Mr. President, late last night, the Senate \npassed a resolution by a unanimous consent agreement establishing July \n2d of this year and the next as National Literacy Day. As the proud \nauthor of this measure, I want to acknowledge its passage and thank the \n53 Senators who joined me in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Mr. President, the ability to read is something most of us often take \nfor granted. For most of us, it is difficult to imagine not being able \nto read a menu, street sign, magazine, or phone\n\n[[Page S6287]]\n\nbook. But for many of our citizens, these seemingly simple activities \nare impossible. This is so because they are illiterate. I am pleased \nthat this resolution will be able to draw attention to the pressing \nissue of illiteracy. I thank my colleagues who have joined me in \ncosponsoring this important measure.\n  All of us should be more aware of the problem of illiteracy. A recent \nstudy found that over 44 million adults cannot read. An additional 35 \nmillion read below the level needed to function successfully in \nsociety. These numbers alone are alarming and warrant our special \nattention. But even more disturbing are the personal hardships people \nmust face each day due to their inability to read. The embarrassment \nparents face when they cannot read to their children. The \ndiscouragement able workers feel when they cannot fill out a basic job \napplication. The disappointment we all endure as the ranks of the \nilliterate grow annually by over 2 million adults.\n  Mr. President, the 18th century writer, Joseph Addison, once wrote \n``Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body.'' I couldn't \nagree more. Reading enriches our lives in countless ways. But there are \nfar too many of our citizens who cannot read the instructions on a \ndoctor's prescription bottle, let alone share the experience of reading \none of Addison's great poems. This needs to change.\n  Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to thank the many \ncitizens across the country who dedicate their lives to beating back \nthe forces of illiteracy. I want to express my gratitude to the \nteachers, volunteers, parents, and others who donate their time and \ntalent to help those who cannot read. In my own State of New Jersey, I \nwant to give special recognition to Caryl Mackin-Wagner, executive \ndirector of Focus on Literacy, Inc., for her leadership on this issue. \nMy thanks to all involved.\n  Mr. President, we must focus our attention on the problem of \nilliteracy. All of us should make sure we do our part to ensure that \ncitizens who need help know where services are available. We need to \nrecognize the detrimental effects illiteracy has on our society. Most \nimportant, more of us need to enlist in the battle to close the book on \nilliteracy.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I am very pleased that we passed \nthis resolution establishing July 2, 1997, and July 2, 1998, as \nNational Literacy Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6286-2", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          DIPLOMATS OF THE STATE DEPARTMENT SOUTH ASIA BUREAU\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, during the 104th Congress, I \nwas privileged to serve as ranking minority member of the Foreign \nRelations Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. In that \ntime, while visiting and monitoring events in the South Asia region--\nwhich includes India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and \nBangladesh--I had the honor of working with a talented and dedicated \ngroup of diplomats. I wish to pay tribute to some of them today.\n  The South Asia Bureau is the smallest and youngest of the State \nDepartment's regional bureaus, having been created by congressional \nmandate in 1992. Despite its size, it has ably represented American \ninterests in this critical part of the world. This summer, it will \nundergo its first major transition, as nearly all the ranking diplomats \nin the bureau will rotate on to other assignments. Before they do, I \nwanted to take an opportunity to commend them for their service.\n  At the top, of course, is Assistant Secretary of State for South \nAsian Affairs Robin L. Raphel, the first person to ever hold the \nposition. During the past 4 years, Assistant Secretary Raphel has \ndeftly managed the complex web of issues that encompass South Asia--\nfrom Indo-Pakistani tensions to nonproliferation, from human rights to \nthe environment, and from counterterrorism and narcotics to the deadly \nconflict in Afghanistan. She has also been a trusted and valuable \ninterlocuter with Congress, making the administration's case fairly and \nstraightforwardly to those on all sides of every issue under her \npurview.\n  Assistant Secretary Raphel has been assisted in her efforts by an \noutstanding team of ambassadors in the field: Ambassador Frank Wisner \nin New Delhi, Ambassador Tom Simons in Islamabad, Ambassador Peter \nBurleigh in Sri Lanka, Ambassador David Merrill in Dhaka, and \nAmbassador Vogelgesang in Kathmandu. Due to a quirk of timing, with the \nexception of Tom Simons, all of these ambassadors either have or are \nexpected to vacate their posts this summer.\n  I want to commend each of these fine diplomats: Frank Wisner, one of \nthe most senior and well-regarded members of the entire Foreign \nService, and David Merrill, both of whom have announced their \nretirements from Federal service: Peter Burleigh, a native of my home \nState of California and a first-rate linguist, who will next be \nfurthering United States interests as Deputy Permanent Representative \nat the United Nations; and Sandy Vogelgesang, for whom I have a \nspecial, personal regard.\n  Last November, when I traveled to Nepal to view United States \nassistance projects, I was highly impressed by Ambassador Vogelgesang's \nknowledge of Nepal and her depth of caring for its people, the high \ndegree of respect she enjoyed throughout the country, and the way these \ntraits enabled her to be an effective advocate and promoter of U.S. \ninterests. She is, in short, one of the finest Ambassadors I have ever \nhad the privilege of working with. I hope and expect that our Nation \nwill enjoy the benefit of her service in future posts in the years to \ncome.\n  Mr. President, during my tenure on the Foreign Relations Committee, I \nhave developed a high regard for the work of our talented and dedicated \nForeign Service personnel. Almost without exception, I have found the \npeople representing our Nation in embassies overseas to be infused with \nseriousness, patriotism, and professionalism. Sadly, they are too often \nunderappreciated, and occasionally even criticized. As Senators, who \nare called upon to approve the highly competitive selection and \npromotion processes, and to confirm appointments to the Foreign \nService's most senior levels, it behooves us to take the time to \nrecognize some of our most accomplished diplomats.\n  On behalf of my colleagues, I express appreciation and admiration for \na job well done to Assistant Secretary Raphel and Ambassadors Wisner, \nSimons, Burleigh, Merrill, and Vogelgesang. Our country owes them \nthanks for their able service, and we are grateful for their \nsignificant contributions to improving and expanding our relationships \nwith the countries of South Asia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/06/24/senate-section/article/S6287-1", "month": "06", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "24", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nIMMUNIZATION OF DONATIONS MADE IN THE FORM OF CHARITABLE GIFT ANNUITIES\n\n  Mr. ROTH.

Therefore, Members can expect a \nlengthy series of back-to-back rollcall votes as the Senate disposes of \nall the amendments in order to the budget reconciliation bill.\n  Following final passage of S. 947, the Senate is expected to proceed \nto the consideration of S. 949, the Tax Fairness Act.
