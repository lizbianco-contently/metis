DALEY, OF ILLINOIS, TO BE SECRETARY OF \n                                COMMERCE\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of William M. \nDaley, of Illinois, to be Secretary of Commerce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 30 minutes for debate on this \nnomination to be equally divided between the chairman and ranking \nminority member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, soon the Senate will vote on the \nnomination of William Daley to be Secretary of the Department of \nCommerce. Yesterday, the Commerce Committee reported favorably Mr. \nDaley's nomination by a vote of 19 to 1. I hope the full Senate will \nalso vote overwhelmingly for Mr. Daley.\n  The confirmation of nominees by the Senate is a duty prescribed by \nthe Constitution. The advise-and-consent obligation given to the Senate \nin the Constitution is an extremely important task. It should not and \nmust not be taken lightly. At the same time, I believe that it is the \nPresident's prerogative to appoint whomever he chooses to \nadministration positions and that such nominees should only be opposed \nand defeated if there is clear and compelling evidence that such \nnominee is unfit or unable to serve the Nation. Such decision should be \nmade only after exhaustive questioning of the nominee and much soul \nsearching.\n  Mr. William Daley has been asked by the President to serve this \nNation as Secretary of the Department of Commerce. Three major lines of \nquestioning were asked by the committee:\n  What are Mr. Daley's qualifications to serve as Secretary? What are \nMr. Daley's plans for the Department? And what are Mr. Daley's policies \nthat would implement those plans?\n  Numerous questions regarding the Commerce Department have been asked \nof the nominee. He has either fully answered the questions or has\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\ncommitted to providing the committee an answer in a timely fashion.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased to announce that the \nDepartment will cut 100 political appointees from its ranks. The \nDepartment has a staggering 256 political appointment positions \navailable. Mr. Daley pledged to reduce that number by 100. He should be \nstrongly commended for this action.\n  Additionally, at his confirmation hearing, Mr. Daley announced that \nall foreign trade missions would be halted until the Department, in \nconsultation with the Congress, develops a set of criteria designed to \nensure such missions are not politicized. We have all read the press \nreports alleging that political quid pro quos were a part of such trade \nmissions. Promoting U.S. products abroad and opening foreign markets to \nU.S. business, not electoral politics, should be the only purpose of \nsuch missions.\n\n  Again, I am very pleased that Mr. Daley has agreed to work with the \ncommittee to ensure that the occurrences of the past do not happen \nagain. I am very pleased that Mr. Daley has agreed to refrain from \npreferential politics. Discretionary money appropriated to the \nDepartment of Commerce should be allocated based on a set of standards \nand fair criteria that do not give special treatment to any specific \nlocality or region.\n  Mr. Daley's commitment in this area is commendable. Mr. Daley has \nalso pledged to act expeditiously on any requests for information for \nfiles if asked for by any congressional committee.\n  Mr. President, I think it is appropriate for me to say that we all \nknow that there are serious allegations concerning individuals who were \npart of the Department of Commerce. Mr. Daley is aware of those \nallegations. He is fully aware and appreciative of the obligation that \nhe has to refurbish the image of that Department because of the \nactivities of some. I am very confident that he is committed to doing \nso and will be able to do so. He is an experienced, talented individual \nwho I believe is very capable of carrying out that daunting task.\n  Last, Mr. Daley promised to recuse himself from any issue that would \npresent a conflict of interest and to work to restore the integrity of \nthe Commerce Department. Such a task will certainly not be easy, but I \nbelieve it can and must be done.\n  For the record, Mr. President, some press reports have raised \nquestions regarding Mr. Daley's past business and political activities. \nSuch reports infer that Mr. Daley or his family may have benefited \neither personally or politically in certain circumstances. Those press \nreports have been made part of the permanent committee record. All such \nallegations were raised with the nominee and found to either lack \ncredibility, be proven false, or were fully explained to the \nsatisfaction of the committee.\n  Let me reiterate that point. Based on the evidence presented by all \nconcerned to the committee, the nominee has engaged in no activity that \nwould cause this Member to vote against him. In fact, the nominee has \ntaken great steps to rebut all allegations and explain the facts \nsurrounding them. After such explanations were forthcoming by the \nnominee, the committee moved expeditiously to approve this nomination.\n  In closing, the Commerce Committee has looked into Mr. Daley's \nqualifications and his fitness to serve, and we believe he is a fine \nindividual who will make an outstanding Commerce Secretary. Mr. Daley \nhas a tough road ahead of him. But I am confident he is up to the task. \nHe has already begun to demonstrate the leadership necessary to move \nthe Department into the next century.\n  I look forward--and I know I speak for all Members on my side of the \naisle--to working with the new Secretary and wish him and his family \nthe very best during their time here in Washington. Mr. President, I \nstrongly urge the Senate to confirm this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I am delighted to serve with my distinguished white-\nhaired chairman. My wife says when I appear on TV I look like a Q-Tip.\n  Mr. President, next week the President of the United States will be \ndelivering his State of the Union Message. The Union is in somewhat \ndisrepair, intense disrepair, I might say, because for 50 years after \nWorld War II, with the Marshall plan, we sacrificed our economy. And it \nhas worked. Capitalism has overcome communism. They are going the way \nof freedom and individual rights the world around now. But it has been \nat quite a cost to our economic strength.\n  We have lost over 2 million jobs just in the past 10 years. Our \nmanufacturing sector has gone from 26 percent of our work force down to \n13 percent. Now is the time to rebuild. In order to do that, we need a \nvery strong Secretary. I am pleased that President Clinton has chosen \nan unusually strong Secretary in the person of Bill Daley of Chicago.\n  The fact of the matter is, for many years now he has been a business \nleader, a business attorney, a banker, an outstanding civic leader, in \nmany respects, and more particularly we know him here in Washington as \na special counsel to President Clinton on extending the North American \nFree-Trade Agreement from Canada down to Mexico. Necessarily, there was \nquite a difference on this side of the aisle with respect to that \nagreement, but be that as it may, Bill Daley handled that with \nthoroughness and with tact and with persistence. And it passed with \nstrong bipartisan support.\n  He knows his subject of trade. He understands the business needs. He \nis a very strong individual. He came to the assignment immediately \ngoing over to brief himself on the Department and, as the distinguished \nchairman has already pointed out, has announced, in unique form for a \nnominee, that he was going to downsize some of the duplications there \nin the Department itself and make sure that the trips were made for \nindustry and not for politics.\n\n  More than anything else, he is really intent on reestablishing the \nmorale of the Department with the loss of Ron Brown who did an \noutstanding job as the Secretary of Commerce. And I say that advisedly \nbecause I have been at least through a dozen or so in the last 30 years \nand worked with them in that 30-year period, not only with respect to \nthe authorization of the Department, but the appropriations there.\n  Ron Brown did an outstanding job. Yes, there were some solicitations. \nThank heavens it was not solicitations by Ron Brown like most \nSecretaries of Commerce. We had one Republican Secretary of Commerce go \nto jail for his solicitations. If we have to get into solicitations, I \nam going to be glad to make the record.\n  But the spirit here is one of bipartisanship in the support for Bill \nDaley. I was particularly impressed that not only the distinguished \nDemocratic Senators, Senator Moseley-Braun of Illinois, and our \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Durbin of Illinois, were there to \npresent him in enthusiastic fashion, but he was presented to the \ncommittee by none other than the chairman of the House Judiciary \nCommittee, the most respected Henry Hyde of Illinois, and the campaign \nmanager for Robert Dole's Presidency, the former Secretary of Defense, \nDonald Rumsfeld.\n  So we have the respect and confidence of the leadership in Chicago \nand Illinois that really knows him best. And it is with that record \nhere that he comes. I am particularly enthusiastic that President \nClinton has made this appointment. I want to yield now to our \ndistinguished colleague from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding.\n  It is ironic that this is my first speech on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate and that I am speaking on behalf of a gentleman whom I have \nknown for 25 years and one I am proud to support. I speak on my behalf \nand on the behalf of the senior Senator from Illinois, Senator Carol \nMoseley-Braun, in support of this nomination of Bill Daley to be our \nnew Secretary of Commerce.\n  Bill Daley, of course, is well known in the city of Chicago and \nacross this Nation. The Daley name carries with it certain connotations \nof political leadership, mainly positive, maybe some negative on a \nnational basis. But those of us who know what the Daley legacy\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\nhas been in the State of Illinois feel that it is overwhelmingly \npositive because of the contribution that has been made to our State, \nto the city of Chicago, and to this Nation by the Daley family over the \nlast few decades. It has been significant, significant in this respect: \nThe Daley family has been willing to step forward into public service \nto face the slings and arrows that public figures face, and to lead.\n  And they have led, led our great city of Chicago forward, not only \nunder Mayor Richard J. Daley but now Richard M. Daley, and through the \nother members of the Daley family.\n  William Daley--Bill Daley as we know him--has often been behind the \nscenes, not on the center of the stage. Of course, when his father was \nmayor, he was a young man. Now that his brother is mayor, and he is in \na capacity to play a larger role, many times he has stepped to the \nside. He led in his own fashion, in his own way, and developed a \nreputation in Chicago, and I think across this country, for leadership, \nnot only the obvious, leading in the city, in community endeavors, \ncharitable undertakings, making certain there was some vision from the \nbusiness community about the future of Chicago, but on the national \nscene as well.\n  It is interesting that when President Clinton faced one of his \ntoughest challenges in his first term, in passing NAFTA, a \ncontroversial issue even within the Democratic party, that he would \nturn to Bill Daley of Chicago and say, ``Come to Washington. Use your \nskills and leadership to help me pass this important trade agreement.''\n  When the dust had settled and NAFTA had passed, even the critics of \nNAFTA gave credit to Bill Daley and said, ``Here is a man who could be \ntrusted.'' His door was open. His word was good. As I said at the \nCommerce Committee, he showed the skills of a playmaker like Michael \nJordan, whose name may be known to even the Senator from South \nCarolina. We are proud of the fact that Bill Daley has served this \ncountry well. We think this designation of Bill Daley as the Secretary \nof Commerce creates another opportunity for him to serve his Nation \nwell.\n  It is no surprise that the Department of Commerce has been under the \nspotlight in the last several months, and some questions have been \nraised, and I think deservedly so.\n  I want to salute my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, for \nnoting that there is need for reform in the Department of Commerce. I \nsay to Senator McCain, we could not choose a better person than Bill \nDaley to bring about real reform, because he is a professional.\n  I have to also note the Senator's comments about investigations into \nquestions about his background have shown that they were fine, that he \ncomes to this job with the level of honesty and integrity that we \nexpect of Cabinet people and people in public service. He will be \ntested to put together a team to bring about real reform in the \nDepartment of Commerce. Bill Daley is going to meet that challenge. I \nthink he is going to rise to that occasion.\n  I might speak to one other point before yielding back. During the \ncourse of this hearing and investigation, questions have arisen about \nthe future of the Department of Commerce. Some have even questioned \nwhether it should exist. I, for one, believe it plays a critically \nimportant role. Now that the cold war is behind us, we are engaged in a \nnew war of equal proportion--a war over jobs, a war over opportunities, \na war to find, I guess, for the next generation of Americans, the same \nopportunities other generations have enjoyed.\n\n  We cannot step back and hope that our reputation as a Yankee trader \nwill be all that is needed for us to win in that war. We need to be on \nthe front, in that battle, making certain that American workers and \nbusinesses are treated fairly when it comes to world commerce. That is \nthe job of the Department of Commerce, one of the more important \nresponsibilities that it faces. I hope the Department of Commerce is \nvalued for that responsibility. It certainly is, in my estimation. I \nknow Bill Daley feels the same.\n  His background in business, in banking, in the practice of law, and \nin public policy, make him uniquely qualified to come to this job in \nthe Department of Commerce and to serve his Nation well. I am happy to \nstand today in support of this nomination. I hope that this body will \njoin me in giving a solid vote of support to the designation of Bill \nDaley as our new Secretary of Commerce.\n  I thank the Senator from South Carolina for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, Michael Jordan makes his money in \nChicago, but he spends it in South Carolina. We welcome him down there \nregularly. I think he is a property owner by now in Hilton Head. I will \ncheck it out, because that would be one of the few votes I could get on \nHilton Head.\n  Mr. President, the appointment of William Daley to head the \nDepartment of Commerce comes at a critical juncture in our history. We \nhave emerged triumphant from our long struggle against the forces of \ntyranny and totalitarianism. Our victory in the cold war was secured \nthrough the commitment and sacrifice of the American people, who \nwillingly subordinated their economic interests to sustain the alliance \nagainst Soviet expansionism. It was access to the rich American market \nthat enabled our allies to rise from the ashes and rebuild their \neconomies. For four decades the American market absorbed the world's \nexports while our exporters confronted closed markets abroad. Our \ngenerosity has taken a tremendous toll on the American economy. For the \npast 20 years wages for the American worker have remained stagnant. The \naverage American now earns 20 percent less today than he or she earned \n20 years ago. The toll has been most devastating in the manufacturing \nsector. Manufacturing now accounts for a mere thirteen percent of our \nGNP, half that of Germany or Japan. The most terrible price that we \npaid was the loss of 2 million manufacturing jobs, which were the \nbackbone of the American economy.\n  Having triumphed abroad it is now time to rebuild at home. Restoring \nthe promise of America and rebuilding our economy will require the same \ncommitment and sacrifice that won the cold war. The Commerce Department \nshould be at the forefront of this effort. There are some, who in the \nname of budget discipline, call for the Department's elimination. In an \nera in which economic and national security are synonymous, eliminating \nthe Commerce Department would be tantamount to unilateral disarmament. \nThe budget will not be balanced by political gimmicks and symbolic \ngestures. Abolishing the Commerce Department will not make a dent in \nbalancing the budget; what it will do is put us at a competitive \ndisadvantage in the global economy.\n  In today's new world economy American firms and American workers \ncompete against foreign companies whose governments are allies of \nbusiness, not adversaries. Where once we stood at the apex of the world \neconomy, now no industry in America is immune from this intense foreign \ncompetition.\n  In market after market, industry after industry, U.S. companies \ncompete against foreign companies that are the beneficiaries of \nstrategic alliances with powerful ministries of trade and industry. \nThose who believe that government has no role in supporting industry \nand American workers seek to rewrite history and ignore the realities \nof the new international competition. In the new global economy, the \nline between public sector and private sector is at times indistinct.\n\n  Our competitors nurture industrial development through rigged capital \nmarkets, generous subsidies, infant industry protection, and favorable \nexport incentives. The invisible hand of the free market did not \ndevelop Korea's world class semiconductor industry. Instead it was the \niron fist of decrees laid down by Korea's Ministry of Trade, which kept \nout foreign competition unless they licensed technology to Korean \ncompanies. The iron fist was complemented by the largesse of Korea's \nFinance Ministry which provided low interest loans to foster the \ndevelopment of its industries.\n  The invisible hand of the market did not create Airbus, nor does it \nguide the development of the faster growing economies in the Pacific \nrim, which are following the Japanese model of development. The irony \nis that the market alone was not responsible for the development of our \nown industrial\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\nbase. From Alexander Hamilton's ``Report on Manufactures,'' to the \nrevolution in information technology initiated through research \nconducted by the Department of Defense, our economic strength has been \nfortified by a symbiotic relationship between government and the \nprivate sector.\n  The strong Commerce Department is an essential prerequisite for \ncompeting in the global economy. The Commerce Department, through its \ntechnology administration, plays a crucial role in developing the \ncritical technologies of the future. Although the National Institute \nfor Standards and Technology [NIST] accounts for only 1 percent of the \nU.S. research and development budget--it is the principal program \ndedicated to fostering critical technologies that have a commercial \napplication. U.S. companies face great pressure to deliver short run \nreturns for the fund managers who dominate America's capital markets. \nAs the Wall Street Journal noted, ``the biggest U.S. companies have cut \nback sharply on research into `basic science' to pursue short term \ngoals * * *.'' This alarming trend did not go unnoticed by the Council \non Competitiveness, which noted, ``Long-term investments rates as a \npercentage of GDP are falling just when Asian and European competitors \nare ramping up their R programs.'' This is why it is crucial that we \nmaintain our Advanced Technology Program. It enables industry and \ngovernment to join forces in carrying out broad-based, long-term, peer-\nreviewed projects that could have large payoffs down the road. \nEliminating the Government's role in technological development will \nconsign our economy to second-rate status. Furthermore, it would allow \nAsians and Europeans to dominate the emerging technologies which will \ncreate the jobs of the future.\n  Not only does the Commerce Department play a critical role in \nfostering technology, it plays an equally important role in protecting \nU.S. industries from the predatory trade practices that have crippled \nmany of our domestic industries. Vigorous enforcement of our \nantidumping laws is crucial to maintaining our standard of living. Far \ntoo often our competitors have hidden behind a citadel of protection in \ntheir home markets while simultaneously flooding our economy with \nillegally dumped products. A Commerce Department that aggressively \nenforces our trade laws will enable U.S. companies to sustain their \ninvestment in strategic technologies and keep jobs at home.\n  Strengthening the Commerce Department will require a strong \nSecretary. Bill Daley fits that description. He has been both a civic \nleader and a business leader. Those of us who opposed NAFTA know him as \na worthy adversary, a man who gets things done. More important, Bill \nDaley is a man who understands what a privilege and an honor it is to \nbe a public servant. While it may be fashionable in some quarters to \ndenigrate public servants, this nominee knows how effective government \ncan change people's lives for the better.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to confirm this excellent appointment.\n  Mr. President, let me emphasize once again the point made by both our \ndistinguished chairman and distinguished colleague, Senator Durbin. The \nCommerce Department has got to be in this front line now of rebuilding \nour economic strength--a very, very important division within the \nDepartment, foreign commercial services, the International Trade \nAdministration. The consensus, I should emphasize to my friends, that \nwhile we are spending some $600 million, in a couple of years that \nbudget that is getting ready for the next millennium that everyone is \ntalking about, that budget will jump to $1.5 billion. I can see some \nsaying, ``Heavens above, this is a runaway Department.'' But these \nendeavors cost, and we want to make sure that they do a credible job, \nas they have been doing, in my opinion.\n  We have the very strong divisions in there with respect to the \nEconomic Development Administration that has worked extremely well over \nthe years now, and the Department has a group of the best professionals \nwith respect to this global competition. When the special trade \nrepresentative, when the State Department and others come and try to \nlearn the facts, it is our Department of Commerce that furnishes the \nweaponry, so to speak, the statistics, the findings, and everything \nelse as to exactly where we are and how well we are doing to give them \ncredibility in their negotiations.\n  So, to have the brilliance of Bill Daley of Chicago come to head up \nthe Department, the conscientious nature that he has already displayed \nwith respect to taking over these duties is heartening to this \nparticular Senator, and I am delighted to be with our distinguished \nchairman in endorsing his nomination.\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to \nspeak on behalf of the nomination of William M. Daley to be the \nSecretary of Commerce. At the outset, I want to congratulate the \nPresident for selecting Bill Daley. I do not believe he could have made \na better choice to lead the Department of Commerce into the new \ncentury.\n  The Department of Commerce has a long and distinguished history, but \nit is a department that sometimes seems to lack focus. Its mission \nincludes things as diverse forecasting the weather, handling patents \nand trademarks, conducting the census, travel and tourism, and \ninternational trade. What brings all of these diverse subjects together \nhowever, is one overriding mission: assisting Americans in enhancing \nthe competitiveness of the United States in the world economy. The \nDepartment of Commerce does not control the competitiveness of our \neconomy, but its work opens up competitive opportunities for the \nprivate sector, and helps the private sector obtain the information it \nneeds to realize its competitive potential.\n  The Department's mission goes beyond the dry names of its \nsubagencies. It is part of the foundation of our economy. It helps open \ndoors abroad for U.S. exporters. It helps us know where we stand, and \nwhere we might be going. It gives us the kind of data that helps both \nAmerican business and American workers achieve a brighter, more \nprosperous future. It is an advocate for economic growth, and helps \nbuild the kind of broader, stronger trade links on which our future \neconomic success in no small part depends.\n  Bill Daley has the background, the talent, the integrity, the energy, \nand the determination to ensure that the Commerce Department reaches \nits full potential as an asset for U.S. economic growth. He is the \nideal person to build on the great work done by Mickey Kantor and the \nlate Ron Brown.\n  His past accomplishments demonstrate what he will be able to achieve \nas Secretary. He is a real leader, both in Illinois and nationally. He \nhas a strong record in the private sector, and an equally strong record \nin public and civic affairs. His resume is a distinguished one. It \nincludes serving as:\n  President and chief operating officer of the Amalgamated Bank of \nChicago;\n  Special counsel to the President for the North American Free-Trade \nAgreement in the fall of 1993, helping President Clinton achieve \npassage of that major trade agreement;\n  A senior partner at one of Chicago's most prestigious law firms, \nMayer, Brown & Platt; and\n  Cochair of Chicago 96, the nonpartisan, not for profit host committee \nthat so successfully oversaw the city and community planning for the \n1996 Democratic Convention in Chicago.\n  Bill Daley was born and raised in Illinois, and he was also educated \nin Illinois. His undergraduate degree is from Loyola University in \nChicago, and he holds a L.L.B. from the John Marshall Law School in \nChicago.\n  If I may be permitted a moment of regional chauvinism, I will say \nthat Bill Daley has all the Midwestern virtues. He has an uncommon \namount of common sense, he is an extremely hard worker, he is \nunpretentious, his life exemplifies the kind of family values we talk \nabout so much here in Washington; and he is always focused on getting \nthe job done. He is a skilled lawyer, an extraordinary negotiator, and \nan executive of rare ability. He has the kind of good judgment that \nmakes him a person who is always being called on for help, and he has \nnever failed to provide that help. And while most of his career has \nbeen in the private sector, he has unstintingly given of his time to \npublic and charitable causes. Like his brothers, and his father before \nhim, he has a real commitment to public and community service. Like all \nof the\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\nother members of his family, he is deeply patriotic, and dedicated to \ndoing everything he can to help all of our people and every part of our \ncountry build an ever-brighter, ever-more prosperous future.\n  Bill Daley has the talent to manage a large, diverse organization \nlike the Department of Commerce, and he is the kind of person that will \nmake the Department run more efficiently and effectively. He \nunderstands business, and he knows how important it is for the United \nStates to compete successfully in the world economy.\n  This is a time of enormous change, not just in our economy, but also \nin the Commerce Department. I cannot think of a person better suited to \nmaking the necessary reforms so that the Commerce Department can \nsuccessfully meet the challenges of the new century that will soon be \nupon us. I know he will make a first-rate Secretary of Commerce, and I \nstrongly recommend that the Senate act expeditiously and favorably on \nhis nomination.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nconfirmation of Mr. William Daley as the next Secretary of Commerce.\n  I am glad to learn that Mr. Daley recognizes the need to streamline \nthe Commerce Department and that he is willing to perform a top to \nbottom review of its agencies and programs to ensure productivity and \nefficiency. In addition, I am hopeful that Mr. Daley will address the \nnumerous concerns which have hampered this Department's effectiveness \nin the recent past and that he will strive to restore the Department's \ngood reputation.\n  As we enter into the 21st century, America must make new strides to \nensure its strong standing in the ever growing global economy. We must \ncontinue to further our ties with foreign nations and businesses so \nthat our economy will continue to be the engine that drives the world's \nprosperity.\n  Although our economy continues to grow yearly, I believe we should be \nconcerned with how slow that rate of growth has been. Small businesses \nare the backbone of our national economy and I am hopeful that Mr. \nDaley will focus more attention on promoting the role of small business \nin foreign trade. With only 12 percent of our small businesses \nparticipating in foreign markets, I believe we have to focus more \nattention and resources to promoting their interests worldwide.\n  As it did with NAFTA and GATT, we need the Commerce Department to \ncontinue to open new markets. Additionally, the Department of Commerce \nmust ensure that our trade partners comply with the promises set forth \nin all such agreements. As competition around the world becomes \nstronger by the day, the Department of Commerce, under its new \nSecretary, must strive to guarantee a level playing field to ensure the \neconomic future of the American people.\n  With nearly one-fourth of our gross domestic product resulting from \nexports and with more than 11 million workers owing their jobs to their \nemployer's overseas business, Mr. Daley's work as Secretary of Commerce \nwill be felt nationwide.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, it is with regret that I announce that \ntoday I will be voting in opposition to the nomination of William M. \nDaley to the position of the Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nCommerce. While Mr. Daley's character and his distinguished career in \npublic service demonstrate that he has the qualifications for the \nposition to which he has been nominated, these qualifications are \nnecessary, but in and of themselves, not sufficient to merit my vote.\n  My chief concerns regarding Mr. Daley's suitability for the position \nreflect: First, questions over his willingness and commitment to deal \nwith corporate welfare in the agency; and second, his commitment to \nengage in the fundamental overhaul of a Department whose management \npractices and many missions have been called into question by numerous \nreports by the Department's inspector general and by the General \nAccounting Office.\n  Corporate welfare has no place in this Government today. Mr. Daley \ngenerally agrees we should not have corporate welfare in the Federal \nGovernment. However, he disagrees with the appropriate definition of \ncorporate welfare. I asked repeatedly for a specific commitment from \nhim to study whether corporate welfare was being doled out by the \nagency. He was unwilling to do so, although he made a similar \ncommitment with respect to the issue of foreign trips conducted by the \nagency.\n  My second concern is the redundancies at the Department of Commerce. \nAccording to a recent GAO study the Department of Commerce functions \nare duplicated 71 times throughout the Federal Government. I discussed \nthis problem with Mr. Daley during the hearing. He stated that he would \nconsider the issue, but made no specific commitments as to when he \nwould address the issue nor in what quantity. He would not commit to \nreport to Congress within 6 months or 1 year on these known \nredundancies nor would he commit to cutting back the number of \nredundancies by a minimum of even 10 percent. He did make such specific \ncommitments regarding political appointees, which he agreed to reduce \nby 100.\n  Because Mr. Daley has refused to make specific commitments to address \nthese problems I do not support his nomination. The next Secretary of \nCommerce should be someone who recognizes the seriousness of these \nproblems, and who is committed to addressing them.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate William \nDaley on his nomination to be Commerce Secretary of the United States. \nI believe his lifelong experience in the private sector and strong \nrecord of public service will provide him with an extraordinary range \nof skills that make him unquestionably qualified for this position.\n  First, he will bring a business perspective to the Department of \nCommerce. From the insurance industry, to a law practice that \nspecialized in international trade, to serving as president of the \nAmalgamated Bank, William Daley understands the needs of the private \nsector.\n  As a special counsel to President Clinton during the debate over the \nNorth American Free-Trade Agreement, he also demonstrated an ability to \nwork with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and was instrumental in \nsecuring its congressional approval.\n  And finally, William Daley believes in the responsibility of the \nDepartment of Commerce to enhance the competitiveness of American \ncompanies in the global marketplace. He knows that our economy cannot \ngrow without the strength of new ideas and a lasting commitment to the \nrisk takers who develop them.\n  As a successful businessman and a dedicated public servant, I am \nconfident that William Daley will build on the legacy of Mickey Kantor \nand the late Ron Brown, whose tireless efforts created countless new \nopportunities for American companies around the world.\n  As Commerce Secretary, William Daley will be an energetic promoter of \nour business interests, a skilled negotiator in opening new markets, \nand a visionary who believes in the value of researching and developing \nnew products and ideas.\n  I look forward to working with him in advancing the interests of the \nAmerican business community in the years ahead.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support Bill Daley to be \nthe next Secretary of Commerce. In his appearance before the Senate \nCommerce Committee, Mr. Daley impressed me and other members with his \nenergy, his enthusiasm, and his firm grasp of the challenges faced by \nAmerican companies attempting to compete in the world marketplace. In \nmy view, Mr. Daley demonstrated that he possesses the qualities, \nenergy, and instincts necessary to be a successful Secretary, and to \nlead the Commerce Department into the 21st century.\n  We all regret that, in recent years, the Department of Commerce has \nbecome the target of a great deal of criticism. Though some of this \ncriticism may be warranted, in my view most of the criticism is not \naimed at creating a better or more efficient Department but instead is \nan attempt to sacrifice valuable and important Federal activities for \nshort-term ideological and partisan gain. Nevertheless, I applaud Mr. \nDaley for his forthright acknowledgment of the criticism and his \ncommitment to address several of the concerns raised. His pledge to \nreview the process\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\nby which persons are selected to accompany Department officials on \ntrade missions abroad and his promise to reduce the number of political \nappointees at the Department are a strong testament of the sincerity of \nMr. Daley's commitment.\n  From conversations with leaders of the Massachusetts business \ncommunity, and especially with those who run the small businesses that \nare the engines of economic growth in my State, there is broad support \nfor the functions performed by the Commerce Department, and there is \nnear unanimous agreement that the U.S. Government must aggressively \nassist U.S. companies attempting to develop and utilize new \ntechnologies, and enter new markets overseas. Small and emerging \ncompanies in Massachusetts have benefited greatly from several Commerce \nprograms. The Advanced Technology Program and the Manufacturing \nExtension Service are both excellent examples of government making \nsmart investments in emerging companies. The evidence for both of these \nprograms demonstrates that each dollar invested generates many more in \nreturn. The same is true for the programs administered by the Trade \nPromotion Coordinating Committee and the U.S. Foreign Commercial \nService. The one-stop-shop trade center in Boston has helped hundreds \nof New England companies develop and expand markets overseas. Finally, \nthe Economic Development Administration remains one of the few \nresources that cities can call on for capital planning or capital \nproject assistance that will boost their economies and create jobs. For \nthis reason, the EDA must be maintained and strengthened.\n  A vital but not-as-well-known arm of the Commerce Department is the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. I consider NOAA to be \none of the Federal Government's premier scientific research and \nresource management agencies, with responsibility for the stewardship \nof our marine resources, management of our coastal zone, and operation \nof the National Weather Service, environmental satellite systems and a \nfleet of oceanographic research vessels. These oceanic and atmospheric \nprograms are a critical component in the integrated effort to study and \nmaintain the Earth's ecosystem.\n  Other Commerce agencies, such as the National Institute of Standards, \nthe Census Bureau, and the Patent and Trademark Office perform missions \nthat are necessary to our economic and governmental functioning. In my \nview, the Commerce Department is in a unique position with \nresponsibility for trade, technology, and environmental matters, and \nthis presents Mr. Daley with a special opportunity: to successfully \nintegrate U.S. policy on economic and environmental issues. After \nfollowing his impressive career and after carefully listening to his \nrecent testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee, I have every \nconfidence that Mr. Daley understands and appreciates this unique \nmission. I support his confirmation, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am delighted that the Senate will give \nits approval today to the nomination of William M. Daley to be \nSecretary of Commerce.\n  Mr. Daley is with the Chicago, IL, law firm of Mayer, Brown & Platt. \nHe previously served as the president and chief operating officer of \nAmalgamated Bank of Chicago, and as special counsel to the President \nfor the North American Free-Trade Agreement. I believe Mr. Daley's \nbackground and experiences will be of tremendous benefit to America's \nbusinesses as they navigate their way through the global economic \nmarketplace in which they now operate.\n  It is particularly important to my home State of California that the \nDepartment of Commerce have a strong and effective leader. Bill Daley \nwill be such a leader.\n  California is the Nation's leading exporter. Last year, California \naccounted for 16 percent--$90 billion--of the Nation's exports, an \nincrease of almost $14 billion over the 1994 levels. This tremendous \namount of exports supported approximately 1 million Californian jobs. \nFrom the period 1987 to 1995, California realized the largest dollar \ngrowth in merchandise exports--$59.1 billion--of any State. As a member \nof the International Finance Subcommittee, I look forward to working \nwith Secretary Daley on the issue of exports and on a host of other \nissues of importance to the businesses in my home State of California.\n  In addition to the issues facing California businesses, there are \nalso many significant and important issues, and challenges, facing our \nNation as a whole as we move forward into the 21st century and begin to \nshift from an industrial base to a technological base in an information \nsociety. Bill Daley has the know-how, vision, and leadership necessary \nto effectively guide us across the bridge into the 21st century.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is the wish of the majority leader that \nwe not vote until 10 o'clock. I do not have a lot of additional \ncomments to make about the nominee that I did not already make.\n  I appreciate the overall broad bipartisan support that has been given \nthis nominee. I think he appreciates it as well. Because of the \nimportance of working on these issues on a nonpartisan basis, the issue \nthat Senator Durbin and Senator Hollings raise about trade are \naccurate.\n  I point out to my colleagues, yes, the Department of Commerce and \nSecretary of Commerce has a very important role to play in the conduct \nof trade and fostering relations and helping U.S. businesses compete \nabroad, and I also appreciate the Senator from Illinois' comments about \nthe new kind of war we are in. But the problem has been, I point out, \nthat there has been a lack of coordination and coherence to the conduct \nof these policies, where on the one hand we send our human rights \nsecretary from the State Department, who bashes this particular \ncountry, in this one case, China, on human rights violations; and then \nour Secretary of Defense goes over, a very close and warm relationship \nwith their military establishment--who, also, by the way, run many of \nthese companies and corporations in China; and then our Commerce \nSecretary goes over and has an entirely different environment.\n  I think the President of the United States understands better, but \nnot completely, the absolute requirement that if we are going to have a \ncoherent foreign policy, which is probably the most important, single, \nfundamental conduct of foreign and trade policy, then we all have to \nhave a coordinated effort, led by the President of the United States. \nYes, human rights plays an important role in our relations with foreign \ncountries; yes, in the furtherance of the United States' national \nsecurity interests; yes, providing access and an equal playing field \nfor U.S. companies and corporations to compete, especially in emerging \nnation markets, is important, but there cannot be discordant voices and \ndisjointed messages to these people, otherwise they become confused and \nsometimes enraged, because you cannot tell the rulers of China, ``By \nthe way, I have no relationship whatever.''\n  On one occasion they were told by our State Department that the \nPresident of Taiwan would not visit the United States of America. Two \nweeks later it was announced that the President of Taiwan was being \ngiven a visa to visit the United States of America.\n  Now, I could argue both sides of that position, but I cannot argue \nfor that methodology. There is no excuse for that kind of methodology. \nYou either say and make sure that the President of Taiwan visits the \nUnited States or you say that he will not--one of the two. But \nespecially when we are talking about the power shift that is going on \nright now, a transition, with the leader who has taken longer to die \nthan the Ayatollah Khomeini, and emerging, if not aggressive, certainly \nassertive behavior in the region, trade has an important role. But it \nhas got to be part of an overall foreign policy. That has been and will \nbe my major criticism of this administration's conduct of foreign \npolicy.\n  I am pleased to say from my conversations with Secretary Daley that \nhe understands that. He understands how important it is to coordinate \nhis efforts with those of the President, the Secretary of State, the \nNational Security Adviser and others so we can shape a far more \neffective foreign policy, which at the end of the day will help us \nimmeasurably in our efforts in increasing trade than some of the kinds \nof modus operandi we have seen in the\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\npast. I am convinced our nominee has that understanding and that \ncommitment.\n\n  I was interested and appreciated my dear friend's, Senator Hollings, \ncomments about Mr. Daley's efforts on behalf of NAFTA. I do believe \nthat Mr. Daley did a very effective and important job in that effort. I \nknow that both my colleagues here on the floor were aware of his effort \nat that particular point, showing his ability to work with the Congress \nof the United States on both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the problem of China is most \nfrustrating. I guess the question is, how best do we extend freedom and \nindividual rights in a country of that kind? It is very difficult for a \nnation with a 220-year history to tell a culture and nation of 3,000 to \n5,000 years of age what to do and how to do it, particularly a country, \nMr. President, of 1.2 billion.\n  If you have ever dealt with China, you understand immediately that \nhuman rights begins, first, with hunger. That is the first human right \nin the People's Republic. They have to feed 1.2 billion. The second \nhuman right is that of housing. The third human right is perhaps \neducation. The fourth human right is ours--one man, one vote. If you \nstart off on the other end of the spectrum, one man, one vote, you have \nchaos. I say that advisedly.\n  I wish I had the time as a southern Governor, because I stand with \npride--no life was lost, no one was hurt during my 4 years. I \nintegrated, as the distinguished president pro tempore's alma mater, \nClemson University, in a peaceful fashion. We have a track record. We \nknow how you have to handle crowds and make sure no one is hurt.\n  That approach to China with respect to commercialization and \ncapitalization, I think, is going to be better than confrontation. It \nis good to come and say we will not trade with you unless you do A, B, \nand C; however, the others are going to trade with them. It is a \nnonstarter. It just will not work. The Germans, the French, and the \nJapanese are in there like gangbusters, and we cannot use that \nparticular tool.\n  The bottom line, you can look at democratic India and its approach \nand you can look at the People's Republic and you may reason that \nperhaps the People's Republic approach will extend more housing, more \nfeeding, more education in the next 10 or 20 years than the democratic \nIndia. It is going to be interesting to follow.\n  But mind you me, China is there. They feel very strongly with respect \nto Taiwan, to Hong Kong and those possessions that have been taken from \nthem, and their stand has been recognized by us in our foreign policy. \nWe have to be more realistic in its treatment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask for the yeas and nays on the nomination of William \nDaley as Secretary of Commerce.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith). The question is, Will the Senate \nadvise and consent to the nomination of Andrew M. Cuomo, of New York, \nto be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development?

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, there \nwill be no further rollcall votes this week. The Senate is expected to \nbe in session into the afternoon for Senators to introduce legislation \nand to make statements. We have had indications that there are some \nSenators who intend to do that.\n  The Senate may also be asked to clear a few routine Legislative and \nExecutive Calendar items. We do have a few we think we will be able to \nget cleared and complete those this afternoon.\n  Following the conclusion of today's session, it is anticipated that \nthe Senate will be in recess tomorrow and a pro forma session on \nMonday.\n  It is my understanding the Judiciary Committee will order reported \ntoday from their committee the constitutional amendment with respect to \na balanced budget. Allowing for the 3-day requirement for minority \nmembers to submit their minority views, it is then expected the \nJudiciary Committee would be able to report the constitutional \namendment to the Senate on Monday. If that is the case, and the report \ncould be available by late afternoon on Monday, it would be my \nintention to turn to the constitutional amendment with respect to a \nbalanced budget on Wednesday, February 5.\n  I remind my colleagues, we will have the State of the Union Address \nby the President on Tuesday night, the 4th, and we expect to receive \nthe President's budget submission on Thursday, February 6. So next week \nwill be eventful.\n  We will continue to work to clear nominations just from getting \nreports from various committees. It looks to me like there could be a \nminimum of two or three more Presidential nominations--I think all of \nthem are Cabinet level--that may be available next week. We will try to \nwork those into the schedule as soon as they are available, presumably \nWednesday and Thursday, on those nominations and confirmations.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to brief the Senate on an issue \nthat is gaining steam in my home State of California, because, if it is \nresolved, it will result in about $80 million going directly into the \nschool system in California to help the children there.\n  This issue involves the underestimation by oil companies of royalties \nthat they owe the Federal Government from crude oil that they have \npumped. They have underestimated these royalties and have been sent a \nbill by the Department of the Interior, and they have not yet paid.\n  At this point the amount owed is $385 million. We expect it will go \nup to $440 million.\n  Ten oil companies, the largest one being Shell, have been sent their \nbills. Shell Oil's bill is over $100 million. Those funds will go to \nthe U.S. Treasury, and then a portion of those funds will go to the \nStates in which the oil was pumped. California is the place where most \nof that oil comes from; and California will get between $75 and $80 \nmillion from the Federal Government when those funds are collected.\n  In California we have a law that the royalties all go to the State \nSchools Fund. I really hate to see years of protracted litigation, Mr. \nPresident, on this matter.\n  The oil companies are not cooperating. Many of them have refused the \nsubpoenas. They are disregarding the subpoenas sent to them. The \nJustice Department is now involved. I hope that instead of being \ndeadbeat oil companies, they will pay up. If they feel they have a case \nthat the bills are too high, they can fight that out. They can try to \nsettle it. But they should at least cooperate and begin paying some of \nwhat is owed.\n  Mr. President, I can tell you, the $75 to $80 million to California \nschools would mean that we could hire an additional 1,000 teachers or \nbuy 40,000 computers. The children deserve that.\n  For Orange County alone the underpayments total more than $5 million; \nfor Los Angeles, $18 million; for San Diego, $5 million; for Fresno, \n$2.25 million.\n  So I appeal to these oil companies, do right for our children, pay \nwhat you owe. Be good citizens, cooperate in this investigation, make \nsome payments, work with us so that our children can get a better \neducation.\n  I hope the people of this country will write to the CEO of Shell, \nwill write to the CEO of Oryx, of Marathon, of Mobil and tell those \nCEO's that we are all in this together and that when an individual \nfamily gets a bill, when they do not pay it, they cannot stall, they \ncannot afford to hire lawyers. If, in fact, the individual says, \n``Well, I paid it,'' you know what you would do as a family member; you \nwould say, ``Here's my canceled check. I've paid this,'' or, ``Come and \nlook at this. This is a mistake.''\n  That is not what these oil companies are doing. Three of them \ncomplied with the subpoenas, but five are fighting them. So I feel, Mr. \nPresident, this is an issue that deserves attention.\n  I am very pleased that Cynthia Quarterman, the Director of the \nMineral Management Services, and Bob Armstrong are working on this \ncase. They are going forward to collect these sums.

While I am waiting for \nhim, for at least a moment I want to talk about another subject. I want \nto say a little bit about the balanced budget amendment to the \nConstitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S830-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S830]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I understand that our colleagues today on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle are offering in the Judiciary \nCommittee an amendment that says that, if we require the Federal \nGovernment to live on a budget, if we fulfill the constitutional \nrequirement that Thomas Jefferson thought necessary when he first saw \nthe document upon returning from France, we ought to set up a system \nwhere we count the Social Security trust fund while it is in surplus \nbetween now and the year 2002 as part of the accounting system of the \nGovernment but that after 2002 we not count it as part of the budget of \nthe Federal Government.\n  What our colleagues would have us do is to make it easy now to spend \nmoney but that when the Social Security system begins to move into the \nred, to not count that deficit as part of the deficit of the Federal \nGovernment. If we are going to balance the Federal budget, if we are \ngoing to guarantee the future of Social Security and Medicare and of \nGovernment services that our people need and deserve, we are going to \nhave to control spending. We cannot balance the budget by simply \nexempting the largest program of the Federal Government from the \nbudget. And the idea of saying that in the future, when Social Security \nis running huge deficits, it will not count as part of the budget, it \nseems to me, is not only shameless but is typical of an era where our \nown President in this year's budget is proposing that we take the \nsingle fastest growing item in Medicare, home health care, that we take \nit out of the Medicare trust fund in order to make the books look \nbetter. I do not think you have to have much imagination to understand \nthat, if you do not count the deficit of Social Security in the future, \nnot only will we have no incentive to control that deficit and make the \nsystem solvent but more and more Government functions will be shifted \nover into the part that does not count for a balanced budget amendment.\n  So I think we all know what the game is here. The game is we have a \nlot of people who promised in the election that they would vote for a \nconstitutional amendment to force Congress and the President to balance \nthe budget and now we are seeing gamesmanship where they say, ``Well, I \nwould vote for it but only if the largest spending program of the \nFederal Government were excluded and only if we could use the benefit \nfrom the surplus now, and only if we do not have to make up the deficit \nlater.'' Have our Democratic colleagues who have offered this proposal \nno shame?\n  We have a choice as to whether we are going to change America. If you \nwant to change America, you are for the balanced budget amendment to \nthe Constitution and you are for a balanced budget where every program \ncounts, where every program is important, where the Federal Government \nis forced to pay its bills.\n  How many families would like to be required to balance their budget \nwithout counting their mortgage payment or without counting the cost of \ntheir new car? I believe we make a mockery of the process.\n  I look forward to the day when we are going to stand up on the floor \nof the U.S. Senate and we are going to say yes or no. As we look back \nat the campaign literature of some of the very people who are now \nundecided and we look at what they said about being for a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution, what we are going to really test \nis, does our word count for anything? When we tell people we are for \nsomething and they vote for us and send us here to do it, will we do \nit, or will we engage in gimmicks to try to confuse the people and try \nto cover what is little more than going back on our word?\n\n  Madam President, I look forward to having my name down as one who is \nfor the balanced budget amendment to the Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S830-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S831-S832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\n\n\n                  VOTING RIGHTS OF MILITARY PERSONNEL\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, let me now turn to the subject that I \ncame to the floor to speak on. Our colleague from Alabama will be here \nlater. Let me explain, if I may, this problem and where we are in the \ndiscussion and why this is a very important issue for all 100 Members \nof the Senate and for all 260 million Americans.\n  We have an all-volunteer military force. We ask young men and women, \nin putting on the uniform of this country, to serve all over the world \nfar away from home in lonely places. We ask them to defend our freedom \nand independence and our interests. We sometimes call upon them to give \ntheir lives in the service of our country. I am not aware that ever \nbefore in the history of America has there been any serious challenge, \nup until the case I am about to talk about, of the right of our \nmilitary personnel to vote.\n  My dad was a sergeant in the Army; a career soldier. Like many people \nin the military, my dad decided where he wanted to declare as his legal \nresidence. Millions of people wearing the uniform of the country over \nthe history of our country since they serve all over the world tend to \npick an area as their legal residence with the objective of coming back \nthere to live when they get out of the service, or at least to have a \nplace-holder as their identity with the very country they serve.\n  We have a case now before the Federal court in my home State of Texas \nin Val Verde County, Del Rio, which is the county where Laughlin Air \nForce Base is located, where we have the Texas Rural Legal Aid, which \nis predominantly funded by the Federal taxpayer. They, in clear \nviolation of the law based on the provisions of the appropriations bill \nwhich we passed on the floor of the Senate last year which prohibited \nthem from engaging in lawsuits related to political activity, have \nfiled a lawsuit challenging the right of military personnel who are \nregistered to vote in Val Verde County but who are not currently \nresiding in the county during their military service to have their \nvotes counted. Interestingly enough, they say, ``Oh, you have a right \nto vote for President. You have a right to vote for Senate or Congress. \nBut you do not have a right to vote in county elections.''\n\n  This is the first time that I am aware of that this challenge has \never been made. The challenge is based on the Voting Rights Act, \ninterestingly enough, because the argument is made that the roughly 800 \nmilitary absentee ballots were cast by predominantly white voters and \nthat the makeup of the general electorate was majority Hispanic and \ntherefore there has been a violation of the Voting Rights Act by the \nfact that these absentee ballots have diluted minority voting strength.\n  I am not here today to testify what the racial makeup is of the \nelectorate in Val Verde County. I do not know the exact numbers. I do \nnot have any idea what the racial makeup is of the 800 absentee \nballots. But the issue is, Do our warriors have a right to vote? Do \nthose who protect our freedom have the basic guarantee of exercising \nthat freedom?\n  As a result, according to the claimants in this lawsuit, of these 800 \nabsentee ballots, 2 Republicans were elected. Their argument is that if \nyou do not count these 800 absentee ballots from military personnel, 2 \nDemocrats would have been elected.\n  Let me say, Madam President, I do not know that is the case, and that \nis not really the issue here. The issue here is the right of people to \nvote.\n  Let me, before going further, say that when the Legal Services \nCorporation was notified that Texas Rural Legal Aid, their grantee in \nTexas, had violated the law, they asked Texas Rural Legal Aid to give \nthem an explanation by a certain deadline. They then asked Texas Rural \nLegal Aid to cease and desist. What Texas Rural Legal Aid has done, \nhaving done all of the workup for the case, is they have now moved to \nthe position of being expert witnesses. This is clearly violating the \nintent of Congress. I want to put my colleagues on notice that God did \nnot decree that appropriations bills have to pass, and we are going to \naddress this issue in the upcoming Commerce-State-Justice \nappropriations bill. And unless we can get satisfaction that the Legal \nServices Corporation is going to abide by the law, those who are ready \nto pass that bill without those guarantees better be ready to get 60 \nvotes.\n  Let me turn to the point I wanted to make today. I discovered \nyesterday that the Legal Services Corporation through their grantee, \nTexas Rural Legal Aid, Inc., sent out a questionnaire to 800 American \nwarriors stationed all over the world, and it has this big official \nheading of ``In the United States District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Texas,'' and then it has all of this legalese. Then it has \na questionnaire that in single space form is 23 pages long encompassing \n54 comprehensive questions, many with multiple parts, and someone has \nto fill it out and they have to get it notarized where they are \nswearing under oath.\n  I would like to give you an indication from this questionnaire of the \nkind of things that are being asked, and I have up here a blowup of one \nlittle part of question 21. Imagine, you are in Berlin or you are in \nKorea. You have a job to do there. You are manning a Patriot battery in \nKorea. Your family is at home. And you get a document 23 pages long \ntelling you that you have 3 days to fill it out.\n  Just look at these questions. These are the people who exercised \ntheir right to vote, something we encourage people to do. So this \nwarrior is in South Korea defending the frontiers of freedom and they \nget this questionnaire. And this is just one section of one of the 50-\nodd questions:\n\n       What is the complete address of the place where your spouse \n     lived on November 5, 1996? If it is located outside the \n     territorial limits of the United States please also indicate \n     the last place your spouse resided which was in the \n     territorial limits of the United States.\n       Did your spouse usually sleep there at night? Yes. No. If \n     no, what is the address where your spouse sleeps at night?\n       Approximately how long (expressed in months, days, and \n     years) has your spouse slept at this address?\n       If your spouse did not then or does not now usually sleep \n     at this address explain the reason(s) your spouse does not do \n     so.\n\n  Is there no shame? Is there no shame? The Federal judge who approved \nthis questionnaire ought to be embarrassed--ought to be embarrassed. It \nis outrageous that taxpayer money was used to send out a questionnaire \nto our warriors who are out defending freedom all over the world asking \nthem because they dared to vote where their husband or wife sleeps at \nnight. Madam President, this is absolutely outrageous.\n  We will shortly have a letter signed by the majority of the Members \nof the Senate urging our Attorney General to enter this case. We are \ndealing with two local candidates. I do not have any real knowledge of \neither one of them. I do not know what kind of attorney they have. I do \nnot know how good a job they are doing presenting their case. But it \nseems to me that this is a fundamental issue: do people who wear the \nuniform of this country have a right to vote in the location that they \ncan choose as their legal residence?\n  I obviously believe they do. It turns our whole political system on \nits head. To suggest that someone who has chosen Val Verde County as \ntheir legal residence while they are serving in the Air Force all \naround the world has less right to vote there because their race may be \ndifferent from the race that someone claims to make up the population \nof that region is clearly outrageous, is a national issue of profound \nimportance. I want the Attorney General of the United States of America \nto enter this case and defend the rights of our warriors to vote. And \nif they are voting and elected one candidate and defeated another, is \nthat not what votes are about? Do we not each cast our vote believing \nthat it might make a difference?\n  Madam President, I do not know whether or not it made any difference. \nI do not know the racial makeup of the 800 people who voted absentee \nwho are in the Air Force, who have claimed Val Verde as their legal \nresidence. I do not know how that changes the makeup of the electorate \nor racial basis, and I do not care. Our society is too preoccupied with \nrace. The whole reason that this is before a Federal judge is that race \nis being used as an issue to take what is basically a voting rights \nissue, which is a State of Texas issue, and elevate it to the Federal \nCourt based on a claim about the ethnic makeup of members of the \nmilitary who voted absentee.\n  I believe this is a very serious issue. I believe it is a terrible \nindictment of\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\nthe Clinton administration, that they have not intervened in this case. \nThe Secretary of State of the State of Texas, the chief elections \nofficial of our State, has said that this lawsuit clearly in no way \nrepresents the election laws of our State. Our Attorney General has \nsaid that requiring this kind of questionnaire and documentation turns \nthe whole election system on its head. The people who did not vote \nabsentee who are not in the military received no such questionnaire.\n  Let me tell you what this questionnaire is about. This questionnaire \nis about voter intimidation. That is what this questionnaire is about. \nYou imagine, if you are manning a military weapons system in South \nKorea and you took the time to vote in your elections in the county you \nclaim is your legal residence and you get a 23-page legal document with \n54 questions, many of which have numerous subquestions asking you where \nyour wife sleeps at night or where your husband sleeps at night, and if \nyour spouse does not sleep where you do, why not.\n  What do you think this is going to do to their willingness to vote in \nthe next election? This is as clear a case of voter intimidation as it \nwould be to have a literacy test written in Chinese. The clear \nobjective of this questionnaire is to intimidate voters and not just \nany voters--people who wear the uniform of this country and who defend \nthe very freedoms that we are now seeing the Federal Government through \nthe Legal Services Corporation seek to deny them.\n  Madam President, I think this is one of the clearest outrages that I \nhave seen in my period of time in public service. I think it is \nsomething that has to be stopped. I want my colleagues to know that \nsince this is occurring in my State, and I speak for Senator Hutchison \non this issue, we intend to see this fixed. I want to call on our \nAttorney General, Janet Reno--and let me say I had a very nice talk \nwith her yesterday. She has promised me that she will look at this on \nan expedited basis. We had previously sent her a letter over a week \nago.\n  My concern here is that we are talking about two locally elected \nofficials who have been barred from taking office. They won the \nelection, nobody doubts that. But they have been barred from taking \noffice while Texas Rural Legal Aid, funded by the Legal Services \nCorporation, tries to intimidate military personnel who voted.\n  I don't know whether they can afford counsel. I don't know how good a \njob they are doing defending the right of our warriors to vote. I want \nthe full weight of the Attorney General brought into this issue. Do our \nwarriors serving in the military have a right to vote in that area that \nthey choose to designate as their legal residence? Let me remind my \ncolleagues, you don't have to own a home to be a legal resident. You \ndon't have to actually reside there if you are in the military. You \nsimply have to make a designation.\n  I see this as voter intimidation. I see it as a gross abuse of the \nVoting Rights Act. I cannot imagine that we would maintain a military \nfacility in a county that did not let our military personnel vote. I \nwould not--I don't care where it is--I would not support spending one \ndime to keep a military facility in a county that denied the right of \nmilitary personnel to vote.\n  I think the time has come to make it clear that this old deal of \nabusing military personnel has to end. From the beginning of the \nRepublic, we have wanted Washington and Uncle Sam to send the soldier \nboys out to build the fort, to buy our goods, and then they are abused. \nThis is one of the worst cases of abuse that I have ever seen, and I am \ngoing to do everything I can, everything within my power, to see that \nthis is fixed.\n  Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and Coast Guard personnel \nhave a right to choose a legal residence.\n  I want to read, in concluding, a quote from Maj. Paul Smith. Maj. \nPaul Smith is in the Air Force. He grew up in Del Rio. He attended high \nschool there. He went off to college, and then he came back to Laughlin \nto do pilot training. He declares Val Verde County as his residence.\n  We have been doing this since the Constitution was written. From the \ncolonial period, we have allowed people wearing the uniform of the \ncountry, serving around the continent at first and now all over the \nworld, to designate where they are going to exercise their legal \nrights.\n  Maj. Paul Smith grew up in Val Verde County in Del Rio, attended high \nschool there, went to pilot training there, and he says he is a \nresident of and chooses to vote in Del Rio. I say he has that right.\n  Here is what he said about this document sent out by Texas Rural \nLegal Aid and the Legal Services Corporation demanding to know where \nhis wife sleeps at night. He said: ``This really infuriates me. I'm \nserving my country, putting my life on the line, protecting the right \nto vote. If they throw my vote out, well, that's not good.''\n  It sure is not good, and it is not going to happen. It is not going \nto happen.\n  So I want to thank my colleagues for giving me this time. I want to \ncall again on the Attorney General to enter this case. Defend the right \nof those who wear the uniform of this country to vote, whatever their \nrace is, however they vote. The issue here is not race. The issue is \nnot who won and who lost elections. The issue is, do people in the \nmilitary, when they are moving all over the country and all over the \nplanet, have a right to designate an area where they want to exercise \ntheir right to vote? It seems to me you cannot be more basic than that, \nand it doesn't matter what the other factors are in this case.\n  If somebody voted illegally, throw their vote out. But to indict \nevery military personnel who voted absentee because their vote might \nhave changed the racial composition of the election, and to send them \nan intimidating legal document demanding they answer it in 3 days, \nasking where their spouse slept, it seems to me is clear, unadulterated \nvoter intimidation, and it is something that needs to be stopped. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I have listened with growing concern \nand really anger at the remarks of the Senator from Texas. I agree with \nhim. It is a cause of great concern to me. I served 15 years in the \nU.S. Department of Justice. I have served in the Army Reserve as a \njudge advocate. My responsibilities in that capacity were to protect \nthe rights of servicemen and all their responsibilities, enforcing the \nSoldiers and Sailors Relief Act so that those service people can \nmaintain their rights in their communities and not be abused while they \nwere serving their country on active duty.\n  To me, this is a very unhealthy action. It outrages me for three \nparticular reasons.\n  First of all, taxpayers' money was used for it. Legal Services \nCorporation lawyers actually going into court and seeking to deny \nsoldiers, sailors and airmen the right to vote. It is fundamentally \nwrong, it is offensive to me, and I am glad the Senator has spoken out \naggressively about it.\n  The Legal Services Corporation has had a history of abusing its \ncharter. Time and time and time again, they are caught and held to \naccount, and they back off and say, ``Oh, we're sorry, we made a \nmistake, it won't happen again.'' But it has happened again and again \nand again, in my experience, and I think we ought not to forget that.\n\n  I also want to say it is particularly galling to me that the votes \nthey seek to cancel are those of soldiers, sailors, and airmen and \nairwomen who are serving our country abroad and throughout this Nation. \nI firmly and strongly believe they ought to be able to vote in the \nlocation they choose as their residence and be able to participate in \nthe votes at that time.\n  Finally, as an individual who served for 15 years in the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice, a tenure I treasure greatly, I think it is \nincumbent upon the Attorney General to take firm and quick action to \njoin the side of those service men and women who are entitled to vote \nand have their vote counted. I think they ought to intervene in this \ncase on the side of the servicemen and help make sure that justice is \ndone.\n  I thank Senator Gramm for his remarks and for calling this to the \nattention of the country. I think it is an important issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAMS.

Mr. President, the emerging relationship between the United \nStates and China is one of immense opportunity for both nations, and \ndeserves the steady attention of the highest levels of both \ngovernments. Both nations need to make every effort to broaden the area \nof common ground in our dealings and understandings, and to engage in \nan open and honest dialogue on those issues, such as weapons \nproliferation and human rights matters, on which we have serious \ndifferences. There is a rising tide of commentary on our bilateral \nrelationship, and it is not particularly easy to arrive at the kind of \nbalanced approach which is both clear-eyed regarding present realities, \nand at the same time visionary on future prospects. One of the most \nthoughtful recent attempts to paint the salient highlights of this \ncomplicated picture was made last week by the recently retired Senator \nfrom the State of Georgia, Sam Nunn.\n  On the occasion of his selection as the 1997 recipient of the Paul \nNitze Award for Distinguished Public Service, Mr. Nunn described the \ncurrent state of consensus in the United States on U.S.-China policy as \n``very, very fragile.'' If that consensus were to break down, and the \nrelationship with China were to turn sour, a historic opportunity of \nprofound importance could be lost. Both sides need to work hard to \navoid that possibility.\n  The consensus within the United States that Senator Nunn describes \nincludes the healthy notion that our support for the modernization of \nChina's legal and banking and judicial, civil service and other \ninstitutions will pay long-range dividends for our overall \nrelationship, and for progress in China, but that modernization will \nnot emerge magically. Sustained efforts at cooperation in both public- \nand private-sector activities must be ongoing.\n  In his remarks, Senator Nunn rightly flags the importance of the \ncircumstances accompanying the turnover of Hong Kong to China on July 1 \nof this year. How well China adheres to the commitment that she has \nmade to the people of Hong Kong to preserve Hong Kong's distinct \nsocial, political and economic identity for the next 50 years will be \nvital. Senator Nunn states that China's ``credibility is on the line,'' \nin that China has given its word, and extended a solemn promise. A very \ndisquieting note has just been raised by the annual report by the State \nDepartment on human rights performance around the world according to \nthe New York Times. The report says, ``Hong Kong's civil liberties and \npolitical institutions were threatened by restrictive measures taken by \nthe Chinese government in anticipation of Hong Kong's reversion to \nChinese sovereignty'' in July. If China does not honor its obligations \nto Hong Kong, her relationship with the world, as Senator Nunn points \nout, will be ``dealt a severe blow.'' Keeping her word will be a key \nindicator of China's general willingness to adhere to the terms of \nother international obligations that the United States might support, \nsuch as membership in the World Trade Organization. Hong Kong will, in \nJuly, become an integral part of China and it will take some dexterity \nand work on the part of the Chinese government to fulfill its promise \nto honor Hong Kong's unique institutions. In this, as in many other \naspects of our growing relationship, patience, calmness, understanding \nand open dialogue will be important keys to success. The United States \nwould be mistaken to judge too quickly or to criticize too easily. We \nshould be cognizant that the more our interrelationships develop across \nthe board, the more likely it will be that the warm breezes of open \ndemocracy will have its effects on Chinese society.\n  It will take a special effort on both sides to continue to propel our \nrelationship along constructive channels, and to do so will require \nsustained effort, frequent interchanges and constant communication.\n  I commend Senator Nunn for his contribution to this dialogue on our \nChina policy and recommend a reading of his address to my colleagues. I \nhope that his remarks will receive wide distribution.\n  I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, that the remarks of Senator \nNunn to which I have just alluded be printed in the Record at this \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Enzi). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             United States-China Policy--Seeking a Balance\n\n                             (By Sam Nunn)\n\n       It is a great honor for me to accept this award which bears \n     the name of one of our Nation's greatest statesmen--Paul \n     Nitze has dedicated his life to advancing our national \n     interests--as a Governmental official--as a private citizen--\n     in war and in peace. Paul is a public servant without peer--\n     from NSC-68 and the wise men--to the Marshall plan and NATO--\n     Paul has led with vision. From the Committee on present \n     Danger and Nuclear Weapons Strategy--to charting a course in \n     the post cold war era--Paul Nitze has had the courage of his \n     vision and has demonstrated that one man can truly make a \n     difference.\n       Paul--by your example--you have defined the true meaning of \n     statesmanship. As an admirer--a student--and a friend--it is \n     a great honor for me to accept the Paul Nitze Award.\n       I am grateful to Bob Murray and CNA's board of trustees for \n     this special honor and for CNA's contributions to our \n     Nation's security.\n       These are just a few examples of the great return the \n     taxpayers get by investing in CNA. Bob, to you and your \n     team--keep up the good work!\n       There is only one catch to this wonderful evening with Paul \n     Nitze--the awardee must delivery a lecture on a matter \n     important to our national security--so any hope that you may \n     have that I will say a quick thank you and sit down--is \n     dashed on the rocks of this obligation.\n       If Paul were presenting a paper this evening, he would \n     cover NATO expansion, peace prospects in the Middle East, the \n     effect of Islamic fundamentalism on U.S. interests, the quest \n     for eliminating nuclear weapons from the globe--as well as \n     the emergence of China--all in clear, succinct and persuasive \n     form. Being a mere mortal, I will confine myself to only the \n     last subject--the emergence of China. I believe that this is \n     an important subject on the eve of the 25th anniversary of \n     President Nixon's historic 1972 visit to China and at a time \n     when many Americans are questioning the policy we have \n     pursued under both Democratic and Republican Presidents since \n     that time.\n       There are many think tanks in Washington--but CNA is \n     unique--the only one whose scientists regularly deploy in war \n     and in peace with our operational forces.\n       Those of us in the Congress dealing with national security \n     are keenly aware of your reputation for excellence and \n     objectivity--but most of all--we are aware of your effect on \n     policy.\n       In the gulf war, one of our missiles misfired and killed \n     our own people--CNA figured out why and prevented it from \n     happening again.\n       The Defense Department has to become more efficient if we \n     are to have the funding to modernize--CNA identified billions \n     in infrastructure savings which have been adopted by the \n     Navy.\n       One of our most effective weapons is the Tomahawk Missile--\n     CNA's recommendations have significantly improved its \n     performance.\n       The growing importance of China in world affairs demands a \n     purposeful, coherent and consistent American policy. History \n     is littered with the uninformed and ineffective responses of \n     an established power towards a rising power, and vice versa.\n       Established powers must provide consistent and credible \n     signals about their expectations and set forth reasonable \n     terms on which they are willing to incorporate the rising \n     power into the international system.\n       We are now watching the rise of China against the backdrop \n     of Asia's rapid industrialization. China is a nuclear power \n     with the world's largest army and a permanent member of the \n     United Nations Security Council. China also is a nation with \n     1.2 billion people, an economy growing at nearly 10 percent a \n     year over the last decade--and as we too often forget--a \n     distinctive civilization of great antiquity.\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\n       China is in the midst of four major transitions:\n       From a planned economy to a state guided market economy.\n       From rule by the long march revolutionaries to rule by \n     bureaucrats, technocrats, and military professionals.\n       From an agricultural society to an industrial society.\n       From a largely self-sufficient, isolated economy to one \n     that is increasingly dependent upon the international \n     economy.\n       China's transition is likely to be protracted. Uncertainty \n     is a permanent quality of modern China. Even if China embarks \n     upon a process of democratization, the development will be a \n     lengthy one. History shows it takes a long time to create a \n     legal system--guarantees for private property--a \n     parliamentary system--a free press--and the political culture \n     that can sustain a pluralistic and tolerant civil society.\n       We must engage China and its current leaders now rather \n     than remain aloof from this vast, complex, and proud \n     civilization until it becomes to our liking.\n       This can only be done if the leaders and peoples of both \n     our countries are convinced that their national interests \n     will be well served through greater U.S.-China cooperation. \n     Let's consider a few examples:\n\n\n               first: arms control and non-proliferation\n\n       Preventing the proflieration of weapons of mass \n     destruction--and their means of delivery--and reducing \n     stockpiles of these weapons are American interests of the \n     highest priority.\n       As a nuclear power and a permanent member of the Security \n     Council, China can either assist or torpedo efforts to stop \n     the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction--its role is \n     critical--China's attitude toward various arms control \n     measures has certainly improved in the past decade--its \n     recent commitment to cease nuclear testing and to support the \n     comprehensive test ban treaty is an encouraging development. \n     China seems to recognize its interest in reducing the dangers \n     of nuclear proliferation globally and especially in East \n     Asia.\n       But China also has been indifferent to the destabilizing \n     consequences of its transfer of advanced technology and sale \n     of materials related to strategic weapons in South Asia and \n     the Middle East. Aspects of its military and technology \n     relations with Pakistan and Iran are deeply troubling to the \n     United States.\n       In our dialogue with the Chinese at high levels we should \n     point out that as a growing importer of oil from the Middle \n     East, China has an increasing stake in the tranquility of the \n     Straits of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf--its pattern of arms \n     sales does not seem to take this into account--we should also \n     emphasize to Beijing that the U.S. Navy protects the waters \n     through which oil tankers bring petroleum to China. China \n     benefits from the stability our naval presence brings to the \n     high seas.\n\n\n                second: the collapse of the soviet union\n\n       Both the United States and China must respond to the \n     consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union. With the \n     Russian threat now greatly diminished, the security \n     frameworks erected in the cold war era must take into account \n     new realities. Plans are underway to extend NATO eastward (a \n     move I remain very skeptical about--but that is the subject \n     of another speech), and we are adjusting our treaties with \n     Japan and Korea. These changes must be undertaken in ways \n     that do not raise new and deep security concerns in Russia \n     about its western flank or in China about its eastern flank, \n     lest we inadvertently stimulate the two to begin a strategic \n     relationship that neither prefers and which threatens \n     stability.\n       Russia's new situation also has offered China opportunities \n     to improve its relations with Moscow. This is a welcome \n     development. Previous Soviet-Chinese rivalry and military \n     confrontation brought tension to the entire region. Improved \n     Sino-Russian relations help promote regional stability. But \n     economic considerations on the Russian side and opportunism \n     on the Chinese side could prompt an undisciplined flood of \n     weapons and military technology to China, provoking an effort \n     by the Asian Nations to balance China's growing strength, \n     resulting in a destabilizing arms race.\n       In Central Asia, Mongolia, and the Russian Far East, China \n     faces some serious questions:\n       Will the new Central Asian Nations stimulate separatist \n     impulses among China's Islamic peoples?\n       Where is the Russian Far East headed, in light of Moscow's \n     ebbing economic and political grasp over the region?\n       Will the migration of Chinese to Siberia continue and \n     become a new source of tension between Russia and China?\n       How will the resources of the Russian Far East be developed \n     in the next century?\n       We should discuss these broad strategic issues with \n     Beijing. How to ease Russia's political and economic \n     transformation; how to create a framework of stability for \n     the states of the former Soviet Empire; and how to continue \n     the current favorable alignment among the major powers of \n     Asia. For the first time in a century, China, Russia, Japan, \n     and the United States have good relations with one another, \n     constant dialogue among China, Russia, Japan, and the United \n     States is required to consolidate this relationship.\n\n\n                   third: regional security interests\n\n       In addition to its global strategic interests, the United \n     States has enduring regional security concerns.\n       No region is more important to the United States than the \n     Asia-Pacific Region, where America has fought three costly \n     wars in this century and where rapidly growing economies \n     offer the United States our greatest expanding markets. \n     Needless to say, China also has a keen interest in \n     maintaining stability in this region--our overlapping \n     interests have enabled China and the United States to \n     cooperate in sustaining peace in Korea and ending nearly 40 \n     years of war on the Indochina Peninsula.\n       Our treaties with Japan and South Korea and the specific \n     arrangements developed under them--the status or forces \n     agreements, the basing arrangements and force structures--\n     took shape in the cold-war era. Much has happened in the \n     subsequent years. Japan and South Korea have emerged as \n     prosperous, full democracies. Through consultations, the \n     United States and China must forge an understanding that \n     adjustments to these treaties are not aimed at China but are \n     intended to ensure that the alliances remain a cornerstone of \n     regional stability.\n\n\n                fourth: international economic interests\n\n       The United States has a major interest in maintaining \n     steady international economic growth, uninterrupted by \n     financial crises or disruptions in the international monetary \n     system. We seek access to the markets of other countries and \n     we believe that the growth of imports into the United States \n     should occur in an orderly fashion. We seek a level playing \n     field--too frequently, foreign countries exploit their open \n     access to American markets while limiting access to their \n     markets or discriminating against American firms.\n       Sanctions should be employed with great care, but any \n     American Government that ignores the American peoples' strong \n     desire for a fair playing field in world trade will have \n     great difficulty conducting a sensible trade policy or \n     foreign policy.\n       With one of the world's largest economies, its rapid \n     increase in foreign trade, its substantial foreign currency \n     reserves (nearly $100 billion), and its external indebtedness \n     (over $100 billion), China's economic performance clearly \n     affects American interests. China has created a better \n     institutional and legal environment to welcome foreign direct \n     investment than most other countries in East Asia. It has \n     taken measures to facilitate repatriation of profits. Its \n     sovereign offerings are deemed credit worthy by international \n     rating agencies.\n       Yet even though roughly 40 percent of China's exports are \n     ultimately consumed in the United States, its Government \n     appears reluctant to address its growing trade deficit with \n     the United States through increased purchases from American \n     vendors. While decrying American linkage of trade and \n     politics, China is practicing its own form of linkage. Too \n     often China has discriminated against American vendors on \n     political grounds, even though China enjoys easier access to \n     the American market than to markets of other developed \n     countries.\n       Further--China's laws governing commerce remain \n     underdeveloped, and corruption is a growing problem. Many \n     non-tariff barriers still exist that restrict access to the \n     China market.\n       As Bob Zoellick recently observed, we are likely to be more \n     successful in pursuing our trade grievances if we seek an \n     international coalition to promote and enforce international \n     standards and if we stress China's self-interest in adhering \n     to the rules.\n\n\n                   fifth: problems of interdependence\n\n       The United States has a major interest in reducing a wide \n     range of problems that transcend national boundaries: \n     Environmental degradation; international terrorism; illegal \n     population migration; narcotics trafficking; the spread of \n     communicable diseases; pressure on world food supplies; and \n     rapid population growth. These problems threaten the survival \n     of vast portions of the world's peoples and introduce global \n     instability.\n       Chinese-American cooperation cannot assure success in \n     addressing these most fundamental problems that threaten all \n     humankind. But Chinese-American animosity would surely make \n     it more difficult to cope with these issues. Acting together, \n     the United States and China can accomplish much. in \n     confrontation, both of us will suffer.\n\n\n                   sixth: democracy and human rights\n\n       The United States must give expression to the values on \n     which the Nation was founded and that draw Americans together \n     as one people. These beliefs have universal appeal. They are \n     a source of American strength.\n       Yet the authoritarian leaders of China believe that many \n     political values that Americans espouse do not apply to \n     China. their obstinate resistance to democratization and \n     human rights is driven by complex reasons. I believe that \n     China's leaders jeopardize their nation's economic progress \n     and domestic stability by not moving more rapidly toward the \n     rule of law and expanding the opportunities of their populace \n     to participate meaningfully in their own governance. China \n     cannot expect United States and world acquiescence or silence \n     in response to flagrant abuses of human rights. This is \n     particularly true in terms of China's treatment of the \n     citizens of Hong Kong.\n       In assessing China's behavior, however, I believe that we \n     must broaden our own definition of human rights. Professor \n     Harry Harding has recently written that:\n       ``While the individual political and civil freedoms \n     enshrined in the American Constitution are indispensable to \n     human rights\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\n     as we know them, human rights also encompass such social and \n     economic rights as the rights to subsistence, to development, \n     to employment, to education, and the special rights of women \n     and children and the elderly. Political and civil freedoms \n     are not the only things that people value in their political \n     lives. Other political goals, including stability, effective \n     governance,and absence of corruption, are also worthy of \n     pursuit.''\n       As we shape our strategy, we need to keep these words of \n     wisdom in mind. If we do, our justifiable criticisms of \n     abuses are likely to have more credibility and more effect \n     not only in China but also with our friends throughout Asia.\n       This review of America's foreign policy interests reveals \n     that a thick web of partly convergent and partly divergent \n     interests now binds the United States and China. In \n     recognition of this reality, I believe that a new fragile \n     consensus on China policy is slowly emerging in Washington \n     and among the American people.\n       This fragile consensus rejects the extremes of rigid \n     hostility or unconditional friendship with China. It seeks \n     cooperation with China while realistically accepting \n     disagreement where our values and interests diverge. If \n     strengthened, this consensus has the potential to embrace \n     several fundamental concepts.\n       First, Sino-American relations merit high level sustained \n     attention of the United States Government. Management of this \n     relationship cannot be relegated in chaotic fashion to the \n     lower levels of each department in the executive branch, but \n     must be coordinated at the highest levels of Government, \n     including the Congress. The exchange of Presidential visits \n     is a strong step in the right direction.\n       Second, the United States has an interest in a prosperous, \n     stable and unified mainland that is effectively and humanely \n     governed, not a weak, divided or isolated China which would \n     surely threatened the region's peace and prosperity.\n       Third, the United States should seek to work constructively \n     with China to facilitate its entry into the international \n     regimes that regulate and order world affairs. China will be \n     more likely to adhere to international norms that it has \n     helped to shape. But China's entry must not be permitted on \n     terms that jeopardize the purpose of those regimes.\n       Fourth, the United States should continue to adhere to our \n     one China policy based on the Shanghai Communique, the \n     normalization agreement, and the 1982 joint communique. We do \n     not seek to detach Taiwan from the mainland permanently, but \n     neither can we accept Taiwan's forcible reunification with \n     the Mainland. Taiwan deserves a status in world affairs \n     commensurate with its economic and political attainment. But \n     realistically, Taiwan can best secure a greater international \n     voice and stature through cooperation with Beijing and not \n     through provocation.\n       Fifth, to attain all these objectives, the United States \n     must retain a robust military presence in the Western \n     Pacific. Until multilateral security arrangements are firmly \n     in place and well rooted in East Asia--there will be no \n     substitute for the Japanese-American and Korean-American \n     security treaties--which are not directed against China.\n       Sixth, the United States--especially the private sector--\n     should cooperate with China in its efforts to develop \n     institutions necessary for its continued modernization: A \n     legal system and the rule of law; a strengthened judiciary; \n     an effective banking and revenue system; a civil service \n     system; representative assemblies; and effective civilian \n     control over the public security and military forces.\n       Finally, because of the attention that will be focused on \n     the turnover of Hong Kong to China on July 1 of this year, \n     Hong Kong will provide the prism through which Americans will \n     view China. This 1997 view may affect the American people's \n     perception of China for years to come, and may turn out to be \n     the bellwether for the international community in judging \n     Beijing's intent and approach to the world.\n       Will China carry out its solemn commitment to Britain and \n     the people of Hong Kong to allow Hong Kong its own distinct \n     social, political and economic identity for the next 50 \n     years? If so, this example will lead to a positive view of \n     China throughout the world, including the people of Taiwan. \n     If not, China's relationship to the world will be dealt a \n     severe blow and its relations with the people of Taiwan will \n     be set back 50 years.\n       It is far from clear that the leaders of China are prepared \n     to meet this responsibility by allowing Hong Kong to retain \n     the qualities that are key to its success--such as a \n     professional civil service, the rule of law, an independent \n     judiciary, and freedom to receive and disseminate \n     information.\n       Considering the large stakes, I believe that our own \n     country must strive for balance in our assessment and our \n     actions.\n       We should remember that Hong Kong was seized by force from \n     a weak China and that the British subsequently ruled it as a \n     British colony--not a democracy. Hong Kong and Macau are the \n     last Western colonies in Asia, and represent the end of an \n     era.\n       China should be told clearly and firmly that their \n     credibility is on the line and that their behavior toward \n     Hong Kong will have a major effect on their standing in the \n     international community--in short, they must keep their \n     world--our measuring stick of Chinese behavior should be \n     based on their own solemn commitments--not on our dream of a \n     Jeffersonian transformation.\n       It is essential that we not rush to a final verdict based \n     on the first thing that goes wrong. This will be a long \n     uneven process with many rough spots and mistakes. The \n     transfer of power is a British and Chinese agreement, and the \n     United States should not get drawn into a self-appointed role \n     as the arbiter of the details.\n       The United States should not become the sole critic when \n     China deviates from its commitment to Hong Kong. This will \n     turn Hong Kong into a U.S.-China confrontation and will not \n     be effective with a Chinese leadership that fears the \n     perception in their own country that they are yielding to \n     American pressure. While we have a huge stake in a prosperous \n     Hong Kong and a China which keeps its commitments--so do our \n     allies in Europe and Asia. We, of course, must lead--but we \n     must lead the international community.\n       In the final analysis, after July 1, Hong Kong will again \n     be part of China and its long term future will be determined \n     by events in China itself. As the eyes of America and the \n     world focus on the important trees of Hong Kong, we must not \n     lose sight of the forest itself--China.\n       In our country the emerging consensus of U.S.-China policy \n     is very, very fragile. The Presidential visits, the recent \n     stabilization of Chinese-American relations and the prospects \n     for improvement in the months ahead are particularly \n     vulnerable to disruption by possible Chinese actions.\n       Many observers caution that for deeper reasons, the new \n     consensus cannot be sustained, citing the historical ``love-\n     hate'' relationship between these two great countries.\n       Some analysts claim that two civilizations as different as \n     that of China and the United States simply cannot sustain \n     constructive relations.\n       Other analysts assert that political and ideological \n     differences preclude a close, cooperative relationship \n     between Washington and Beijing.\n       Yet others claim that accommodations between the United \n     States and China will necessarily prove to be temporary \n     because of our differences in wealth and power and because \n     the United States is a defender of an international system \n     that we helped to create and that advances our interests.\n       Let us acknowledge and accept the dangers these observers \n     offer. They remind us of the enormous challenges in fostering \n     cooperative Sino-American relations. They caution us neither \n     to harbor illusion nor to allow expectations to soar. But in \n     the final analysis, what should we do with their warnings? \n     Should our policy become fatalistic, devoid of hope that the \n     United States and China can be partners in the building of a \n     more stable and secure world? Should the United States look \n     upon China as an enemy and therefore seek to weaken or divide \n     it, thereby creating a reality we seek to avoid?\n       I believe the clear answer is no. To move in this direction \n     would become a self-fulfilling prophecy. Forewarned of the \n     difficulties, the leaders of China and the United States must \n     persist in forging cooperative bonds between our two nations.\n       One conclusion is clear--in no small measure, the future \n     well-being of the American and Chinese people depends on the \n     ability of our two nations to cooperate. I remain hopeful \n     that enlightened self-interest will prevail, as it has in the \n     25 years since President Nixon and Chairman Mao shook hands.\n       Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to address an \nongoing threat to our Nation's security and prosperity, a threat with \ndual roots. In the precarious Middle East and right here at home there \nis reason for concern about our Nation's increased reliance on \npotentially unstable foreign sources of oil. I believe it is critical \nduring the 105th Congress that we focus on efforts to increase energy \nconservation, particularly in the context of reauthorization of the \nFederal highway and transit programs.\n  We must think back to the days of the gulf war and further back to \nthe oil crises of the 1970's to better understand the entire picture. \nAmerican consumers too often forget the interdependence of world \nevents, particularly when it comes to our use of imported foreign oil. \nThere are currently legitimate reasons to question whether instability \nin\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\nthe Mideast will once again jeopardize our access to that region's oil \nresources, putting our economy and perhaps our national security at \nsignificant risk.\n  By way of background, it is well known that the oil supplies in the \nMideast are immense. An estimated 66 percent of the world's recoverable \noil resources are found in the region. These supplies are critical to \nthe United States as well as to our European allies. More than 20 \npercent of the oil we purchase comes from the Arab countries of the \nOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, commonly known as OPEC. \nWestern Europe depends on the region for 25 percent of its oil \nconsumption. These OPEC countries include alphabetically, Algeria, \nIraq, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates.\n  I have been troubled that U.S. imports of foreign oil continue to \nincrease. Currently, the U.S. imports constitute more than 50 percent \nof the oil which we consume. According to the American Petroleum \nInstitute, this equals more than 9 million barrels per day, with a 6-\npercent increase in the amount of imported oil since 1995 alone. That \nis cause for real concern. This is a huge jump from the 6 million \nbarrels imported per day in 1973. Further, if these trends continue, \nanalysts say that in 10 years we will look to these overseas sources \nfor two-thirds of our energy needs.\n  In part because of the ready availability of less expensive sources \nof foreign oil, it has not been cost effective for U.S. energy \ncompanies to increase domestic production. U.S. domestic production of \noil continues to decline, with an estimated 17,000 U.S. oil wells \nceasing production annually. U.S. industry claims that regulatory \nrelief and tax measures are necessary to jump start domestic production \nagain, and these are areas which we ought to consider.\n  This is a field that I have some personal knowledge in, Mr. \nPresident, from my roots in Kansas where my father ran a junkyard and \nwhere he and my brothers bought oil wells for salvage and then flooded \nwells. We have a great source of supply from those wells and other \nproduction in the United States which we really ought to reexamine in \nthe context of this major international problem.\n  In an effort to protect ourselves against the disruption of oil \nsupplies after the oil crises we faced in the 1970's, Congress \nestablished the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That reserve was intended \nto minimize the effects of any disruptions from the import of oil, and \nby the end of 1989 that reserve held 580 million barrels. The first \nsale from that reserve occurred after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in \nAugust 1990, demonstrating that the reserve can serve its intended \npurpose, because it was used at that time.\n  The effectiveness of the reserve is measured by the number of days of \nnet petroleum imports the reserve could supply in the event of an \ninterruption in the supply of foreign oil. For example, in 1986 the \nreserve was said to contain 115 days of imports. By 1995, based on the \ndecreasing U.S. production and a corresponding increase in foreign \nimports, the reserve was said to hold an amount comparable to 75 days \nof net imports.\n\n  As if it was not sufficient to let the effectiveness of the reserve \ndwindle, last year in an unprecedented move, the Administration decided \nto sell approximately 25 million barrels of petroleum from the reserve \nto generate revenues, an amount equivalent to almost 3 weeks supply of \nimports from Saudi Arabia. That timing, I suggest, was less than \nprudent, particularly considering the state of affairs in the Mideast \ntoday which should highlight the dangers and disadvantages of reliance \non Mideast oil. Saudi Arabia, in particular, poses a unique cause for \nconcern. The sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital \ninterest to the United States, as President Bush said in 1990 after \nIraq invaded Kuwait. If a hostile nation seized Saudi oil wells, the \nlargest reserve in the world, the American economy and the world \nmarkets could tumble.\n  More recent events are again drawing our attention to Saudi Arabia. \nLast week, Attorney General Reno and FBI Director Louis Freeh publicly \nacknowledged what has been known for a long time; and that is that the \nSaudis are not cooperating with the United States investigation into \nthe terrible terrorist attack at Dharhan on June 25 of 1996. We saw the \nterrorist attack on United States citizens in Riyadh in November of \n1995. We saw the Saudi investigation. We saw the Saudi execution of \nfour convicts, people they said were guilty, on May 31, 1996 without \ngiving the FBI an opportunity to question those individuals. Now \nDirector Freeh has been blunt about the lack of Saudi cooperation, and \nAttorney General Janet Reno said the same thing in public disclosures \nlast week.\n  It is in the interest of the United States, Mr. President, for our \nrelationship with Saudi Arabia to continue, and we want to have a good \nrelationship with the Saudis. But we have some 5,000 U.S. military \npersonnel there. We have thousands of other U.S. personnel there. I \nthink it is important for the Saudis to understand that continued \nUnited States cooperation requires fair treatment for our investigative \nefforts.\n  Along a parallel line, it is important for the Saudis to understand \nthat respect for United States personnel there, for their religious \nfreedom, is of enormous importance. It was not too long ago, in the mid \n1980's, when United States citizens were arrested in their households \nby the so-called ``religious police'' and held in detention.\n  But this effort to maintain our relationship with the Saudis, while \nof enormous importance, requires that we focus on a potential problem \nof what we will do if the oil supplies from Saudi Arabia are in any way \nthreatened.\n  Mr. President, while our interest in reducing dependence on foreign \noil is a difficult task, we can achieve meaningful reductions in energy \nconsumption through prompt reauthorization of the Federal mass transit \nand highway programs contained in the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991, known as ISTEA, as well as enactment of an \nAmtrak reform bill and continued public policy initiatives to promote \nthe use of clean burning alternative-fueled vehicles such as natural \ngas and electric cars.\n  ISTEA is commonly referred to as the highway bill, but it does much \nmore than pave roads. That legislation expands the mass transit formula \nand discretionary grant programs, authorizing some $31.5 billion over 6 \nyears for public transportation. Other provisions established funding \nfor bicycle paths and pedestrian walkways. That bill revolutionized \nFederal spending on transportation infrastructure improvements by \nestablishing the National Highway System, funding the Congestion \nMitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program, granting States and \nlocal governments more flexibility in determining transit and highway \nsolutions, and promoting new technologies such as intelligent \ntransportation systems and magnetic levitation systems, which are also \nimportant alternatives to help us reduce dependency on foreign oil.\n  The funding authority for ISTEA will expire on September 30 this \nyear, therefore creating the necessity and an opportunity to focus \nnational attention on the significant link between energy consumption \nand our transportation infrastructure. A Department of Transportation \nstudy of the 50 largest urban areas in the United States suggests that \nnearly 4 billion gallons of gasoline are wasted each year due to \ntraffic congestion--approximately 94 million barrels of oil. There is \nmuch at stake, for the annual economic loss to business in the United \nStates caused by traffic congestion is estimated in itself at $40 \nbillion by the Federal Transit Administration. We will be correcting \nmany problems if we work on mass transit and road improvements to \nreduce traffic congestion and also our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Legislation to reauthorize Federal highway programs will provide an \nopportunity to improve existing roadways, construct more efficient \nbypasses and highway interchanges and generally reduce congestion in \nour cities and towns. Further, a key weapon in our effort to reduce our \ndependence on oil shipments from potentially unstable regions is public \ntransportation and mass transit.\n  Mass transit has developed to include traditional bus and subway \nlines, commuter rail, cable cars, monorails, water taxis, and several \nother modes of shared transportation. Public transportation is a \nlifeline for millions of\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\nAmericans and deserves substantial funding for that reason alone. \nHowever, it deserves even greater funding when one considers that \npublic transportation saves 1.5 billion gallons of fuel consumption \nannually in the United States and that each commuter who switches from \ndriving alone to using public transportation saves 200 gallons of \ngasoline per year, according to government and private studies. Transit \nthus deserves a renewed and expanded Federal commitment as we begin \nconsideration of the reauthorization of ISTEA.\n  The additional benefits of reducing fuel consumption and improving \nthe environment, not to mention the millions of Americans who are \ninvolved in the transit industry, provide extra reason to stop and \nexplore the case for mass transit. In our States, citizens and \ncommunities depend on good public transportation for mobility, access \nto jobs and health care providers, environmental control, and economic \nstability.\n  In the context of ISTEA reauthorization, I intend to work closely \nwith my colleagues to ensure that sufficient funds are available for \nimproving our transportation infrastructure, including both highways \nand transit. As a first step, I was pleased to join 56 of my colleagues \nin a recent bipartisan letter to Budget Committee Chairman Pete \nDomenici urging that the fiscal year 1998 budget resolution reflect the \nneed for increased transportation funding. Further, I am currently \nworking on legislation that reflects the energy and environmental \nbenefits of public transportation by increasing funding for mass \ntransit and preserving the elements of the transit program incorporated \nin the 1991 ISTEA law. The additional benefits of reducing fuel \nconsumption and improving the environment will be present if we do have \nthe highway-transit conservation ideas uppermost in our minds. Mr. \nPresident, I have taken some time today since we are in morning \nbusiness and since there is not business at hand to speak on the \nsubject of the interrelationship between the way we handle mass transit \nand oil conservation in the context of what is going on in the Mideast \nand very serious potential problems which we face there.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article in the New \nYork Times from last Sunday be printed at the conclusion of my \ncomments, entitled ``Oil Imports Are Up. Fretting About It Is Down,'' \nwhich summarizes some of the statistical basis for legitimate concern \nif we do not do something about those oil imports and if we do not \nfocus on them. As the headline notes, fretting about oil imports is \ndown. It is passe. We do remember those long lines, many of us do, in \n1973, and we do see the problems in the Mideast and the issue of \nstability of the Saudi Government.\n  This is the interrelation of problems which I think we have to \naddress in a number of ways. We can address these problems through our \nforeign policy with the Saudis, and by trying to reduce dependency on \nforeign oil in a variety of ways, such as first, stimulating our \ndomestic oil production consistent with environmental concerns, and \nsecond, reauthorizing the ISTEA programs, which will give us an \nopportunity to achieve some meaningful economies through mass transit.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 26, 1997]\n\n             Oil Imports Are Up--Fretting About It Is Down\n\n                          (By Matthew L. Wald)\n\n       Washington.--In his second inaugural address last week, \n     Bill Clinton made promises on the usual problems, like race \n     relations, education and health. But another hardy perennial, \n     the nation's dependence on imported oil, went unmentioned. \n     Not gone but forgotten, this problem is larger than ever.\n       Imports have risen to record levels--about 50 percent of \n     consumption, according to the American Petroleum Institute. \n     Needing cash last year, the Government sold off about 25 \n     million barrels from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, the \n     equivalent of almost three weeks of imports from Saudi \n     Arabia. That hoard might have been precious in a crisis.\n       But there will not be another crisis quite like the oil \n     shortages of 1973 to 1974 and 1979 to 1980, experts say, and \n     there are reasons that might justify America's profligate \n     course. Last year, domestic production decreased, but the oil \n     companies delivered 2.8 percent more fuel to their customers. \n     As a result, imports, which are relatively cheap, increased 6 \n     percent, the institute said.\n       The contrast between the bad old days and today is \n     stunning. When imports were 40 percent of consumption, Jimmy \n     Carter, donning a cardigan, said that America should cut \n     imports by nearly a third by 1985 and declared ``the moral \n     equivalent of war.'' As President Carter's energy czar, James \n     R. Schlesinger, but it last week, Americans now have evolved \n     to ``indifference without moralizing.''\n       Efforts to find substitute fuels for vehicles continue, \n     along with programs to pump more domestic oil and conserve \n     use. But dependence on foreign sources will grow anyway, the \n     General Accounting Office said last month, because rising \n     demand will outstrip all these efforts as the economy grows. \n     Even without a population increase or new factories to \n     consume more energy, new Chevy Astros, Mercury Villagers and \n     other vans are roaring out of showrooms as old fuel-efficient \n     Chevy Chevettes and Honda Civics head for the scrap heap. \n     That means more fuel per mile.\n       Combined with declining domestic production, imports could \n     rise to 60 percent of consumption by 2015, the G.A.O. said.\n       Hazel R. O'Leary, whose job as Energy Secretary ended with \n     Mr. Clinton's swearing-in, said in an interview just before \n     here departure that the American people needed to get the \n     message, but delivering it was beyond the ability of an \n     Energy Secretary. She said it would take another oil shock.\n       And that appears about as certain as another hurricane in \n     Florida or earthquake in California. The only question is \n     when. Many of the elements are already in place; Larry \n     Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research \n     Foundation, said that idle production capacity is only about \n     three million barrels a day, all of it in the Persian Gulf. \n     ``If you were to have a disruption in Kuwait or Saudi \n     Arabia,'' he said, ``the ability of the world to make it up \n     is zero. And nobody would honestly say the Middle East is \n     more secure today than it was a decade ago.''\n       But Mr. Goldstein and other experts say oil is no longer at \n     the top of America's problem list of a number of reasons.\n       For one, interruptions in supply from the Persian Gulf are \n     possible, but there is no enemy superpower poised to march \n     in. ``When the Soviet Union was still around, it had six \n     airborne divisions seemingly ready to fly into the gulf,'' \n     said Mr. Schlesinger, who also did a turn as Secretary of \n     Defense. OPEC has lost power too, he said.\n       In fact, the so-called North-South confrontation of the \n     1970's, with rich oil-consuming nations facing off against \n     poor energy-producing ones, is mostly gone. Daniel Yergin, \n     president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, pointed \n     out that in the 1970's and 1980's, oil-producing countries \n     nationalized their industries, but now they are privatizing \n     them and asking for Western investment. ``It's back to a high \n     degree of interdependence,'' he said. ``Everybody wants to be \n     on the same team now.''\n       And America itself has changed. The amount of goods and \n     services that 20 years ago required five barrels of oil to \n     make now takes only three. Not only have utilities switched \n     to coal and natural gas, but the output of the American \n     economy has also shifted away from products using vast \n     amounts of energy, like heavy manufactured goods, to those \n     that use hardly any, like movies and computer software.\n       The price of oil is down, too. In 1980, oil sales were \n     about 8.5 to 9 percent of gross domestic product. ``Today, \n     it's a little over 3 percent,'' Mr. Goldstein said.\n       Mr. Goldstein also distinguishes between dependency and \n     vulnerability. If this country cut its dependency by several \n     million barrels a day, it would still be just as vulnerable \n     to price shock, he said, because in a free international \n     market, ``a disruption anywhere is a price shock \n     everywhere.'' Making a similar point last month, the G.A.O. \n     gave the example of Britain after the fall of the Shah of \n     Iran and the subsequent price shock. That country was nearly \n     self-sufficient in oil at the time, but when the price rose, \n     the economic dislocation was severe. The G.A.O. report found \n     that ``vulnerability is linked to dependence on oil, not \n     merely to dependence on imported oil.''\n       Cheap oil is still a boon to the American economy. The \n     G.A.O. put the benefits of cheap oil at hundreds of billions \n     of dollars annually. Its analysis explicitly excluded the \n     cost of human life in sending American soldiers back into \n     Mideastern oil fields--or the limits that import dependency \n     may impose an American foreign policy. In the current \n     political climate, though, those costs do not seem to be high \n     on anybody's list.\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise to express my deep concerns with the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's proposed changes to air quality \nstandards. The EPA kicked off the last Thanksgiving weekend by \nannouncing its intention to move their air quality goalposts yet again. \nIt seems they change the rules more frequently than the NFL and the NBA \nput together. I doubt there were many State or local governments that \nspent Thanksgiving giving thanks for that announcement. I was the mayor \nof Gillette, a coal producing town on the plains of Wyoming. I know \nfirsthand how hard many of our Nation's cities and States have been \nworking. They have been expending a huge amount of effort and dollars \njust to get into compliance with the standards established in 1990.\n  And let there be no mistake. Compliance, for better or worse, has \nbeen costly. It has been costly to small businesses, businesses that \noperate on thin profit margins in the best of circumstances. It has \nbeen costly to major industries that have spent hundreds of millions of \ndollars retooling their plants and factories to comply with that law. \nIt has been costly to State and local governments that have had to \ndivert scarce dollars to mandated planning and enforcement duties. And \nmost of all, it has been expensive for the citizens who lose jobs when \nindustries relocate overseas or to other areas of the country that are \nalready in compliance. This costly compliance has resulted in the \nhigher taxes levied to compensate for a smaller tax base. And citizens \nnotice higher costs for goods and services.\n  I do recognize that the EPA excludes economic concerns from the \nformulation of their air quality standards. The 1990 amendments to the \nClean Air Act require that oversight. The air quality standards \nestablished in 1990 have been beneficial to our Nation's environment \nand, by extension, our public health. Of course, the more radical \nenvironmentalists point to the absence of an economic apocalypse over \nthe past 7 years as proof that no environmental standard is too strict \nand nothing is impossible. You and I know that nothing is impossible. \nBut arm in arm with successes has come a dangerous corollary. It is \nalso easy to believe that nothing is too outrageous.\n  In the name of species protection, logging in the Pacific Northwest \nhas all but disappeared. Years of careful forest management had \nrendered these the most productive forest lands in the world. They are \nso productive that for every 100,000 acres of Pacific Northwest forest \nland taken out of production, we force a half-million acres of Siberian \nwilderness to be cut down to fill the void. Environmentalists may have \nsaved a few spotted owls, but in the process they have probably signed \nthe death warrant of the Siberian tiger. It is ridiculous to trade jobs \nfor dubious environmental gain. It is ridiculous to think that we are \nsaving the world by importing our natural resources. This is what \nSenator Hatfield used to refer to as ``environmental imperialism''--\nimperialism inflicted on nations too desperate to ignore our resource \nmarkets yet too poor to enforce their own environmental standards.\n  Can the word ``ridiculous'' apply to the proposed standards \nthemselves? The current standard for particulate matter limits \nparticles to 10 microns or larger. The proposed standard would change \nthat to particles larger than 2.5 microns. For comparison, a human hair \nis about 28 microns in width. For ozone, the current standard of .12 \nparts per million averaged over 1 hour would be replaced by a new \nstandard of .08 parts per million averaged over 8 hours. In light of \nthe fact that there are many cities across the Nation that have yet to \nsatisfy the current standard and the fact that no one yet has justified \nthese new standards, I think it is safe to say that the proposed \nstandards fail the credibility test. The Congressional Research Service \nhas stated that ``The new standards would substantially increase the \nnumber of areas not attaining the Clean Air Act's air quality standards \nand magnify the difficulties faced by present nonattainment areas in \nreaching attainment.'' And the hardship to be imposed is without \nreasonable evidence of any additional benefit.\n  Billions--billions--of dollars were sent by cities and industry 10 \nyears ago to comply with the current standards. Yet, now the EPA \nintends to require billions more to comply with the new standards. The \ncapital invested in current compliance has yet to be paid off, in many \ninstances. Areas that are not yet in compliance with the current \nstandards will have to strengthen their restrictions by several orders \nof magnitude. The possibility of mandatory car pooling and bans on \nbackyard barbecues and lawn mowing are ridiculous, but probably will be \nthe result.\n  I can assure you they will not go over well in my State. Wyoming is \npopulated with people gifted with a basic common sense. They are \naggressively independent and free thinking. I can only imagine the head \nscratching that will ensue when they see county tanker trucks watering \nthe dirt roads around there. After all, Wyoming has miles and miles of \nmiles and miles, and many of those roads are gravel.\n  Anyone familiar with the average Wyoming winter understands the axiom \nthat sand is safety, yet sand applied to ice-bound roads results in a \ndust level, and that dust level already violates the proposed standards \nin many communities. The current clean air standards are already \ncausing wrecks and injury to people.\n  From an economic perspective, these standards will visit tremendous \nhardships upon my State and upon every State that depends on land-use \nindustries. Wyoming is the largest coal producer in the Nation. Clean, \nlow-sulfur coal, I might add. But mining does create some dust. Not \nreally dust, it is smaller than that. That is why we are talking about \nthe size of these particulates. I wish each of you would have an \nopportunity to visit a mine in Wyoming. Many of you would see a very \nclean industry. But now the particulates have to be even finer. And oil \nrefining creates gases.\n  The Nation simply cannot have job-producing factories or heat in \ntheir homes without those byproducts. We are led to believe these \nstandards would eliminate billowing clouds of pollution, but the \ncurrent laws already do that. These proposed standards would place \nenormous burdens on our mining and refining industries and would simply \nspell the end of many western refineries.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency and its handmaiden, the \nenvironmental movement, are engaging in a form of execution attributed \nto the ancient Chinese. It is known as death by 10,000 slices, and its \ncurrent victim is the American economy. Each swipe of the knife results \nin wounds that are individually minor but cumulatively disastrous. With \nevery burdensome standard, the blade flashes and another small business \ngoes under. With every new expensive regulation, a new slice drips red \nand another plant or factory moves overseas. With every additional \nsurtax, the knife whistles by, and the American family has less money \nto place back into the economy.\n  Mr. President, we must restore a semblance of balance and reason to \nour environmental laws. We must introduce cost-benefit analysis and \nrisk assessment into the environmental equation. We must evaluate \nscience above politics. We must honor the work of the last Congress in \nrestricting unfunded Federal mandates. We must stop moving the \ngoalposts on cities, towns, States, and businesses that are already \nworking hard to comply. We must give business and industry incentives \nto work toward our spiraling environmental goals. It is a small planet. \nIt is where you and I live. We can't keep shifting environmental \nproblems to poorer countries who can't afford the level of clean air we \nenjoy. We must recognize that the worst thing in the world for the \nenvironment is not responsible logging or ranching or mining, but \npoverty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I noticed in the newspapers this morning\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\nthat the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee is suggesting \nthat he be given some $6.8 million to hire some 80 investigators on the \nissue of investigating campaign irregularities, apparently including \nthe ones that are in the paper about the Democratic National Committee, \nand more.\n  It seems to me the first step in dealing with the issue of \nirregularities in campaigns--and if there are some, they ought to be \ninvestigated--the first step would be to give the Federal Election \nCommission some teeth. Invest a little bit in the Federal Election \nCommission and give it some teeth, and let them investigate. But if we \nare going to investigate in Congress, if we are going to have a group \nof politicians investigating another group of politicians, I don't \nthink we need $6.8 million to do that. But if they decide to do that, I \nhave a suggestion: Go ahead and rent a truck and back it up to whatever \nhouse--the Republican National Committee or the Democratic National \nCommittee--and I hope all of them will encourage their minions to load \nup all the relevant paper and let people read it to see who did what, \nwho didn't do what and who didn't comply with laws and who did comply \nwith laws.\n\n  But it ought to be more than that. The trail of trouble, it seems to \nme, in campaign financing isn't just in the national committees--and \nthere are some problems in both national committees. One fellow went to \njail already earlier this year on the issue on the other side of the \naisle. There are plenty of questions on this side of the aisle with \nrespect to the DNC.\n  Let's find out where the trouble was and correct it. But that is not \nthe only place there is trouble on the campaign trail. Let's also \ninvestigate the growth of these 501(c)(3) organizations that some in \npolitics have created to get tax-exempt money and use it in the \npolitical system. Let's follow that string wherever that leads.\n  In my judgment, there are a substantial number of questions that need \nto be addressed by investigators in that whole range of areas. Once we \nstart down this trail, let's make sure we follow the fresh trail all \nthe way to the end, not just take a look at one little building or \nanother little building. Let's look at all of it.\n  I say to those who are concerned about it--and I am concerned about \nit--the first step ought to be for us to come to the floor of the \nSenate--we could do it this afternoon or early next week--and decide \nthere is too much money in politics and we ought to limit campaign \nspending.\n  The Supreme Court says that is hard to do, but there are mechanisms \nby which we could do it. If Republicans and Democrats decided to create \na system in which there were voluntary spending limitations, we would \nlimit spending in campaigns, and we would solve a lot of these \nproblems.\n  We have some folks trotting around here who think there is not enough \nmoney in politics. They say we spend more money on washing machines and \ndog food than we do on politics, suggesting somehow that politics is a \ncommercial activity like everything else, just buy and sell.\n  Our political system is our democracy. It ought not be for sale. What \nhas happened to money in politics is that it has ratcheted up out of \ncontrol in an exponential way, and it is time for us to put some limits \non campaign spending. Let's limit campaign spending, and let's make it \nstick. There is too much money in politics, and we can do the American \ndemocratic system and the American public a real service if we would, \non a bipartisan basis, decide to come together and support campaign \nfinance reform that has real and effective spending limits.\n  Yes, it can be done and it ought to be done today, tomorrow, next \nweek or next month. We do not need $6 million or 80 investigators to do \nthat. All we need is the will to decide there is too much money in \nAmerican politics and we ought to limit campaign spending.\n  Take a look at what has happened with campaign spending relative to \nthe consumer price index in this country. You will see the consumer \nprice index has risen a bit and campaign spending has risen out of \nsight. There is too much money in politics, and we ought to adopt a \nbill that the President will sign that limits spending in our political \nsystem.\n  Some won't like that, I suppose. We have one party that spends twice \nas much as another party. I suppose they would say, ``We have a 2-to-1 \nadvantage, so why would we want to do that?''\n  We ought to do it to clean up the political system. The fact is, \nthere have been abuses on both sides. Any abuse ought to be \ninvestigated, and we ought to investigate it thoroughly.

Mr. President, we are going to have a vote on a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget very soon. Some \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate in the last day or so said that \nthose of us who believe that when we put a provision in the \nConstitution requiring a balanced budget, we ought not enshrine in the \nConstitution the requirement to use the Social Security trust funds to \nbalance the budget, because we think it is dishonest budgeting. They \nsay, those of us who believe that, that is an accounting gimmick; just \nan accounting gimmick, they say.\n  There are two to three dozen folks over in the House of \nRepresentatives now, I am pleased to say, on the Republican side who \nare saying exactly what some of us have been saying for some long \nwhile, that it is not honest budgeting to collect money from paychecks \nof workers, call it Social Security taxes, tell them we promise we will \nput it in a trust fund, and then use it as an offset for other revenue \nso you can claim the budget is in balance when it isn't.\n\n  To those who say this is an accounting gimmick, I ask one question: \nWhy is it that when those who want to use this device of misusing \nSocial Security trust funds to balance the budget, why is it when their \nbudget is balanced, the Federal Government will still borrow $130 \nbillion more that year? Why, if your budget is in balance, is the \nFederal debt still growing?\n  The answer: The debt is still growing when those who advocate this \npractice claim the budget is in balance because the budget is not in \nbalance. It is a ruse. It is a charade. More than that, it is misusing \nmoney that if you did it in the private sector, you would be on your \nway to some minimum security installation, because you can't do it in \nthe private sector.\n  If you run a business and say to your employees, ``I will put money \naway in a pension program for you, but, by the way, I had a loss in my \nbusiness this year so I am going to take your pension money and offset \nit against my loss so I can say to people that I haven't lost any \nmoney,'' what happens to you isn't very pretty, because that is against \nthe law.\n  That is exactly what is proposed we enshrine in the Constitution, by \nsaying that we should take the Social Security trust funds and declare \nthem revenue with all other revenue and then declare that we have \nbalanced the budget.\n  In the same year when we declare we have balanced the budget, we will \nhave to increase the debt limit because the debt is still increasing. \nAnd when the folks in North Dakota or Wyoming or New Mexico or \nelsewhere ask us the question, ``If you have balanced the budget, why \ndid you have to increase the debt limit?'' I want to be around for the \nanswer, because the answer is, the budget was not balanced.\n  I think fiscal discipline is a pretty good thing. I come from a small \ntown, a small school, a small State. We believe in fiscal discipline. I \nam pleased I have been one of those who cast votes to reduce the \nFederal budget. The deficit is down 60 percent in the last 4 years. The \nlast 4 years in a row it has been down. I cast tough votes to do that.\n  I will continue to do that. I will cast a vote in the coming weeks to \nsupport a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But I will \nnot cast a vote\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\nthat puts something in the Constitution that is wrong. And it is \nfundamentally wrong to suggest that we take that balance of trust funds \nevery year and use it to balance the budget.\n  In 1983, I was on the House Ways and Means Committee. Mr. Greenspan, \nat that point, headed a commission to make recommendations on Social \nSecurity funding. The commission recommended that we begin to \naccumulate a pool of savings so that when the baby boomers retire, \nthere will be some money in the Social Security system to pay for their \nretirement. That is going to be the maximum strain on the Social \nSecurity system.\n  So we began to accumulate a surplus this year. We will collect $70 \nbillion more in Social Security than we spend from that same system. \nWhy? Because we designed to save that.\n  I will ask any of my colleagues on the floor whether double-entry \nbookkeeping means you can spend it twice. Can you claim you are saving \nit when in fact you use it over here with ordinary revenue and claim \nyou use it to balance the budget? The answer is ``no''. There is no \nstudy, no set of studies in this country, that allows you to make that \nclaim.\n  That is why, when we have a vote on a constitutional amendment to \nbalance the budget, we will vote on two of them. One I will vote for \nand offer along with colleagues, and one I will oppose. That is the one \nthat says, let us enshrine in the Constitution a practice that I think \nis fundamentally dishonest budgeting.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wanted to visit some other issues today. I shall not do \nthat and will wait until next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S839-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S840]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REAUTHORIZATION OF ISTEA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, one issue I want to visit is the need to \nreauthorize the ISTEA program or the highway program in this country. \nIt is important for States like North Dakota.\n  I notice the Senator from Alaska is on the floor. He will, I am sure, \nhave the same feelings about this that I have. We are large States in \nland mass, small States in population. We have a need to construct a \nnetwork of highways still across our States for interstate commerce and \nfor a whole range of needs, but we have a very small tax base with \nwhich to do it.\n  We have seen developed in this discussion who are the donor States \nand who are the donee States with respect to highway moneys. Well, that \nis largely irrelevant to me. If they want to ship fresh fruit and \nfrozen fish from Boston to Seattle, do they want to ship them on gravel \nroads through North Dakota and Wyoming? I do not think so. We want to \nmaintain and develop a National Highway System that works for \neverybody. That means that we need, as small States in the debate on \nthis highway system, fairness for the highway needs for our States.\n  I will just say that as we work through this debate in the coming \nweeks and months, those of us who come from States like North Dakota \nand Wyoming and Alaska and others are going to be working very hard to \nmake sure that we are treated fairly in this reauthorization. Mr. \nPresident, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S840-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S840-S841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SUBCOMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS, COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS, 105TH CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

ATWOOD, ALASKA PIONEER\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, Alaska lost one of its greatest 20th \ncentury pioneers this month, when Robert B. Atwood died on January 10.\n  Many today remember him as the man who edited and published Alaska's \nlargest newspaper, the Anchorage Times, for more than 50 years.\n  But some of my best memories are of the hours and days and weeks we \nspent\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\ntogether in the 1950's, when he was chairman of the Alaska Statehood \nCommittee and I was assistant to the Secretary of the Interior Fred \nSeaton as Alaskans sought Statehood.\n  Bob Atwood was a leader in that fight. He crystallized the support of \nour Nation's press to put the 49th star on our flag. It was his \nunderstanding and knowledge of the news media, and his friendships \namong editors and publishers across our Nation that brought the press \non board, to champion the cause for bringing Alaska into the union. Not \ntoo many years later, he was responsible for newspapers across our \nNation understanding the importance of building our great Alaska \npipeline.\n  Bob Atwood was more than a great publisher, more than the successful \nchairman of the Statehood Committee. He was a cultural renaissance man, \nwho did much behind the scenes to promote the arts and education in \nAlaska.\n  Bob loved new technology, and brought his newspaper into the computer \nage long before most of the Nation's largest dailies were on line. He \nwas the first one on the staff of the Anchorage Times to learn how to \nuse the new computers, while his staff struggled with the transition \nfrom typewriters to the electronic age.\n  His knowledge of history, and of the many serious- and humorous-\nstories about Alaska and Alaskans who shaped my State's history, was \nextraordinary. Bob was generous in sharing those stories with \norganizations and groups who asked him to speak or to attend their \nmeetings.\n  Above all, Bob Atwood understood the importance of a strong military \npresence in Alaska, the crossroads of the world, and he helped to make \nthe Nation aware of our strategic global position.\n  He was a tireless supporter of our service men and women, and \nremained friends with many of them long after their tours of duty in \nAlaska were over. For 40 years Bob served on the military's civilian \nadvisory boards in Alaska, and was president since 1976 of the Alaskan \nCommand Civilian Advisory Board. He assured that in Alaska there was--\nand still is--a partnership between our military stationed in our State \nand Alaskans.\n  Immediately after the 1964 earthquake, he told me he wanted to buy \nland and build a house close to the area most damaged by the \nearthquake, to show his confidence in the future of Alaska. He built \nthat house and opened it up time and again to men and women from our \nState and hundreds of others he had met during his travels in our \ncountry and all over the world.\n  My friend Bob was quietly generous to a number of causes which were \nnever publicized. In addition, he was proud of those which bear his \nname, to which he donated millions of dollars, including the Atwood \nchair in journalism at the University of Alaska, the Atwood Center at \nAlaska Pacific University, and the Evangeline Atwood Theater at \nAnchorage's performing arts center. His generosity touched the lives of \nthousands of Alaskans, though they may never have known it.\n  Bob Atwood had the manners of an old-fashioned gentleman, the \ncuriosity and sense of fun of a youngster, and writing and editing \ntalents that could only be achieved through graceful maturity and a \ngreat understanding and love of words.\n  In helping to make life better for all Alaskans, Bob Atwood made \nhistory. He was indeed a great man, who helped to make our great land \neven greater. He was also a dear, good and loyal friend. I will miss \nhim. Our sympathy goes out to his daughter Elaine and his grandsons and \ngranddaughter, to whom he was devoted.\n  As a visitor comes into my office, there is a photo of Bob Atwood and \nme with our snowmachines in the broad fields near Alyeska, the ski \nresort in my home town, Girdwood, AK. I cherish those days when I spent \ntime there with Bob, with Evangeline and Elaine Atwood.\n  Bob was a true Alaskan--a real pioneer.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S841-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S842]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TRIBUTE TO MAJ. GEN. CONRAD F. ``NICK'' NECRASON\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, our Nation lost one of the genuine heroes \nof World War II, a man who went on to a distinguished second career in \nAlaska, when Maj. Gen. Conrad F. ``Nick'' Necrason died this last \nmonth.\n  He was the recipient of the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, and the \nDistinguished Flying Cross. He also received our State of Alaska's \nhighest military award, the Legion of Merit.\n  He began his career at West Point. After his 1936 graduation, he went \non to flying school, earning his wings in the Army Air Corps the next \nyear.\n  When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, General Necrason was flying \nto Pearl Harbor as part of a bomber squadron. He loved to tell the \nstory of how he had to land on a golf course during the battle--the \nattack of the Japanese on Hawaii.\n  During World War II, General Necrason flew 360 air combat hours, and \nwas recognized for developing low-level bombing techniques. He flew a \nwhole variety of aircraft, most notably P-38 fighters and B-17 bombers. \nIn 1943, he was wounded in action over Burma.\n  A few years later, he flew bombers during the Korean conflict.\n  General Necrason came to Alaska at an exciting time, just as \nstatehood dawned, and was commander of the Alaskan Air Command at \nElmendorf Air Force Base from 1958 to 1961.\n  After retirement in 1965, he became Alaska's Adjutant General and \ncommander of the National Guard, serving from 1967 through 1972, and \nagain from 1974 to 1982.\n  During those years, he effected a successful restructuring of the \nAlaska Army National Guard and the Alaska Air National Guard.\n  He brought the great workhorses of the air, C-130's, into service in \nAlaska, expanded our Eskimo scout contingent by establishing training \nprograms for women, and led the guard in helping Alaska and Alaskans \nthrough floods and other natural disasters.\n  While many describe him as a soldier's soldier, Nick Necrason was \nequally as well-liked and at home in the civilian community.\n  He was known for his skill at bridge and at poker, and with his wife, \nMyrle, who survives him, as a gracious host, welcoming people from all \nparts of our State and our world to their home.\n  General Necrason's heroism during combat, his distinguished peacetime \ncareer, and his contributions to Alaska will not be forgotten. We \nextend our deepest sympathy to his wife Myrle, daughters Ginger and \nSandy, and his grandchildren.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S842-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S842-S843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        LIEUTENANT GENERAL SAMUEL E. EBBESEN, UNITED STATES ARMY\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, today I salute an outstanding military \nofficer, Lt. Gen. Samuel E. Ebbesen, U.S. Army. General Ebbesen is \nretiring this month with more than 35 years of dedicated service to our \ncountry, culminating in assignments as Commanding General, Second \nUnited States Army, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nMilitary Personnel Policy.\n  In his most recent position, he was responsible for the establishment \nof all policies concerning military personnel matters including \naccessions and retention programs; compensation and benefits; and the \nclassification, assignment and career development for the 1.4 million \nservice members of the Department of Defense. His accomplishments were \nmany, resulting in improved quality of life for our service members and \nthe enhanced readiness of our Armed Forces.\n  General Ebbesen, a native of St. Croix, VI, was commissioned in 1961 \nthrough the Reserve Officer Training Corps [ROTC]. He holds a Bachelor \nof Arts degree in political science from City College of New York and a \nMasters degree in public administration from Auburn University. His \nmilitary schooling includes the Infantry Officer Basic and Advanced \nCourses, U.S. Army Command and General Staff College, and the Air War \nCollege.\n  During his distinguished career, General Ebbesen served in numerous \nleadership and key staff positions throughout the Army. He served as \nthe commanding general, 6th Infantry Division, Light, Fort Wainwright, \nAK, as the deputy commander, Alaska Command [ALCOM] and as the \nassistant division commander, 6th Infantry Division, Light. After the \ndivision relocated--north of the range--in Alaska, General Ebbesen was \ninstrumental in\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\nsuccessfully integrating the 6th Infantry Division--Light--into the \nFairbanks community. He fostered strong community relationships which \nendure today. Under General Ebbesen's tenure, the 6th Infantry Division \nachieved safety records which were unsurpassed in the United States \nArmy at that time. This record was achieved in spite of adverse and \ndifficult climatic conditions. He ensured that the 6th Infantry \nDivision were pivotal players in the U.S. Pacific Command's Expanded \nRelations Program throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Further, General \nEbbesen significantly improved quality of life for those soldiers and \ntheir families stationed throughout Alaska.\n  Additionally, General Ebbesen served as the Deputy Chief, Legislative \nLiaison, Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison, United States \nArmy, Washington, DC; Chief of Staff, I Corps, Fort Lewis, WA; \ncommander, 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, Fort \nCampbell, KY; Deputy Chief, Plans and Operations Division, and later \nExecutive Officer, Office of the Chief, Legislative Liaison, Office of \nthe Secretary of the Army, Washington, DC; and Commander, 2d Battalion, \n32 Infantry, 7th Infantry Division; Executive Officer, 2d Brigade, 7th \nInfantry Division; and G3, 7th Infantry Division, Fort Ord, CA.\n  General Ebbesen's military awards and decorations include the Defense \nDistinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit--with 3 Oak Leaf Clusters, \nBronze Star Medal with ``V'' Device--with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters, \nMeritorious Service Medal--with Oak Leaf Cluster, Air Medal and Army \nCommendation Medal--with 2 Oak Leaf Clusters. His combat assignment and \ntraining resulted in the award of the Combat Infantry Badge. Expert \nInfantry Badge, Parachutist Badge, and Air Assault Badge. He is \nauthorized to wear the Army General Staff Identification Badge and the \nOffice of the Secretary of Defense Identification Badge.\n  Mr. President, I ask you and our colleagues to join me in saluting \nGeneral Ebbesen for his distinguished service to this great Nation and \nto the great State of Alaska, as well as his superb leadership of the \nmen and women of our Armed Forces. It is with great pride that I \ncongratulate him upon his retirement and wish him the very best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S842-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                MARITIME SECURITY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleague's \nattention to the outstanding efforts and hard work of the men and women \nof the U.S. Maritime Administration. I want to offer my own heartfelt \nthanks to those individuals for their hard work and dedication in \nswiftly implementing the Maritime Security Act.\n  The Maritime Security Act, which was approved by the Senate on \nSeptember 24, and signed into law by the President on October 8 last \nyear. It will ensure the continued viability of the U.S.-flag merchant \nmarine. It will guarantee that there will be an adequate number of \nprivate-sector, U.S.-flag vessels on hand for the Department of Defense \nin times of war or national emergency. Our Nation will continue to \nsupport a base of maritime employment to provide trained, loyal U.S.-\ncitizen merchant mariners to crew the Department of Defense's Ready \nReserve fleet of sealift vessels.\n  Quite simply, without this legislation the United States might have \nlost its merchant marine. Some of our Nation's most honored former \nmilitary leaders let us know last year, in no uncertain terms, just how \ncostly that would be. Our Armed Forces are counting on the U.S.-flag \nmerchant marine to bring them the supplies they need to sustain their \noperations on hostile shores. If history has taught us one lesson, Mr. \nPresident, we should hold a deep appreciation for the importance of the \nU.S.-flag merchant marine to our Nation's security. That is why the \noutstanding efforts of the Maritime Administration deserves \nrecognition.\n  In the days following enactment of the Maritime Security Act, the \nstaff of the Maritime Administration worked tirelessly to iron out the \ncontracts between the Government and the individual U.S.-flag vessel \noperators. This is the backbone of the Maritime Security Program.\n  At the same time, MARAD staff coordinated their efforts with the \nDepartment of Defense. This ensured that only the most modern and most \nmilitarily useful U.S.-flag vessels are chosen for the Maritime \nSecurity Program. These efforts will enhance our national defense \ncapabilities.\n  The first contracts were signed last month, just before the holidays. \nAnd, I am pleased to report to my colleagues that the final contracts \nwere just recently signed. In just 4 months, the complete 47-ship \nMaritime Security Fleet has become a reality. We have MARAD to thank \nfor taking our vision and translating it into a viable program.\n  I want to recognize the Administrator of MARAD, Vice Adm. Albert J. \nHerberger. His firm leadership at the helm of his agency has been \nexemplary. Vice Admiral Herberger is widely respected in the maritime \nindustry, and his abilities as a manager, a negotiator and an \nadministrator, coupled with his extensive military experience, played a \nmajor role in implementing this legislation.\n  The implementation of the Maritime Security Program also required the \nefforts of many MARAD employees. I want to take a moment to recognize \nseveral workers by name: Debra Aheron, Ray Barberesi, Murray Bloom, \nJoan Bondareff, Cher Brooks, Thomas Bryan, Jim Caponiti, Veronica \nCarver, Sharon Cassidy, Rhonda Davis, William Ebersold, John \nGraykowski, Steven Jackson, William Kurfehs, John Lesnick, Richard \nMcDonnell, Jeffrey McMahon, Robert Patton, Carol Powell, John Swank, \nKenneth Willis, and Joan Yim.\n  To conclude, Mr. President, I would like to add that the Maritime \nAdministration will continue to administer the Maritime Security \nProgram throughout the 10-year life of the Maritime Security Act. \nAlthough the work from the good folks at MARAD is just the beginning, \nwe should honor their efforts. They have done so much to ensure that \nthe American flag will still fly in the world's sea lanes. American \nmerchant mariners will be on the decks of those ships. And, our Armed \nForces will have the necessary strategic sealift capability to project \nAmerica's presence overseas.\n  Thank you, MARAD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S843-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RETIREMENT OF PROCTOR JONES\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today marks the last day for one of the \nSenate's most competent and skilled legislative aides. Proctor Jones, \nstaff director of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water \nDevelopment has spent the last 36 years helping to assure the \nlegislative process moves forward. I know I am just one of many who are \ngrateful for his guidance on a wide array of energy issues.\n  During his tenure in the Senate he has gained a reputation for doing \nhis homework, having a deep understanding for the appropriations \nprocess, and perhaps most important, fairness. He was invaluable in \nsecuring major projects for my home State of Kentucky, and I feel \ncertain his handprint can be found on important projects all across the \ncountry.\n  Jones leaves the Senate with an incredible body of knowledge, \nexpertise and institutional knowledge. He also leaves after literally \nbeing the right hand of such powerful chairmen as Senators Russell, \nEllender, McClellan, Magnuson, Stennis, Byrd and Hatfield.\n  It will be a huge loss to the Senate and to States like mine that \nhave benefitted from his knowledge and expertise. But there's no doubt \nthat Jones will continue to serve the greater community working with \nformer Senator Johnston.\n  Let me close by wishing him and his family the best of luck and by \nonce again thanking him for his commitment not only to the U.S. Senate, \nbut to the American people. His service will not be forgotten and will \ncontinue to impact generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S843-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S843-S844]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PAUL TSONGAS\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, last week, America lost a public servant \nand a leader of unusual intelligence and vision. It is with great \nsadness that I rise to pay tribute to my former colleague and friend, \nPaul Tsongas, whose untimely passing has deeply affected both those who \nknew him well and the millions of Americans who respected and admired \nhis exemplary life.\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\n  His frank and fearless commitment to a better America challenged us \nall. As remembered by the Hellenic Chronicle, a Massachusetts \npublication, Senator Tsongas ``changed the face of politics in the \n1990's and reminded us that honesty and the power of ideas can still \ncount for something in American politics.'' He was unwavering in his \nideals because he truly believed them. At his funeral, Bishop Methodios \nof Boston spoke of Senator Tsongas' insight, integrity and \nintelligence; fitting qualities for a person who, as the Bishop said, \n``looked deep within his heart and soul and there discovered his vision \nfor a better America.''\n  The son of a Greek immigrant, Senator Tsongas went from working in \nhis father's drycleaning store to Dartmouth College, Yale Law School, \nand the Peace Corps. He won his first bid for public office in 1969, \nwhen he was elected to the Lowell City Council, the beginning of an \nesteemed career that included service as Middlesex County Commissioner \nin 1973, fifth congressional district representative to the U.S. House \nin 1974 --the first Democrat to win in his district in a century, and \nUnited States Senator from Massachusetts in 1979, an office never \nbefore held by a Peace Corps veteran.\n  In the Senate, I was privileged to serve with Senator Tsongas on the \nBanking and Foreign Relations Committees, where he fulfilled his duties \nwith great capability and distinction. His understanding of the world \nbeyond our borders, gained during his service in the Peace Corps, \nequipped him to make a significant contribution to a more effective \nAmerican foreign policy. Senator Tsongas never took the privilege of \nbeing a U.S. Senator for granted. He was serious about his work and had \nhigh hopes and even higher standards for this country.\n  ``Patriotism is like charity,'' wrote Henry James. ``It begins at \nhome.'' For Senator Tsongas, everything began at home. Whether it was \nLowell, the town in which he made his life, or the family that was his \nlife, Senator Tsongas never lost sight of what was most important. He \noften questioned the legacy he would leave behind for the people and \nplaces he cared for most. He should not have been concerned. Due to his \nefforts both in and out of office, the town of Lowell now claims a \nnational historic park, thousands of jobs, a minor league baseball \nteam, 14 new schools, and a real sense of pride. As the local paper \nnoted, ``We in Lowell need only walk through our city to celebrate--\nevery day--what Paul Tsongas did for his hometown.''\n  I will always remember Paul Tsongas, as will his fellow Americans, as \na highly principled public servant who, unafraid of any challenge, was \nexceedingly able to affect the issues of his time. I will also remember \nhim as the individual who inspired us all by confronting his own \nmortality with extraordinary grace and heroism. His faith in his own \ninstincts not only gave him the courage to step down from office when \nthe time was right, it was also the source of his strength during his \ndistinguished service in the Congress of the United States.\n  Senator Tsongas left an indelible mark on our hearts, which now go \nout to his wife Niki, his daughters Ashley, Katina and Molly, and his \nsisters Thaleia and Vicki. They have so much to mourn, but they also \nhave so much of which to be proud.\n  There is a requiem hymn sung in the Greek Orthodox Church which, \nhere, seems apropos: ``Eonia e mneeme.'' It means, ``may he live in our \nmemories forever.'' In the last years of his life, Senator Tsongas \nstruggled with the question of history, with what he would leave us. \nThe answer is, clearly, much. Paul Tsongas will live in the memories \nand records of his country, his town, and his family, forever.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I know that Senator Kennedy wanted to \nbe recognized, but because he is not here I ask unanimous consent that \nI be permitted to speak in morning business for such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S843-3", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S844-S846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CHINA: THE FUTURE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a speech that this Senator made to the Asia \nSociety yesterday morning entitled, ``China: The Future.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           China: The Future\n\n                     (By Senator Dianne Feinstein)\n\n       As a Californian, I have been surprised to discover how \n     Washington, and the whole East Coast foreign policy \n     establishment tends to look primarily across the Atlantic to \n     Europe, and how little it looks to Asia and the Pacific.\n       But the fact is that U.S. interests are no longer primarily \n     in Europe. You've heard the phrase ``the dawning of the \n     Pacific Century'' many times. Well, the Pacific Century is \n     here.\n       Consider these facts: The Pacific trading theater has long \n     since overtaken the Atlantic. Overall trade with Asia stands \n     at $570 billion. With Europe it is $270 billion. Trade with \n     Asia accounts for more than 30 percent of U.S. exports and \n     close to 40 percent of U.S. imports. And today, more than 60 \n     percent of the world's population lives on both sides of the \n     Pacific Ocean.\n       All of this illustrates what Secretary of State John Hay \n     meant when he said nearly a century ago: ``The Mediterranean \n     is the ocean of the past; the Atlantic, the ocean of the \n     present; and the Pacific, the ocean of the future.'' That \n     future is now.\n\n\n                           china's importance\n\n       The single most important question facing the future of \n     peace and prosperity in Asia is how China develops.\n       And there is no more important challenge facing U.S. \n     foreign policy than the question of how to peacefully engage \n     China in the international community.\n       China's influence is felt in so many ways: China's \n     population of 1.25 billion, is nearly one quarter of the \n     world's inhabitants; China's sheer size--her geographical \n     reach includes common borders with such key nations as \n     Russia, Japan, Korea, and India, and includes vast quantities \n     of untapped natural resources; China's expanding military \n     prowess, including a 3 million-man army, and her status as \n     one of the five declared nuclear powers in the world today; \n     China's permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council; and \n     China's remarkable economic growth of roughly 10 percent a \n     year, which has vaulted it to the position of the world's \n     11th largest exporter--China is where Japan was in 1980, but \n     growing much faster.\n       For all of these reasons, the U.S. relationship with China \n     is probably our single most important undeveloped bilateral \n     relationship in the world today.\n       In 1997, Sino-American relations are entering a crucial new \n     phase, ripe with both danger and opportunity.\n       Events in the next year, and how they are handled by \n     Washington and Beijing, will determine for some time to come \n     the nature of the relationship between our two countries.\n       I was very pleased to hear our new Secretary of State, \n     Madeleine Albright, articulate the Administration's policy in \n     clear terms during her confirmation hearing before the \n     Foreign Relations Committee. She said: ``Our goal is to \n     expand areas of cooperation, reduce the potential for \n     misunderstandings and encourage China's full emergence as a \n     responsible member of the international community.''\n       And, while she recognized that our two nations have \n     important differences, the Secretary also stressed that we \n     have a multifaceted relationship with China.\n       I want to make some comments this morning on what I believe \n     to be the central issues in the U.S.-China relationship \n     today: the question of engagement versus containment; the \n     China-Taiwan relationship; nuclear proliferation; human \n     rights; the trade imbalance; trade issues such as Most-\n     Favored Nation status, Intellectual Property Rights, and \n     China's accession to the WTO; and the transition of Hong \n     Kong.\n\n\n               The ``Engagement vs. Containment'' Debate\n\n       This question should be settled by now, but unfortunately \n     it is not. There are still those who see China as an enemy, \n     and who want the U.S.-China relationship to be modeled on \n     Cold War strategies of the past, Containment is their mantra. \n     But there are two problems with this approach:\n       First, it has not and will not work. No other country will \n     join us in trying to contain the largest country and one of \n     the fastest growing economies in the world.\n       Second, containment is not in the interest of the United \n     States. We have far too many mutual interests with China--\n     interests which far outweigh our differences, including: \n     preserving stability, and preventing arms races in Northeast \n     and Southeast Asia; a peaceful, non-nuclear Korean Peninsula; \n     preventing nuclear escalation between India and Pakistan; \n     preventing the introduction of nuclear or other destabilizing \n     technology into the Persian Gulf; keeping sea lanes open for \n     international commerce; maintaining the prosperity of Hong \n     Kong and Taiwan; and curbing the trafficking of narcotics.\n       Attempting to influence these critically important issues \n     by isolating China is a fruitless and very dangerous course \n     of action. The only way we can make progress on these issues \n     is through active engagement.\n       I have been saying for the past four years that I have been \n     in the Senate that the U.S. needs to develop a long-term, \n     strategic framework for building a relationship with China, \n     based on our many mutual interests.\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\n       No single issue should be a litmus test for the entire \n     U.S.-China relationship.\n       Managing and developing a positive relationship with China \n     does not mean we must ignore the importance of key issues of \n     concern with China--such as human rights, the transition of \n     Hong Kong, or the issue of Taiwan. It does, however, mean \n     that we should not allow our entire relationship to be called \n     into question each time an incident occurs.\n       The United States must develop a long-range, strategic plan \n     for our relationship with China.\n       The US must engage China. This engagement must be ongoing, \n     it must be consistent, and it must be formed at the highest \n     levels.\n       To date, interaction at the Presidential, Vice \n     Presidential, Secretary of State, and Secretary of Defense \n     level has not been frequent or deep enough. There is no ``red \n     telephone'', no ability for the two Presidents to talk and \n     work with each other during a crisis.\n       We cannot engage China solely at a second-tier level. Talks \n     at the Deputy Assistant Secretary level are not sufficient, \n     and, in the absence of regular higher level contacts, are \n     probably counter-productive in the message it sends to \n     China's leaders.\n       Secretary Albright will be meeting soon with Foreign \n     Minister Qian Qichen, and she is committed to regular contact \n     with her counterparts in Beijing. Vice President Gore will be \n     traveling to Beijing this spring, setting the stage for an \n     exchange of presidential visits this fall and next year.\n       These are positive steps that I hope will lead to \n     development of sustained communication at the very highest \n     levels.\n       President Clinton has an opportunity to shape the future \n     course of Sino-American relations by developing a positive \n     working relationship with Chinese President Jiang Zemin and \n     other leaders, I hope he will seize this opportunity.\n       Congress also has an important role to play in this \n     process.\n       It is critical that more members of Congress travel to \n     China, meet with those in the Chinese leadership and others, \n     and develop a working dialogue with those who are creating \n     the China of the 21st century.\n\n\n                     the china-taiwan relationship\n\n       Taiwan remains the one issue with the greatest potential to \n     seriously disrupt efforts to stabilize the U.S.-China \n     relationship. It is impossible to overstate the depth of \n     Chinese feelings about Taiwan's role in the U.S.-China \n     relationship. They are real, visceral, and deep.\n       During my trip this past November, Chinese officials and \n     citizens made it clear: If the Taiwan issue is handled well, \n     everything is possible in Sino-American relations; if it is \n     mishandled, it will continue to shock, and possibly derail, \n     U.S.-China relations.\n       The United States should, I believe, consistently and \n     authoritatively reaffirm, both to Beijing and to Taipei, its \n     commitment to the long-standing and bipartisan ``One China'' \n     policy, as outlined in the three Joint Communiques.\n       It must be remembered that the status quo has been \n     beneficial to all three parties, allowing Taiwan to become \n     prosperous and democratic, and the U.S. and China to develop \n     normalized relations befitting two world powers.\n       So Taiwan must understand that its efforts to assert itself \n     internationally cannot be a guise for moving towards \n     independence.\n       For its part, China should consistently make clear that \n     reunification would take place only through peaceful means, \n     and should refrain from any aggressive military actions and \n     rhetoric.\n       Any impression that China might try to settle the Taiwan \n     issue by the use of force presents a challenge not just to \n     Taiwan but also, under the Taiwan Relations Act, to the \n     United States as well. We could not stand idly by and \n     countenance a military attack.\n       At the same time, Washington must make clear to Beijing \n     that U.S. interests require continued robust--albeit \n     unofficial--ties with Taipei, which are consistent with the \n     ``One China'' policy.\n       Such unofficial access, however, should not be confused in \n     either Beijing or Taipei as an invitation for official \n     recognition by the U.S. We must not allow another incident \n     such as the issuance of a visa to President Lee Teng-hui two \n     years ago to needlessly provoke a crisis.\n       The United States should encourage Taiwan and China to \n     resume the Cross-Straits Initiative that was conducted by \n     China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits \n     and Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation, which showed such \n     promise until it was derailed a year and a half ago.\n\n\n                            nonproliferation\n\n       One of the most important areas of concern in our \n     relationship with China is nuclear nonproliferation.\n       Clearly China's record on nonproliferation is mixed. China \n     has ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention--something the \n     U.S. Senate has not yet done--and signed the Comprehensive \n     Test Ban Treaty, as well as cooperated in efforts to extend \n     the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT) indefinitely.\n       China has made important commitments, such as abiding by \n     the guidelines of the Missile Technology Control Regime \n     (MTCR) and not providing assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear \n     facilities.\n       Nevertheless, we continue to have concerns about nuclear \n     and missile technology that China has provided to Pakistan, \n     and the possibility of similar sales to Iran.\n       It is vital that China be engaged in a new security \n     partnership, one that is cooperative rather than \n     confrontational. As I said earlier, isolating a nation of \n     China's growing power and influence makes little sense.\n       China has recognized our mutual interest in preventing \n     nuclear proliferation in North Korea. It is also clearly in \n     the interests of both China and the United States to ensure \n     that tensions are de-escalated in South Asia, where both \n     India and Pakistan have the ability to launch nuclear devices \n     in a matter of days.\n       We should encourage China to join us in the development of \n     a coherent nuclear non-proliferation strategy, as a co-\n     guarantor of stability and security in these regions.\n       We must try to convince China that arms control regimes \n     should be adhered to not for ideological or legalistic \n     purposes, but because they are in China's own best interest.\n       If China is willing to become an active and responsible \n     party to international treaties and regimes, China should be \n     granted an equal say in setting the ``rules of the game.'' \n     China must, of course, then agree to abide by those rules \n     along with every other nation.\n       A partnership between China and the United States toward \n     nuclear non-proliferation and stability is the key to success \n     in these regions.\n\n\n                              human rights\n\n       As I said earlier, no issue should be a litmus test in our \n     relationship with China. But at times, human rights has been \n     just that.\n       The U.S. has tried lecturing China on human rights; We have \n     expressed outrage, and our relationship has zigged and zagged \n     with each arrest, newly reported case of torture, or other \n     egregious happening; And we have tried linking human rights \n     to Most Favored Nation trading status.\n       These efforts have clearly been unsuccessful.\n       Let me speak about the negatives first.\n       I am remain deeply concerned by China's treatment of \n     dissidents and its constant persecution of Tibetans in Tibet. \n     I have talked with Tibetan refugees personally--some in Napal \n     this past November--and I believe their stories to be true.\n       I believe there has been a tightening by the Chinese \n     government on human rights in the last year.\n       For those of us who watch China closely, there are a number \n     of signs. There has been a recent crackdown on religious \n     liberties.\n       In Jiangxi province in November, 80 Catholics were \n     arbitrarily arrested without warrants, beaten, and jailed.\n       There have been many recent arrests of leading dissidents, \n     often resulting in disproportionately long sentences. Fro \n     example: Wei Jingsheng was sentenced for 14 years; Chen Xi \n     was sentenced for 10 years; Wang Dan was sentenced for 11 \n     years in prison plus two years deprivation of political \n     rights.\n       I cannot conceive of a reason why it is in China's \n     interests to do these things. But whatever the reason, it is \n     very disturbing, and it portends real danger for Hong Kong, \n     which is a very religious Chinese community.\n       But let me also mention the positive side.\n       It must be recognized that progress is taking place in \n     China. For example, the National People's Congress just \n     enacted legislation intended to: help protect individuals \n     from arbitrary punishment by police and government agencies; \n     limit the practice ``administrative detention'' to thirty \n     days; and require the State Council to secure the approval of \n     the National People's Congress before declaring martial law.\n       As one who has traveled to China dozens of times over the \n     last 20 years, it is clear to me that there have been \n     remarkable changes: an increasing standard of living, \n     increased wages, and savings, and improved education of the \n     people; greater mobility and a freer lifestyle for the \n     average Chinese; local and provincial governments that are \n     more independent from Beijing--with over 300 million Chinese \n     participating in direct local and provincial elections; a \n     growing web of private property ownership in the provinces, \n     and greater legal protection for the owners and investors in \n     private enterprises; a more accessible court system for \n     Chinese citizens to contest government actions that infringe \n     on their freedoms and property.\n       To appreciate the scope of these changes one only needs to \n     look back a mere 35 years to the Cultural Revolution and \n     Great Leap Forward, during which millions of Chinese lost \n     their lives in unprecedented brutality.\n       Yes, these changes are in their infancy compared to Western \n     standards, but it is important to understand that China is a \n     $5,000 year old nation--a nation governed by the rule of man \n     for most of its history. It will not transition to the rule \n     of law overnight--no matter how much pressure is applied from \n     outside forces.\n       It was interesting for me to read an article by Henry Rowen \n     entitled ``The Short March,'' in which he describes \n     conducting a Lexis-Nexis search on China and human rights in \n     five major U.S. publications.\n       For the period January 1991 through June 1996 he found ``on \n     the one hand, 356 stories on abuses of various kinds, and on \n     the other hand, 3 on local elections, 16 on efforts to \n     introduce a rule of law, and 10 on the liberalizing of the \n     mass media: in short, an overall ratio of 12 to 1.''\n       So clearly, the bad gets reported and the good does not.\n       I believe that China will not change its ways merely to \n     please America. The real key to change is convincing China \n     that it in China's interests to change. And I believe that \n     this can be done.\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\n       Most importantly, the U.S. should work with China to \n     develop a modern legal system with an independent judiciary, \n     due process of law and a modern penal and civil codes. China \n     is receptive to our help in this area.\n       Through engagement and assistance such as this we can do \n     more to advance the cause of human rights in China in the \n     long run than through constant castigation, or isolation.\n       I would like to make a proposal that may be acceptable to \n     both sides. I would propose a presidential human rights \n     commission or forum. This commission would be appointed by \n     both presidents, with the mission of charting the evolution \n     of human rights in both countries over the last 20 to 30 \n     years.\n       In reports to be delivered to both presidents, the \n     commission would point out the successes and failures--both \n     Tiananmen Square and Kent State--and make recommendations for \n     goals for the future.\n\n\n                      The Growing Trade Imbalance\n\n       Another area of increasing concern is the growing trade gap \n     with China.\n       What is essentially a trade problem today will become an \n     acute political problem in the U.S.-China relationship if it \n     is left unaddressed.\n       I have communicated my concern about this issue to the \n     Chinese leadership. They agree that this is a potential \n     problem, but they dispute the size of the trade imbalance.\n       The United States calculates the imbalance at about $38 \n     billion, while the Chinese figure is closer to $10 billion.\n       When I was in China in November I proposed to Zhu Rongji, \n     the Executive Vice Premier, who is in effect China's economic \n     czar, that the United States and China establish a joint \n     working group to sit down and establish once and for all a \n     common method of calculating the trade imbalance, especially \n     after Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese rule. Zhu Rongji told \n     me he would support such a proposal.\n\n\n                       Most Favored Nation Status\n\n       Another constant flashpoint is the annual battle over \n     China's Most Favored Nation Trading status.\n       Every summer Congress and the Administration go through a \n     sort of ritual dance over the extension of MFN status to \n     China. Congress had never overridden a President's decision \n     to extend MFN for China, but we have often voted on it \n     anyway.\n       Last year, the House, by a resounding vote of 286-141, \n     rejected an attempt to deny or condition China's MFN status. \n     It would be helpful to have that vote settle it once and for \n     all, but, unfortunately, we are less than five months away \n     from the next go around, which I suspect may not be any less \n     rancorous.\n       The political implications of revoking MFN for China are \n     great. For a country such as China, where face and respect \n     are such central issues, the debate over revoking MFN is seen \n     as tantamount to the United States telling China that we are \n     still unsure whether to accept them as a member of the family \n     of nations.\n       Denying MFN would seriously impair our ability to work with \n     China on just about any issue.\n       Clearly, linking human rights with MFN has been a failure. \n     I hope we do not make the same mistake twice by linking it to \n     something else, like the negotiations on China's accession to \n     the WTO.\n       MFN is our standard trading status, and it is granted to \n     all but seven rogue states.\n       It is time to put an end to this destructive debate year \n     after year. I support making MFN for China permanent.\n\n\n                               HONG KONG\n\n       In the short run, the transition of Hong Kong is seen by \n     some as a bellwether for China's willingness to act as a \n     responsible great power.\n       It is key and critical that ``one country, two systems'' be \n     carried out. The world is clearly watching to see whether in \n     fact it is possible to have within China an autonomous region \n     that charts its own domestic policy.\n       The Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law \n     provide the foundation for the transfer, and for the future \n     governance and economic life of Hong Kong.\n       I am troubled by the legislation submitted last week to the \n     National People's Congress that would undo the Hong Kong bill \n     of rights. Lu Ping, the Chinese official in charge of the \n     Hong Kong transition, told me directly in Beijing in November \n     that the question of public protest and assembly was a matter \n     for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), and if \n     SAR law permitted public expressions of dissent, China would \n     have no objection.\n       If the central government of China reverses Hong Kong's \n     Bill of Rights, and other civil liberties, it would be a blow \n     to the credibility of ``one country, two systems.''\n       Additionally, I would hope that the provisional legislature \n     meeting this week in Shenzhen is sensitive to the pledge of \n     domestic autonomy for Hong Kong.\n       I strongly agree with Secretary Albright when she said that \n     the way events play out in Hong Kong will have an important \n     effect on the overall U.S.-China relationship.\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       With this new Congress, and an Administration now seasoned \n     in its second term, we now have the opportunity to move \n     beyond some of the events that have soured Sino-American \n     relations in the past several years.\n       President Clinton and Secretary Albright must immerse \n     themselves fully in the details of this most delicate and \n     critical of American relations.\n       In the final analysis, the goal of American policy must be \n     to encourage China toward a full and active relationship with \n     the West and to work together toward a China that is able to \n     take its role as a stable leader of Asia and a guarantor of \n     peace and security in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S844-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S846-S848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WELFARE REFORM\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, we begin the 105th Congress with a \nsober recognition of the fact that the Federal Government cannot solve \nall problems. Anyone who questions this premise need only look at \npainful choices that must be made in order to balance the Federal \nbudget, our first and most difficult task this session.\n  Having said that, the clearest message, I think, sent to us this past \nNovember was that the people of America want Republicans and Democrats \nto work together to solve real problems. I have been very concerned and \nI might even say dismayed by statements made by Members of this body \nand the House, that under no circumstances will there be any changes, \nno matter how meritorious, no matter how necessary, to the welfare bill \nwhich passed last year.\n  Mr. President, when this body debated and approved the historic \nwelfare reform bill last year, I outlined to my colleagues what I saw \nas some of the major flaws in the drafting of that bill, and as a \nresult, the impact that this legislation will have on the largest State \nin the Union--California. I want to take an opportunity this afternoon \nto update those comments.\n  The impact of this bill on California is huge. At this stage, it \nreally is not fully known or even understood. Some estimate that \nCalifornia will absorb about $17 billion of the $55 billion saved by \nthis bill. That is a body blow to our safety net. It could have a \ncatastrophic impact both financially and in terms of human lives. I \nvoted, because of this, against that welfare bill.\n  I am not alone in my concerns. Even the Republican Governors, many of \nthem poster-children for the reform effort, are looking at the fine \nprint now and saying, ``How is my State going to pay for these costs? \nHow are we going to provide the necessary care? How are we going to \nmeet these requirements without turning people out on the streets?''--\nfor some, in large numbers. Even the Republican Governors are asking \nfor changes.\n  A headline in the Washington Post 2 days ago said it pretty clearly: \n``After getting responsibility for welfare, States may pass it down,'' \nsomething that I, as a county supervisor and a mayor for some 18 years, \nrecognize that it is exactly the way it goes. The buck usually stops \nwith the lowest rung of a government. That is just what is going to \nhappen with this bill. In California, a proposition 13 State, there is \nno way for local governments to raise their taxes or their revenue \npotential to deal with the problem.\n  In the months since the passage of the welfare bill, I directed my \nstaff to examine how this bill would impact California counties. To \ndate, my staff has met with the welfare directors of 22 out of \nCalifornia's 58 counties. Their pleas were nearly universal. I will \nshare them with you. The work requirements, they say, as currently \noutlined in the bill will most probably not be attainable even under \nthe most optimistic of circumstances. The child care funds in the bill \nfor California are not enough to satisfy the requirements of the bill. \nThe legal immigrant provisions denying food stamps and SSI, \nparticularly to the elderly, the sick, and the disabled, will have a \ndevastating impact on county general assistance programs. The biggest \nimpact will be on the largest county in the State, Los Angeles County. \nAnd the counties tell me they have no computer ability to track and \nmonitor recipients under the new rules. How do they comply?\n  Some of the changes asked for by these counties are technical in \nnature, such as increasing the time permitted for job search to be more \nrealistic for areas where the average search even for nonwelfare \nrecipients is twice as long as that permitted under the bill. Other \nchanges are more fundamental, such as restoring some assistance to the \nelderly and disabled legal immigrants. I know President Clinton shares \nmany of these concerns, and will propose a number of changes in his \nbudget soon to be released.\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\n  I hope the door is not closed to at least looking at what the facts \nare. I believe it would really be unconscionable, and in a sense, the \nheight of irresponsibility, to arbitrarily say we will not look at any \nproblem or any misdrafting in that bill. I will point out one area in \nmy remarks later where I think it is simply a case of misdrafting.\n\n  Let me speak for a moment about legal immigrants. There are 500,000 \nelderly and disabled noncitizens nationwide who will lose SSI by August \n22, 1997. Of these legal immigrants 205,000 are in California--more \nthan 40 percent. That is a very real problem. Many of these individuals \nare seriously ill and completely destitute, with no family capable of \nsupporting them. In Los Angeles County alone, there are 93,000 such \npeople, and the ultimate transfer to the county will be in the hundreds \nof millions of dollars. When they lose their benefits they will turn to \nthe counties.\n  Just last week, California's State legislative analyst's office \nestimated the ban on SSI and food stamps will cost California $5.8 \nbillion over 6 years. Now, either this is a massive cost-shift or the \nhomeless in America and in California are going to be greatly adding to \ntheir numbers. In Los Angeles County alone the nonmedical costs of \nsupporting elderly and disabled legal immigrants could top $236 million \nannually.\n  San Francisco also estimates that 20,000 legal noncitizens may turn \nto the county's general assistance program, at a total cost of up to \n$74 million annually.\n  Let me give an actual example from my hometown legal immigrants. My \nSan Francisco staff met with a 73-year-old legal immigrant on SSI. She \nwas welcomed to this county from Vietnam in 1980. She was a refugee \nfrom communism with no family in the United States. She speaks no \nEnglish and she is suffering from kidney failure. She requires dialysis \nthree times a week. Under this new law, this 73-year-old woman will \nlose SSI, her only source of support. Her well-being will become the \nresponsibility, somehow, some way, of the county.\n  During the welfare debate I proposed an amendment to make this \nsection of the bill prospective. I understand the majority's concern \nthat the legal immigrants' use of SSI was increasing at a higher ratio \nthan U.S. citizens' use of SSI. I understand wanting to slow that \nnumber down. The way to do it is to say that in the future, everyone \ncoming to this country following the date of enactment, which was \nAugust 22 last year, know that when you come to the United States of \nAmerica as a legal immigrant, you are not eligible for SSI. For the \npeople here before that time, what I propose is that there be an \namendment to the bill that would say SSI could be continued for those \nwho have no other verifiable source of support. These are the elderly, \nthey are monolingual, they are destitute, and many of them are ill.\n  Let me speak for a moment, Mr. President, about the work requirements \nof the bill, because counties throughout California are really \nconcerned.\n  Under the new welfare law, 25 percent of single-parent families on \nwelfare and 75 percent of two-parent families on welfare must be \nengaged in work activities this year. By 2002, the requirements rise to \n50 percent of single-parent families and 90 percent of two-parent \nfamilies.\n  California's economy is recovering, but our unemployment rate is \nstill 1\\1/2\\ points above the national rate. It is 6.8 percent. The \nnational rate is 5.4 percent. So some 1 million Californians are still \non unemployment.\n  Let me give you some examples of how unrealistic the work \nrequirements of the welfare bill are on certain counties in California.\n  In Tulare County, the heart of the great Central Valley, the heart of \nthe area that has the largest agriculture producers in the United \nStates, the unemployment rate is 16.3 percent, more than 10 percentage \npoints above the Nation, and one-third of the county is on public \nassistance--one-third of the county. There are no jobs for people.\n  In Merced County--again in the Central Valley--unemployment is even \nhigher at 16.8 percent. Thirty-five percent of the population there \nreceives some type of public assistance.\n  Here are others: Imperial County, 27 percent unemployment; Madera, \n15.9; Monterey, 10.6 percent; Stanislaus County, 17.3 percent; and \nSonoma County, 14 percent.\n  And these are not small population areas. In some of the cases, the \npopulation of these counties is actually more than the population of \nsome of the States. These are larger areas.\n  With 2.7 million families in California on welfare, counties fear \nthat the work requirement, as defined in the new welfare law, simply is \nnot realistic for the State to be able to meet.\n  California is simply not creating jobs fast enough, and the kinds of \njobs that the State is creating are high-technology, biotech, highly \nskilled jobs, and jobs in the import-export business; jobs that relate \nto Asia; jobs that have a level of educational requirement that can \nproduce a high skill level.\n  In Riverside County in southern California, their GAIN Program, which \nis their welfare-to-work program, is the most successful program of its \nkind in the Nation. It is 12 years old. It has been the model for other \nprograms all throughout the United States. Yet, in that time, only 14 \npercent of single-parent families currently meet the work requirement \nas set under welfare reform. And only 15 percent of two-parent families \nmeet the work requirement. That is after 12 years of trying. If \nRiverside County can't meet the requirements, how many counties and \nStates nationwide will actually be able to do so?\n  That is why I urge that the President and Members of Congress to \nallocate some new funds--countercyclical moneys--that would apply \nparticularly in counties where the unemployment rate is at a certain \namount. You might want to make it over 1 percentage point from the \nnational average, particularly in areas where there is a high welfare \nload, which gives testament to the fact that you can't produce jobs in \nthat county.\n  I feel that Congress should amend the welfare law in significant ways \nto make it easier for States to meet the work requirements. And I would \nlike to suggest some of them.\n  Doubling the time allowed for job search activities from 6 weeks to \n12 weeks. That is what they say it actually takes and where there is \nsuccess.\n  Expand the welfare law's definition of ``work'' to include 2 years of \nvocational education instead of 1. That is what they say it requires to \nbe employable.\n  Include people who--this is a glitch, I think, in the drafting of the \nbill and one of the reasons that I am so concerned that the \nannouncement has been made that even technical changes will not be made \nto the bill. The way the bill is drafted, it does not include people \nwho leave welfare for work and those who are immediately placed in a \ngiven month as part of the State's total number of people moving from \nwelfare to work. So, In other words, the way the bill is drafted, you \ndon't get credit for the people that month you place in jobs. I think \nthat this is a technical glitch. I think it is a drafting error. I \nthink it is easy to correct. But if we have this policy of nothing no \nmatter whenever it is not going to get corrected.\n\n  I would suggest creating a countercyclical funding program for the \nnext 6 years, and I suggest targeting counties with high unemployment \nand high welfare caseloads.\n  Child care funding increases: Under the new welfare law, the money is \ninsufficient to accommodate the increasing demands. Currently, my State \nsubsidizes child care for 205,000 low-income children. But there are \n1.8 million children on welfare in California--1.8 million. The State \ncurrently only has funds to subsidize 205,000.\n  In order to accommodate the increases in the work requirements which \nare required by this bill from 25 percent in 1997 to 50 percent in 2002 \nfor an individual recipient, I would propose adding an additional $1.43 \nbillion in child care funding over the next 6 years.\n  I would also propose exempting parents with children under the age of \n12, instead of 6, from the work requirement if they cannot find child \ncare.\n  This bill--mark my words--will be known as the ``latchkey mandate \nbill'' if people can't find work. And there is no reason for any child \nin elementary school be left home alone without any adult supervision.\n  Let me speak for just a moment on the reporting requirements.\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\n  When Federal welfare reform was enacted, little attention was paid to \nthe 15 new reporting requirements that the law imposes on the States--\neverything from welfare recipients' race and citizenship status, to \nother Federal benefits they receive, to unemployment status and \nearnings.\n  California, like many other States, has no computer system in place \nto track and report all of this data. And without effective tracking \nand reporting, the Nation's largest State has no hope of enforcing the \ntime limit and preventing welfare fraud. Contra Costa County's welfare \ndirector said that his county's ability to meet the reporting \nrequirements of the bill is ``literally zip.'' This is a big county.\n  I think that the welfare law's reporting requirements are important, \nand I do not advocate relaxing them. But I do believe that the counties \nare going to require additional support in the form of computer \nassistance that is greater than that which is provided in the bill \ntoday, and that we ought not to be so fixed that we cannot take a look \nat it.\n  I make these comments at this time in the hope that someone might \nread them, or even see them, or take notice of them, and that this \nstatement that there will be no amendments to this bill can perhaps be \nchanged to ``Well, we will carefully consider amendments.''\n  I thank the Chair.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on a subject which I \nhave frequently addressed in the past, one that is extremely important \nto me and I think to every Member of this body--in fact, to everybody \nin this country: judicial activism.\n  We are witnessing today a rising tide of concern, shared not just by \nmy Republican colleagues and myself, but indeed by an ever-growing \nsegment of the public at large, about judicial activism and the \nprospect of filling the courts with more activists over the next 4 \nyears. Today, when we talk about activists, we are talking about people \nwho are substituting their own personal preferences for what the law \nreally is--those who choose as unelected judges appointed for life to \nmake laws from the bench and to usurp the powers of the legislative and \nexecutive branches of this Government. They are not elected to make the \nlaws, but are appointed to interpret the laws.\n  Today, I would like to point out an especially egregious abuse of \njudicial power about which I have just learned. Judge Gladys Kessler, a \nClinton appointee to the District Court for the District of Columbia--\nthat is the U.S. district court for the District of Columbia--took the \ntruly extraordinary step, and as far as I know, a step which is \nvirtually unprecedented in our Federal judicial system, and actually \nissued an order to show cause to three sitting U.S. Fourth Circuit \njudges--Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals judges, judges that are above \nher in the Federal system: Judges Karen Williams, Frances Murnaghan, \nand senior Judge Butzner. Judge Kessler in effect is seeking to force \nthose appellate judges to come before her, a U.S. district court judge, \nand justify a decision that they recently handed down. Judge Kessler's \norder was personally served on Judge Williams' law clerk just \nyesterday. Let me tell you about this shocking order, dated January 3, \n1997, and issued in Civil Action No. 96-2875-GK.\n  In 1972, one Restoney Robinson pled guilty in North Carolina State \ncourt to first-degree murder.\n  He was sentenced to life in prison, and he has since been imprisoned \nin North Carolina--which is located within the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals' jurisdiction. After losing all of his appeals in the State \ncourts, this convicted murderer, Mr. Robinson, has apparently been \npeppering the Federal district court for the middle district of North \nCarolina with frivolous petitions and, appealing the denials of those \npetitions to the higher court, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I \nunderstand that Mr. Robinson has brought more than 80 such actions.\n  This past October, a panel of fourth circuit judges, comprised of \nJudges Williams and Murnaghan and Senior Judge Butzner, denied \nRobinson's most recent frivolous appeal. In what can only be described \nas a truly bizarre, indeed lawless, action, Judge Kessler not only \nentertained the habeas corpus petition from Mr. Robinson, a petition \nover which she had absolutely no jurisdiction whatsoever, since Mr. \nRobinson is imprisoned in North Carolina, but had the gall to issue an \norder to those fourth circuit judges--requiring them within 30 days to \ncome before her and explain to her, and to Mr. Robinson, the convicted \nmurderer, why he should not be released from prison.\n  Indeed, I am told that just yesterday the U.S. marshals in \nOrangeburg, SC, personally served this order on Judge Williams' law \nclerk. I have a copy of the order right here, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the order was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n     United States District Court for the District of Columbia\n\n     Restoney Robinson, Petitioner vs. Murnaghan and Williams, \n         Respondent(s)\n\n     Civil Action No. 96-287\n\n\n                order directing respondent to show cause\n\n       It is this 3rd day of January, 1997,\n       ORDERED that the respondent(s), by counsel, shall within 30 \n     days of service of a copy of this Order and the Petition \n     herein file with the Court and serve on petitioner a \n     statement showing why the Writ of Habeas Corpus should not \n     issue.\n       The Clerk of Court is directed to furnish a copy of the \n     Petition and a certified copy of this Order to the United \n     States Marshal for the purpose of making service on the \n     respondent(s) and the U.S. Attorney's Office.\n                                                   Gladys Kessler,\n                                     United States District Judge.\n\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I have been critical of the activism of many of President \nClinton's judges, and let me tell you I have read many an activist \ndecision in the last few years, but I have never ever seen, nor heard \nof, a district court judge requiring circuit court of appeals judges to \njustify their decision, let alone circuit court of appeals judges from \nan altogether different circuit. In fact, we have consulted with a \nnumber of Federal court scholars who have told the committee that to \ntheir knowledge such an action is unprecedented. I should hope so.\n  In short, Judge Kessler's order can only be explained as a blatant \nabuse of judicial authority and disregard for the basic structure of \nour Federal courts, or perhaps at the very least a gross oversight. But \nin any event, it is confounding and it is dumbfounding. That Judge \nKessler apparently believes she somehow has the power to review fourth \ncircuit judges' opinions is, quite frankly, nothing short of appalling \nand represents the worst short of judicial hubris.\n  Perhaps Judge Kessler does not appreciate the gravity of her actions \nor perhaps she is trying to make a statement. Either way, however, her \norder is very disturbing because it represents either a fundamental \ndisregard for, or ignorance of, the most basic limits on judicial \npower.\n  Mr. President, when Republicans point out the activism of Clinton \nnominees, we are accused of using selective criteria. But as Clinton \njudges issue more and more activist decisions, it is becoming clear \nthat a great number of them are--by any criterion--activist judges.\n  Now, I have asked that the show cause order be printed in the Record. \nI hope people will read that. It is an astounding document. I do not \nknow how anybody, any judge sitting for the district court, could have \nissued that kind of order. Nevertheless, it is just evidence of some of \nthe things we have been going through in this country.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Will the Senator from Utah yield for a question?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. First, let me, if I might, say that I commend the \nSenator for taking the time to bring to the attention of the Congress \nand of the Senate such a glaring, incredible abuse of judicial \nauthority. It is obvious that that is the case. But let me ask--I am \nconfused as to how it is that the district court judge here in \nWashington would assert jurisdiction. What was her jurisdiction?\n  Mr. HATCH. There is none. It is absolutely astounding. Here is a \nFederal district judge, trial court judge in the District of Columbia, \nwho has absolutely no connection to the Fourth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, telling appellate judges that they must come before her and \nexplain why this murderer's frivolous appeal was denied.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Was the crime committed here in DC?\n  Mr. HATCH. No. If I understand it, the crime was in North Carolina.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. So if the crime was in North Carolina, the prisoner is \nin the Carolinas, the question is total lack of jurisdiction. So the \nthing that becomes shocking is what is to prevent this judge from \nissuing or entertaining a case, let us say, from Utah where a Utah \njudge and court had ruled; she is claiming that she could ask that \njudge to come here and to explain to her why the judge made that \ndecision.\n  Mr. HATCH. Or from New York. If we can have judges, district court \njudges, trial court judges in the District of Columbia issue an order \nto appellate judges in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, then the \nstructure and rationality of our Federal judicial system would be \nthrown into disarray.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Has the Justice Department involved itself in this \nmatter?\n  Mr. HATCH. I do not know that they know about it, but they certainly \nare going to know about it after we finish here today, because it is \nunbelievable.\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Is it the intent then of the Senator to bring this to \nthe attention of the Justice Department and ask them, would it not be \ncorrect, to seek an order from a higher court right here to quash this? \nThis is incredible.\n  Mr. HATCH. We intend to let the Justice Department know, but, more \nimportantly, I think, I am serving notice around here that we are not \ngoing to continue to sit back and tolerate these activist judges. \nNobody has been more fair to the Clinton judicial nominations than I \nhave. But many of these nominees have come in here and said we are not \ngoing to be activist judges; we are not going to usurp the powers of \nthe executive and legislative branches of Government; we are going to \ndo what judges should do, and that is interpret the laws that are made \nby those who are elected. All of them mouth that kind of language, but \nwhen it comes right down to it, a significant number of them are, one \non the bench, engaging in patently activist judging and usurping powers \nthat they do not have.\n  So I am just serving notice that we are on to the games these \nnominees are playing, and do not intend to let this game go on. We are \ngoing to do what it takes to weed out those nominees who pay lip \nservice to judicial restraint, but then think they can do anything they \nwant to once they don their robes.\n  There are limitations to the judiciary. The judiciary can preserve \nitself and keep the high opinion of the American people by not acting \nas activists, by not usurping the powers of the other two separated \nbranches of Government, and by living within the limits of the Third \nBranch.\n  I do not care whether activism comes from the right or whether it \ncomes from the left. It is wrong, and I have never seen a more flagrant \ncase of something that is wrong than this case. That is why I wanted to \nbring it to the attention of the Senate and also serve notice that we \nare going to treat the judgeship nominees over the next 4 years with \nthe utmost diligence and scrutiny.\n  We appoint Federal judges for a lifetime, and accordingly expect them \nto live up to the high calling of the judiciary; to appreciate the \ninherent limits on judicial power, and not to substitute their own \npolicy preferences for that which the law requires.\n  I hope that this sends a message to everybody, and I am serious about \nit. As one who has taken a lot of abuse from both sides on judges--\nincluding my own Republican colleagues--I am serving notice that we do \nnot intend to allow this rising tide of judicial activism to continue. \nThe integrity of our judiciary, and our very right to self-government \nis at stake.\n  I thank my colleague. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, for bringing to the attention of the Senate \nand to the Nation as a whole, I think, a very serious situation. \nBecause this portends the kind of thing that may take place, I think \nnotice has to be served by those within the court itself.\n  Clearly, this case goes well beyond the realm of someone having a \ndifference of legal opinion. The question of jurisdiction alone is a \nfrightening one and how someone could reach well beyond and entertain a \nmatter--are we going to say any Federal judge in any Federal \njurisdiction can review matters that do not legally come before them or \nwithin their purview or power?\n  (The remarks of Mr. D'Amato pertaining to the introduction of S. 249 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. D'AMATO.

Mr. President, I stand here today to pay tribute to Paul \nTsongas, one of the most courageous men and of the greatest \nhumanitarians that I have had the honor of serving with in the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Paul Tsongas' work for his fellow man did not start nor stop here in \nWashington. Before he even dreamed of running for elected office, he \ndonated his time to the Peace Corps, serving in Ethiopia and the West \nIndies.\n  But whether it was Ethiopia or Washington, DC, Paul Tsongas left his \nmark wherever he went.\n  In his hometown of Lowell, MA, one only needs to look at the Lowell \nNational Historical Park to realize what he meant to his fellow \ncitizens of that historical New England town.\n  He only served in the Senate for one term. But in just his second \nyear, he led the efforts to pass the Alaska Lands Act of 1980 which has \nbeen recognized as one of the most important pieces of conservation \nlegislation in history.\n  When diagnosed with lymphoma, he left the Senate to spend more time \nwith his family. But he did not give in to his cancer. He fought it \nwith the tenacity that those of us who knew him would only come to \nexpect.\n  After undergoing experimental surgery to beat the cancer, he felt \neven more compelled to donate his life to helping his fellow citizens. \nOne person he helped was my close friend Bill Gray. Bill, suffering \nfrom cancer, was constantly encouraged and cheered by Paul.\n  As we all remember, his remarkable run for President as an advocate \nfor a balanced budget in 1992 helped shape America's political agenda.\n  After contributing to the campaign in a losing effort, he co-founded \nthe Concord Coalition to advocate a balanced budget. Since then, the \ndeficit has been cut in half and the Concord Coalition has become one \nof the most well respected bipartisan organizations in Washington.\n  Paul Tsongas will be remembered here in Washington and in his \nhometown of Lowell not only for his work as a legislator but for his \nwork as a father, a husband, and a humanitarian.\n  My thoughts and prayers go out to his wife Niki, and his daughters \nAshley, Katina, and Molly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S851-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S851]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         U.S. FOREIGN OIL CONSUMPTION: HERE'S WEEKLY BOX SCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, one troubling aspect of our determining \nnational security is the manner in which the United States has become \nmore and more deeply dependent upon foreign countries to supply the \nbulk of our energy needs for the American people.\n  I was holding hearings on this perilous situation a decade ago when I \nwas chairman of the Agriculture Committee; and again this past Congress \nin my present capacity as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  The administration does acknowledge that this is a national security \nconcern, but, the administration has done precisely nothing about U.S. \ndependency on foreign oil.\n  Mr. President, the American Petroleum Institute reports that for the \nweek ending January 24, the U.S. imported 7,840,000 barrels of oil, \n945,000 barrels more than the 6,895,000 imported during the same week a \nyear ago.\n  To put it another way, Americans relied on foreign oil for 54.7 \npercent of their needs last week, and there are no signs that the \nupward spiral will abate. Before the Persian Gulf war, the United \nStates obtained approximately 45 percent of its oil supply from foreign \ncountries. During the Arab oil embargo in the 1970's, foreign oil \naccounted for only 35 percent of America s oil supply.\n  Which raises the inevitable questions: is anybody else interested in \nrestoring domestic production of oil--by U.S. producers using American \nworkers? Politicians would do well to ponder the economic calamity \ncertain to occur in America if and when foreign producers shut off our \nsupply--or double the already enormous cost of imported oil flowing \ninto the United States--now 7,840,000 barrels a day.\n  Mr. President, as I say, I shall continue to report to the Senate--\nand to the American people--on a regular basis regarding the \nincreasingly dangerous U.S. dependency on foreign oil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S851-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S851-S852]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CPSC CHAIRMAN ANN BROWN BRINGS CONSUMER PRODUCT SAFETY MESSAGE TO \n                                NEVADANS\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, last month U.S. Consumer Product Safety \nCommission Chairman, Ann Brown, came to Nevada to deliver her vital \nsafety messages to my constituents in Las Vegas and Reno. Her timely \nvisit, just before the holidays, when many people are preparing their \nhomes for visits by friends and relatives, reminded the citizens of my \nState of the practical things they can do to keep their homes safe.\n  In Las Vegas, we visited the home of Ms. Lori Black. Lori and her \nhusband Mike are the parents of eight children. As we toured their home \nwith Lori and her youngest daughter Leslie Mika and oldest daughter \nAnn, Chairman Brown reviewed the CPSC's baby safety checklist and found \nthat they had done an excellent job of making their home safe for \nchildren.\n  In Reno, we visited the home of Lisa and Scott Anderson and their \ndaughter Lyndsey Sue. There, Chairman Brown was able to point out that \ntheir baby crib passed the soda can test. She demonstrated that a soda \ncan is useful to measure the spaces between the slats in a baby's crib. \nIf the soda can cannot go through the slats, then the crib is baby \nsafe.\n  Chairman Brown also demonstrated the importance of clipping the loop \nat the end of venetian blind cords. She told us in the past 14 years, \n173 children had strangled in the loops of curtain and blind cords, but \nthat as a result of a voluntary agreement she secured from the blind \ncord industry, manufacturers are now installing safety tassels at the \nend of their cords. She commended the Andersons for making their home \nsafe for a baby by putting all medicines on an upper shelf far from a \nbaby's curious hands and having no baby clothes with strings or cords.\n  In both Las Vegas and Reno, the homes contained smoke alarms, but \nlacked carbon monoxide detectors. Chairman Brown emphasized to both \nfamilies the necessity of these devices. Every year, about 200 people \ndie from carbon monoxide poisoning, and thousands are treated in \nhospital emergency rooms. With the installation of CO detectors and \nannual appliance inspections, these deaths and injuries can be \nprevented.\n  I want to commend Chairman Brown for her valuable work promoting \nconsumer product safety in Nevada and across the country. The baby \nsafety program she initiated is a model of the way business and \ngovernment can work together as partners to advance the public \ninterest.\n  The Gerber Products Co. underwrote the costs of printing the \nmaterials for the baby safety program. This has allowed the CPSC to \nmake the baby safety checklist and other helpful materials available to \nthousands of people throughout the country.\n  The Consumer Product Safety Commission is a small agency with a big \nmission--to keep families safe in their homes and at play. It is also \none of the taxpaying public's best bargains in government. CPSC's $42.5 \nmillion budget, about 16 cents per capita, helps to attack the $200 \nbillion in annual societal costs and about $30 billion in direct \nmedical costs. Thus, every dollar appropriated to CPSC has the \npotential to address about $5,000 in societal costs and about $600 in \ndirect medical costs. As one example, the CPSC's work in making sure \nbaby cribs are safe and removing unsafe cribs from the market has \nreduced crib-related deaths from 200 annually to less than 50 deaths \nper year. That one project alone saves society nearly $1 billion a \nyear--or almost 25 times the CPSC's current annual budget.\n  But the CPSC is most concerned with saving lives and reducing \ninjuries and\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\nit is working even now on actions to reduce those crib-related deaths \nto an even lower figure.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Brown for bringing her lifesaving \nmessage to the citizens of Nevada and to commend her for her excellent \nleadership of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. I urge my \ncolleagues to share the CPSC's baby safety checklist with the new \nparents and grandparents in their States.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the baby safety checklist be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Baby Safety Checklist\n\n\n                                Bedroom\n\n       Put your baby to sleep on her back or side in a crib with a \n     firm, flat mattress and no soft bedding underneath her.\n       Make sure your baby's crib is sturdy and has no loose or \n     missing hardware.\n       Never place your baby's crib or furniture near window blind \n     or curtain cords.\n\n\n                                Bathroom\n\n       Keep medicines and cleaning products in containers with \n     safety caps and locked away from children.\n       Always check bath water temperature with your wrist or \n     elbow before putting your baby in to bathe.\n       Never, ever, leave your child alone in the bathtub or near \n     any water.\n\n\n                                Kitchen\n\n       Don't leave your baby alone in a highchair; always use all \n     safety straps.\n       Use your stove's back burners and keep pot handles turned \n     to the back of the stove.\n       Lock household cleaning products, knives, matches, and \n     plastic bags away from children.\n\n\n                              Living Areas\n\n       Install smoke detectors on each floor of your home, \n     especially near sleeping areas; change the batteries each \n     year.\n       Use safety gates to block stairways and safety plugs to \n     cover electrical outlets.\n       Keep all small objects, including tiny toys and balloons, \n     away from young children.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Santorum). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Abraham). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LOTT.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nencourage economic development through the creation of additional \nempowerment zones and enterprise communities and to encourage the \ncleanup of contaminated brownfield sites; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 THE COMMUNITY EMPOWERMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, it gives me great pleasure, \ntogether with my colleagues, Senators Abraham, D'Amato, Jeffords, \nLieberman, Murray, and Daschle to reintroduce the Community Empowerment \nAct of 1997. This legislation is designed to create new jobs and spur \neconomic growth by encouraging the cleanup and reuse of contaminated \nindustrial and commercial sites known as Brownfields. This bill also \ncreates 20 new additional empowerment zones and 80 new enterprise \ncommunities all across the Nation.\n\n  I like to call them environmentally challenged sites. They are sites \non which there has been some contamination but not to a level \nsufficient to reach Superfund status. But they are contaminated \nnonetheless. They are, on the one hand, excellent locations for \nindustrial and commercial redevelopment because the transportation, \nmore often than not, already exists. The infrastructure, the utilities, \nand the labor force already exists.\n  However, these properties are often unattractive to potential \nredevelopers because of the known, unknown, or perceived contamination \nthat may exist on the property. This factor creates an incentive for \ncompanies to locate and develop in greenfields, which are undeveloped \nareas generally in the suburbs. This urban flight contributes to urban \nsprawl, taking jobs away from the city.\n  It also results in the paving off of many of the greenfield areas of \nour country.\n  The challenge for all of us is to stop this trend. And one way to do \nthat is by encouraging businesses through the Tax Code to redevelop and \nto reuse the existing brownfield sites; to reclaim, if you will, sites \nthat have been contaminated which have been used or used up.\n  At present, if an industrial property owner does environmental damage \nto their property and then cleans up the site, the owner is allowed to \ndeduct the cost of that cleanup from a single year's earnings. However, \nin a strange twist of logic, someone who buys an environmentally \ndamaged piece of property and cleans up that property is not allowed to \nexpense these cleanup costs, but instead must capitalize the cost and \ndepreciate the cleanup expense over many years.\n  The result of this? The result has been an urban landscape littered \nwith vacant or abandoned properties, properties that attract crime and \nbring down property values in surrounding neighborhoods.\n  Confronting the brownfields issue can help to address many of the \nproblems that face high unemployment in older communities, including \njob creation, economic renewal, environmental justice, and \nenvironmental improvement. The collective efforts of everyone, \nparticularly the nonprofit community, the private sector, government at \nall levels, developers, and community groups, are essential to begin \nthe process of returning brownfields property back to productive use \nand to bring economic growth back to disadvantaged cities and rural \nareas.\n  Under the provisions of this legislation, qualifying brownfields will \nbe provided full first-year expensing of environmental cleanup costs \nunder the Federal Tax Code. Full first-year expensing simply means that \na tax deduction will be allowed for the cleanup costs in the year that \nthose costs are incurred.\n  The Community Empowerment Act provides tax incentives that we hope \nwill break through some of the current barriers preventing the private \nsector from investing in brownfields cleanup projects.\n  So it provides a carrot, if you will, to the private sector to begin \nto help not only with the environmental cleanup but also with urban \nredevelopment. So it becomes a win-win in both regards in that way.\n  In my own State of Illinois, the brownfields provisions will have a \nmajor impact on efforts to help restore neglected and abandoned \nindustrial areas. It will facilitate the cleanup of some 300 to 500 \nsites in Illinois, each of\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\nwhich has a remediation cost ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 per \nsite.\n  The Treasury Department estimates that this act will provide $2 \nbillion in tax incentives that will leverage an additional $10 billion \nin private investment, returning an estimated 30,000 brownfields across \nthe country to productive use again. The $2 billion investment will be \nincluded in the President's balanced budget plan and so it will be paid \nfor.\n  The Federal assistance that this proposal envisions will be \nconcentrated in neighborhoods with the most severe problems and that \nare truly in need of such investment. The bill targets four areas.\n  First, the empowerment zones and enterprise communities across the \ncountry.\n  Second, areas with a poverty rate of 20 percent or more that are near \nindustrial or former industrial sites.\n  Third, existing EPA brownfields pilot areas. The Environmental \nProtection Agency has already designated brownfields sites across the \ncountry.\n  Fourth, areas with a population of under 2,000 or more than 75 \npercent of which is zoned for industrial or commercial use.\n  So this is not just a big-city solution. This is something that will \naffect the cities, the suburbs, and the rural areas as well in \nproviding an incentive to reclaim these environmentally challenged \nareas of our country.\n  In my hometown, in Chicago, Mayor Daley has taken the initiative to \nestablish a brownfields pilot program which has made public investment \nleverage substantial private investment dollars. One of these projects \nis known as the Scott Peterson Meats Co., in Chicago. The site had been \ntax delinquent for several years when Scott Peterson Meats and the city \nbegan to work together. The city conducted an assessment of potential \nhazards that were identified and which included asbestos-containing \nmaterials, lead-based paints, and some 11 underground storage tanks, \nsome of which were filled with tar. The city paid for environmental \ninvestigation, cleanup, and building demolition, which totaled some \n$250,000 in contractor costs. Due to the city's investment, however, \nthe company, Scott Peterson Meats, then turned around and invested an \nadditional $5.2 million in a new smokehouse on its existing property, \nand it has hired over 100 additional employees to date. So with the \nwin-win of environmental cleanup and urban reclamation we also have job \ncreation coming out of this legislative initiative.\n\n  Another example of a successful public-private partnership pulling \npeople together to clean up a brownfields site is the Madison Equipment \nsite located in Illinois. This abandoned industrial building was a \nneighborhood eyesore. Scavengers had stolen most of the wiring and \nplumbing, and illegal or what is called midnight dumping of trash and \ndebris was rampant. Madison Equipment needed expansion space, but it \nfeared the environmental liability. However, in 1993, the city of \nChicago took the initiative to invest just a little over $3,000 in this \nproject, in this environmental reclamation, this brownfields project, \nand 1 year later the company, Madison, put in $180,000 of its own to \nredevelop the building. The critical reason that lenders and investors \nlook at this area now is because the city committed the public \ninvestment to spur private redevelopment and investment. When local \ngovernment demonstrates the confidence to commit public funds, private \nfinancial institutions are more likely to follow suit. These types of \nexamples show how a little investment can go a long way and how we can \nengage the partnership between the public and the private sector in \nnonbureaucratic ways in order to spur a result that truly is in the \npublic interest.\n  Chicago's pilot project will successfully return all the pilot sites \nto productive use for a total of about $850,000 in public money. This \npilot project is a perfect example of what this legislation can \naccomplish on a national level. But in order to make it happen, \ncooperation is the key. Effective strategies require strong \npartnerships among government, industry, organized labor, community \ngroups, developers, environmentalists, and financiers, who all realize \nthat when their efforts are aligned, when we work together, progress is \nmade easier.\n  The second component of this legislation is the establishment of 20 \nmore empowerment zones and 80 additional enterprise communities.

Economic revitalization in \nthis Nation's most distressed communities is essential to the growth of \nour entire country. With the concept of team effort, we can rebuild \ncities by stimulating investments and creating jobs. Environmental \nprotection used in this way can and will be good business. It is also \ngood policy. With this legislation, we will begin the effort to restore \neconomic growth back into our country's industrial centers and rural \ncommunities all the while improving our environment.\n  Again, I wish to thank my colleagues, Senators Abraham, D'Amato, \nJeffords, Lieberman, Murray, and Daschle for their original \ncosponsorship of this legislation and for making this legislation a \ntruly bipartisan effort.

Of the 80 enterprise communities, 50 would be in urban \n     areas and 30 would be in rural areas. Of the 20 empowerment \n     zones, 15 would be in urban areas and 5 would be in rural \n     areas. The designations would be made before January 1, 1999.\n       Certain of the eligibility criteria applicable in the first \n     round would be modified for the second round of designations. \n     First, the poverty criteria would be relaxed somewhat, so \n     that unlike the first round there would be no requirement \n     that at least 50 percent of the population census tracts have \n     a poverty rate of 35 percent or more. In addition, the \n     poverty criteria will not be applicable to areas specified in \n     the application as developable for commercial or industrial \n     purposes (1,000 acres in the case of an enterprise community, \n     2,000 acres in the case of an empowerment zone), and these \n     areas will not be taken into account in applying the size \n     limitations (e.g., 20 square miles for urban areas, 1,000 \n     square miles for rural areas). The Secretary of Agriculture \n     will be authorized to designate up to one rural empowerment \n     zones and five rural enterprise communities\n\n[[Page S860]]\n\n     based on specified emigration criteria without regard to the \n     minimum poverty rates set forth in the statute. Rural census \n     tracts in excess of 1,000 square miles or including a \n     substantial amount of governmentally owned land may exclude \n     such excess mileage or governmentally owned land from the \n     nominated area. Unlike the first round, Indian reservations \n     will be eligible to be nominated (and the nomination may be \n     submitted by the reservation governing body without the State \n     government's participation). The empowerment zone employment \n     credit will not be available to businesses in the new \n     empowerment zones, and the increased expensing under section \n     179 will not be available in the developable acreage areas of \n     empowerment zones.\n       Section 202 authorizes a new category of tax-exempt \n     financing for businesses in the new empowerment zones. These \n     bonds, rather than being subject to the current State volume \n     caps, will be subject to zone-specific caps. For each rural \n     empowerment zone, up to $60 million in such bonds may be \n     issued. For an urban empowerment zone with a population under \n     100,000, $130 million of these bonds may be issued. For each \n     urban empowerment zone with a population of 100,000 or more, \n     $230 million of these bonds may be issued.\n       Section 203 liberalizes the current definition of an \n     ``enterprise zone business'' for purposes of the tax-exempt \n     financing available under both the first and second rounds. \n     Businesses will be treated as satisfying the applicable \n     requirements during a 2-year start-up period if it is \n     reasonably expected that the business will satisfy those \n     requirements by the end of the start-up period and the \n     business makes bona fide efforts to that end. Following \n     the start-up period a 3-year testing period will begin, \n     after which certain enterprise zone business requirements \n     will no longer be applicable (as long as more than 35 \n     percent of the business' employees are residents of the \n     empowerment zone or enterprise community). The rules under \n     which substantially renovated property may be ``qualified \n     zone property,'' and thereby be eligible to be financed \n     with tax-exempt bonds, would also be liberalized slightly.\n       Section 204 liberalizes the definition of enterprise \n     business for purposes of both the tax-exempt financing \n     provisions and the additional section 179 expensing by \n     reducing from 80 percent to 50 percent the amount of total \n     gross income that must be derived within the empowerment zone \n     or enterprise community, by reducing how much of the \n     business' property and employees' services must be located in \n     or provided within the zone or community, and by easing the \n     restrictions governing when rental businesses will qualify as \n     enterprise zone businesses. A special rule is also provided \n     to clarify how a business that straddles the boundary of an \n     empowerment zone or enterprise community (e.g., by straddling \n     a population census tract boundary) is treated for purposes \n     of the enterprise zone business definition.\n\n\n        title iii--expensing of environmental remediation costs\n\n       Section 301 would provide a current deduction for certain \n     remediation costs incurred with respect to qualified sites. \n     Generally, these expenses would be limited to those paid or \n     incurred in connection with the abatement or control of \n     environmental contaminants. This deduction would apply for \n     alternative minimum tax purposes as well as for regular tax \n     purposes.\n       Qualified sites would be limited to those properties that \n     satisfy use, geographic, and contamination requirements. The \n     use requirement would be satisfied if the property is held by \n     the taxpayer incurring the eligible expenses for use in a \n     trade or business or for the production of income, or if the \n     property is of a kind properly included in the inventory of \n     the taxpayer. The geographic requirement would be satisfied \n     if the property is located in (i) any census tract that has a \n     poverty rate of 20 percent or more, (ii) any other census \n     tract (a) that has a population under 2,000, (b) 75 percent \n     or more of which is zoned for industrial or commercial use, \n     and (c) that is contiguous to one or more census tracts with \n     a poverty rate of 20 percent or more, (iii) an area \n     designated as a federal EZ or EC or (iv) an area subject to \n     one of the 40 EPA Brownfields Pilots announced prior to \n     February 1997. Both urban and rural sites may qualify. \n     Superfund National Priority listed sites would be excluded.\n       The contamination requirement would be satisfied if \n     hazardous substances are present or potentially present on \n     the property. Hazardous substances would be defined generally \n     by reference to sections 101(14) and 102 of the Comprehensive \n     Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act \n     (CERCLA), subject to additional limitations applicable to \n     asbestos and similar substances within buildings, certain \n     naturally occurring substances such as radon, and certain \n     other substances released into drinking water supplies due to \n     deterioration through ordinary use.\n       To claim the deduction under this provisions, the taxpayer \n     would be required to obtain a statement that the site \n     satisfies the geographic and contamination requirements from \n     a State environmental agency designated by the Environmental \n     Protection Agency for such purposes or, if no such agency has \n     been designated by the EPA, by the EPA itself.\n       This deduction would be subject to recapture under current-\n     law section 1245. Thus, any gain realized on disposition \n     generally would be treated as ordinary income, rather than \n     capital gain, up to the amount of deductions taken with \n     respect to the property.\n\n   Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senators \nMoseley-Braun, Abraham, Jeffords, Daschle, Lieberman, and Murray, in \nintroducing legislation that will provide a new tax incentive to \nencourage the private sector to clean up thousands of contaminated, \nabandoned sites known as brownfields. Brownfield sites are abandoned or \nvacant commercial and industrial properties suspected of being \nenvironmentally contaminated.\n  Under current law, the IRS has determined that costs incurred to \nclean up land and ground water are deductible as business expenses, as \nlong as the costs are incurred by the same taxpayer that contaminated \nthe land, and that taxpayer plans to use the land after the cleanup for \nthe same purposes used prior to the cleanup. That means that new owners \nwho wish to use land suspected of environmental contamination for a new \npurpose, would be precluded from deducting the costs of cleanup in the \nyear incurred. They would only be allowed to capitalize the costs and \ndepreciate them over time. Therefore, it is time for us to recognize \nthe need for aggressive economic development policies for the future \neconomic health of communities around the country, and to recognize the \ninequity of current tax law. My colleagues and I believe that our \nlegislation is the type of initiative the Federal Government needs to \nencourage development of once abandoned, unproductive sites that will \nbring real economic benefits to urban distressed and rural areas across \nthe United States. By encouraging redevelopment, jobs will be created, \neconomic growth will continue, property values will increase as well as \nlocal tax revenues.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to say that in my State of New York, the \ncity of Elmira has been selected as a fourth round finalist for the \nEPA's Brownfields Economic Redevelopment Initiative Demonstration Pilot \nProgram. The city of Elmira has primed an unsightly and unsafe urban \nbrownfield and is now in the final stages of turning it into a revenue- \nand jobs-producing venture. The city of Elmira initiated this important \nproject with no guarantees of public or private funding and has done \nthis at very minimal cost to taxpayers. Can you imagine what could and \nwould be done if the public and private sector had the encouragement to \nalso become involved?\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \njoin us in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with \nSenators Moseley-Braun, D'Amato, Abraham, and Lieberman in sponsoring \nthe Community Empowerment Act of 1997, which will encourage the cleanup \nof abandoned industrial sites known as brownfields in Vermont and \nacross the country.\n  The term ``brownfields'' refers to contaminated industrial sites. \nMost of these sites were abandoned during the 1970's and 1980's, as \nindustrial development migrated away from urban areas to the greener \nlandscape of the suburbs. One such site in Vermont is the Holden-\nLeonard Mill, a 20-building complex in Bennington, VT, that is poised \nto become a brownfields success story after 10 years of work.\n  Once employing one-quarter of Bennington's work force, the mill shut \ndown in 1939 and then was owned by a patchwork of owners until the \n1980's. After soil tests disclosed high levels of pollutants, the mill \nsat empty after 1986. Fortunately, a buyer of the site came forward in \n1992 and with cooperation between the business, State agencies, and the \nEPA the mill has been refurbished and over 200 new employees have been \nhired. The process, however, of revitalizing this site began in 1986 \nand is still going on.\n  Our aim with this legislation is to provide tax incentives to \nbusinesses willing to clean up and redevelop brownfields sites so that \nmore brownfield sites can be returned to productive use and so that the \nprocess doesn't have to take 10 years.\n  Last November, I sponsored a forum on brownfields redevelopment in \nBurlington, VT. There is only one unpolluted site in Burlington \navailable for industrial development. Yet there are currently 17 \nbrownfields sites in the city, all with great potential for\n\n[[Page S861]]\n\ndevelopment. I toured several of these sites and saw this potential \nfirst hand. Burlington is both an EPA brownfields pilot city and an \nenterprise community. Under our legislation, businesses that acquire \nthese sites would be able to claim tax deductions for their \nenvironmental cleanup costs. With tax incentives for brownfields \nredevelopment, I am hoping that we will see more of these abandoned \nsites returned to productive use.\n  We treasure our open spaces in Vermont, and we are looking at ways to \ngive incentives to companies to invest in our downtowns. When a company \nbuilds a facility on a brownfield site it takes advantage of existing \ninfrastructure. the revitalization of a brownfield site means one less \nfarm or field is paved over or forest cut down for the sake of a new \nplant or facility.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill.\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am delighted to join this \ndistinguished group of Senators in introducing legislation to provide \ntax incentives for the cleanup of brownfields. This legislation will \nprovide a powerful incentive to clean-up these sites. And that clean up \nwill be followed by more jobs and more economic growth in areas that \nvery much need both of those things. I am encouraged by the broad, \nbipartisan support both here in the Congress and in the administration \nand in the environmental community and in the business community, to \nprovide tax incentives to get these sites cleaned up.\n  Brownfield sites are abandoned commercial and industrial properties \nthat are environmentally contaminated. Developers and lenders avoid \nthese sites both for liability reasons and because the tax incentives \nfor cleaning up these sites is so limited. The result is an urban \nlandscape littered with vacant and abandoned properties--properties \nwhich invite crime, depress surrounding housing and commercial prices, \nand hinder economic growth in these areas. Additionally, by \ndiscouraging the clean-up of brownfields, we are encouraging the \ndevelopment of undeveloped areas known as greenfields.\n  This bill is simple: it allows taxpayers who purchase contaminated \nproperties to deduct the costs of cleaning up brownfields in the year \nthat cleanup expenses occur. This tax incentive would apply to existing \nand future empowerment zones and enterprise communities, in areas with \na poverty rate of 20 percent or more and in adjacent industrial and \ncommercial areas and in existing brownfields pilot areas as designated \nby the Environmental Protection Agency. Currently, a taxpayer who buys \na contaminated property and cleans it up must spread the costs of that \ncleanup over time. We expect the cost of this bill to be about $2 \nbillion over 7 years. The administration has estimated that this \nproposal may bring as many as 30,000 brownfield sites back to \nproductive use.\n  In Connecticut, my home State, we know first hand about the problems \nthese brownfield sites can pose for a community. In her soon to be \nreleased study of various brownfields sites, Edith M. Pepper of the \nNortheast-Midwest Institute included the Bryant Electric Plant in \nBridgeport, CT, as one of her case studies. As she notes, the Bryant \nElectric Plant shut down in 1988 after 90 years of operating in \nBridgeport's west end. It is no secret that Bridgeport is in difficult \nshape economically. Closing this 500,000 square foot facility did \nnothing to help that situation.\n  However, as Ms. Pepper notes in her case study of this brownfields \nsite, it appears that hope is on the way. A non-profit development \ngroup, the West End Community Development Corp. [CDC] is working to \nform a large business park on and around the Bryant site. Over $15 \nmillion has already been invested in the site, including a significant \namount for cleanup. According to city officials, the developer plans to \ncreate 300-400 new jobs and invest $20-50 million in Bridgeport's west \nend.\n  The brownfields bill we are introducing today could help in \nBridgeport. Undoubtedly it could help in places like New Haven and \nHartford as well.\n  The bill we are introducing today expands upon a bill that Senator \nAbraham and I introduced in the last Congress, S. 1542. That bill \nlimited these cleanup incentives to the 104 empowerment zones and \nenterprise communities that exist in 42 States across the country. I am \ndelighted by today's effort to expand on the number of regions and \nsites that will be covered in the brownfields legislation and I urge my \ncolleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important \nlegislation.\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I join Senator Moseley-Braun, \nSenator Jeffords, Senator Lieberman, Senator D'Amato, and others in \nintroducing the Community Empowerment Act of 1997. This legislation \nbuilds upon the legislation Senator Lieberman and I introduced last \nCongress, as well as the similar legislation introduced by Senators \nMoseley-Braun, D'Amato, and Jeffords.\n  Having now joined forces for the new Congress, the Moseley-Braun-\nAbraham legislation will provide tax incentives for the environmental \ncleanup of brownfields located in economically distressed areas. There \nare between 100,000 and 300,000 of these sites across the country, Mr. \nPresident, and they are a blight on both the landscape and the economy \nof our communities.\n  I am sponsoring this legislation because, in my view, too many of our \ntroubled cities, towns, and rural areas have both environmental and \neconomic problems. These problems conspire to produce an endless cycle \nof impoverishment. Contaminated sites are abandoned and new companies \nrefuse to take over the property for fear of environmental lawsuits \nfrom government and/or private parties. As a result, contamination and \njoblessness continue and even get worse.\n  For example, a survey of Toledo, OH businesses found that \nenvironmental concerns were affecting 62 percent of the area's \ncommercial and industrial real estate transactions. These effects are \nall but universally negative in terms of job creation and economic \ndevelopment.\n  Another example: Construction of a $3 million lumber treatment plant \nin Hammond, IN, was abandoned after low levels of contamination were \nfound at the proposed site. The developer concluded that uncertain \ncosts and potential liabilities outweighed the site's benefits.\n  The city of Hammond lost construction jobs, 75 full-time lumber plant \njobs, and any reasonable prospect that a developer would assume the \nrisk of developing property anywhere on the 20 acre site.\n  In Flint, the former site of Thrall Oil Co., now sits vacant. \nEconomic development officials believe this property should attract \nfuture manufacturing development. Unfortunately, because the Michigan \nDepartment of Environmental Quality has labeled it ``contaminated,'' \ndevelopers cannot be found.\n  For decades now, Mr. President, the Federal Government has tried, \nwith little success, to revitalize economically distressed areas. The \nblight remains. Urban renewal and various welfare programs too often \nhave only made things worse by spawning dependency on government help. \nEnvironmental laws have fared little better. Intended to force cleanup \nof contaminated sites, these laws instead have scared away potential \ninvestors with potentially unlimited liability, including liability for \ncontamination the investors did not cause or even know about.\n  Environmental regulations and liability established under the Federal \nSuperfund Program along with various other Federal and State \nenvironmental rules have helped create thousands of these brownfield \nproperties in the United States. These are industrial or commercial \nsites suspected of being in some way environmentally contaminated. \nAlthough not serious threats to public health and safety, these \nproperties have become unavailable for economic use, because legal \nrules make them too financially risky for investment and job creation.\n  Potential liability scares businesses and investors away from these \nsites, creating permanently abandoned blights on the urban and rural \nlandscape. Investors are afraid of being dragged into multimillion-\ndollar litigation and cleanup over contamination they did not cause. \nWorse, investors willing to shoulder the liability of a potential \nenvironmental cleanup find that they cannot write off the cost of \nenvironmental remediation of brownfields. Instead these costs must be \nspread over a number of years. Thus, the Tax Code and environmental \nlaws combine to scare away potential sources of investment and growth,\n\n[[Page S862]]\n\noften from our most economically distressed areas.\n  To help both our economy and our environment, the Moseley-Braun-\nAbraham legislation would target tax benefits at brownfields in \neconomically distressed areas to encourage cleanup and job creation. We \nwould allow investors in brownfields to expense their cleanup costs \nimmediately--without having to split these costs up over a number of \nyears. This will have three positive effects.\n  First, these incentives will help our communities. By encouraging \nredevelopment of abandoned, unproductive sites, these tax incentives \nwill reinvigorate economic growth in distressed communities across the \ncountry. They will provide economic opportunity rather than government \ndependence by encouraging investment and entrepreneurship where it is \nmost needed.\n  Second, this legislation will help the environment. These tax \nincentives will significantly improve our ability to clean up \nenvironmentally contaminated sites. The legacy of existing cleanup laws \nis a remarkable lack of progress. With thousands of sites across the \ncountry categorized as brownfields, we need to start cleaning them now, \nand we need private investment to get the job done. Furthermore, \nencouraging brownfields cleanup will save undeveloped land from \nunnecessary development. For every brownfield that is cleaned up and \nreused there will be a green field that remains clean and unused. \nThird, this solution, unlike those attempted in the past, utilizes the \nprivate sector to reclaim contaminated land and reinvigorate distressed \ncommunities. By encouraging private investment, rather than attempting \nto purchase or force cooperation with government mandates, we can free \nup private capital and initiative to do its job of revitalizing these \ndistressed areas.\n  By adopting this approach, the Senate will take a significant step \ntoward revitalized, reinvigorated, and renewed urban and rural zones. \nWith the incentives, included in this amendment, good jobs and a clean \nenvironment will go together, to everyone's benefit. I thank Senators \nMoseley-Braun, D'Amato, Lieberman, Jeffords, and our other cosponsors \nfor joining me in this important effort, and I look forward to seeing \nmeaningful brownfields reforms passed this Congress.\n       By Mr. GRAMS (for himself, Mr. Abraham, Mr. Ashcroft, Mr. \n     Faircloth, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Kyl, Mr. McCain, Mr. Stevens \n     and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 236. A bill to abolish the Department of Energy, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n                THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ABOLISHMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I introduce legislation aimed at improving \ngovernment as we know it. The Department of Energy Abolishment Act of \n1997 comes after nearly two decades of debate. The basic question has \nalways remained the same: Why should we expend taxpayer dollars on this \nCabinet-level agency? And today, we ask the same question.\n  Following a year's worth of discussions on the blueprint I am putting \nforth, much progress has been made. When the 104th Congress began to \ntackle this issue, we looked at three main issues. First, we examined \nthe fact that the Department of Energy no longer has a mission--which \nis clearly reflected by the fact that nearly 85 percent of its budget \nis expended upon nonenergy programs. Next, we studied those programs \ncharged to the DOE and reviewed its ability to meet the related job \nrequirements. And finally, we looked at the DOE's bloated budget in \nlight of the first two criterion--determining whether the taxpayers \nshould be forced to expend over $16 billion annually on this hodge-\npodge collection.\n  Nearly a year later, this Nation continues to grow increasingly \ndependent upon foreign oil--in total contrast to the DOE's core \nmission. Even in light of this administration's focus on alternative \nenergy, the DOE expends less than one-fifth of its budget on energy-\nrelated programs. And after examining key DOE mission programs, such as \nthe Civilian Nuclear Waste program, it is clear that the goals of those \nmissions are not being met.\n  So we are challenged to either accept the status quo or move to \nchange it. I must admit that the status quo may be easier in the short-\nterm. But in the context of the proverbial big picture, we cannot \nafford to turn our backs. Besides the fact that it is the role of \nCongress to oversee taxpayer expenditures and ensure a fair rate of \nreturn on their investments, this Nation is faced with a national debt \nin excess of $5.3 trillion.\n  However, gaining consensus on the need for change is easier than \neffecting such change. So, last year I worked with the Senate Task \nForce on Government Agency Elimination to develop a blueprint. Under \nthe direction of the former Senate Majority Leader, Senator Dole, I \nworked with Senators Faircloth, Abraham, and Stevens to study proposals \non the DOE.\n  After months of discussions with experts in the fields of energy and \ndefense, we introduced legislation--legislation which is the core of \nthe bill I am introducing today.\n  Let me be the first to state that the ideas contained within this \nbill are not all of my own. Just as the idea to eliminate the \nDepartment of Energy is not a new one--since its creation in 1978, \nexperts have been clamoring to abolish this agency in search of a \nmission. This bill represents the comments and input of many who have \nworked in these fields for decades, but like all things--I consider it \na work in progress.\n  As many of our colleagues will recall, the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee held a hearing on this very bill last September. \nDuring the hearing, we received testimony from such distinguished \nwitnesses as the Former Assistant Energy Secretary Shelby Brewer and \nthe Former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger in support of the \nproposal. Having either directly run these programs, or relied upon \nthem, they provided strong firsthand evidence as to the detriment of \nleaving things as they are.\n  The committee also received testimony from the current Acting \nSecretary and then-Assistant Energy Secretary, Charlie Curtis, who \ntestified in support of improving the delivery of the Department's \nmissions, at lower cost, for the benefit of the American people. His \ntestimony focused upon how the DOE was working to improve its efforts \nto fulfill various missions, and how changing horses midstream would \nderail the DOE's efforts. In his remarks, Mr. Curtis dismissed the DOE \nAbolishment Act because the DOE did not believe it appropriate to \nentertain matters of this moment and complexity in the context of a \nbill which has as its proposed objective changing the organizational \nstructure and fate of the Department of Energy.\n  What the DOE fails to recognize is that the conclusions--to abolish \nthe DOE--arise from an analysis of the Department's activities, rather \nthan from any antigovernment ideology or mere desire to reduce \ngovernment spending, as pointed out by Dr. Irwin Stelzer of the \nAmerican Enterprise Institute. Supporters of the DOE Abolishment Act \nhave always agreed that there are core functions performed by the DOE \nwhich must continue to be done, but the DOE has yet to provide a \ncompelling argument as to why the DOE itself must continue to exist or \nsuccessfully respond to our reasons for its elimination.\n  But Mr. Curtis' objections are understandable when placed in the \ncontext of remarks by Nobel-prize economist, Dr. Milton Friedman: ``The \nDepartment of Energy offers an excellent example of a major difference \nbetween private and government projects. If a private project is a \nfailure, it will be closed down; if a government project is a failure, \nit will be expanded. * * * It is in the self-interest of the Government \nofficials in charge to keep the project alive; and they always have the \nready excuse that the reason for failure was the lack of sufficient \nfunds.''\n  So today, I am joined by my colleagues, Senator Abraham of Michigan, \nSenator Ashcroft of Missouri, Senator Faircloth of North Carolina, \nSenator Hutchinson of Arkansas, Senators Kyl and McCain of Arizona and \nSenator Stevens of Alaska, in reaffirming congressional intent to \nchange the Department of Energy as we know it.\n  Under the Department of Energy Abolishment Act of 1997, we dismantle \nthe patchwork quilt of government initiatives--reassembling them into \nagencies better equipped to accomplish\n\n[[Page S863]]\n\ntheir basic goals; we refocus and increase Federal funding toward basic \nresearch by eliminating corporate welfare; and, we abolish the bloated, \nduplicative upper management bureaucracy.\n  First, we begin by eliminating Energy's Cabinet-level status and \nestablish a 3-year Resolution Agency to oversee the transition. This is \ncritical to ensuring progress continues to be made on the core \nprograms.\n  Under title I, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission [FERC] is \nspun off to become an independent agency, like it was prior to the \ncreation of the DOE. The division which oversees hearings and appeals \nis eliminated, with all pending cases transferred to the Department of \nJustice for resolution within 1 year. The functions of the Energy \nInformation Administration are transferred to the Department of the \nInterior with the instruction to privatize as many as possible. And \nwith the exception of research being conducted by the DOE labs, basic \nscience and energy research functions are transferred to Interior for \ndetermination on which are basic research, and which can be privatized. \nThose deemed as core research will be transferred to the National \nScience Foundation and reviewed by an independent commission. Those \nthat are more commercial in nature will be subject to disposition \nrecommendations by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  The main reasoning behind this is to ensure the original mission of \nthe DOE--to develop this Nation's energy independence--is carried out. \nWith scarce taxpayer dollars currently competing against defense and \ncleanup programs within the DOE, it's no surprise that little progress \nhas been made. However, by refocusing dollars into competitive \nalternative energy research--we will maximize the potential for areas \nsuch as solar, wind, biomass, and so forth. For States like Minnesota, \nwhere the desire for renewable energy technologies is high, growth in \nthese areas could help fend off our growing dependence upon foreign oil \nwhile protecting our environment.\n  Under Title II, the laboratory structure within the DOE is revamped. \nFirst, the three defense labs are transferred to the Defense \nDepartment. They include Sandia, Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore. The \nremaining labs are studied by a nondefense energy laboratory \ncommission. This independent commission operates much like the Base \nClosure Commission and can recommend restructuring, privatization, or a \ntransfer to the DOD as alternatives to closure. Congress is granted \nfast-track authority to adopt the Commission's recommendations.\n  Title III attempts to assess an inventory of the Power Marketing \nAdministration's assets, liabilities, and so forth. This inventory is \naimed at ensuring fair treatment of current customers and a fair return \nto the taxpayers. All issues, including payments by current customers \nmust be included in the General Accounting Office's [GAO] audit.\n  Petroleum reserves are the focus of title IV. The Naval Petroleum \nReserve is targeted for immediate sale. Any of the reserves that are \nunable to be disposed of within the 3-year window will be sold \ntransitionally from the Interior Department. With the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve, it is transferred to the Defense Department and an \naudit on value and maintenance costs is conducted by the GAO. Then, the \nDOD is charged with determining how much oil to maintain for national \nsecurity purposes after reviewing the GAO report.\n  Under titles V and VI, all of the national security and environmental \nrestoration-management activities to the Department of Defense. \nTherefore, all defense-related activities are transferred back to \nDefense, but are placed in a new civilian controlled agency--Defense \nNuclear Programs Agency--to ensure budget firewalls and civilian \ncontrol over sensitive activities such as arms control and \nnonproliferation activities.\n  And the program which has received much criticism as of late, the \nCivilian Nuclear Waste Program, is transferred to the Corps of \nEngineers. This section dovetails legislation adopted by the Senate \nlast Congress. A key element is that the interim storage site is \ndesignated at Nevada's test site area 25. Building upon legislation I \nintroduced last Congress, the GAO is directed to recommend \nprivatization options and provide cost saving estimates for the overall \nprogram.\n  For 35 States, including my home State of Minnesota, timely \nresolution to the nuclear waste issue is essential. The continued \nimpasse over the designation of interim and permanent waste sites \nimplies additional slippages in the DOE's legal requirement to accept \nnuclear waste by 1998. Minnesota stands to lose nearly 30 percent of \nits energy resources shortly after the turn of the century, but 34 \nother States face similar crisis. Having paid over $250 million into \nthe Nuclear Waste Trust Fund, Minnesota's ratepayers want resolution, \nnot the continual foot-dragging we have seen from the DOE. And when we \nlook at the $12 billion collected to date in contrast to the lack of \nprogress over the past 15 years, it is clear that the status quo is not \nworking. That is primarily the impetus behind today's announcement by \nthe Nuclear Waste Strategy Coalition that they are petitioning the \nCourts for approval to stop payments to the Nuclear Waste Trust Fund. \nUntil the Court order in July, the DOE even denied accountability for \nthe program. It is time for a change if we want results. This \nlegislation provides that change.\n  Overall, outside models estimate savings between $19 and $23 billion \nin the first 5 years, and approximately $5 to $7 billion annually \nthereafter. This is in sharp contrast to the former Secretary's \nStrategic Alignment Initiative, which boasts unconfirmed savings of $14 \nbillion but no savings in the outyears.\n  In introducing this bill, our goals are to build upon the issues \nraised during last year's hearing; to hold additional hearings in \nconjunction with those who have expressed concerns over the Department \nof Energy--including Senator Brownback of Kansas, chairman of the \nGovernment Affairs Subcommittee on Government Management Oversight; \nand, to move forward on implementing a widely supported proposal. And, \nin the coming weeks, Representative Tiahrt of Kansas will be \nintroducing companion legislation in the House of Representatives in \nthe near future.\n  Contrary to proponents of the status quo, the momentum is far from \nbeing derailed. In fact, if we were to look at the Department of \nEnergy's own Report on External Regulation issued in December 1996, \neven its own working group recommended transferring the regulation of \nits nuclear facilities to outside entities. The report concluded that \nby through external regulation, and adoption of the private sector's \nsafety culture, program safety and public confidence would be greatly \nenhanced. We agree. And we would like to see such concepts applied \nacross the board to DOE's programs--and the DOE ultimately eliminated. \nWe welcome any input to that end from the administration.\n  And so looking back over the past year--examining how the debate has \ntransformed from one of whether or not to maintain the status quo, to \none of how to change it--I am encouraged over the progress we have \nmade. Today, we mark the beginning of the debate on achieving our goal \nof streamlining government and improving the delivery of government \nservices at lower costs to the American taxpayers. One year from now, \nit is my hope that we will be working toward the implementation of a \nrestructuring plan on the Department of Energy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS:\n  S. 237. A bill to provide for retail competition among electric \nenergy suppliers for the benefit and protection of consumers, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n             the electric consumers protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Electric \nConsumers Protection Act of 1997. This bill provides for the transition \ntoward deregulation and competition in electricity generation.\n  While very few people, including myself, find a discussion of the \nelectric utility industry and the many laws and regulations governing \nthe industry exciting, the fact is that electricity is an extremely \nimportant commodity which affects everyone on a daily basis. Any event \nthat increases or reduces electric rates can impact: First, the lives \nof the poor and those on fixed incomes that\n\n[[Page S864]]\n\ndepend on electricity to heat their homes in the winter and cool them \nin the summer; second, the price of goods we buy every day; as well as, \nthird, the competitiveness of our factories. In addition, decisions \nmade by electric generators often have a direct effect on our \nenvironment as well as our national security.\n  So, it is not at all inconsequential that the electric industry, \nwhich has remained relatively static for the last 60 years, is about to \nundergo a fundamental change. Instead of the traditional vertically \nintegrated local utility, which generates power at its own plants, \ntransmits that power over its own lines, and sells that power to all \nconsumers in a particular area, consumers will soon be bombarded with \nall sorts of offers from companies competing to become their power \nsupplier, and other entrepreneurs will be seeking to buy large blocks \nof power to serve certain kinds of consumers. Naturally, these changes \nare bound to create considerable apprehension among utilities, their \nshareholders, and consumers.\n  Mr. President, there are some who would prefer that we maintain the \nstatus quo. However, it is becoming increasingly certain that \ncompetition is inevitable. At least six States--California, New \nHampshire, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Vermont, and Massachusetts--have \nalready enacted legislation or promulgated regulations providing for \ncompetition. A number of other States have established proceedings to \ndetermine how to move toward competition. In all, more than 40 States \nhave either ordered, or are examining the possibility of requiring, \nderegulation of the retail electric markets.\n  Theoretically, introducing competition among electric power providers \nshould produce greater efficiencies and lower electric rates. Certainly \nlarge industrial consumers of electricity would see significant \nreductions in their energy bills, but I am more concerned about the \npotential impact on residential and small commercial consumers--the \nbiscuit cookers as we call them in Arkansas. Generating companies may \nbe less eager to compete to serve these customers, especially those \nlocated in rural areas. This reduced bargaining power could also end up \ncausing residential and small commercial customers to pay for those \ncosts arising from the transition to competition--that is, stranded \ncosts--costs that industrial consumers can more easily avoid.\n\n  I believe it is the role of both Congress and the States to ensure \nthat the biscuit cookers also benefit. It is not enough to simply \nproclaim that the days of the utilities' vertically integrated \nmonopolies are over. We also have a solemn obligation to be fair to \nutility companies that have been operating in reliance on the ground \nrules we all created over the last 60 years. This will require a \ncareful balancing of competing interests. Everyone will benefit by \nrestructuring if it is done properly, and I consider this an absolutely \nessential result.\n  Mr. President, I am introducing this bill to begin the debate in the \n105th Congress about how best to promote an orderly transition to a \ncompetitive retail electric market. This legislation is designed with \nthe goals of allowing all consumers to enjoy the benefits of \ncompetition while not penalizing utilities for prudent decisions they \nmade under the previous regulatory system.\n  There is significant debate over whether Congress should even pass \nlegislation on this subject. The argument that the States should decide \nthese issues certainly has some merit. After all, retail electric \nservice has generally been the domain of the States, although \nrequirements imposed at the Federal level by both FERC and Congress \nhave had a direct impact on retail rates and service.\n  But I personally believe a State-by-State approach could produce a \nlot of unintended consequences which would limit the benefits \nassociated with retail competition. Electric generation markets are \nbecoming increasingly regional and even multiregional. What happens in \none State can have direct and indirect impacts on consumers and \nutilities located in another State. Utilities operating in more than \none State can be subjected to conflicting regulatory regimes which \ncould impact the way they operate their systems and the electric rates \npaid by consumers.\n  This phenomenon is best illustrated by the multistate utility holding \ncompanies registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act \n[PUHCA}. I have had a lot of experience with registered holding \ncompanies because two of them serve my home State of Arkansas. These \nholding companies generally plan for, and operate, generating \nfacilities on a systemwide basis for the benefit of customers in the \nentire region served by the company. If restructuring proceeds on a \nState-by-State basis, these holding companies would find themselves \nsubjected to different requirements which could negatively impact \nconsumers.\n\n  For example, the Entergy System serves retail customers in parts of \nLouisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Arkansas. If Louisiana and Texas \nwere to order retail competition and Arkansas and Mississippi decided \nto delay competition, it would be difficult, if not impossible, for \nEntergy to operate a system of generating facilities designed to serve \na particular load over a four-State area. It is quite possible that \nconsumers in Arkansas and Mississippi would wind up paying more for \ntheir service. Entergy's captive customers in Arkansas and Mississippi \ncould be further disadvantaged to the extent Entergy were to become \nfinancially imperiled as a result of the retail competition orders in \nTexas and Louisiana.\n  A State-by-State approach to retail competition also presents \nproblems where utilities operate entirely within a single State. It \nwould make no sense for a utility in a State that does not require \nretail competition, to be able to sell power at retail in an adjoining \nState that requires retail competition, while a utility subjected to \nretail competition is unable to mitigate its losses by competing for \ncustomers in the adjoining State. Such a result both increases stranded \ncosts and distorts the generation marketplace.\n  My legislation requires that retail competition be implemented in \neach State by 2003. States will continue to have the option of choosing \nan earlier starting date. In addition, the States can individually \noversee the transition to competition.\n  Moreover, if Congress is going to mandate retail competition then I \nbelieve we have an obligation to provide for utility recovery of its \nstranded investment in facilities that become uneconomic as a result of \nthe transition to retail competition. That is not to say that a utility \nis automatically entitled to recover every penny of its investment. \nRather, my bill limits utilities to recovery of their investments that: \nFirst, were prudent when incurred; second, are legitimate and \nverifiable; and third, cannot be mitigated by selling power to others \nin the competitive market.\n  My bill provides that if a utility seeks to recover stranded costs, a \nState commission would establish the level of such costs pursuant to an \nadministrative determination or after the utility auctions off its \nassets to establish the market value of these facilities. Once the \nstranded costs are calculated, consumers would be assessed a wires \ncharge to compensate the utility for its stranded costs.\n\n  It is vital that, as we proceed with electric restructuring, we act \nto ensure that the generation markets are truly competitive. It will do \nno good to remove Federal and State rate regulation if consumers do not \nhave access to a sufficient number of potential power marketers. We \nhave already seen this problem in other industries that have \nderegulated, where after an initial flurry of competitors entering a \nparticular market, significant consolidation occurred.\n  Utilities obviously should not be allowed to use their advantageous \npositions with regard to transmission and distribution to gain a \ncompetitive advantage in the generation market. Utilities should not \nuse funds from their transmission and distribution systems to subsidize \ntheir generation businesses. In addition, my bill requires the \nimplementation of independent system operators [ISO's] to oversee the \noperation of transmission systems in each region.\n  We also must be mindful that power suppliers might not be falling all \nover themselves to serve certain consumers, especially those located in \nrural areas. My bill contains a universal service requirement to ensure \nthat everyone who wants electric service has the opportunity to buy it \nat reasonable rates.\n\n[[Page S865]]\n\nThe bill also authorizes States to collect fees from all consumers to \nhelp pay for the universal service obligation.\n  Mr. President, there are currently a number of utility-based programs \nwhich provide societal benefits. For instance, the Public Utility \nRegulatory Policies Act [PURPA] provides for utility purchases of \nenergy generated at certain plants which use renewable resources or \ncogeneration. In addition, many States have programs requiring \nutilities to contribute to energy conservation and to help low-income \npeople pay their energy bills. The costs of these programs are passed \nthrough to ratepayers. It will be more difficult for utilities to \ncontinue to implement these programs in a competitive retail \nenvironment. My bill authorizes States to collect wire charges to help \npay for these kinds of programs.\n  Congressman Dan Schaefer has developed a proposal designed to promote \nthe use of renewable generation. His portfolio approach would require \neach company selling power at retail to generate a portion of its power \nusing renewable resources or to purchase credits from those companies \nthat do generate in excess of the minimum requirements. I think it is \nvery important that we do everything possible to promote the use of \nrenewable energy and my bill contains a similar proposal.\n\n  Mr. President, over the last 25 years we have made substantial \nprogress in cleaning our air and rivers, lakes and streams. It has come \nat a fairly big cost, but I doubt anyone would turn the clock back on \nour successes.\n  There are understandable conflicting positions about what will happen \nwith the introduction of competition. Some argue that competition will \nincrease the use of natural gas, which is more friendly to the \nenvironment than coal. Others argue that existing coal generating \nplants that were grandfathered in under the provisions of the Clean Air \nAct will be utilized more frequently. It is difficult to know who is \nright. But I think it is fair to say that we all have an obligation to \nprotect our air quality and we shouldn't take this issue lightly. My \nbill requires EPA to submit a study to Congress within 2 years \nanalyzing the issue and suggesting any changes to our laws that may \nneed to be made to protect the environment.\n  Mr. President, the issues addressed by the Electric Consumers \nProtection Act of 1997 are very complex and far reaching. It is going \nto take Congress some time in order to sort them out and develop a \nconsensus for a comprehensive approach to electric generation \nderegulation. I am introducing this bill today to begin the debate and \npropose one roadmap as to how we may get there. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues and all interested parties as we proceed to \nexamine this very important issue over the next 2 years.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill and a \nsummary of the bill be placed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 237\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure Medicare reimbursement for certain ambulance services, and to \nimprove the efficiency of the emergency medical system, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. GRAMS. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today, with the \nsupport of my colleague from Florida, Senator Graham, to introduce an \nimportant health care proposal that is designed to improve our \nemergency medical system and to ultimately benefit our constituents who \ndepend on these services. The area is one I believe has not received \nthe attention that it deserves.\n  In a nation where some 268,000 Americans turn to the 911 emergency \nresponse system for help every single day, our population relies on the \nreadiness, efficiency and the quick response of our emergency medical \nsystem. It is something on which the American people have come to \ndepend, a service we nearly take for granted. We don't know when we \nneed it, but we want it to work well when we do. The men and women who \nrisk their lives in delivering emergency care are true heroes, yet \ntheir desire to improve the services they provide is rarely recognized \nby Congress.\n  The nightly news is filled with the stories of local emergency \nresponse problems. You may recall the tragedy in Philadelphia in 1994 \nwhen a young boy died on the steps of his church after being beaten. It \ntook police 40 minutes to respond after the first 911 call was \nreceived.\n  Here in the District of Columbia, some residents have waited for more \nthan 25 minutes before an ambulance responded to their 911 medical \nemergency. Far too often, Congress fails to respond until there is a \nnational crisis, but we can't afford to wait for a crisis to occur \nbefore we respond to the needs of our emergency medical system. \nPatients' lives are at risk if Congress doesn't begin to help the \nsystem become more efficient.\n  Currently, emergency medical service providers are not consulted when \nWashington is formulating national policy which affects their ability \nto respond in a timely and in an efficient manner, and there is no \ncoordinated Government focus on EMS, no collection of national data and \nstatistics which I believe would help Congress and the administration \ndevelop more effective policies to help improve EMS.\n  Furthermore, there is no lead EMS agency to provide guidance and \ndirection to Congress and the States when implementing Federal policies \nconcerning Medicare reimbursement issues, emergency management \nplanning, or the effect of Federal regulations on EMS providers. This \nlack of coordination often negatively impacts providers of EMS and our \nconstituents who rely upon them.\n  Later this year, Congress will be reauthorizing the Intermodal \nSurface Transportation Efficiency Act, for which its supporters will be \nasking for $26 billion in transportation spending, and yet the \nemergency medical services communities will likely not have a voice in \nimproving our transportation system. That is the very system they \ndepend upon to ensure that when they are dispatched to a patient in \nneed of emergency medical services, the highway design or newest \ntechnologies will allow them to respond quickly and efficiently. EMS \nproviders need a seat at the table.\n\n  I find it ironic that we expect so much from our EMS system and yet, \nwhen they seek assistance, we continue to ignore their 911 call for \nhelp.\n  That is why I am today introducing the Emergency Medical Services \nEfficiency Act of 1997. My legislation sets out a blueprint for \nresponding to the needs of our emergency medical system and begins to \naddress just a few of their concerns Washington has long ignored.\n  First, the Grams-Graham bill will require Medicare to reimburse for \nambulance services provided for emergency medical care based on the \noriginal diagnosis by a prudent layperson, instead of the ultimate \ndiagnosis determined by health professionals in the emergency room.\n  Mr. President, the division of emergency medical services for the \ncity of St. Paul, MN, prepared a list for me of just some of their 1996 \nemergency ambulance transports that began as a 911 call for help, but \nwere eventually denied payment by Medicare.\n  Among the cases where payment was denied include a 79-year-old \nfemale, on several prescription medications, who had fallen in the \nnight and was suffering from vertigo; a 72-year-old male, on numerous \nprescription medications, who had fallen on the sidewalk, had \nlacerations on his arm, a cut over his right eye, and was confused; and \nalso a 95-year-old female who awoke confused and weak, possibly \nsuffering from a stroke.\n  In each of these incidents, emergency services personnel responded to \nwhat they believed to be medical emergencies. Even though the cases \nwere ultimately ruled nonemergencies, the EMS providers should have \nbeen reimbursed by Medicare for the emergency transport service that \nthey provided.\n  As Joseph A. Grafft, EMS Manager for the FIRE/EMS Center at \nMetropolitan State University in St. Paul noted in a letter to me, \n``Ambulance providers are not physicians and do not diagnose patients. \nThey deal with presenting symptoms and give care based on these \nsymptoms. The physicians diagnose and make the final determination. \nAmbulance providers should not be penalized for doing their job.''\n  Our bill ensures that Medicare reimbursements are based on the \noriginal diagnoses of the 911 callers. At the same time, we do not seek \nreimbursements for medical conditions that are clearly not life-\nthreatening.\n  Second, our bill establishes two separate advisory councils comprised \nof emergency service providers and others. The first will advise the \nHealth Care Financing Administration on issues pertaining to Medicare \nreimbursement. The second advisory council will make recommendations to \nthe administration and Congress in regard to improving the efficiency \nand coordination of our emergency medical system.\n  Third, our bill will designate a lead-EMS agency, to be established \nat the direction of the Secretary of Transportation in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary will \nmake recommendations to Congress as to which functions should be \ntransferred to the Transportation Department in order to streamline and \ncoordinate the EMS system.\n  Finally, our bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish a national database for the collection of statistics relating \nto the delivery of emergency medical services within our national \ntransportation system and national emergency response system.\n  The Secretary will set forth the appropriate criteria for national \ndata collection in consultation with State EMS agencies to ensure the \nleast burdensome data collection reporting procedures. We would hope \nthis database could be tied to an existing data collection system.\n  I believe these four provisions will begin to address a few of the \nneeds that the EMS community has brought to my attention. This bill \nwill allow Congress, the President, as well as State and local \nofficials to have the resources and also the facts they need to make \nnecessary improvements in emergency medical care to patients.\n  Dr. Daniel Hankins, president of the Minnesota Chapter of the \nAmerican College of Emergency Physicians, made that point eloquently in \na recent letter to me. He said, ``For too long EMS has been forgotten \nwhen health care legislation has been proposed.''\n  He went on to say, ``EMS is a small, but crucial part of the overall \nhealth care system. It is in most rural areas the only lifeline for \naccess into emergency care. It is a fragile safety net . . . that is \nonly held together by the dedication of the many volunteers that \ncomprise the EMS system.''\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that I am joined today by the senior \nSenator\n\n[[Page S872]]\n\nfrom the State of Florida in the introduction of this legislation. We \nare proud to have a large number of organizations--organizations \ndedicated to improving emergency medical care--supporting our \nlegislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a complete list of these organizations \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    List of Organizations Supporting the Emergency Medical Services \n                             Efficiency Act\n\n       (1) Minnesota Ambulance Association.\n       (2) Minnesota Air Medical Council.\n       (3) Healthspan Transportation.\n       (4) Lifelink III.\n       (5) Minnesota Emergency Medical Services Association.\n       (6) South Central Minnesota Emergency Medical Services \n     Program.\n       (7) Minnesota Chapter, College of Emergency Physicians.\n       (8) Gold Cross Ambulance Service.\n       (9) North Memorial Health Care.\n       (10) Minnesota Hospital and Healthcare Partnership.\n       (11) West Central Minnesota Emergency Medical Services \n     Program.\n  Mr. GRAMS. Thank you, Mr. President. The Emergency Medical Services \nEfficiency Act is not the answer to all of the problems. But it is the \nfirst step in addressing the concerns of a very important segment of \nboth our health care and transportation systems. This bill is a \nblueprint for further improvements in emergency medical services to \nhelp all Americans.\n  By introducing today's legislation early in the session, it is my \nhope that we will call attention to the needs of EMS providers and move \nforward to a more comprehensive bill, one that addresses additional \nconcerns that are equally important to the EMS community as those we \nhave addressed here today.\n  Over the next few weeks, I will be working with EMS providers in \nMinnesota and throughout the country to look at improving four key \nareas: regulatory oversight, technology improvements in medicine and \ntransportation, insurance reimbursement issues, and the EMS functions \nwhich should be transferred and streamlined under the Department of \nTransportation.\n  Senator Graham has worked tirelessly to ensure that the definition of \n``prudent layperson'' apply not only to ambulance service but also to \ncare provided at emergency departments. In our second bill, it is our \nintent to include Senator Graham's new language to ensure that patients \nare not denied reimbursement for emergency care because they failed to \nobtain proper certification or authorization from their insurance \nprovider. I look forward to working with the American Association of \nHealth Plans, which today announced new policies to clarify how health \nplans should cover emergency care, in developing an appropriate \nlegislative solution.\n  The legislation we introduce today and our subsequent work will be \npart of an ongoing effort we hope to include in the newly drafted Rural \nHealth Improvement Act. This important overall effort, in which I have \nalso been involved, will help ensure that rural areas are not \noverlooked in our desire to improve health care delivery.\n  So finally, Mr. President, I look forward to working with Senator \nGraham, Senator Thomas, and others in the months and weeks ahead to \nimprove emergency medical services for patients and providers and \nensure the most efficient use of scarce tax dollars. The American \npeople expect--and of course deserve--nothing less.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 238\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 relating to \nthe treatment of livestock sold on account of weather related \nconditions; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            INVOLUNTARY CONVERSION OF LIVESTOCK LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation to \nprovide equitable treatment under the tax law for farmers and ranchers \nwho are forced to sell their livestock prematurely due to extreme \nweather conditions. I am joined in this effort by Senators Johnson, \nConrad, Dorgan, Baucus, and Harkin.\n  The last few weeks have seen the most extreme winter weather of the \ncentury in the upper Midwest. Prolonged sub-zero temperatures and back-\nto-back blizzards continue to devastate herds of cattle and other \nlivestock. An estimated 50,000 cattle have died since the beginning of \nthe year, and countless thousands of other head of livestock are under \nextreme stress. The President declared the region a national disaster \narea on January 10.\n  A few summers ago, Midwestern States suffered severe floods, which \ndevastated lives and property along these States' rivers and \nshorelines. President Clinton responded quickly by providing disaster \nassistance, $2.5 billion, including $1 billion for agriculture, in \nemergency aid to flooded areas in the Midwest.\n  In addition to receiving disaster payments, many farmers were able to \ntake advantage of provisions in the Internal Revenue Code designed \nprimarily to spread out the impact of taxes on farmers in these \nsituations. Ironically, however, while farmers who lose their\n\n[[Page S875]]\n\ncrops due to floods are covered under these provisions, farmers who \nmust involuntarily sell livestock due to flood and other extreme \nweather conditions, are not.\n  Normally, a taxpayer who uses the cash method of accounting, as most \nfarmers do, must report income in the year in which he or she actually \nreceives the income. The Tax Code, however, outlines certain exceptions \nto this rule where disaster conditions generate income to the farmer \nthat otherwise would not have been received at that time. For example, \none exception allows farmers who receive insurance proceeds or disaster \npayments when crops are destroyed or damaged due to drought, flood, or \nany other natural disaster to include those proceeds in income in the \nyear following the disaster, if that is when the income from the crops \notherwise would have been received.\n  Two other provisions deal with involuntary conversion of livestock. \nThe first provision enables livestock producers who are forced to sell \nherds due to drought conditions to defer tax on any gain from these \nsales by reinvesting the proceeds in similar property within a 2-year \nperiod. The second provision allows livestock producers who choose not \nto reinvest in similar property to elect to include proceeds from the \nsale of the livestock in taxable income in the year following the sale.\n  For no apparent reason, the two provisions dealing with livestock do \nnot mention the situation where livestock is involuntarily sold due to \nflooding, blizzards, or other extreme conditions. Thus, these weather \nemergencies do not trigger the benefits of those provisions. Yet, many \nlivestock producers are currently being compelled to sell livestock \nbecause they are under stress, just as they were forced to by the \nfloods the other year to sell their animals because the crops necessary \nto feed the livestock and the fences for containing them had been \nwashed out.\n  Our proposal would expand the availability of the existing livestock \ntax provisions to include involuntary conversions of livestock due to \nflooding and other extreme, weather related conditions. This would \nconform the treatment of crops and livestock in this respect.\n  Last Congress, I introduced this bill in the Senate as S. 109, and my \ncolleague, Senator Johnson, introduced a companion measure in the \nHouse--H.R. 1588--when he was a Member of that body. Similar \nlegislation was passed by Congress as part of the Revenue Act of 1992. \nUnfortunately, that legislation was subsequently vetoed for unrelated \nreasons. The Department of the Treasury testified in support of the \nchange in the last Congress. In 1995, the Joint Committee on Taxation \nestimated the revenue loss from my bill to be $17 million over 6 years.\n  Let me emphasize that the tax provisions we are dealing with here \naffect the timing of tax payments, not forgiveness of tax liability. \nThe distinguished Governor of South Dakota, William Janklow, called me \na few days ago and emphasized how important it would be for Congress to \nmake this change as soon as possible. I hope my colleagues will agree \nthat we should not shut out some farmers--livestock producers--from the \ndisaster related provisions of the Tax Code simply because the natural \ndisaster involved was severe winter conditions or a flood instead of a \ndrought. That just doesn't make sense.\n  The American Farm Bureau Federation and the National Farmers Union \nhave endorsed the bill. I urge my colleagues to give it favorable and \nearly consideration.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 239\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF LIVESTOCK SOLD ON ACCOUNT OF WEATHER-\n                   RELATED CONDITIONS.\n\n       (a) Deferral of Income Inclusion.--Subsection (e) of \n     section 451 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to \n     special rules of proceeds from livestock sold on account of \n     drought) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``drought conditions, and that these \n     drought conditions'' in paragraph (1) and inserting \n     ``drought, flood, or other weather-related conditions, and \n     that such conditions''; and\n       (2) by inserting ``, Flood, or Other Weather-Related \n     Conditions'' after ``Drought'' in the subsection heading.\n       (b) Involuntary Conversions.--Subsection (e) of section \n     1033 of such Code (relating to livestock sold on account of \n     drought) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``, flood, or other weather-related \n     conditions'' before the period at the end thereof; and\n       (2) by inserting ``, Flood, or Other Weather-Related \n     Conditions'' after ``Drought'' in the subsection heading.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to sales and exchanges after December 31, 1996.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I'm pleased to join Senator Daschle and \nothers in reintroducing legislation to bring much-needed tax relief to \nfamily farmers and ranchers whose businesses have suffered from unduly \nharsh weather conditions in the Upper Midwest this winter.\n  Livestock producers in North Dakota and other States in the Northern \nPlains have been facing unusually extreme conditions during this \nwinter. North Dakota has experienced at least a half-dozen blizzards, \nwinds of up to 50 miles per hour, and wind chills of near 80 below \nzero.\n  Our livestock producers have had great difficulty in moving snow and \nkeeping paths open to both feed and livestock. Our interstate highways \nhave been closed seven times this winter so it is easy to imagine the \ndifficulties that our rural people have had in keeping township roads \nopen and usable.\n  Some are beginning to compare this winter to the infamous winter of \n1886 which nearly wiped out the cattle industry on the Northern Plains. \nThat was the year in which Teddy Roosevelt lost his cattle herd on his \nranch in the North Dakota badlands.\n  When this winter is over, we will be able to make some judgments as \nto whether this winter will be another of those history-making times \nwhich will haunt the memories of another generation of farmers and \nranchers in the Dakotas.\n  But right now, we need to do everything possible to ease the burdens \nthat our livestock producers are facing. The U.S. Department of \nAgriculture has been working very hard to get workable programs to help \nproducers get to their livestock and feed. They have also been working \non the longer range problem of helping ranchers and farmers with the \nextra feed supplies that are needed to get these cattle through the \nwinter.\n  While USDA has had some problems in getting those programs on the \nground, we certainly appreciate the Department's efforts especially \nwhen we consider the limited tools that are currently available to \nthem. It should be noted that the Emergency Livestock Feed Assistance \nprogram that would normally have been available for such a situation \nwas suspended by the 1996 farm law. This has put USDA in a position of \nhaving very limited resources and authorities for this emergency.\n  Compounding the problems of our livestock producers have been the \nvery low cattle prices that have come from a combination of being at \nthe bottom of a cattle pricing cycle together with record levels of \nconcentration in the marketplace.\n  Our producers have had a hard time maintaining their herds even \nwithout this winter emergency. That is why it is extremely important \nthat we help them through this time period.\n  Some of our producers are making the choice to either sell their \ncattle altogether or reduce the size of their herd, rather than to \ncontinue to maintain them at high costs and high risk.\n  Unfortunately our current tax laws hinder such sales in the case of \nmost weather-related disasters except for drought. If a farmer or \nrancher is forced to sell cattle or other livestock prematurely this \nwinter, they will be burdened with a large tax bill. There is no \nprovision at present for tax deferral of gains on involuntary \nconversions of livestock for severe winter conditions. The Tax Code \nallows for such deferrals only for drought conditions.\n  In the last session of Congress, I cosponsored legislation with \nSenator Daschle that would have expanded this tax provision to respond \nto a variety of severe weather conditions.\n  Our legislation would allow a farmer or rancher to defer paying taxes \non the proceeds of an involuntary sale of livestock due to severe \nweather-related emergencies if he reinvests the proceeds in similar \nproperty down the\n\n[[Page S876]]\n\nroad. A farmer or rancher who decides not to reinvest the proceeds \nunder these circumstances may elect to report the proceeds from the \nsale on the next year's tax return. This legislation, which is \nsupported by the Administration, builds upon similar provisions in the \nTax Code which is provided in the case of forced livestock sales due to \ndrought.\n  Initial estimates following the January 10th blizzard across our \nState indicated that about 2,000 livestock producers were selling \nnearly 35,000 additional cattle as a result of that storm. The weekly \nreports from the North Dakota Agricultural Statistics Service indicate \nthat cattle sales continue to be more than 20 percent above normal in \nthe State.\n  This legislation will give these producers an additional tool in \nmanaging their operations so that these involuntary conversions do not \nimpose additional financial hardships upon them.\n  Again I am pleased to once again cosponsor this legislation with \nSenator Daschle to help our producers meet the unusual conditions of \nthis winter. I urge my colleagues to join us in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n\n  S. 240. A bill to provide for the protection of books and materials \nof the Library of Congress, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n\n\n              THE LIBRARY OF CONGRESS BOOK PROTECTION ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation \nto help protect the valuable resources of the Library of Congress. The \nLibrary of Congress Protection Act will help the Library of Congress \nstop abuses of its free book loan program by authorizing the Library to \nimpose fines for books that are long overdue.\n  I am introducing this legislation to empower Library of Congress \nofficials to crack down on individuals who seriously abuse their \nLibrary privileges, by keeping books too long or failing to return \nthem. Library of Congress officials should not have to tolerate the \nfact that many individuals are apparently unconcerned about returning \nthe books that taxpayers provide for them. Congress should not prevent \nthe Library from instituting strengthened policies to hold severely \ndelinquent borrowers responsible for their tardiness.\n  This legislation will enable the Library of Congress to implement a \nreasonable overdue book charge policy similar to those of most public \nlibraries across America. By doing so, the many Members of Congress, \ncongressional staffers, and executive branch employees who benefit from \nthis magnificent institution will have an added incentive to comply \nwith the generous loan policies of the Library of Congress.\n  This proposal is very basic, but it will afford Library officials the \nleverage and flexibility they need to address this problem. This bill \nwill help Library of Congress officials keep better track of their \nresources, and will spur many delinquent borrowers to return the books \nthat taxpayers provide for them completely free of charge.\n  The Library of Congress Book Protection Act would direct the Library \nto implement an overdue book charge policy for books improperly held \nover 70 days. These individuals or offices will have their privileges \nsuspended until their fines are paid in full. Library of Congress \nofficials will, however, be able to waive such penalties when \nappropriate. The Library would also be authorized to retain the funds \nreceived from late book fines, as well. Finally, the offices of \nseverely delinquent borrowers and the fines they owe will be published \nin the annual report submitted by the Library to its oversight \ncommittees.\n  While figures for the 104th Congress have not been published yet, \npreliminary data shows that as of December 28, 1996, over 2,200 books \nwere over 30 days overdue. Figures published by the Library during the \n103d Congress showed that out of the 20,000 books that were out on \nloan, over one-third were listed as overdue. One half of the 4,200 \nbooks on loan to congressional staff and the media were listed as \noverdue, and 1 in 5 books out on loan to Members, committees, and \ncongressional support agencies had been overdue for more than 2 months. \nLibrary of Congress officials state that over 300,000 books are missing \nfrom their collections dating back to 1978, and the estimated cost of \nthese thefts is $12 million.\n  I am concerned about the fact that it is all too easy for individuals \nto disregard their responsibility to return books to the Library of \nCongress in a timely manner. This negligence is not only unfair to the \nother users of the Library, but it also drains the Library's resources \nin chasing down overdue or missing books.\n  In addition to Members of Congress and congressional staff, the \nLibrary of Congress also makes loans to executive branch departments \nand agencies, the judiciary and diplomatic corps, the press, and other \ninstitutions. As I have mentioned, Mr. President, the Library of \nCongress is barred from charging late fees for overdue books in \ncontrast to virtually every other publicly funded library in America. \nFurthermore, the Library cannot retain any funds that might be \ncollected due to the loss or damage of loaned books. It's clearly time \nto change these unwise restrictions and strengthen the Library's \nability to protect its resources, and I hope Members of the Senate will \nsupport this legislation to do so.\n  Surely, it's not asking too much of the individuals and offices \nfortunate enough to use the Library of Congress to do so in a \nresponsible manner. Even under the new borrowing guidelines that would \nbe instituted by this legislation, there really is no reason for any \nwell-intentioned borrower ever to have to pay late fines or have their \nprivileges suspended. I'm optimistic that the mere specter of having to \npay overdue book fines will coax delinquent borrowers into \nresponsibility renewing their book loans or returning the books.\n  I hope that the Senate will adopt this legislation to implement \nprudent new guidelines in the book loan policies of the Library of \nCongress.\n                                  _____\n                                 \n       By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 241. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nfamily-owned business exclusion from the gross estate subject to estate \ntax, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 THE AMERICAN FAMILY-OWNED BUSINESS ACT\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAmerican Family-Owned Business Act--a bill that will preserve the \nAmerican family businesses and save jobs across the country. This bill \ncuts estate tax rates in half and also creates a new exclusion that \ncompletely eliminates the estate tax for small businesses. Under the \nnew exclusion, family-owned businesses can exempt up to $1.5 million of \nfamily business assets from their estate. If a family business is \nvalued at more than $1.5 million, the excess is taxed at one-half of \nthe current rates--thus providing a maximum tax rate of 27.5 percent.\n  This legislation was introduced in the last Congress by my good \nfriend, the former majority leader, Bob Dole. Although this legislation \nwas included in S. 2, The Family Tax Relief Act, I feel so strongly \nabout the need for estate tax relief for family-owned businesses and \nfarmers that I felt it was necessary to introduce this legislation on \nits own.\n  The current Federal estate tax is just too burdensome on the American \nfamily. Time and time again, farmers and other business owners across \nthe country have told me that estate tax rates are just too high. They \nrise quickly from 18 to 55 percent, effectively making the Government a \n50-50 partner in a family business.\n  Even the most sophisticated estate tax planning and the purchase of \nlife insurance cannot sufficiently mitigate the effects of these high \nrates, leaving families no recourse but to sell their businesses to pay \nthe estate tax. This bill will stop these forced sales from happening \nagain.\n  I agree with many who say that estate tax rates should be reduced \nacross the board, or repealed entirely. I applaud my colleague, Senator \nKyl, who is leading the effort to repeal the estate tax. And I hope \nthat we do that some day. But given our current budget crisis, we will \nlikely have to take an incremental approach on the estate tax. This \nlegislation takes an important step in that direction.\n  This legislation will protect and preserve family enterprises. We \nknow too\n\n[[Page S877]]\n\nwell the adverse impact of an estate tax-forced sale. The family loses \nits livelihood, the family business employees lose their jobs, and the \ncommunity suffers.\n  We must do all that we can to help family-owned businesses not only \nsurvive, but also prosper. They are the job creators in this country. \nIn the 1980's alone, family businesses accounted for an increase of \nmore than 20 million private-sector jobs.\n  By relieving families of the burden of the estate tax and letting \nthem keep their businesses, they can continue to prosper. And when \nfamilies continue to operate their businesses, we all benefit--the \nbusiness' employees keep their jobs, the government receives income \ntaxes on business profits, and the families retain their livelihood.\n  The bill requires heirs to participate in the family business. These \nparticipation rules are deliberately flexible and recognize that \ndifferent family businesses need differing levels of participation by \nheirs.\n  The estate tax is not a Democratic or a Republican problem, or one \nthat affects only rural or urban families. There are farmers, ranchers, \nor other family businesses in each State that would benefit from this \nlegislation.\n  This bill provides the critical relief needed for American families' \nbusinesses. I urge my colleagues to support this effort, and I hope \nthat Congress will act expeditiously on this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 242. A bill to require a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate to \npass any bill increasing taxes; to the Committee on the Budget and the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs, jointly, pursuant to the order of \nAugust 4, 1977, with instructions that if one committee reports, the \nother committee have 30 days to report or be discharged.\n\n\n              Tax Fairness and Accountability Act of 1996\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President I introduce legislation entitled the \n``Tax Fairness and Accountability Act of 1997.'' This legislation \nrequires a supermajority vote in the Senate in order to raise taxes and \neliminates the 60-vote Congressional Budget Act point of order against \nreducing taxes. A supermajority vote requirement is the strongest \npossible defense for this body's spending excesses. By requiring 60 \nvotes in the Senate to approve a tax increase rather than a simple \nmajority, we will ensure that Congress does not balance the budget on \nthe backs of taxpayers.\n  Although our national debt currently stands at over $5.3 trillion, \nCongress' insatiable appetite for spending has not diminished. Our \ninability to reach a balanced budget for the past 28 years is not due \nto undertaxation but rather over spending. It is time that we place \nlimits on the ability of government to casually dip into the pockets of \nan already overtaxed citizenry.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, Americans spend more on their tax \nbill than food, shelter and clothing combined. This is simply \noutrageous. The American people cannot afford to be taxed anymore. \nArizonans, for example, had to work until almost the beginning of May \nto pay their tax bill. Today nearly 40 percent of the American family's \npaycheck goes toward some kind of tax.\n  There have been numerous studies that show when Congress increases \ntaxes it increases spending by a greater amount. One study by the Joint \nEconomic Committee, showed that for every dollar that was raised in \ntaxes, Congress spent $1.16. Thus, the deficit reduction claimed by \nthose who support raising taxes is lost. The 1990 budget debacle is the \nbest example of Congress' chronic disease called tax and spend. Under \nthe 1990 budget deal Congress was supposed to cut spending but of \ncourse it never did. The tough spending caps that were put in place \nunder this agreement, were raised by Congress in order to satisfy their \ninsatiable appetite for spending. We must do everything in our power to \nfind a remedy for this disease. The supermajority vote requirement is \nthe first dose of the medicine.\n  This legislation is so important because politicians have forgotten \nwhose money they are spending in Washington. Americans work very hard \nfor the money they earn and send to Washington. Again and again studies \nshow that people are working harder for less and are spending more time \nat work. In many families one or both parents must work two and three \njobs just to make ends meet, leaving less and less time for family. \nCongress needs to take heed of these facts and recognize that families \nall across America are being forced to tighten their belts as the tax \nman continues to take an evergrowing portion of their money. Balancing \nthe budget should require Congress to tighten their belt by reducing \nspending, not by asking Americans to pay more. I hope the Senate will \nact quickly on this important legislation.\n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Ford, and Mr. \n        Gorton):\n  S. 243. A bill to provide for a short term reinstatement of expired \nAirport and airway trust fund taxes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n\n\n               REINSTATEMENT OF THE AVIATION EXCISE TAXES\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill, \ncosponsored by Senators Hollings and Ford, to reinstate the aviation \nexcise taxes until September 29, 1997.\n  On December 31, 1996, the aviation excise taxes expired. The aviation \nexcise taxes include a 10-percent passenger ticket tax, a 6.25-percent \nfreight waybill tax, a $6 per person international departure tax, and \nfuel taxes imposed upon general aviation aircraft. These taxes were the \nprincipal source of revenues for the airport and airway trust fund, \nwhich funds most of the budget of the Federal Aviation Administration \n[FAA] and all of the FAA capital programs.\n  Recent estimates by the General Accounting Office [GAO] and the FAA \nindicate that, unless the excise taxes are reinstated, the trust fund \nwill be out of available moneys by March or April of this year. The FAA \nwill have to terminate spending on its capital programs--the safety and \nsecurity enhancements that we have worked so hard to institute.\n  It is unconscionable to allow the FAA to go without money that is \nabsolutely essential to fund the safety and security programs of the \nnational air transportation system.\n  The current estimates of when the trust fund will be out of available \nmoney--which I just learned today--are much more dire than originally \nanticipated. There are several reasons for the unexpected worsening of \nthe FAA's fiscal situation.\n  The Treasury Department may have mistakenly credited the trust fund \nwith $1.5 billion. Under normal circumstances, there is a gap in the \ntime between the collection of taxes on airline tickets and the payment \nof those taxes into the Treasury by the airlines. In addition, those \ntaxes are first paid into the general fund before being credited to the \ntrust fund. When the aviation excise tax expired, so did the authority \nto transfer the revenues from the general fund to the trust fund.\n  The result of this process is that billions in tax revenues from 1996 \nare not paid to Treasury until 1997. Because those revenues cannot be \ntransferred out of the general fund, the trust fund may have far less \nmoney than originally estimated. The trust fund could be out of \navailable money by March, with curtailment of spending beginning even \nbefore that time because of the stringent provisions of the Anti-\nDeficiency Act.\n  On one particular point, I want to be very clear--the taxes should \nnot be extended for more than a few months. We have a process in place \nto explore alternative long-term funding mechanisms to ensure the \nfiscal viability of the FAA and its important safety and security \nmissions. Until the results of those studies are available and \nalternative mechanisms are in place, we must ensure that adequate \nfunding is provided for these programs.\n  These taxes were allowed to expire at the end of last December so \nthat reinstatement of the taxes would count for new revenues which can \nbe used to offset tax cuts or spending in other parts of the Federal \nbudget. Playing budget games with these excise taxes is simply \ndeplorable. The excise taxes paid by the users of the national air \ntransportation system must be dedicated to that system.\n  Mr. President, if the situation was dangerous before, it has now \nreached a very critical point. We must not delay any longer. Therefore, \nI am introducing this bill to take immediate action\n\n[[Page S878]]\n\nto begin the process of reinstating the aviation excise taxes until \nSeptember 29, 1997. I will work closely with Senators Lott and Daschle \nto ensure early Senate action on this vitally important measure, so \nthat the safety of our airline transportation system is not adversely \naffected.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of extending the \naviation ticket tax through the end of fiscal year 1997. This tax is \nvery important to the day-to-day operation of our Nation's aviation \nsystem. Money to improve, maintain, and run our airports is 100 percent \nsupported by fees paid by the users of the air transportation system. \nIt is not paid for by the taxes we all pay on April 15. Every time they \nfly, people have been paying the user fees in the form of a ticket tax. \nThat money has been going into the airport and airway trust fund, and \nthe money is then disbursed through the appropriations process. We tell \npeople to pay these fees, and we tell them we will then spend it on \nairports.\n  However, there is one small problem. The ticket tax expired at the \nend of 1996. Due to budget games, the money that we thought would be in \nthe trust fund is not there. Originally we were advised that the trust \nfund would be broke in July, but now it appears that it will be \ndepleted as early as March. If this situation is not corrected, \nmillions of dollars in airport modernization projects, aviation safety \nenhancements, and airport security efforts will have to be delayed or \nterminated. The obvious answer to this untenable situation is to \nreinstate the aviation ticket tax, and that is why I am cosponsoring \nSenator McCain's bill. I urge my fellow colleagues to quit playing \nbudget games and start fulfilling Government's primary function--\npreserving the safety of the American people.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues in cosponsoring a \nbill to reinstate the aviation ticket tax through September 29, 1997. \nThis tax goes directly into the aviation trust fund. The tax has \nalready expired and we cannot allow the trust fund to go broke. If that \noccurs, then it will be very difficult for us to continue to maintain \nthe safety and security initiatives that are needed in order to secure \nand ensure the safety of our aviation system.\n  I do not need to remind my colleagues of the importance of aviation \nsafety. Over the past year, we have seen too many headlines which have \nunderscored the need for a safe and secure aviation system. I urge my \ncolleagues to act expeditiously on this very important matter.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, on January 1, 1997, the aviation system in \nthe United States received a serious blow when the aviation excise \ntaxes lapsed. Together, these taxes--the 10-percent passenger ticket \ntax; the 6.25-percent cargo waybill tax; the $6.00 per person \ninternational departure tax; and certain general aviation fuel taxes--\naccount for more than 90 percent of the revenues in the airport and \nairway trust fund, which funds the Federal Aviation Administration and \nits programs.\n  Without the collection of these revenues, the uncommitted balance of \nthe airport and airway trust fund is quickly being depleted. In fact, \nit is running dry at a rate of $175 per second --more than $15 million \nevery day. Yesterday, officials at the Department of the Treasury \nannounced that if no action is taken to reimpose these taxes, the trust \nfund could be insolvent as early as March.\n  For this reason, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators McCain, \nHollings, and Ford, in sponsoring the Airport and Airway Trust Fund \nTaxes Short Term Reinstatement Act. This legislation will extend the \nexisting system of aviation excise taxes through September 29, 1997, \nand give Internal Revenue Service authority to transfer previously \ncollected aviation excise taxes into the airport and airway trust fund.\n  The numerous aviation tragedies in 1996 have, I believe, lowered the \npublic's confidence in the safety of the U.S. aviation system. While \nour system continues to be the safest aviation system in the world, \nCongress owes it to the American people to consider this legislation as \nquickly as possible to ensure aviation safety, security, and capital \ninvestment are not jeopardized in any manner.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 244. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe increase in the tax on Social Security benefits; to the Committee \non Finance.\n\n\n                    THE SENIOR CITIZENS' EQUITY ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I introduce legislation that repeals the \nincrease in tax on Social Security benefits. The Omnibus Budget \nReconciliation Act of 1993 increased the taxable proportion of Social \nSecurity benefits from 50 to 85 percent for Social Security recipients \nwhose threshold incomes exceed $34,000--(single)--and $44,000--\n(couples). The legislation I am introducing today simply phases out \nthis increase gradually over a 4-year period. In 1997, the applicable \npercentage would be 75 percent; in 1998, 65 percent; in 1999, 60 \npercent; in 2000, 55 percent; and finally in 2001, the taxable \npercentage would return to 50 percent.\n  I believe the increase in the taxable portion of Social Security \nbenefits was blatantly unfair because it changed the rules in the \nmiddle of the game. Responsible senior citizens who had carefully \nplanned for their retirement were penalized and saw their income fall \nwhile their marginal tax rate skyrocketed. Nearly 9,000 seniors \nrepresenting 23.4 percent of recipients are affected by this provision. \nThese Seniors relied on, and based their decisions on, the old law, and \nthey have no recourse to go back in time to change their decisions \nbased on the new law.\n  Clearly, we should be encouraging all Americans to save and invest \nfor the future. We can no longer expect that Social Security benefits \nwill take care of all our retirement needs. If Congress continues to \nchange the rules after plans and investment decisions have been made, \nwe will diminish the incentive for Americans to prepare for the future \nand plan accordingly.\n  I am consistently amazed by the perverse disincentives Congress \nenacts. Aside from being patently unfair, taxing 85 percent of Social \nSecurity benefits above the current income levels creates a tremendous \ndisincentive for affected seniors to work. It simply doesn't make sense \nto work if every dollar you earn over the threshold drastically reduces \nyour Social Security benefits.\n  I am pleased that this legislation is supported by the National \nCommittee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare and the Seniors \nCoalition. I ask unanimous consent to submit their letters of \nendorsement into the Record.\n  The problems with this additional tax on Social Security benefits are \nstrikingly similar to the Social Security earnings limit. I am pleased \nthat Congress finally enacted an increase in the earnings limit last \nyear and I hope that we will act expeditiously on this legislation.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The Seniors Coalition,\n\n                                    Fairfax, VA, January 27, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the 2.4 million members \n     of The Seniors Coalition, I would like to express our strong \n     support for your legislation repealing the 1993 increase in \n     taxes on Social Security benefits. While this legislation is \n     desirable, total repeal would be preferable.\n       The arguments you made at the time of introduction are \n     certainly persuasive. However, they apply as much to a tax on \n     50 percent of benefits as they do to a tax on 85 percent of \n     benefits. We understand the arguments in favor of taxes on \n     some portion of benefits, and recognize the supposed adverse \n     revenue impacts from total repeal. Accordingly, while The \n     Seniors Coalition would prefer to see total repeal of all \n     taxes on Social Security benefits, we do recommend immediate \n     passage of your bill at least rolling back the 1993 increase. \n     We will be happy to make this case in public hearings, and \n     you certainly have permission to use our support to promote \n     passage of the bill.\n       Please let us know if there are further steps we can take \n     to move this legislation to passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Thair Phillips,\n     Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    National Committee To Preserve\n\n\n                                 Social Security and Medicare,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Committee to Preserve \n     Social Security and Medicare welcomes as a major step in the \n     right direction your legislation to repeal the inequitable \n     tax increase on Social Security benefits enacted as part of \n     the 1993 budget reconciliation bill.\n\n[[Page S879]]\n\n       The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 increased the \n     amount of Social Security benefits subject to tax from 50 \n     percent to 85 percent for individual beneficiaries with \n     income above $34,000 or for couples with income above \n     $44,000. The ``Senior Citizens' Equity Act'' would gradually \n     phase out this increase and return the taxable percentage to \n     50 percent by the year 2001.\n       The 1993 tax increase affects not only wealthy seniors but \n     also middle income seniors. It unfairly penalizes responsible \n     senior citizens who planned for their retirement through \n     employment, saving, and investment. Many National Committee \n     Members need or want to work, but they also deserve to \n     receive their retirement benefits. Whether the senior works \n     out of the need for income or the pleasure of working, taxing \n     85 percent of social security benefits over the current \n     income thresholds exacts a high price. The increased tax rate \n     only discourages work and retirement savings.\n       Moreover, a Price-Waterhouse analysis demonstrated that the \n     1993 bill targeted seniors by increasing their tax burden \n     more than non-seniors in every income category--on average \n     twice as great for senior families as non-senior families. \n     Middle income seniors experienced a disproportionately large \n     tax increase under the 1993 bill. For your information, we \n     are enclosing a summary of the Price-Waterhouse data.\n       On behalf of older Americans, we thank you for your work to \n     enact this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Martha A.

Senior families in the second \n     lowest income category will see a tax increase of 3.8% while \n     all families in the same category will see a reduction of \n     1.1%. While seniors in these groups are unaffected by the \n     increased tax on Social Security benefits, they are affected \n     by the energy tax and receive little or no assistance from \n     the earned income tax credit.\n       Middle income seniors also will see a disproportionately \n     large tax increase. Seniors with income between $24,000 and \n     $72,000 will have tax increases that are 2.5 to 6 times \n     higher than non-senior families without children in \n     comparable income classes.\n       Under the conference bill, seniors will face an average \n     increased tax burden of 7.5%, more than double the 3.5% \n     increase for non-seniors without children.\n\n  PERCENTAGE CHANGE IN FEDERAL TAXES \\1\\ FROM RECONCILIATION CONFERENCE\n        BILL BY 2-PERSON FAMILY INCOME CLASSES \\2\\ BY FAMILY TYPE\n             [1994 income levels for 1998 proposed tax law]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                       Non-\n                                                      senior\n  Adjusted family income for 2 persons     Senior    families     All\n                                          families     w/o      families\n                                                     children\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n0-$12,900..............................        4.6       -4.3      -28.1\n$12,901-$23,600........................        3.8        0.8       -1.1\n$23,601-$35,300........................        2.8        1.0        1.0\n$35,301-$53,300........................        2.3        0.9        1.0\n$53.301-$72,000........................        6.4        1.0        1.4\n$$72,000 or more.......................        9.8        6.5        8.4\nAll....................................        7.5        3.5        3.8\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ Includes all permanent tax changes in conference agreement and\n  includes the outlay portion of the earned income tax credit.\n\\2\\ Percentage change in taxes is for all families by family size\n  adjusted income quintiles.

A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to authorize \nthe appointment of additional bankruptcy judges for the judicial \ndistrict of Maryland; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                         JUDGESHIP LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise for myself and my distinguished \ncolleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, to introduce a bill crucial \nto the administration of justice and the economy in our State. This \nbill provides for two additional bankruptcy judgeships in the Federal \nJudicial District of Maryland. A look at the conditions currently \nfacing Maryland's bankruptcy judges reveals the critical need for these \nnew judgeships.\n  Recent years have witnessed a sharp rise in bankruptcy filings \nnationwide. Last year, for the first time in our history, filings \nduring a 12-month period--June 1995-June 1996--exceeded 1 million, a \n21.4-percent rise from the prior 12-month period. This trend has many \ncauses, including greater access to credit, a lagging economy in some \nregions, and public and private downsizing. Such sharp increases in \nfilings strain the ability of bankruptcy judges to administer justice \npromptly and effectively, and jeopardize the stabilization of creditor-\ndebtor relations that is, after all, the goal of bankruptcy law.\n  No State has been more affected by these trends than Maryland. \nBankruptcies there have quadrupled in the past decade. As filings rise \nnationwide, Maryland rates of increase have significantly exceeded \nFederal rates. No end appears to be in sight. Maryland filings during \nJanuary-November 1996 exceeded State filings during the same period in \n1995 by 36 percent; in the July-November 1996 period, State filings \nexceeded by 45 percent filings during the same period in 1995.\n  In 1991, the U.S. Judicial Conference, using a 1990 Federal Judicial \nCenter time-management study, adopted a case-weighting system for \nbankruptcy judges, under which different types of cases were assigned \ndifferent degrees of difficulty and overall weighted case-hour goals \nwere established for the judges. Under this system, the average U.S. \nbankruptcy judge has a weighted case-hour load of about 1,250 hours per \nyear. The Judicial Conference generally does not consider a request for \nnew bankruptcy judgeships by a Federal judicial district unless the \naverage case-hour total for the district's judges exceeds 1,500.\n  Given these yardsticks, the burdens facing the district of Maryland's \nbankruptcy judges are truly astounding.\n  In 1993, the national weighted case-hour average was 1,362 hours; by \ncontrast, the Maryland average for that year was 59 percent greater--\n2,168 hours.\n  In 1994, the national average was 1,227 hours; the 1994 Maryland \naverage was 75 percent greater--2,143 hours.\n  In 1995, the national average was 1,149 hours; the 1995 Maryland \naverage was 72 percent greater--1,982 hours.\n  In 1996, the national average was 1,272 hours; the Maryland total for \nthat year was 75 percent greater--2,230 hours.\n  So for each of the last 4 years, the average weighted case-hours for \nMaryland's bankruptcy judges have exceeded by a wide margin not only \nthe national average, but also the 1,500-hour yardstick used by the \nJudicial Conference to rate requests for additional judges.\n  Other States have faced temporary overloads, but only Maryland can \nclaim the dubious distinction of having one of the Nation's most \noverworked bankruptcy courts for each of the last 4 years. In fact, \nonly the District of Maryland has ranked in the top 3 among the 91 \nFederal judicial districts during each of the 8 biannual evaluations of \nbankruptcy judges' case-hours since September 1992.\n  This situation cries out for remedial action. Recognizing as much, \nthe Judicial Conference recommended to the 104th Congress that Maryland \nreceive an additional bankruptcy judgeship. Unfortunately, this \nproposal was not enacted into law and, as a result, the problem has \nworsened considerably.\n  I have cited data on increased bankruptcy filings in Maryland during \nlate 1996. If Maryland received one additional bankruptcy judge \ntomorrow, the case-hours per judge in the district would still be \n1,784, 141 percent of the national average and well in excess of the \n1,500-hour mark used to rate a district's need for new judges.\n  In fact, even if Maryland received two new bankruptcy judges, its per \njudge caseload would still exceed the national average by 18 percent. \nTo place Maryland at the national average, three additional bankruptcy \njudges would be required. Yet this bill adds only two judgeships, the \nminimum response according to those most familiar with the problem. \nThis is the number recommended to the Judicial Conference by the Fourth \nCircuit Judicial Council, and I fully expect the Judicial Conference to \ninclude two new Maryland judgeships in its spring recommendations to \nCongress.\n  New judgeships are essential not only for effective judicial \nadministration,\n\n[[Page S880]]\n\nbut also for Maryland's economy. Bankruptcy laws are crafted to foster \norderly, constructive relationships between debtors and creditors \nduring times of economic difficulty. This in turn results in businesses \nbeing reorganized, jobs--provided by creditors and debtors--preserved, \nand debts managed fairly. Overworked bankruptcy courts have a \ndestabilizing effect on this system.\n  Consider an example. Bankruptcy law provides debtors temporary relief \nfrom the claims of creditors, allowing the debtor to adopt a \nreorganization plan, thereby improving its chances of recovery, and \nkeeping creditors from cutting in line in front of other creditors who \nhave priority claims on debtor assets. But the law also allows a court \nto grant creditors relief from a stay where the creditor shows that its \nclaim will not receive adequate protection under normal procedures. \nUnder this procedure, a court must hold a hearing 30 days after an \napplication for relief from the stay, or automatically grant relief.\n\n  Because of the importance of these hearings, Maryland's bankruptcy \njudges routinely set aside 1 day per week to conduct them. One such \njudge, on December 6, 1996, had on his calendar 125 motions for relief \nfrom stay, a caseload that obviously precludes these cases from being \nfully heard. Thus, creditors seeking to cut in line, to the detriment \nof the debtor, other creditors, and the orderly administration of the \nbankrupt estate, may file for relief from stay, knowing that the case \nwill not likely be heard and that the creditor will receive automatic \nrelief under the law. Failure to hold a timely hearing may result in \nthe inability of a debtor to reorganize, or in the cheating of other \nworthy creditors.\n  Similarly, the extreme caseloads faced by Maryland's bankruptcy \njudges allow dishonest debtors to dissipate assets, again at the \nexpense of worthy creditors.\n  In short, the inevitable delays occasioned by the lack of judges harm \nboth creditors and debtors, thereby imperiling businesses and the \npeople employed by them. Is it any wonder that private bankruptcy \npractitioners and business groups also support additional bankruptcy \njudges for the District of Maryland? To quote Susan Souder, president \nof the Maryland Federal Bar Association, ``Maryland citizens, \nbusinesses, and lenders should be entitled to the same protection of \nthe courts as their counterparts in other States.'' Currently they do \nnot receive such protection. Two new bankruptcy judges in the District \nof Maryland are imperative if we are to address this critical problem.\n  In closing, let me commend the dedicated efforts of Maryland's four \nsitting bankruptcy judges--Chief Judge Paul Mannes and Judges Duncan \nKier, James Schneider, and Steve Derby. Their dedication to the \nadministration of justice is especially impressive given the \nextraordinary burdens placed upon them.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Paul S. Sarbanes, in sponsoring this important legislation. \nThis bill would authorize the appointment of additional bankruptcy \njudges for the state of Maryland.\n  Bankruptcy filings nationwide have dramatically increased. In my \nState of Maryland, over 20,000 individuals and businesses filed \nbankruptcy last year. Unfortunately, bankruptcy filings have hit a peak \nnationwide with both individuals and businesses seeking relief from \nfinancial debt. While the economic climate in Maryland is much better \nthan in many parts of the country, the recent recession has had an \nimpact on consumers in my State.\n  This bill will give relief to bankruptcy judges, who hear cases in \nMaryland. These judges have had a growing caseload to process. This is \ngood news for consumers, who are seeking a reorganization of their \ndebts and creditors seeking to protect their rights. It is critical \nthat consumers are able to have their bankruptcy petitions processed in \na timely manner. For the debtor seeking to protect his home under a \nchapter 13 filing, this bill will help expedite the process and allow \nthe bankruptcy judge to give full consideration to the petition.\n  Maryland's bankruptcy judges have had to struggle to keep up with the \ngrowing docket. Because of the current heavy caseload, judges cannot \nschedule hearings in a timely manner. This adversely affects the \ndebtor's reorganization and delays distributions to creditors.\n  The District of Maryland currently has four bankruptcy judges. The \nJudicial Conference recommended the authorization of an additional \njudge. Their findings were based on the weighted caseload per judge, \nwhich is a good indicator of a judge's workload.\n  Maryland's judges are working strenuously in the best interests of \nboth debtors and creditors. But, their caseload requires additional \nassistance. Maryland needs at a minimum one more bankruptcy judge, but \nwould prefer two more judges.\n  Judges from other districts have helped Maryland's bankruptcy judges. \nHowever, these judges have had to struggle with their own increasing \ncaseloads.\n  The Judicial Conference found that Maryland's judges have a caseload \nper judge that is 70 percent above the national average. Clearly, the \nbankruptcy judges in Maryland's district are overwhelmed by the \ncaseload. Even with the addition of another bankruptcy judge, \nMaryland's judges would still have a caseload that is above the \nnational average. So, I hope we will be able to provide two additional \nslots.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this legislation. It is important \nfor consumers and creditors to process their claims. It is also \nimportant to provide equity in handling the caseload in Maryland's \nbankruptcy courts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 246. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide greater flexibility and choice under the Medicare Program; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                          MEDICARE LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this piece of legislation which I have just \nsent to the desk is an update of the legislation which I introduced \nlast year to address what is obviously one of the most critical issues \nwhich we face as a Congress, and that is the question of the solvency \nof the Medicare trust funds and the proper way to deliver health care \nto our senior citizens.\n  Last year the bill that I am introducing was basically used as the \ncore concept for the structural reform which was included in the \nbalance budget bill which was passed by this Senate and by the Congress \nand sent to the President, which he unfortunately decided to veto.\n  The bill that I have just introduced is an attempt to once again \nbring forward what I consider to be a number of very constructive and \nimportant initiatives in the area of making Medicare a more effective \nsystem of health care for our senior citizens.\n  We have all heard the facts, the facts being that the Medicare system \nis broken, that it is not only broken but that it is headed \naggressively toward bankruptcy, that this year it lost $9.2 billion or \nspent $9.2 billion more in the part A trust fund than it had taken in, \nthat the losses are increasing and will be more than $40 billion \nannually by the year 2000, and that, as I mentioned, the part A trust \nfund in Medicare will be broke, will be insolvent as of the year 2001, \nthe early part of 2001, actually January.\n  I think the actuaries may have fudged a little bit there so they \nwould not have to say 2000. I think we are going to find quickly that \nthe insolvency of the trust fund is going to occur in the year 2000, \nwhich is not very far away from us.\n  What happens when the part A trust fund goes insolvent? Basically, \nthe senior citizens do not have a health care system and do not have an \ninsurance system. There is no provision in the law today that allows us \nto supply health care if there are no funds to pay for it in the part A \ntrust fund. So the system will literally not exist, and senior citizens \nwill be without a health insurance system.\n  We should have addressed this last year, of course. And there was an \nattempt to address it last year. But because of the politics of the \nseason, because we were in an election year--both for this Congress and \nfor the Presidency--it was not addressed, even though sincere attempts \nwere made from this side of the aisle.\n  Those sincere attempts included, in significant part, the bill which \nI have\n\n[[Page S881]]\n\njust reintroduced. But they were confronted by an opposition which \ndemagoged the issue and said that the proposals to try to bring about \nsolvency in the Medicare part A trust fund were actually going to \nundermine that system when in fact what is undermining the system is \nthe pending insolvency of the trust fund.\n  President Clinton, this year, to his credit, has decided to step up \nto the issue of Medicare or at least said he is going to publicly, and \nsuggested that he will propose $138 billion in savings in the Medicare \naccounts.\n  Of course, last year when Republicans proposed savings in the \nMedicare accounts, they were accused of cutting Medicare. I will not \nuse that term because I believe that we need to pursue an effort of \nconstructive dialog here. But it is ironic that this year the President \nwould be calling his proposal to save $138 billion as a constructive \nattempt to address Medicare when last year it was characterized as a \nsavaging and extreme act, both by members of the President's party and \nby the Vice President, when we proposed savings not much higher than \nwhat are being proposed by the President today.\n  Unfortunately, in proposing his $138 billion in savings, the \nPresident has used a lot of old ideas and what you might call attempts \nto address the Medicare system at the margin. Unfortunately, also, \nalthough not accounted for allegedly in the $138 billion of savings, he \nhas also used a massive bookkeeping gimmick of moving home health care \nout of the part A trust fund allegedly into the part B trust fund, so \nactually it is under the taxpayers of America and into the general \nfund. It is an incredible act of flim-flam and one which hopefully will \nnot be accepted by this Congress.\n  Independent of that, the real problem of the $138 billion is not that \nit is inappropriate; it is that it does not address the underlying \nstructural problem of Medicare. It addresses lower payments to \nproviders, mostly. But the problem of Medicare is not the extra dollar \nwe are paying to this provider or the extra 5 percent we are paying to \nthat provider, it is the fact that it is presently structurally not \nsupportable, the fact that the costs of Medicare are simply going up \nmuch faster than the cost of the Government generally and the rate of \ninflation. Not only generally, but also the rate of inflation in the \nhealth care industry.\n  The system is designed as a 1960's automobile. It was created in the \n1960's. In the 1960's it was not a Cadillac system. Everybody knows \nthat. It was probably an Oldsmobile. But it is the exact same \nOldsmobile designed in the 1960's that is now on the road in the \n1990's. It has been patched and repaired and fixed up here and there, \nbut we are still driving down the road in the 1990's in a 1960's car. \nIt is not working. It is not working because it does not acknowledge \nthe fact that the health care delivery system in this country has \nchanged fundamentally since the 1960's.\n  In the 1950's and 1960's most people had a doctor by name, an \nindividual. Most people pursued what was known as fee-for-service \nmedicine where they hired their doctor. Their doctor referred them to \nanother doctor if they had a problem. They hired that doctor, and they \nwent around hiring individual doctors. Today, health care is not \nprovided that way in the private sector, or, for that matter, in the \npublic sector, if you are a member of the Federal Government. Today, \nthe way it is provided, usually you have a prepaid plan where you pay \nan amount upfront and you participate in a plan that provides you a \nvariety of options with a variety of different physicians to go to. It \nmay be in the form of an HMO or PPO or PSO, or it may be in the form of \nsome hybrid, but there are usually a variety of different ways you get \nhealth care. Only rarely today in the private sector and in the Federal \nemployee sector is that health care provided in the manner of going out \nand hiring an individual physician and then moving forward on a fee-\nfor-service basis through the system.\n  Yet, we still have Medicare delivering the vast amount of its care, \nthe vast amount of its service, under the fee-for-service system, which \nhas created an inflation factor in the Medicare system in the cost of \ndelivery of that system which is basically making it unaffordable and \nleading to the bankruptcy of the part A trust fund. Because there is no \ncompetition today in the senior citizens' health dollars, because the \nsystem remains a closed system where fee-for-service really is only the \nviable way--there are a few HMO's, but they are very limited in their \napplicability--then, as a result, we have not brought the market force \ninto the system, we have not brought efficiencies into the system, and \nwe have not seen occur in Medicare what has occurred in the general \nhealth care delivery system in this country.\n\n  Over the last 3 years, the rate of inflation of health care costs in \nthis country, the inflationary rate of growth of health care costs in \nthis country, were less than the general rate of inflation. The general \nrate of inflation was about 3 percent. The rate of growth of health \ncare costs was below that number in the last 3 years in the private \nsector. Yet, in the Medicare system, the rate of growth of health care \nhas remained about 10 percent.\n  What my legislation does essentially is give seniors more options. \nThat is why it is called choice care. It says to senior citizens, you \ncan go out in the marketplace and participate in the system you \npresently have if you want to, in the fee-for-service system. There is \nno reason you cannot stay in the system you are presently in, or, \nalternatively, you can go into one of the other delivery systems--HMO, \nPPO, or PSO--whatever you want to pursue. It gives the senior citizen, \nif you want to simplify it, it gives the senior citizen the same \noptions, essentially, that a person who works for the Federal \nGovernment has who is under the Federal employee health benefits \nprogram. I, as a Member of Congress, have an option to choose a number \nof different health care plans. Why should not the senior citizens have \nthat same option?\n  Basically, we asked that question, and we say they should. They \nshould. Not only would it be more advantageous for a senior citizen to \nbe able to go out and pick any number of health care programs, but it \nwould be more advantageous for us, the Federal Government, and for the \ntaxpayers to have those options, because we would bring competition \ninto the system and hopefully, as a result, bring market forces into \nthe system and, as a result, help to reduce the rate of growth of \nhealth care costs to something closer to what we are seeing in the \nprivate sector.\n  We never expect that a program designed for seniors will have the \nsame rate of growth of health care costs as the private sector because \nseniors, regrettably, have more health problems. We know we can do \nbetter than a 10-percent annual rate of growth. In fact, to make the \ntrust fund solvent, we do not have to get to the private sector rate of \ngrowth. We do not have to get to a 3 percent or less rate of growth. We \ncan make the trust fund solvent with rate of growth somewhere between 6 \nor 7 percent annually.\n  We are only talking about reducing the rate of growth of the Medicare \ntrust fund by 3 percent; we are talking about continuing to allow it to \ngrow by 6 to 7 percent. This is a huge increase, a huge amount of new \ndollars flowing into the health care system every year. It is a result \nof the fact we are able to still balance the trust fund and make it \nsolvent with that type of rate of growth that we create a huge \nmarketplace incentive for people to compete for senior dollars in \nhealth care. It is that desire for competition, that use of competition \nwhich will lead us to a more competitive system, a more efficient \nsystem, and for a system which will actually deliver better health care \nto seniors.\n  We put some protections in here, also, to make it clear that seniors \nare not giving up anything by participating in choice care. First off, \nas I mentioned, they have the right to stay with fee-for-service, their \npresent plan, if they want to. Second, any plan that wants to compete \nfor a senior citizen dollar must provide the core services which are \npresently provided under the Medicare system. You may say, if that is \nthe case, why are they ever going to be able to charge less if they \nhave to provide the same amount as the senior presently gets? It is \ncalled the marketplace. There are ways to provide the same services and \npay less for them and have them cost less by having more efficiencies \nin the provider. The\n\n[[Page S882]]\n\nmarketplace will produce that sort of efficiency and you will have less \ncosts.\n\n  Also, we give seniors the right to opt out if they choose another \ntype of health care delivery service. If they are uncomfortable with \nit, they can disenroll from that service.\n  Furthermore, and most importantly, we do not allow people who are \ncompeting for the seniors' dollars to discriminate. In other words, if \nyou are a provider and you are going to make yourself available to \nsupply senior citizens with health care, you have to take all comers. \nThere cannot be any attempt to screen out people because they have \npreexisting conditions. So it will not have adverse risk selection.\n  The practical implications of this are that a senior will annually \nreceive a booklet or proposal, much like we receive as Federal \nemployees, which will outline the various health care systems which are \navailable to that senior. What I see happening is that there are going \nto be a lot of health care providers who will say, ``Hey, we can \nprovide that senior with the same health care they are getting today,'' \nbecause of the 6 to 7 percent annual increase. ``We can provide that \nsenior with that same health care and throw some other benefits in, \ntoo. We can offer prescription care, we can offer eyeglasses, we can \noffer a variety of things that are not presently available under \nMedicare because we know that we can more efficiently deliver the \nservice than the senior is presently getting on fee-for-service.''\n  What I expect will happen and what I am pretty confident will happen \nand what people who have looked at this in depth say will happen is \nthat the marketplace will bring forward a variety of different options \nfrom which seniors will have a choice. At the same time, we will give \nseniors an incentive to go out and look at those choices because what \nwe will say to seniors is, ``Listen, today, we pay about $4,800 a year \nfor your health care per senior. You, senior citizen, to the extent you \nchoose a health care delivery service,'' which, again, has to have the \ncore delivery services that you presently get so they cannot reduce \ntheir price because they are not delivering you what you need,'' to the \nextent you choose a delivery service which costs less than $4,800, we \nwill let you, the senior, keep 75 percent of the savings.''\n  So if the annual premium of an HMO supplying seniors with the same \nservice is say $4,500 and the senior chooses to go with that HMO \nbecause the senior maybe has a family member--a son or daughter who is \nworking and a member of that HMO--and the son or daughter say, ``They \ncan give us pretty good service,'' that senior will get to keep the \ndifference between $4,800 and $4,500, or $300. That senior will get to \nkeep 25 percent of that difference, and 75 percent will be returned to \nthe trust fund.\n  So what we have created here is a market event where a senior citizen \ncan get a savings by shopping thoughtfully and efficiently for their \nhealth care, and where the health care providers have an incentive to \ncome in and compete for that health care dollar. What does that cause? \nThat causes efficiency. It causes the marketplace to create efficiency. \nWe have learned that the Federal Government can't produce efficiency. \nWe have learned that by having a nationalized system, which is what \nMedicare is, you do not have an efficient system; that you have an \ninefficient system. What we know from experience is the way you create \nefficiency and lower costs is by having competition and having a \nplaying field where the consumer is protected, which is exactly what \nthis does.\n  So this proposal would give the seniors an incentive to be thoughtful \npurchasers, and would give the marketplace an incentive to come in and \nbe thoughtful competitors, or strong competitors for the senior citizen \ndollars.\n  Another issue that is raised and is legitimate is the question of \nreimbursement and how we are going to reimburse these provider groups. \nThe President has proposed that we cut the rate of reimbursement for \nHMO's from 95 to 90 percent arbitrarily across the board. I am not \ngoing to criticize the President for trying to address the cost of \ngrowth. I think that is important. But there is a better way to do \nthis. The fact is that the reimbursement system as it is presently \nstructured is out of kilter. For health care services which are \nidentical--and in some cases they are better in the lower-cost States \nthan the higher-cost States--the reimbursements are not identical. They \nare totally out of whack.\n\n  For example, there is a beneficiary reimbursement in South Dakota of \nabout $200 per person. But on Staten Island it cost about $767 per \nperson. Studies by Dr. Weinberg at Dartmouth, and a number of other \nprofessionals, have concluded that the service isn't any better but \nthat it is simply an issue of regional disparity. And in fact in New \nHampshire, which happens to be one of the lowest-cost health care \nStates in the country--a little more than South Dakota but not much \nmore--we are rated the No. 1 State in the country for health care \ndelivery systems. Yet, our delivery systems are done at a cost which is \none-third the price of what it cost on Staten Island.\n  So this regional disparity has basically penalized States and areas \nthat are trying to be efficient and effective in delivering their \nhealth care.\n  Take Hawaii, for example. Hawaii has one of the highest costs of \nliving in the country because of the fact that it is an island, and \neverything has to be shipped in, I guess. But at the same time Hawaiian \nmedical care is one of the most efficient cost delivery systems in the \ncountry. So they are penalized. Those health care systems are penalized \nby a lower reimbursement rate.\n  What we suggest--and this is a complicated issue--we are suggesting \nthat as we go forward with this Choice Care proposal that we begin to \nlevel out the playing field on reimbursement so that we no longer are \nrewarding the inefficient, and so that the efficient receive the proper \npayment. We do this by not cutting anybody because we are increasing \nfunding for Medicare throughout this period by 6 to 7 percent. We do \nnot have to cut anything. What we are going to do is slow the rate of \nincrease to those areas that have a much higher reimbursement and \naccelerate the rate of increase to those with lower reimbursement \nareas.\n  As a result, we will at some point--there is a timeframe in our bill \nthat allows for this--about 5 to 7 years from now get to a period where \nwe have everybody in a much narrower band of reimbursement which leads \nto a much more efficient market.\n  So the underlying theme here is simple. Under the Choice Care plan, \nwhich as I mentioned was adopted in significant proportions, or the \nconcepts were adopted in significant proportions in the last budget, \nseniors should be given essentially the same choices that members of \nthe Federal Government have and that the average working American has--\nthe ability to go out in the marketplace and choose from a variety of \ndifferent health care providers. And in making that choice they should \nbe given an incentive to be efficient.\n  So we are going to reward them by giving them a return on the amount \nthat they save, and at the same time we are going to say to the \nmarketplace we are no longer going to disproportionately reward \ninefficient areas at the expense of efficient areas, and at the same \ntime we are going to say to the seniors, ``You have a variety of \noptions to choose from. But, if you want to stay where you are, and you \nare happy where you are, you can do that.''\n\n  So how does this help the Federal Government in the end? How does \nthis get Medicare costs under control? It basically amounts to a major \nstructural reform of the system. It is not playing at the edges the way \nthe President proposes. It is a major structural reform. In the end we \nwill have brought the marketplace into the system, we will have created \nan atmosphere where seniors will be looking at a variety of choices for \nhealth care, and where efficiency will be something that will have to \nbe undertaken by the provider groups. They are going to be able to get \nthe seniors' participation, and those seniors today who are in their \nfee-for-service probably are not going to opt into this overly \naggressively because they were raised in the 1950's and 1960's with \nfee-for-service. We understand that. But what we also understand is \nthat the coming generation of seniors has been in a workplace \nenvironment where the variety of health care service delivery system \nhas been available to them. They are comfortable with a variety of \nhealth care delivery systems. And as such they are not going to shy \naway from taking advantage of the marketplace.\n\n[[Page S883]]\n\n  So, as we go down the road we will get the type of savings we need. \nWe will see that rate of growth reduced from 10 percent back to 6 or 7 \npercent. That is still a substantial rate of growth. Then we will have \nput in place something that can give us a long-term lasting hope for \nrestructure of reform, or reform in the Medicare trust fund in order to \navoid the bankruptcy. If we do not do this, the trust fund part A goes \nbankrupt. It is that simple. That is not acceptable.\n  If we do not undertake structural reform, if we simply undertake the \nreform at the margins, like the President has proposed, we put off that \nbankruptcy maybe for 2, 3, or 4 years. But it still occurs. Our \nobligation as policymakers is to make the more fundamental broader \nchanges that are needed for a long-term solution to this problem. And \nthis is one major step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate your time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President I really enjoyed the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague from New Hampshire. He makes a lot of very \ntelling and important points in the field of health care. I think he \ndeserves to be listened to, as certainly the distinguished doctor \nsitting in the chair, the Presiding Officer. As everybody knows, he has \ngreat interest in health care matters.\n  And I just want to say that I appreciate the work of both of these \nSenators, the Senator from New Hampshire and the Senator from \nTennessee, in this area.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Gordon H. Smith):\n\n  S. 247. A bill for the relief of Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       PRIVATE RELIEF LEGISLATION\n\n Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I introduce private relief \nlegislation for Ms. Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn. Senator Hatfield \nchampioned Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's cause in the 104th Congress, and at his \nrequest and the request of many in the Portland area, I and Senator \nSmith are now picking up the legislation to make Ms. Barbeau-Quinn a \ncitizen of this country.\n  Ms. Barbeau-Quinn, a native of Canada, is a long time member of the \nPortland community and resident of Oregon. She lived in Portland with \nher now deceased husband, Mr. Michael Quinn since 1976, and together \nthey ran the Vat and Tonsure Tavern, a unique and respected restaurant \nin the Portland area. While Ms. Barbeau-Quinn and her husband lived \ntogether for over 16 years, they did not actually marry until shortly \nbefore Michael Quinn's death in 1991.\n  Since Oregon does not recognize common law marriage, and Ms. Barbeau-\nQuinn was not married the 2 years required by immigration law, she has \nnot been able to file for permanent residency in this country. While I \ndo not intend to introduce many private relief bills, because of \nSenator Hatfield's involvement in this matter and Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's \ncompelling case, I think it is appropriate that the Senate pass \nlegislation to ensure that Ms. Barbeau-Quinn remains a member of the \nPortland community for many years to come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 248. A bill to establish a Commission on Structural Alternatives \nfor the Federal Courts of Appeals; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n     THE STRUCTURAL ALTERNATIVES FOR THE FEDERAL COURTS OF APPEALS \n                  COMMISSION ESTABLISHMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today, with my distinguished \ncolleague, Harry Reid, I am introducing S. 248, a bill to establish a \nCommission on Structural Alternatives for the Federal Courts of \nAppeals.\n  The Commission proposal emerged last year during a debate over a \ncontroversial bill to divide the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. As a \nresult of that discussion, it became clear to me and the majority of my \ncolleagues that there was no consensus on how best to resolve the \nproblem of caseload growth in the U.S. courts. The idea of a study \ncommission gained broad support and has independent merit.\n  Legislation to form a study commission was approved twice by the \nSenate in the 104th Congress: in March 1996 as a stand-alone bill, and \nlater in the session as part of the Senate amendments to H.R. 3610, the \nOmnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997. Although the Senate \namendment was not included in the final version of H.R. 3610 signed by \nthe President on September 23, 1996, the initial funding for the \nCommission was appropriated therein. The authorizing legislation \ndeserves a speedy enactment by the 105th Congress.\n  The Commission legislation we are offering today is evenhanded, fair, \nand genuinely bipartisan. It will consist of two members appointed by \nthe Chief Justice of the United States, two members appointed by the \nPresident, two members appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, \ntwo members appointed by the minority leader of the Senate, two members \nappointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and two \nmembers appointed by the minority leader of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The object is to have a balanced group of individuals who will \nexamine the issues fairly and give full consideration of all relevant \nperspectives. With a balanced membership, we can be confident that the \nCommission's recommendations will be given due weight by all three \nbranches of the National Government.\n\n\n                  BROAD SUPPORT FOR A STUDY COMMISSION\n\n  The proposal for a study commission on Federal appellate structure \nhas won enthusiastic support from prominent judges and scholars.\n  To underscore the need for this legislation, as well as its \nimportance, I can do no better than quote from Judge Diarmuid F. \nO'Scannlain, who has served with distinction on the Ninth Circuit since \nhis appointment by President Reagan in 1986. In a recent symposium in \nthe Montana Law Review, Judge O'Scannlain wrote in favor of the study \ncommission bill offered last year:\n\n       As one member of the Court of Appeals most affected, I view \n     [a study commission] as a far superior alternative to [a bill \n     that] would have immediatedly divided the Ninth Circuit. The \n     [study commission] bill also provides an historic opportunity \n     to develop a comprehensive blueprint for the structure of the \n     federal courts of appeals generally, and the Ninth Circuit in \n     particular, for the 21st Century. No comprehensive review of \n     the structure of the federal courts has been undertaken since \n     the study chaired by . . . Senator Roman Hruska of Nebraska \n     in the 1970s (the ``Hruska Commission''), and in my view such \n     a review is most timely.\n\n  Chief Judge Proctor Hug., Jr. of the Ninth Circuit, also writing in \nthe Montana Law Review symposium, observed:\n\n       Based upon its prior experience with the academic community \n     and the benefits obtained from their insightful \n     recommendations, the Ninth Circuit strongly supported Senator \n     Dianne Feinstein's proposed legislation to establish a study \n     commission . . . to take a full and fair look at the entire \n     federal appellate system and to make recommendations to the \n     Congress for how and where to make reforms.\n\n  Another participant in the symposium was Prof. Arthur D. Hellman of \nthe University of Pittsburgh School of Law, a leading national \nauthority on the Federal appellate courts. Professor Hellman wrote:\n\n       . . . Congress should proceed systematically by creating a \n     new, focused commission to examine the problems of the entire \n     appellate system and make recommendations that will serve the \n     country for the long run.\n\n  In a similar vein, Prof. Carl Tobias of the University of Montana Law \nSchool, a respected scholar of Federal procedure, has written in the \nNational Law Journal:\n\n       A preferable route would be to appoint a national \n     commission to seek solutions to the problems of the appellate \n     system as it is currently constituted, and ways of handling \n     its increasing dockets with efficiency. Careful study should \n     provide sufficient information to make a fully informed \n     decision . . . The time is now ripe for Congress to authorize \n     such a study, rather than engage in piecemeal reform.\n\n\n                             THE COMMISSION\n\n  Our bill directs the Commission to study ``the present division of \nthe United States into the several judicial circuits.'' Next, the \nstatute calls for a study of ``the structure and alignment of the \nFederal Court of Appeals system, with particular reference to the Ninth \nCircuit.'' Finally, the Commission must ``report to the President and \nthe Congress its recommendations for such\n\n[[Page S884]]\n\nchanges in circuit boundaries or structure as may be appropriate for \nthe expeditious and effective disposition of the caseload of the \nFederal Courts of Appeal, consistent with fundamental concepts of \nfairness and due process.''\n  The language of the statute leaves no doubt that one task of the \nCommission would be to undertake a careful, objective analysis of the \narguments raised by proposals to divide the ninth circuit. However, it \nis equally clear that the Commission's mandate is not limited to the \nninth circuit or to the delineation of circuit boundaries generally. \nThis reflects the fact that circuit alignment is one of a set of \ninterrelated structural arrangements that govern the operation of the \ncourts of appeal.\n  To ensure expeditious consideration of the issues at all levels, S. \n248, contains three important deadlines. Section 2(b) requires that \nappointment of members be made within 60 days of enactment. Section 6 \nrequires the Commission to submit its report within 2 years of the date \non which its seventh member is appointed. Section 7 requires that the \nSenate Judiciary Committee act on the report no later than 60 days \nafter submission.\n  There are three reasons why the Commission should be given 2 years in \nwhich to carry out its work. First, before the Commission can formulate \nits recommendations, it will have to secure informed, objective answers \nto specific and difficult questions. These questions cannot be answered \nmerely through contemplation, or even by consultation with experts. \nThey will require research, and research takes time.\n  Second, an important part of Commission process is obtaining public \ninput. In particular, at an appropriate stage in its deliberations, the \nCommission should issue a draft report for public comment. Responses \nfrom constituencies should be taken into account in formulating the \nfinal recommendations.\n  Third, the 2-year timespan is supported by the experience of other \ncommissions, such as the Hruska Commission of 1973 and Bankruptcy \nCommission of 1994. It may be argued that if, as with the Hruska \nCommission, the initial deadline proves unworkable, Congress can always \nextend it. But that is the wrong lesson to be drawn from the experience \nof the Hruska Commission. It is far more efficient to provide initially \nfor the 2-year lifespan than to put everyone to the time and effort of \nseeking an extension later.\n  Our proposed Commission will be fair, and it will have sufficient \ntime to conduct a credible study. The Commission will help determine \nthe proper course for the future of our national judiciary, and \ntherefore I urge my distinguished colleagues to support S. 248.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the issue of whether to divide the Ninth \nCircuit Court of Appeals is one in which I have been very involved with \nsince the initial proposal. I made clear my opposition to the proposed \nsplit last year, and I am still convinced that such an unnecessary and \ncostly venture is unwarranted. However, I have agreed to the \nestablishment of a commission to study the judicial circuits, the \nstructure and alignment of the Federal court of appeals system, and to \nreport to the President and the Congress its recommendations for such \nchanges in the circuit boundaries or structure as may be appropriate \nfor the expeditious and effective disposition of the caseload of the \nFederal courts of appeal.\n  Today, Senator Feinstein and I are introducing a bill to create this \ncommission. The commission makeup is fair, evenhanded, and bipartisan. \nIt will consist of two members appointed by the President, two members \nappointed by the Chief Justice of the United States, two members \nappointed by the majority leader of the Senate, two members appointed \nby the minority leader of the Senate, two members appointed by the \nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, and two members appointed by \nthe minority leader of the House of Representatives. I think this is \nthe most fair and equitable way to study this issue.\n  In today's environment of fiscal belt tightening, it is crucial that \nwe carefully scrutinize proposals such as splitting a judicial circuit. \nIt is necessary that we curtail the development of costly Federal \nproposals and engage in studied cost-benefit analysis before we create \nnew programs. There are many unanswered questions in splitting the \nNinth Circuit Court of Appeals. What are the costs associated with such \na division? Will this require the construction of new courthouses and \nhiring of additional judges? If so, how many and how much? And what are \nthe benefits of a division? The commission we propose will answer all \nof these questions before we even consider any possible division. \nFurther, the commission will examine the structure and function of all \nthe Federal courts of appeal.\n  This is a reasonable proposal for the establishment of a vital \ncommission. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Hollings, Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Faircloth, Ms. \n        Moseley-Braun, Mr. Biden, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Ford):\n  S. 249. A bill to require that health plans provide coverage for a \nminimum hospital stay for mastectomies and lymph node dissection for \nthe treatment of breast cancer, coverage for reconstructive surgery \nfollowing mastectomies, and coverage for secondary consultations; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n\n\n            the women's health and cancer rights act of 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I come here today and rise to introduce a \nbill that I think is unfortunately necessary, unfortunately because \nHMO's and insurance carriers--and I don't mean this for all, but we are \nseeing a growing tendency--are doing the kinds of things nobody would \nhave imagined, and they are doing it and interfering with good, sound \nmedical care, because they are more interested in the bottom line.\n\n  Indeed, there are some who are already beginning to drumbeat against \nhealth maintenance organizations per se, and we would be losers, \nbecause there are important innovations and savings that can be made, \nbut those savings and innovations should not be made at the expense of \nthe traditional and important and sacred--sacred--right that a patient \nshould have with their physician.\n  Maybe it takes the specter of cancer and breast cancer, in \nparticular, because people are concerned and it is a fright, to get \npeople to focus on what is taking place, and that is insurance carriers \nplacing arbitrary limits on patients as it relates to the length of \nstay or time that they can use a medical facility, a hospital.\n  It is interesting and, indeed, ironic that as I make these remarks, \nthe presiding officer who sits in the chair and presides over the \nSenate today is a distinguished Senator and a distinguished citizen who \nspent so much of his life in the area of healing and of practicing \nmedicine and who knows better than I. I am so pleased to be able to \nhave his counsel and to share these thoughts with him today personally.\n  While I introduce this legislation on behalf of 16 colleagues in the \nSenate of the United States and 20-plus Representatives in the House, \nDemocrats and Republicans--totally bipartisan--I do not suggest that \nthis is the cure-all for what we see taking place. Indeed, we have \nspecifically limited this legislative initiative.\n  There were calls and outcries that HMO's and insurance carriers be \nrequired to provide at least a minimum of time as it relates to \nmastectomies. Many in the medical profession came forward and said, \n``We think that is the worst kind of legislation. We would rather see \nno time, nor do we think that the health providers should be setting \ntimes.''\n  That is a larger debate for a larger area, but I subscribe to that, \nand I think that we should say very clearly here in the U.S. Senate and \nCongress, By gosh, insurance carriers should not be saying, ``If there \nis a particular disease, we are only going to insure you up to X \nhours.''\n  What happens if there is a complication? It may be that a procedure, \nwhether it be a mastectomy or whether it be prostate cancer or whether \nit be some other disease, that ordinarily, under normal circumstances, \nthere is an average length of time. It might be 1 day, 2 days, 3 days. \nBut who is to say, if there is a complication and it takes 6 days or 2 \nweeks, are we then going to\n\n[[Page S885]]\n\nsay something that ordinarily would be covered in insurance policies, \nthat somehow because someone has adopted a rule--and why they have \nadopted that rule; I don't know how they can practice that, they are \nnot practitioners--that we are going to exclude you if you go over that \nperiod of time?\n  This is wrong. This should not be the way in which we attempt to \nmanage health care costs, and it is, I believe, taken by many people to \nmean the greed of the industry.\n  The fact that there are now today many in the HMO business, some \nalmost startup companies overnight, making millions and millions of \ndollars--I am not against profits, but if you are going to make profits \nby denying adequate basic medical treatment, then that is wrong, that \nis immoral and we in the Congress of the United States have a business \nto do something about it.\n  I know there are going to be those who say let the marketplace work, \nlet free competition work. Well, that is naive. To simply say that by \ninsisting on a minimum standard, that minimums be observed, that no one \ninterferes with the patient and that very special relationship with the \ndoctor--we are now seeing that taking place, because there are those \ncarriers who are punishing doctors, punishing them by denying them \nadequate compensation or penalizing them by denying them moneys they \notherwise would have because they recommend treatments that may cost \nthat insurance carrier more but which they feel are necessary for the \nsafety, health, and protection of their patients.\n  How dare we permit and countenance that kind of thing today? We know \nit is going on, and to the health maintenance organizations and to the \ninsurance carriers who say it is not going on and this legislation is \nnot necessary, well, if it is not necessary, don't oppose it. It is \nthat simple. If you are not penalizing doctors or rewarding them \nbecause they hold back on treatments that might cost more and which are \nnecessary, then why should you be opposed to it? If you are not \narbitrarily limiting the time that a patient may have or necessary \ntreatments, then why would you be opposed to it?\n  This legislation basically says you cannot do that, you cannot \nprescribe 48 hours as it relates to mastectomies. You cannot deny that \ndoctor-patient relationship by penalizing a doctor. We say you are not \npermitted to do that, or rewarding a doctor on the basis of cost-\neffectiveness.\n\n  In a third provision, we say that when it comes to the devastating \ndisease and the specter of cancer, not only breast cancer, but prostate \ncancer--all cancers--that people are entitled to a second opinion. \nThere is not anyone I know who, if they faced a diagnosis and were \ngiven a particular course of treatment that would be suggested, that \nthey would not look for a second opinion. That is fact.\n  If the doctor and the attending physician recommended a second \nopinion, our legislation says the company must pay for that. If that \nphysician feels that there is a need to get some specialist outside of \nthe organization, outside of that HMO, the company must pay for that. \nWhat do we say to the average worker who has no independent resources \nwho can't pay $500 or $1,000, or whatever it might be for that \nspecialist, for that second opinion? You cannot have it?\n  So, Mr. President, we provide that with respect to this particular \ndisease. I believe we should go further, and I think in the fullness of \nthe discussions and the legislative actions that this Congress will \nundertake that we will examine this, and your committee, the Health \nCommittee, in particular will be looking at it.\n  But I think certainly at this time we should begin to say, Listen, as \nit relates to this particular disease of cancer, where the treating and \nattending physician recommends a second opinion, that patient should \nhave the ability and the right to be covered and have that second \nopinion.\n  I am going to relate two specific examples, because we have spent \nsome time in shaping and putting together this legislation and it is by \nno ways written in stone or steel. It is in the sand, it is something \nto be looked at, something to be worked with. I look forward to the \nhelp and recommendations of the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, \nwho presides today, on how we can improve and make this legislative \neffort a better one.\n  Last, but not least, in the area of breast cancer in particular, one \nof the very shattering thoughts and a fear that women live with today \nis the fact that they may be one of the eight who is diagnosed with \nbreast cancer, and that is a national average. They are concerned about \nthe treatment that might permanently disfigure them and, therefore, it \nbecomes absolutely imperative that, as a nation, we indicate to people \nthat there are courses of treatment that cannot only save a life but, \nindeed, do not have to be disfiguring, and in this way, as it relates \nto breast cancer in particular, have more women coming in for early \ndiagnosis and treatment and avoid, No. 1, death, and, No. 2, \ndisfigurement, because we provide that breast cancer reconstruction and \nthat reconstructive surgery not be considered cosmetic.\n  If someone loses an ear, that surgery is not considered cosmetic. \nHowever, incredibly, we find insurance carriers denying reconstruction \non the basis that it is cosmetic. So we create a double tragedy by \ndenying women who have that disease and who don't have the ability to \npay for reconstruction the ability to have that. And, second, and \nprobably just as important, there are many who will not go for early \ndiagnosis, and, therefore, the treatment is not available to them until \nit is too late. That has to be avoided.\n  So we provide that HMO's and insurance carriers must make this \navailable. It is not an option that they can just simply turn away.\n  The title of our bill is called the ``Women's Health and Cancer \nRights Act of 1997.''\n  Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Women's Health and \nCancer Rights Act of 1997. This important reform legislation will \nsignificantly change the way insurance companies provide coverage for \nwomen diagnosed with breast cancer. The problem of the so-called drive-\nthrough mastectomies must be eliminated from our society. Physicians \nmust not be forced to have their best medical judgment questioned by \ninsurance companies who put their bottom line before a woman's health. \nThe women of New York and America deserve better.\n  Today, there are 2.6 million women living with breast cancer. In 1997 \nalone, more than 184,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer \nand, tragically, 44,000 women will die of this dreaded disease. Breast \ncancer is still the most common form of cancer in women; every 3 \nminutes another woman is diagnosed and every 11 minutes another woman \ndies of breast cancer. The D'Amato-Feinstein-Snowe legislation makes \ncritically important changes in how breast cancer patients receive \nmedical care.\n  Specifically, the bill requires health insurance companies to cover \nan unlimited stay in the hospital following mastectomies, lumpectomies, \nand lymph node dissection for the treatment of breast cancer when the \nattending physician decides a longer stay is necessary. Every physician \nwould have the freedom to prescribe longer stays when necessary, and \nthe confidence that insurers will not punish them for practicing sound \nmedical treatment. My bill would make it illegal to penalize a doctor \nfor following good medical judgment. The time for a hospital stay will \nno longer be an arbitrary determination made on the basis of saving \nmoney.\n\n  Another important provision of the D'Amato-Feinstein-Snowe bill \nensures that mastectomy patients will have access to reconstructive \nsurgery. Scores of women have been denied reconstructive surgery \nfollowing mastectomies because insurers have deemed the procedure \ncosmetic and not medically necessary. It is absolutely unacceptable and \nwrong that many insurers deem this essential surgery as cosmetic, and \nit is a practice that must be changed.\n  The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act also includes a unique \nprovision for coverage of second opinions by specialists. The bill \nwould require health care providers to pay for secondary consultations \nwhen cancer tests come back either negative or positive. This important \nprovision will help identify false negatives as well as false \npositives. Additionally, if the attending physician recommends \nconsultation by a specialist not covered by the\n\n[[Page S886]]\n\nhealth plan, the bill would allow the doctor to make such a referral at \nno additional cost to the patient.\n  This legislation is particularly important for the women of Long \nIsland. Our families have been ravaged by this horrible disease. Our \ngrandmothers, mothers and daughters, sisters and wives, children and \nfriends have been afflicted at rates that are unexplained and far too \nhigh.\n  We must continue to work together to find a cure for breast cancer. \nBut until a cure is found, we must ensure that women receive the \ntreatment they deserve. This legislation protects women and anyone ever \ndiagnosed with cancer. It is the most comprehensive bill introduced in \nthe Senate and I am proud to offer it today.\n  I want to thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Snowe for the \ncontributions that they have made as it relates to helping prepare this \nlegislation. The Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act is important. It \nis important again that we preserve adequate, decent, affordable \nmedical care and not tamper with that sacred relationship that should \nbe preserved between a doctor and his patient.\n  I would like, if I might, to share with the Senate the remarks of a \ngreat surgeon, Dr. Larry Norton, Chief of Breast Cancer Medicine at \nSloan Kettering, one of the great cancer hospitals in this Nation. He \nis reflecting about a patient. I will not read all of it. He tells why, \nI think, this legislation is so necessary. He said:\n\n       There was a patient that I saw on a second opinion not too \n     long ago who paid herself for a second opinion because her \n     HMO . . . wouldn't [do that]. I saw her and told her about a \n     therapy that was very scientifically based that we thought \n     was superior here, in fact clinical trials have demonstrated \n     to be superior, and it has become a standard now, throughout \n     the United States. . . . we offered her that particular \n     treatment.\n       Speaking to the person on the other end of the phone at her \n     managed care plan, and I managed to work my way up to the \n     physician level through several clerical levels. . . .\n\n  Here is the chief of surgery at Sloan Kettering Memorial calling an \nHMO to suggest this course of treatment. I want to describe what is \ngoing on. He had to call clerk after clerk after clerk, and he finally \ngot someone who was a physician. By the way, most people cannot do that \nand they cannot work through that. And he was told that they would not \npay for the care.\n  He went on to say--and this is the person on the other end:\n\n       . . . Dr. Norton, we are not saying . . .\n\n  Imagine, this is an HMO, a doctor on the other side of the HMO. He is \nsaying:\n\n       . . . Dr. Norton, we are not saying that [it] is not the \n     right treatment, we are just saying that we are not going to \n     pay for it.\n\n  By the way, what I am reading to you is testimony he gave publicly \nabout 10 days ago in New York at Sloan Memorial. He went on to say:\n\n       I put the phone down, shaking, and called her [that is, his \n     patient] to discuss this with her, and her 10-year-old son \n     answered the phone. I said who I was and he said, calling to \n     his mother, ``Mommy, your doctor is on the phone.'' I knew at \n     that moment that the discussion that she could not get the \n     care that was appropriate was not what I was going to say. \n     Through enormous efforts, and through the support of my \n     terrific institution, [we] were able to provide her that care \n     and things turned out very well for her, as we could have \n     anticipated.\n\n  The doctor goes on to say:\n\n       The point is that there is a holy alliance between the \n     doctor and the patient, and the entire structure of medicine \n     is because of that holy alliance. It is a religious \n     experience [a religious experience] to take care of a patient \n     well and, if you feel any less motivation, you are not [going \n     to be] doing your job as a physician. We feel that kind of \n     motivation here. We are living in an era where a lot of steps \n     are coming between the doctors and the patients. Their \n     motivations are not necessarily the same motivations that \n     have driven us to this point of advance.\n       What we see before us today . . .\n\n  He talks about legislation and the fact that it was a bipartisan \neffort to protect that relationship, that special relationship that I \nknow that the President understands well.\n  Again, we are going to hear cries of intrusion, or about the \nmarketplace. Well, since when do you tell me we do not have a right to \nset basic minimums? We do that in many areas. We do that as it relates \nto quality of food. We do that as it relates to protecting our drinking \nwater. We certainly have a right to say you cannot interfere with that \nspecial relationship by punishing a doctor because he is giving what he \nfeels is the proper medical advice and withholding from him and having \nhim think that he may be penalized. That is wrong. That is wrong.\n  Mr. President, I want to share another experience. When we initially \ntalked about introducing this bill, we did not talk about breast cancer \nreconstruction. And I got a call from the executive director of the \nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of New York, a \nremarkable woman by the name of Mary McCarthy. She said, ``Senator, \nwe've been making studies.'' She was a person who brought to our \nattention, Senator Feinstein and Senator Snowe, and others, the fact \nthat there was this great problem of insurance carriers not providing \nfor reconstructive surgery when it came to the breast and considering \nit as cosmetic.\n  Let me just read to you her words which communicate the problem. Not \nonly is she the executive director of the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists of New York, she goes on to say:\n\n       I am a breast cancer patient myself. I would like to share \n     [with you] my experiences on the three major subjects \n     within the bill, the mastectomy surgery, the \n     reconstructive surgery and the second opinion.\n\n  She says:\n\n       I thought I was very well informed on health care and I \n     thought I had excellent health care coverage. Yet my own \n     reconstructive surgery and my second opinion were both denied \n     by my health care plan. My reconstruction was denied last \n     April as not medically necessary.\n\n  She went on to say she was able to eventually get this surgery. She \nsaid:\n\n       I am concerned that other women do not have these kinds of \n     resources. I would like to touch, although personal, on the \n     importance of reconstructive surgery for women who opt to \n     have reconstruction surgery. My mastectomy was clinically \n     curative surgery, but my reconstruction was emotionally \n     healing. There is no longer a reminder every day of my \n     cancer. When I get dressed in the morning, in an intimate \n     moment with my husband, if I have my nightgown on at home \n     with my kids, I look normal and I feel normal. If you lose an \n     ear or a testicle, or part of your face to cancer, there is \n     no question that reconstruction is covered. Yet denials for \n     breast [cancer] reconstruction are serious and they are \n     rising.\n       For a disease with the magnitude of cancer, it is very \n     important to have access to second opinions and to be able to \n     [go] outside your HMO, if necessary, for the kind of \n     expertise you need. To my surprise, and to the surprise of my \n     physicians within my plan, my plan adamantly refused to \n     authorize my second opinion. I paid for my second opinion \n     myself, not all women have these resources . . . No family \n     should be forced to assume this kind of responsibility.\n\n  Then she goes on to say something.\n\n       When I was in the hospital after my surgery . . . [the \n     nurses] actually cringed [the people responsible for taking \n     care of me] and looked upset when they changed my dressing. I \n     spoke candidly to my husband, who is loving and caring and \n     goes with me to most of my medical appointments, and he felt \n     that he could not have handled the emotional or the clinical \n     responsibility of helping with drains and bandages. The \n     appropriate length of stay is critically needed and the \n     language in the bill to ensure that the appropriate stay for \n     each individual is met is vital.\n\n  What she is saying is that if she had been discharged, her husband \ncould not have taken care of her. And you just simply cannot set a time \nlimit.\n  Mr. President, I want to offer that bill. I send it to the desk with \nthe cosponsors. I commend all of my colleagues to join in this \nlegislative effort. It is one that we will be serious and purposeful \nfor. I hope we can have hearings sooner rather than later.\n  Again, as I said, this is totally bipartisan in nature. Cancer does \nnot look to see the politics of its victims. In particular, we address \nsome of the major concerns as they relate to cancer. But I think \nproblems that we have go well beyond this. This is something that this \nCongress should become involved in, the vital interest of the health of \nall of our citizens.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 249\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Madam President, as cochair of the Senate Cancer \nCoalition, I am pleased today to join with Senator D'Amato in \nintroducing S. 249, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act of 1997.\n\n\n                                The Bill\n\n  This bill does four things:\n  For treatment of breast cancer, it requires insurance plans to allow \nphysicians to determine the length of a patient's hospital stay \naccording to medical necessity; and it requires health insurance plans \nto cover breast reconstruction following a mastectomy.\n  For treatment of all cancers, it requires health insurance plans to \ncover second opinions by specialists whether the initial diagnosis is \npositive or negative; and it prohibits insurance plans from financially \npenalizing or rewarding a physician for providing medically necessary \ncare or for referring a patient for a second opinion\n\n\n                          Two California Cases\n\n  I have received two letters from constituents describing firsthand \ntheir treatment by insurance companies in having a mastectomy.\n  Nancy Couchot, age 60, of Newark, CA, wrote me that she had a \nmodified radical mastectomy on November 4, 1996, at 11:30 a.m. and was \nreleased by 4:30 p.m. She could not walk and the hospital staff did not \nhelp her ``even walk to the bathroom.'' She says, ``Any woman, under \nthese circumstances, should be able to opt for an overnight stay to \nreceive professional help and strong pain relief.''\n  Victoria Berck, of Los Angeles, wrote that she had a mastectomy and \nlymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. on November 13, 1996, and was released \nfrom the hospital 7 hours later, at 2:30 p.m. Ms. Berck was given \ninstructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent \nhome. She concludes, ``No civilized country in the world has mastectomy \nas an outpatient procedure.''\n  These are but two examples of what, unfortunately, is becoming a \nnational nightmare--insurance plans interfering with professional \nmedical judgment and refusing to cover hospital stays of mastectomy \npatients.\n\n\n                           Need for the Bill\n\n  Increasingly, insurance companies are dropping and reducing inpatient \nhospital coverage of mastectomies. This is beyond the pale. It is \nunconscionable.\n  The Wall Street Journal on November 6 reported that ``some health \nmaintenance organizations are creating an uproar by ordering that \nmastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. At a growing number \nof HMOs, surgeons must document ``medical necessity'' to justify even a \none-night hospital admission.''\n  In 1997, over 184,000 women--or 1 in every 8 American women--will be \ndiagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 44,300 women will die from \nbreast cancer; 2.6 million American women are living with breast cancer \ntoday. In my State, 20,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer \nand 5,000 will die or one every 27 minutes. San Francisco has among the \nhighest incidence rates of breast cancer in the world.\n  After a mastectomy, patients must cope with pain from the surgery, \nwith psychological loss--the trauma of an amputation--and with drainage \ntubes. These patients need medical care from trained professionals, \nmedical care that they cannot provide themselves at home.\n  In the last 10 years, the length of overnight hospital stays for \nmastectomies has declined from 4 to 6 days to 2 to 3 days to, in some \ncases, no days. With the average cost of one day in the hospital at \n$930, if insurance plans refuse to cover a hospital stay, patients are \nforced to go home.\n\n\n                         Breast Reconstruction\n\n  Insurance plans also refuse to cover breast reconstruction. Our bill \nrequires coverage. Breast reconstruction is an important followup part \nof breast cancer treatment and recovery. One study found that 84 \npercent of patients were denied insurance coverage for reconstruction \nof the removed breast. Commendably, my State has passed a law requiring \ncoverage of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. However, we need \na national standard, covering all insurance policies.\n\n\n                        Second Opinions Covered\n\n  Another important feature of our bill is insurance coverage of second \nopinions for all cancers. The news of possible cancer is traumatic. It \nis a dreaded fear that we all live with daily. For this life-\nthreatening disease for which there is no cure, more information is \nbetter than less. Expert advice is needed to make all-important \ndecisions. I believe it is reasonable to encourage people to have a \nsecond consultation with a specialist, by requiring insurance plans to \ncover second opinions.\n  Patients often need specialty care. A December 1996 study reported in \nthe New England Journal of Medicine found that specialty care improves \nthe outcome of heart attack patients. This should come as no surprise. \nSpecialists are knowledgeable about their field. A California doctor \npointed out that nonspecialists may order a ``battery of unnecessary \nand sometimes invasive and risky examinations'' for patients. Thus, \nincentives that discourage the use of specialists or referrals to \nspecialists, can end up costing the insurance plan more--instead of \nsaving money.\n\n\n                        No Financial Incentives\n\n  Finally, our bill prohibits insurance plans from including financial \nor other incentives to influence the care a doctor provides, similar to \na law passed by the California legislature last year. Many physicians \nhave complained that insurance plans include financial bonuses or other \nincentives for cutting patient visits or for not referring patients to \nspecialists. Our bill bans financial incentives linked to how a doctor \nprovides care. Our intent is to restore medical decisionmaking to \nhealth care.\n\n[[Page S890]]\n\n  For example, a California physician wrote me, ``Financial incentives \nunder managed care plans often remove access to pediatric specialty \ncare.'' A June 1995 report in the Journal of the National Cancer \nInstitute cited the suit filed by the husband of a 34-year-old \nCalifornia woman who died from colon cancer, claiming that HMO \nincentives encouraged her physicians not to order additional tests that \ncould have saved her life.\n  Our bill tries to restore professional medical decisionmaking to \nmedical providers, those whom we trust to take care of us. It should \nnot take an act of Congress to guarantee good health care, but \nunfortunately that is where we are today.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in enacting this bill, an important \nprotection for millions of Americans who face the fear and the reality \nof cancer every day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 250.

Edward Johnstone is a \nveteran who fought for his country at the Battle of the Bulge, but \nfinds nothing remarkable in his decorations of honor--to him they are \nreminders of his duty to country and fellow countrymen who never \nreturned home. Edward Johnstone is a distinguished legal scholar who \nearned his law degree from the University of Kentucky and put his \nskills to work as a country lawyer in his hometown of Princeton, KY. \nEdward Johnstone is a judge who has served 21 years on the bench doling \nout words of wisdom and sentences of justice to those who come before \nhim. Edward Johnstone is a tough, fair, hard-working Federal judge who \nputs in a full day's work even though he is a senior judge. Edward \nJohnstone is a man who gives me faith in the judicial process and those \nchosen to uphold our laws.\n  I am very proud to introduce legislation on behalf of myself and all \nof the western Kentuckians whose lives have been touched by this \nextraordinary individual.\n  Let me end my remarks, Mr. President, by remembering something that \nGeorge Washington once said, ``The administration of justice is the \nfirmest pillar of government.'' As an administrator of justice, Edward \nJohnstone is our own marble column in the Western Kentucky community.\n  Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill designating the courthouse \nin Paducah, KY, as the Edward Huggins Johnstone United States \nCourthouse, and I ask that it be appropriately referred.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nfarmers to income average over 2 years; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                 farmer's income averaging legislation\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I am introducing \nlegislation--along with Senators Grassley, Cochran, Roberts, Abraham, \nand Hutchinson--which will restore to American farmers an important \ntool in meeting their Federal income tax obligations.\n  Mr. President, America would not be what it is today without the \ndedication, sacrifice, and hard work of the American farmer. The \nAmerican farmer is the most efficient farmer in the world. Each farmer \nin America provides food and fiber for 94 people in our country and an \nadditional 35 people abroad. As a result, Americans enjoy the most \naffordable, healthy, and stable food supply of any country in the \nworld.\n  Yet, despite the successes of the American farmer, they are faced \nwith unique and difficult barriers, they must overcome, including \nunpredictable weather, natural disasters, plauges of insects and \ndiseases, and excessive Government regulations. All of these result in \nsubstantial income fluctuations for the average farmer.\n  Wide swings in farmers' income from year to year, result in a tax \nburden much higher than individuals with a stable source of income \nbecause surges in income are taxed at a higher rate than is a steady \nflow of income. This problem is compounded when a farmers income is \nexaggerated by the sale of land or other assets.\n  Prior to 1986, farmers were allowed to average their income over a 2-\nyear period in order to give them some sense of regularity and \npredictability in their payment of Federal taxes. This provision was \nrepealed as part of the 1986 Tax Act, which reduced the number of tax \nbrackets and lowered the top rate of 28 percent. However, since 1986, \nCongress has added two new tax brackets, and increased the top rate to \n39.6 percent.\n  This change, along with the move to a more market-oriented farm \nprogram, makes it imperative that Congress restores to farmers the \nability to average their income, and the legislation I am introducing \ntoday will do just that. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last \nyear that this bill would cost about $90 million over 5 years.\n  Representative Nick Smith has sponsored an identical bill in the \nHouse, and it has the broad support of the farming community. Groups \nendorsing this proposal include: Alabama Farmers Federation, American \nFarm Bureau Federation, National Association of Wheat Growers, National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, National Farmers Union, National Grain \nSorghum Producers, National Grange, National Pork Producers Council, \nand Women in Farm Economics.\n  Mr. President, the success of our Nation depends in large part on the \nsuccess of the American farmer. Until we can enact broad-based tax \nreform, we should provide farmers with some sense of regularity and \npredictability in meeting their Federal tax obligation. This \nlegislation will do that, and I hope my colleagues will support \nit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG:\n  S. 252. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na reduction in the capital gains tax for assets held more than 2 years, \nto impose a surcharge on short-term capital gains, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                       CAPITAL GAINS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that will have a \nsignificant impact on the promotion of long-term investment through a \nreduction in the capital gains tax. I believe the Congress has a \nresponsibility to enact laws promoting long-term capital investment and \nsavings by all Americans. Part of fulfilling this obligation must \ninclude implementing a plan that would reduce the current capital gains \ntax rate on long-term investments.\n  We must also, however, balance this important economic goal against \nthe moral issue of adding increasing debt onto our children's \nshoulders. This becomes an unavoidable issue in the capital gains \ndebate because the Joint Committee on Taxation scores capital gains a \nbig revenue loser. This scoring issue is an unfortunate fact that we in \nCongress cannot ignore.\n\n[[Page S891]]\n\n  Accordingly, I have developed legislation that would encourage long-\nterm investment by amending the current capital gains tax using a \nsliding scale plan. My bill encourages an individual to hold an asset \nover a number of years, thus, allowing a greater tax reduction on \ninvestments, with the maximum benefit being reached after 4 years. It \nwould reward individuals who look toward contributing to a savings plan \nover a number of years, while at the same time making quick-fix \ninvestments less attractive. This sliding scale plan would encourage \ninvestments that benefit long-term savings, such as a child's \neducation, an individual's retirement, or other non-speculative \nholdings.\n  The theory behind the sliding scale reduction on capital gains hinges \nupon an agreed goal: the promotion of savings and long-term investment \nthrough a capital gains cut, while recognizing our current fiscal \nrealities. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates this plan would \nlose just $7.4 billion in revenue over the 1995-2000 period.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a Washington \nPost op-ed by Louis Lowenstein, professor of finance at Columbia \nUniversity, be included in the Record. Professor Lowenstein's piece \noutlines the current fiscal problem this legislation attempts to \naddress.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The first would cut the maximum rate in half, to \n     just under 20 percent; the second would index the gain to \n     eliminate the effects of inflation. With the Treasury \n     Department estimating the 10-year cost at $92 billion, it is \n     no wonder that critics label this a giveaway to the rich.\n       Speaker Newt Gingrich and his allies are right about one \n     thing--there is something wrong with the current capital \n     gains tax structure. But their remedy doesn't fix the real \n     problem, which is the refusal of today's investors to focus, \n     as they once did, more on long-term business concerns than on \n     the next twitch in interest rates, unemployment data or \n     market prices. Their solution is not only misguided but a \n     missed opportunity to correct some real wrongs in the tax \n     system.\n       There is a better way: Cut the capital gains tax rate for \n     people who hold stocks for long periods, and maintain or even \n     raise the rates for short-term investors. This would reward \n     productive investment, discourage speculators and avoid a \n     costly increase in the deficit.\n       Such a policy has been endorsed in one form or another over \n     the last half-century by such varied folk as Sen. Nancy \n     Kassebaum, investment banker Felix Rohatyn, financier Warren \n     Buffett and economist John Maynard Keynes--as well as by a \n     1992 Twentieth Century Fund task force on market speculation \n     and corporate governance, of which I was a member. The \n     proposal, so remarkably simple, calls for capital gains rates \n     that would decline dramatically, but only as the holding \n     period lengthens.\n       In other words, the capital gains tax benefit would be \n     restricted to people who meet the traditional notion of \n     investor. The dictionary defines an investor as ``an \n     individual or organization who commits capital to become a \n     partner of a business enterprise.'' As recently as the \n     beginning of the 1960's, investors still though in terms of \n     owning a share\n\n[[Page S893]]\n\n     of America, as the New York Stock Exchange used to say. They \n     knew their companies and they held their stocks, on the \n     average, for seven years. For these investors, the rate could \n     be cut drastically--even to zero--after, say, 10 or 15 years. \n     That would help return stock markets to their most useful \n     function, one in which participation should be encouraged.\n       Stock markets enable corporations to raise long-term \n     capital even while investors enjoy a high degree of \n     liquidity. But those markets are not an end in themselves. \n     Trading in stocks once they are issued can devolve into a \n     game of ``musical shares''; the players change places but at \n     the end of the year nothing much else happened.\n       And, indeed, the concept of owning a share of American \n     business has given way to short-term speculation, \n     particularly by institutional investors. The turnover of \n     shares of New York Stock Exchange companies, which had been \n     14 percent, a year in the early `60s, soared to 95 percent by \n     the late 1980s. In 1987, the total cost of all that \n     activity--commissions and other trading costs--was about $25 \n     billion, or more than one-sixth of all corporate earnings.\n       That's a very different kind of market than the market, \n     say, for wheat, which moves grain from farmers to elevator \n     operators to millers to bakers to consumers. When \n     institutions trade the same shares over and over, nothing is \n     created except profits for the brokers. There is only \n     duplication and waste, not gain.\n       While there is good reason to let the capital gains tax \n     drop as the holding period lengthens, there is absolutely no \n     reason to subsidize an already wasteful, frenetic trading \n     game. At present, to qualify for capital gains treatment one \n     need hold an investment position for just one year. That is \n     why the tax on restless holders should, at the very least, \n     not go down. Remember, it is mutual fund managers and other \n     so-called professionals who are the problem. They spend other \n     peoples commission dollars on their asset allocation and \n     other market-timing strategies.\n       True, speculation fills gaps in trading in the market, \n     dampening price changes between trades and allowing investors \n     to accumulate or liquidate positions rapidly. But its social \n     value is limited. And while most economists rarely see a \n     market they do not admire, there is no economic reason for \n     the tax system within which the stock market must operate to \n     reinforce its worst tendencies. Even economists increasingly \n     recognize that once the market wheels have been lubricated, \n     added grease helps only the merchants of grease--the brokers.\n       Worse yet, a market focused on short-term trading values is \n     far less likely to serve its fundamental goals--to allocate \n     capital to its best uses and to encourage shareholders to \n     monitor the corporate managers' performance. As one fund \n     manager said, ``It is not our job to be a good citizen at \n     General Motors.'' But if not him, who?\n       The more immediate advantages of a steeply graduated \n     capital gains tax are obvious. It can be formulated to be \n     revenue-neutral, or nearly so, thus easing the budgetary \n     pressure. It would obviate the need for inflation-indexing, \n     for the simple reason that tax would fade rapidly as the \n     holding period lengthened. And for those who, like this \n     author and perhaps Gingrich too, dislike the old tax-shelter \n     programs that enriched parasites at the expense of the \n     public, a tax along the lines suggested here would discharge \n     such games. All in all, it is difficult to think of any tax \n     proposal that would accomplish so much at so little cost. The \n     same cannot be said of an across-the-board capital gains cut \n     for the rich to be paid for by the rest of us.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR:\n\n  S. 253. A bill to establish the negotiating objectives and fast-track \nprocedures for future trade agreements; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n             THE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION REFORM ACT\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, development of overseas markets and \ncustomers is vital to the future of U.S. agriculture. Demand for food \nand feed is growing rapidly. U.S. agriculture is efficient and \ncompetitive, however, tariff and nontariff barriers remain high in many \ncountries.\n  As incomes rise in developing countries, their demands for our \nproducts will continue to expand. In 1996, agricultural exports reached \na record $59.8 billion. Continued growth is vital. World commodity \nmarkets are often distorted by import barriers, export subsidies and \nState trading enterprises. These distortions put American farmers and \nagribusiness operators at a disadvantage. We must reduce trade barriers \nand allow our industry to supply the world's markets.\n  Today I will introduce the Trade Agreement Implementation Reform Act. \nThis bill will grant the President the fast-track authority he needs to \nnegotiate future trade agreements. It is in the national interest for \nthe President to have this authority, but is has lapsed due in part to \nthe way past implementing legislation was handled.\n  Earlier fast-track authority allowed side-deals, special-interest \naccommodations and provisions of questionable merit. As a result, \npublic confidence in our trade policies eroded. Reforming the fast-\ntrack process and prohibiting these special-interest provisions is one \nstep in gaining support for future trade agreements.\n  My bill contains two major changes from previous practice. First, \nlegislation submitted under the fast-track authority will contain only \nprovisions absolutely necessary to implement an agreement. Prior law \nallowed provisions necessary and appropriate and encouraged deals with \nspecial interests in exchange for support.\n  Second, although fast-track legislation is not amendable, we should \nmake one exception. Senators should be able to amend or delete \nprovisions that merely offset revenue losses from tariff changes. Such \nprovisions in the Uruguay round legislation included the controversial \nPioneer Preference and pension reform titles. Congress should have the \nability to debate and amend items like these, but be subject to overall \ntime limits.\n  The United States must continue to move forward in its effort to find \nnew markets for our goods and services. We should take advantage of a \nfavorable trade climate in South America by pursuing an agreement with \nChile. Chile has advanced bilateral trade agreements with Canada and \nMexico and has become an associate member of the Southern Cone Mercosur \ntrading bloc. Before the United States can move forward, the \nadministration must have fast-track authority. The President must now \nmake a case to Congress and the American people that this is a priority \nof his administration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 253\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Trade Agreement \n     Implementation Reform Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.\n\n       The overall trade negotiating objectives of the United \n     States for agreements subject to the provisions of section 3 \n     are--\n       (1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market \n     access,\n       (2) to obtain the reduction or elimination of barriers and \n     other trade-distorting policies and practices,\n       (3) to further strengthen the system of international \n     trading disciplines and procedures, and\n       (4) to foster economic growth and full employment in the \n     United States and the global economy.\n\n     SEC. 3. TRADE AGREEMENT NEGOTIATING AUTHORITY.\n\n       (a) Agreements Regarding Tariff Barriers.--\n       (1) In general.--Whenever the President determines that one \n     or more existing duties or other import restrictions of any \n     foreign country or the United States are unduly burdening and \n     restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that \n     the purposes, policies, and objectives of this Act will be \n     promoted thereby, the President--\n       (A) on or before June 1, 2003, may enter into trade \n     agreements with foreign countries, and\n       (B) may, subject to paragraphs (2) through (5), proclaim--\n       (i) such modification or continuance of any existing duty,\n       (ii) such continuance of existing duty-free or excise \n     treatment, or\n       (iii) such additional duties,\n\n     as the President determines to be required or appropriate to \n     carry out any such trade agreement.\n       (2) Limitations.--No proclamation may be made under \n     paragraph (1)(B) that--\n       (A) reduces any rate of duty (other than a rate of duty \n     that does not exceed 5 percent ad valorem on the date of \n     enactment of this Act) to a rate of duty which is less than \n     50 percent of the rate of such duty that applies on such date \n     of enactment,\n       (B) reduces the rate of duty on an article over a period \n     greater than 10 years after the first reduction that is \n     proclaimed to carry out a trade agreement with respect to \n     such article, or\n       (C) increases any rate of duty above the rate that applied \n     on the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (3) Aggregate reduction; exemption from staging.--\n       (A) Aggregate reduction.--Except as provided in \n     subparagraph (B), the aggregate amount that the rate of duty \n     on any article may be reduced under paragraph (2) in any year \n     shall not exceed an amount that is equal to the greater of 3 \n     percent ad valorem or 10 percent of the total reduction in \n     the rate of duty for such article required pursuant to a \n     trade agreement entered into under paragraph (1).\n\n[[Page S894]]\n\n       (B) Exemption from staging.--No staging is required under \n     subparagraph (A) with respect to a duty reduction that is \n     proclaimed under paragraph (1) for an article of a kind that \n     is not produced in the United States. The United States \n     International Trade Commission shall advise the President of \n     the identity of articles that may be exempted from staging \n     under this subparagraph.\n       (4) Rounding.--If the President determines that such action \n     will simplify the computation of reductions under paragraph \n     (2) (A) or (B) or paragraph (3), the President may round an \n     annual reduction by an amount equal to the lesser of--\n       (A) the difference between the reduction without regard to \n     this paragraph and the next lower whole number, or\n       (B) one-half of 1 percent ad valorem.\n       (5) Additional limitation.--A rate of duty reduction or \n     increase that may not be proclaimed by reason of paragraph \n     (2) or (3) may take effect only if a provision authorizing \n     such reduction or increase is included within an implementing \n     bill provided for under section 4 of this Act and that bill \n     is enacted into law.\n       (b) Agreements Regarding Tariff and Nontariff Barriers.--\n       (1) In general.--Whenever the President determines that any \n     duty or other import restriction imposed by any foreign \n     country or the United States or any other barrier to, or \n     other distortion of, international trade--\n       (A) unduly burdens or restricts the foreign trade of the \n     United States or adversely affects the United States economy,\n       (B) the imposition of any such barrier or distortion is \n     likely to result in such a burden, restriction, or effect, or\n       (C) the reduction or elimination of such barrier or \n     distortion is likely to result in economic growth or expanded \n     trade opportunities for the United States,\n\n     and that the purposes, policies, and objectives of this Act \n     will be promoted thereby, the President may, on or before \n     June 1, 2003, enter into a regional, bilateral, or \n     multilateral trade agreement described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Description of trade agreement.--A trade agreement is \n     described in this paragraph if it is a regional, bilateral, \n     or multilateral trade agreement entered into by the President \n     with a foreign country providing for--\n       (A) the reduction or elimination of such duty, restriction, \n     barrier, or other distortion, or\n       (B) the prohibition of, or limitation on the imposition of, \n     such barrier or other distortion.\n       (3) Conditions.--A trade agreement may be entered into \n     under this subsection only if such agreement makes \n     substantial progress in meeting the applicable negotiating \n     objectives described in section 2 and the President satisfies \n     the conditions set forth in subsections (c) and (d).\n       (4) Compliance with uruguay round agreements and other \n     obligations.--In determining whether to enter into \n     negotiations with a particular country under this subsection, \n     the President shall take into account whether that country \n     has implemented its obligations under the Uruguay Round \n     Agreements and any other trade agreement with respect to \n     which the United States and such other country are parties.\n       (5) Limitation.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no trade benefit shall be extended to any country solely \n     by reason of the extension of any trade benefit to another \n     country under a trade agreement entered into under paragraph \n     (1) with such other country.\n       (c) Notice and Consultation Before Negotiation.--\n       (1) General rule.--The President, at least 60 calendar days \n     before initiating negotiations on any agreement that is \n     subject to the provisions of subsection (b), shall--\n       (A) provide written notice to Congress of the President's \n     intent to enter into the negotiations and set forth therein \n     the date the President intends to initiate such negotiations \n     and the specific United States objectives for the \n     negotiations,\n       (B) before submitting the notice, seek the advice of and \n     consult with the relevant private sector advisory committees \n     established under section 135 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 \n     U.S.C. 2155), regarding the negotiations and the negotiating \n     objectives the President proposes to establish for the \n     negotiations, and\n       (C) before and after submission of the notice, consult with \n     Congress regarding the negotiations and the negotiating \n     objectives.\n       (2) Exception.--Notwithstanding subsection (b)(3) and \n     section 4(c), the provisions of this subsection shall not \n     apply to an agreement which results from negotiations that \n     were commenced before the date of enactment of this Act and \n     the provisions of this Act regarding implementation shall \n     apply to such agreement, if with respect to such agreement, \n     the President provides notice, seeks advice, and consults in \n     accordance with subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph \n     (1) as soon as practicable after the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (d) Consultation With Congress Before Agreements Entered \n     Into.--\n       (1) Consultation.--Before entering into any trade agreement \n     under subsection (b), the President shall consult with--\n       (A) the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate, \n     and\n       (B) each other committee of the House and the Senate, and \n     each joint committee of Congress, which has jurisdiction over \n     legislation involving subject matters which would be affected \n     by the trade agreement.\n       (2) Scope.--The consultation described in paragraph (1) \n     shall include consultation with respect to--\n       (A) the nature of the agreement,\n       (B) how and to what extent the agreement will achieve the \n     applicable negotiating objectives, and\n       (C) all matters relating to the implementation of the \n     agreement under section 4.\n\n     SEC. 4. IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADE AGREEMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--\n       (1) Notification and submission.--Any agreement entered \n     into under section 3(b) shall enter into force with respect \n     to the United States if (and only if)--\n       (A) the President, at least 120 calendar days before the \n     day on which the President enters into the trade agreement, \n     notifies the House of Representatives and the Senate of the \n     President's intention to enter into the agreement, and \n     promptly thereafter publishes notice of such intention in the \n     Federal Register;\n       (B) after entering into the agreement, the President \n     submits a copy of the final legal text of the agreement, \n     together with--\n       (i) a draft of an implementing bill,\n       (ii) a statement of any administrative action proposed to \n     implement the trade agreement, and\n       (iii) the supporting information described in paragraph \n     (3); and\n       (C) the implementing bill is enacted into law.\n       (2) Restrictions on implementing bill.--\n       (A) In general.--An implementing bill referred to in \n     paragraph (1) shall contain only necessary provisions.\n       (B) Necessary provision.--For purposes of this Act, the \n     term ``necessary provision'' means a provision in an \n     implementing bill that--\n       (i)(I) makes progress in meeting the negotiating objectives \n     contained in section 2 for the trade agreement with respect \n     to which the implementing bill is submitted, and\n       (II) is required to put into effect, or sets forth a \n     procedure to carry out, a substantive provision of the trade \n     agreement with respect to which the implementing bill is \n     submitted, or\n       (ii) is a revenue provision.\n       (3) Supporting information.--The supporting information \n     required under paragraph (1)(B)(iii) consists of--\n       (A) an explanation as to how the implementing bill and \n     proposed administrative action will change or affect existing \n     law; and\n       (B) a statement--\n       (i) asserting that the agreement makes progress in \n     achieving the applicable negotiating objectives contained in \n     section 2, and\n       (ii) setting forth the reasons of the President regarding, \n     among other things--\n\n       (I) how and to what extent the agreement makes progress in \n     achieving the applicable negotiating objectives referred to \n     in clause (i), and why and to what extent the agreement does \n     not achieve other negotiating objectives,\n       (II) how the agreement serves the interests of United \n     States commerce,\n       (III) why the implementing bill and proposed administrative \n     action is necessary to carry out the agreement,\n       (IV) how the provisions of the implementing bill are \n     necessary to comply with the applicable negotiating \n     objectives, and\n       (V) how any revenue provision in the implementing bill is \n     necessary to comply with the Balanced Budget and Emergency \n     Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n\n       (4) Other considerations.--To ensure that a foreign country \n     that receives benefits under a trade agreement entered into \n     under section 3(b) is subject to the obligations imposed by \n     such agreement, the President shall recommend to Congress in \n     the implementing bill and statement of administrative action \n     submitted with respect to such agreement that the benefits \n     and obligations of such agreement apply solely to the parties \n     to such agreement, if such application is consistent with the \n     terms of such agreement. The President may also recommend \n     with respect to any such agreement that the benefits and \n     obligations of such agreement not apply uniformly to all \n     parties to such agreement, if such application is consistent \n     with the terms of such agreement.\n       (b) Application of Congressional ``Fast Track'' Procedures \n     To Implementing Bills.--\n       (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in this \n     subsection and subsection (c), the provisions of section 151 \n     of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2191) (hereafter in this \n     Act referred to as ``fast track procedures'') apply to \n     implementing bills submitted with respect to trade agreements \n     entered into under section 3(b) on or before June 1, 2003 (or \n     if extended under section 5, June 1, 2005).\n       (2) Certain points of order and amendments in order.--\n       (A) In general.--\n       (i) Points of order.--A point of order may be made by any \n     Senator against a provision in an implementing bill that is \n     not a necessary provision (as defined in subsection \n     (a)(2)(B)). If such point of order is sustained by a majority \n     of the Members of the Senate duly chosen and sworn, the \n     provision shall be stricken.\n       (ii) Amendments in order.--The provisions of section 151(d) \n     of the Trade Act of 1974 shall not apply to a provision in an \n     implementing bill that is a revenue provision and an \n     amendment to a revenue provision shall be\n\n[[Page S895]]\n\n     in order if the amendment meets the requirements of paragraph \n     (4).\n       (B) Time limit.--Sections 151(f)(2) and 151(g)(2) of such \n     Act shall be applied by substituting ``25 hours'' for ``20 \n     hours'' each place such term appears and such time limits \n     shall include all amendments to and points of order made with \n     respect to an implementing bill.\n       (C) Rules for debate in the senate.--Debate in the Senate \n     on any amendment to or point of order made with respect to an \n     implementing bill under this paragraph shall be limited to \n     not more than 1 hour, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by the mover and the manager of the implementing \n     bill, except that in the event the manager of the \n     implementing bill is in favor of any such amendment, the time \n     in opposition thereto shall be controlled by the minority \n     leader or the minority leader's designee. The majority and \n     minority leader may, from the time under their control on the \n     passage of an implementing bill, allot additional time to any \n     Senator during the consideration of any amendment. A motion \n     in the Senate to further limit debate on an amendment to any \n     implementing bill is not debatable.\n       (3) Revenue provision.--For purposes of this Act, the term \n     ``revenue provision'' means a provision in an implementing \n     bill that--\n       (A) is not required to put into effect, or does not set \n     forth a procedure to carry out, a substantive provision of \n     the trade agreement with respect to which the implementing \n     bill is submitted,\n       (B) is not inconsistent with the obligations of the United \n     States under the trade agreement with respect to which the \n     implementing bill is submitted, and\n       (C) either decreases specific budget outlays for the fiscal \n     years covered by the implementing bill or increases revenues \n     for such fiscal years in order to comply with the Balanced \n     Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.\n       (4) Requirements for amendment.--It shall not be in order \n     in the House of Representatives or the Senate to consider any \n     amendment to a revenue provision in an implementing bill that \n     would have the effect of increasing any specific budget \n     outlays above the level of such outlays provided in the \n     implementing bill for the fiscal years covered by the \n     implementing bill or would have the effect of reducing any \n     specific revenues below the level of such revenues provided \n     in the implementing bill for such fiscal years, unless such \n     amendment makes at least an equivalent reduction in other \n     specific budget outlays, an equivalent increase in other \n     specific Federal revenues, or an equivalent combination \n     thereof for such fiscal years. For purposes of this \n     paragraph, the levels of budget outlays and Federal revenues \n     for a fiscal year shall be determined on the basis of \n     estimates made by the Committee on the Budget of the Senate \n     or of the House of Representatives, as the case may be.\n       (5) Difference between the 2 houses.--If the text of \n     implementing bills described in subsection (b)(1) concerning \n     any matter is not identical--\n       (A) the Senate shall vote passage on the implementing bill \n     introduced in the Senate, and\n       (B) the text of the implementing bill passed by the Senate \n     shall, immediately upon its passage (or, if later, upon \n     receipt of the implementing bill passed by the House), be \n     substituted for the text of the implementing bill passed by \n     the House of Representatives, and such implementing bill, as \n     amended shall be returned with a request for a conference \n     between the 2 Houses.\n       (6) Amendment between houses.--Except as provided in \n     paragraph (7)--\n       (A) overall debate on all motions necessary to resolve \n     amendments between the Houses on an implementing bill under \n     this subsection shall be limited to 2 hours at any stage of \n     the proceedings; and\n       (B) debate on any motion, appeal, or point of order under \n     this subsection which is submitted shall be limited to 30 \n     minutes, and such time shall be equally divided and \n     controlled by, the majority leader and the minority leader or \n     their designees.\n       (7) Procedures relating to conference reports.--\n       (A) Appointment of conferees.--A request for a conference \n     shall be accepted and conferees shall be appointed--\n       (i) in the case of the Senate, by the President pro \n     tempore, and\n       (ii) in the case of the House of Representatives, by the \n     Speaker of the House,\n     not later than 3 calendar days after such request is made.\n       (B) General rules for consideration of conference report.--\n     Consideration in a House of Congress of the conference report \n     on an implementing bill described in paragraph (5), including \n     consideration of all amendments in disagreement (and all \n     amendments thereto), and consideration of all debatable \n     motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited \n     to 4 hours, to be equally divided between, and controlled by, \n     the majority leader and the minority leader or their \n     designees.

Mr. President, I introduce the Class Action Fairness \nAct of 1997. This legislation is necessary to address a troubling and \ngrowing problem in class action litigation--unfair and abusive \nsettlements that ignore the best interests of injured plaintiffs while \nunscrupulous defendants and attorneys reap the rewards.\n  Let me give you an example of this situation. It involves a class \naction settlement that affected a constituent of mine, Martha Preston \nof Baraboo, WI. Ms. Preston was a member of a class action lawsuit \nfiled in Alabama State Court against BancBoston Mortgage Corp. The suit \nalleged that the bank was holding an excess balance of Ms. Preston's \nmoney in her mortgage escrow account. As with many class members in \nthis case--and in most class action lawsuits--Ms. Preston did not \nactually initiate the suit or even have knowledge that her mortgage \ncompany was being sued on her behalf. But a group of lawyers who \nclaimed to represent her and all other people in a similar situation \nfiled the suit on behalf of the class and negotiated a settlement of \nthe suit, as they are allowed to under the law.\n  The settlement they negotiated provided that the bank would refund \nthe excess money that it was holding and provide a small amount of \ncompensation to the plaintiffs for lost interest. Pursuant to the \nsettlement, Ms. Preston received a check for $4.38 to compensate her \nfor the interest she would have earned had the excess money been \ninvested. A few months later, a miscellaneous disbursement of $80.94 \nshowed up on her escrow account. That $80 went to pay the class action \nattorneys their fee for getting her $4.38. So Ms. Preston ended up \nlosing $75 as the result of a lawsuit filed without her knowledge and \nthat purported to be to her advantage.\n  Unfortunately, Ms. Preston's losses did not end there. She was \nunderstandably upset at what happened to her. So she found an attorney \nwho was willing to represent her pro bono. She sued the attorneys who \nhad negotiated the agreement that cost her $75. No sooner had she sued \nthem for what they had done, than these attorneys turned around and \nsued her and her pro bono attorneys in Alabama--a State she has never \nvisited--for abuse of process and malicious prosecution and asked for \n$25 million in damages against her. Both of these lawsuits are ongoing; \nindeed the suit that Ms. Preston filed is now the subject of a petition \nfor a writ of certiorari to the Supreme Court. Not only did Ms. Preston \nlose $75, but now as a result of trying to defend herself from being \nfleeced she is defending a $25 million lawsuit against her.\n  The Preston case is especially egregious. Unfortunately it is not \nuncommon. The system of class action law suits has created a climate \nwhere this kind of abuse is possible.\n  A class action is a lawsuit in which an attorney not only represents \nan individual plaintiff but, in addition, seeks relief for all those \nindividuals who have suffered an injury similar to the plaintiff. For \nexample, a suit brought against a pharmaceutical company by a person \nsuffering from the side effects of a drug can, if the court approves it \nas a class action, be expanded to cover all individuals who used the \ndrug.\n  Often, these suits are settled. The settlement agreements provide \nmoney and/or other forms of compensation. The attorneys who brought the \nclass action suit also get paid for their work. All class members are \nusually notified of the terms of the settlement and frequently--but not \nalways--given the chance to withdraw from the agreement if they do not \nwant to be part of it. A court must ultimately approve a settlement \nagreement.\n  Many of these suits are brought and settled fairly and in good faith. \nUnfortunately, we also know that there are a few unscrupulous lawyers \nwho file class actions in search of big attorney fees rather than to \nget compensation for victims. And the class action system does not \nadequately protect class members from such predatory acts. The primary \nproblem is that the client in a class action is a diffuse group of \nthousands of individuals scattered across the country. The group is so \ndiffuse that it is incapable of exercising meaningful control over the \nlitigation. As a result, while in theory the class action lawyers must \nbe responsive to their clients, in practice, the lawyers control all \naspects of the litigation.\n  Moreover, when a class action is settled, the amount of the attorneys \nfee is negotiated between the plaintiffs' lawyers and the defendants. \nBut in most cases the fee is paid by the class members--the only party \nthat does not have a seat at the bargaining table.\n  In addition, class actions are now being used by defendants as a tool \nto limit their future liabilities. Class actions are being settled that \ncover all individuals exposed to a particular substance but whose \ninjuries have not yet manifest themselves. As Prof. John Coffee of \nColumbia Law School has written, ``the class action is providing a \nmeans by which unsuspecting future claimants suffer the extinguishment \nof their claims even before they learn of their injury.''\n  In light of the incentives that are driving the parties, it is easy \nto see how the class members can be left out in the cold. Plaintiffs \nattorneys and corporate defendants can reach agreements that satisfy \ntheir respective interests--and even the interests of the name class \nplaintiffs--but that short sell the interests any class members who are \nnot vigilantly monitoring the litigation.\n  Although members of class actions get notices of settlements, the \nsettlements are often written in incomprehensible legalese. Let me give \nyou an example of a recent notice:\n\n       ``The Rebate payable to the eligible member [sic] of the \n     Open Class and the Closed Class shall be an amount equal to \n     (i) the Average Surplus, as determined by the above \n     subparagraph, multiplied by (ii) 50% multiplied by (iii) 3% \n     multiplied by (a) 1 if the loan was serviced for at least 1 \n     year but less than . . . .''\n\n  Even well trained attorneys are hard pressed to understand these \nnotices. But these long, finely printed and intricate letters are being \nsent to class members. And on the basis of these notices, people's \nlegal rights are being eliminated and in cases like Ms. Preston's they \nare being injured.\n  We all know that class action suits can result in significant and \nimportant benefits for class members and for our society. Class actions \nhave been used to desegregate racially divided schools, to obtain \nredress for victims of employment discrimination, and to compensate \nindividuals exposed to toxic chemicals or defective products. Class \nactions increase access to our civil justice system because they enable \npeople to pursue claims that collectively that would otherwise be too \nexpensive to litigate.\n  The difficulty in any effort to improve a basically good system is in \nweeding out the abuses without causing undue damage. The legislation I \npropose attempts to do this. It does not limit anyone's ability to file \na class action or to settle a class action. It seeks to address the \nproblem in two ways. First, it requires that State attorneys general be \nnotified about potential class action settlements that would affect \nresidents of their states. With this systematic notification in place, \nthe attorneys general can intervene in cases where they think the \nsettlements are unfair. Second, the legislation requires that class \nmembers be notified of a potential settlement in clear, easily \nunderstood English--not legal jargon.\n  Let me emphasize the limited scope of this measure: we do not require \nthat State attorney generals do anything with the notice that they \nreceive. No obligations are imposed upon them at\n\n[[Page S898]]\n\nall, although we are hopeful that they will act when appropriate. \nMoreover, we do not give the attorneys general any new or special \nrights to intervene in the settlements. They must work within current \nlaw.\n  The simple goal of this legislation is to provide better information \nand better consumer protection through greater knowledge. We do not \nwant to close the courthouse door to meritorious cases, but merely \nassure that people are provided with meaningful information so that \nthey can defend themselves.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 254\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, we introduced legislation earlier \nthis week to establish a Corporate Subsidy Review, Reform, and \nTermination Commission. We know that many Americans believe that \nGovernment operates for the benefit of the few and the privileged. They \nbelieve the system does not operate fairly, and their lack of \nconfidence in us affects our ability to enact the reforms and make the \nhard decisions which must be made if we are to get our country back on \nthe right track again.\n  Last Congress, we actively sought to reform many areas of Government \nspending--we reduced Government spending by $53 billion, reformed the \nwelfare system, restructured farm supports, rewrote telecommunications \nlaw, reformed the Federal procurement system, and adopted major \nimmigration reforms. We identified and reformed areas of Government \nspending which needed fundamental reform because they did not work as \nwell as they should.\n  As part of this process, a bipartisan group of Senators examined some \nprograms whose primary beneficiaries are profit-making enterprises and \nproposed reforming 12 specific programs which are characterized by some \nelement of corporate subsidization. We chose these examples to \ndemonstrate that such programs exist in virtually every industry, from \nmilitary construction, to energy production, to consumer product \nadvertising. While all the sponsors were not uniformly enthusiastic \nabout each of the 12 examples, we believed the package as a whole \nunderscored an important point and demonstrated our willingness to \nexamine Government spending in every area. This proposal was offered as \nan amendment to the reconciliation bill, and received the support of \nonly one-fourth of the Senate. Clearly, this problem needed to be \nattacked in a different way.\n  As a result, we introduced another bill last Congress which was \nreported favorably by the Committee on Governmental Affairs. It is that \nbill we introduced this week to create a Commission to fairly and \nindependently review corporate subsidies and make recommendations to \nthe President and the Congress for the retention, reform, or \ntermination of such subsidies.\n  Why establish a Commission and a new process to do what we could and \nshould do directly?\n  First, this Commission will do what we cannot do well: Make an \noverall informed assessment of all programs, on both the spending and \nrevenue sides, at one time. Over the years, we have created an \nintricate, interwoven system of subsidies, taxes, and exemptions. For \nexample, a Tennessee utility which would have been affected by the \nspending cuts we proposed last Congress pointed out to me that they in \nturn are competing against other energy providers who receive subsidies \nin the form of Federal tax exemptions.\n\n  Second, our experience last Congress demonstrated that voting hit or \nmiss on individual items is not going to be successful. One person's \npork is another's prize. And no one wants to give up their prize \nprogram if there isn't shared sacrifice. With the commission approach, \nwe will know that all programs have been examined and those which \nprovide unjustified subsidies have been exposed.\n  Third, the members of the Commission will be appointed specifically \nfor this purpose by the President and the Congress. They will possess \nthe expertise, authority and stature necessary to do the job.\n  Fourth, the Commission's recommendations will not be buried in the \ncorner of a Federal agency or a congressional committee. While the \nPresident and Congress will be able to propose amendments to or \noutright reject the Commission's recommendations, they must address \nthem.\n  S. 207 incorporates provisions to accommodate many of the concerns \nraised last Congress. This bill takes special note of the Federal \nGovernment's role in the area of international trade. In establishing \nthe Commission's review of Federal subsidies, it is not our intent to \nunduly disadvantage U.S. business interests as they compete in the \ninternational marketplace. We recognize that foreign governments \nfrequently subsidize business interests in their own countries. \nEliminating a particular program or subsidy might make sense in a \npurely domestic context, but such action could place a U.S. company at \na severe disadvantage when competing with a foreign company which has \nthe benefit of a subsidy from its government. A U.S. Government subsidy \nmay have been instituted in order to offset a similar subsidy to \nforeign competitors by foreign governments, with the intent of leveling \nthe playing field for U.S. industry. To eliminate such a subsidy not \nonly affects the direct U.S. business interests in global competition, \nbut also reduces the leverage of the U.S. Government in trade \nnegotiations. Having matched a foreign government subsidy, the U.S. \nGovernment may call for negotiations to end mutually the practice. We \nrecognize the importance of those issues and have included provisions \nto address carefully the Federal Government's role in international \ntrade.\n  Mr. President, we must require no less of profit-making enterprises \nthan\n\n[[Page S903]]\n\nwe ask of all Americans. It is a matter of fairness and shared \nsacrifice. At a time when the national debate is focused on getting \ncontrol of the budget, now and in the future, we cannot afford to \nprovide inappropriate corporate subsidies which undermine our efforts \nand which distort the free market. Perhaps most importantly, enactment \nof this legislation will demonstrate that Congress and the executive \nbranch are serious about addressing and correcting a system which the \nAmerican public as a whole sees as benefiting the few with access and \ninfluence, rather than serving the general public good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S902-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CONGRATULATIONS AND GOOD WISHES TO MARK SMITH\n\n Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise to recognize and offer my \ndeep gratitude to legislative director, Mark Smith, who tomorrow, after \n14 years of public service, will leave our office to pursue a career in \nthe private sector.\n  I first became acquainted with Mark in 1983, when he joined my office \nas a legislative correspondent. He worked on my second campaign for the \nSenate as a driver and advance worker. After attending law school, he \nreturned to my staff as a natural resources expert, and finally became \nlegislative director in 1993. Very rarely in my life have I met someone \nwho so embodies the qualities of integrity, hard work, perseverance, \nand loyalty.\n  Mark's family comes from Thompson Falls in the northwest section of \nMontana. That part of our State is known around the world for its \nspectacular forests and mountains. And it is known throughout Montana \nfor the respect its people hold for the land; for their strong ties of \nfamily and friendship; and for their old-fashioned values and work \nethic.\n  All these have put their stamp on Mark, and Mark brings them to work \nevery day.\n  He is an expert on the environment and natural resources. On these \nissues, Mark has always been able to find the elusive but essential \nbalance. He has helped preserve Montana's most beautiful natural \nriches, while at the same time promoting and protecting the natural \nresource jobs that sustain so many Montana families. The preservation \nof Pompey's Pillar, the beauty of the Fort Peck Reservoir, and the \nprosperity of many Montana businesses are due in large part to Mark's \nappreciation of our great outdoors.\n  He has a respect for public service and reverence for the law that \ncome right from the heart. Of Mark's many accomplishments here, perhaps \nthe one that has made me proudest comes from this unique quality. That \nis the confirmation of two Montanans, Sid Thomas and Ron Molloy, as \nFederal judges. Mark helped me create a selection process that brought \ntwo of the most qualified individuals in America to the Federal bench. \nAnd that will benefit every Montanan for many years to come.\n  He has a rock solid work ethic and a deep respect for working men and \nwomen. Mark himself comes in to the job early and stays late. And when \nthe Senate goes out on recess, Mark travels throughout Montana \nlistening and learning from millworkers, farmers, small business \nowners, and people in every walk of life. And that has helped me more \nthan I can say.\n  And finally, but perhaps most important of all, Mark is one of the \nmost honest, loyal, and dedicated people I have ever met.\n  Now Mark is moving on. Everyone in our office will miss a valuable \ncoworker, a respected adviser, and a good friend. But I and all the \nrest of us are very proud to have worked with Mark, and we wish him the \nbest in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S903-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO THE TOWN OF BERLIN, NH, AS IT CELEBRATES ITS CENTENNIAL \n                              ANNIVERSARY\n\n Mr. SMITH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \npeople of Berlin, NH, on their city's 100th anniversary. The residents \nof this north country community will begin celebrating this historic \noccasion February 2 and continue celebrating with a number of \nfestivities including a parade, fireworks show, and music presentation.\n  The tract of New Hampshire's wilderness now known as Berlin allowed \nthe first settlers striving for independence to come across the \nmountains to start a new community in the isolated but spectacularly \nbeautiful, rugged land. At that time, the area was called the \nPlantation of Maynesborough after a renowned English gentleman to whom \nit was granted by the Crown in 1771. Though this area was severe in the \nwinter, no one had to go hungry because the woods were full of deer and \npartridge, and the brooks and river teemed with trout. The seemingly \nendless stands of timber-pine, spruce, fir, and much more scenic beauty \nstretched across the land.\n  I travel to Berlin often. It is the gateway to northern New \nHampshire. I am always heartened by the sense of community spirit and \nthe dedication to excellence in the people of this industrial town. I \nhave worked with the members of the city government, and many \nresidents, on issues ranging from environmental protection to job \nsecurity at the plants to economic development for local business. I \nknow the people of Berlin to possess the Yankee independence exhibited \nby the first settler, William Sessions. That drive, fellowship, and \ncommunity spirit still holds true in the Berlin of today.\n  The village was incorporated on February 2, 1897, by Governor \nRamsdell, under the name of Berlin. Over the next 20 years, settlers \ncontinued farming, running sawmills, and raising homes and families. By \n1920, Berlin became a busy industrial center and the capital of the \npapermaking world with the formation of the Brown family's Berlin Mills \nCo. It is an industry still prevalent today.\n  Thomas Green opened Berlin's first retail market for business in \n1835. By 1890, Berlin developed a downtown of wood framed stores, \nchurches, and other public buildings that lined the unpaved streets and \nwooden boardwalks. After the turn of the century, several hotels, \ntheaters, and even a large opera house could be found in the center of \nBerlin's flourishing economy. On July 24, 1902, a street railway began \noperating between Berlin and Gorham, and in 1920, the railway \ntransported over 1.6 million passengers.\n  Many of the buildings that graced the streets of Berlin in the early \n1900's still exist today and exemplify some of Berlin's extraordinary \narchitecture. Several of the events planned for Berlin's centennial \ncelebration will take place in these historic areas of the city. Sunday \nevening's formal ceremonies will be held in Berlin's city hall, \ncompleted in 1914 by A.N. and J.B. Gilbert. The city hall illustrates \nGerogian revival architecture.\n  I regret I cannot attend the joyous festivities today, but I warmly \ncongratulate the residents of Berlin on 100 years of history. I wish to \nextend my very best wishes for a festive week of activities and \ncontinued prosperity. Happy birthday Berlin.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S903-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S903-S904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS\n\n Mr. BOND.

The presiding officer at \n     any hearing is authorized to limit the time of each witness \n     appearing before the committee or a subcommittee. The \n     committee or a subcommittee shall, as far as practicable, \n     utilize testimony previously taken on bills and measures \n     similar to those before it for consideration.\n       Rule 10.--Should a subcommittee fail to report back to the \n     full committee on any measure within a reasonable time, the \n     chairman may withdraw the measure from such subcommittee and \n     report that fact to the full committee for further \n     disposition.\n       Rule 11.--No subcommittee may schedule a meeting or hearing \n     at a time designated for a hearing or meeting of the full \n     committee.

In the event there are \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views, an appropriate \n     opportunity shall be given the majority to examine the \n     proposed text prior to filing or publication.\n       Rule 17.--(a) The committee, or any subcommittee, may issue \n     subpoenas, or hold hearings to take sworn testimony or hear \n     subpoenaed witnesses, only if such investigative activity has \n     been authorized by majority vote of the committee.\n       (b) For the purpose of holding a hearing to take sworn \n     testimony or hear subpoenaed witnesses, three members of the \n     committee or subcommittee shall constitute a quorum: \n     provided, with the concurrence of the chairman and ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, a single \n     member may hear subpoenaed witnesses or take sworn testimony.\n       (c) The committee may, by a majority vote, delegate the \n     authority to issue subpoenas to the chairman of the committee \n     or a subcommittee, or to any member designated by such \n     chairman. Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any \n     other member so requesting, shall be notified regarding the \n     identity of the person to whom it will be issued and the \n     nature of the information sought and its relationship to the \n     authorized investigative activity, except where the chairman \n     of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, determines that such notice would \n     unduly impede the investigation. All information obtained \n     pursuant to such investigative activity shall be made \n     available as promptly as possible to each member of the \n     committee requesting same, or to any assistant to a member of \n     the committee designated by such member in writing, but the \n     use of any such information is subject to restrictions \n     imposed by the rules of the Senate. Such information, to the \n     extent that it is relevant to the investigation shall, if \n     requested by a member, be summarized in writing as soon as \n     practicable. Upon the request of any member, the chairman of \n     the committee or subcommittee shall call an executive session \n     to discuss such investigative activity or the issuance of any \n     subpoena in connection therewith.\n       (d) Any witness summoned to testify at a hearing, or any \n     witness giving sworn testimony, may be accompanied by counsel \n     of his own choosing who shall be permitted, while the witness \n     is testifying, to advise him of his legal rights.\n       (e) No confidential testimony taken or confidential \n     material presented in an executive hearing, or any report of \n     the proceedings of such an executive hearing, shall be made \n     public, either in whole or in part or by way of summary, \n     unless authorized by a majority of the members of the \n     committee or subcommittee.\n       Rule 18.--Presidential nominees shall submit a statement of \n     their background and financial interests, including the \n     financial interests of their spouse and children living in \n     their household, on a form approved by the committee which \n     shall be sworn to as to its completeness and accuracy. The \n     committee form shall be in two parts--\n       (I) information relating to employment, education and \n     background of the nominee relating to the position to which \n     the individual is nominated, and which is to be made public; \n     and,\n       (II) information relating to financial and other background \n     of the nominee, to be made public when the committee \n     determines that such information bears directly on the \n     nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the \n     individual is nominated.\n       Information relating to background and financial interests \n     (parts I and II) shall not be required of (a) candidates for \n     appointment and promotion in the Public Health Service Corps; \n     and (b) nominees for less than full-time appointments to \n     councils, commissions or boards when the committee determines \n     that some or all of the information is not relevant to the \n     nature of the position.

When the Chair finds it \n     necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear \n     the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so \n     long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.\n       (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete \n     transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record \n     the proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not \n     such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this \n     paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo \n     such a record.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources With \n       Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters\n\n\n                                hearings\n\n       Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act \n     requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announce \n     the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least \n     one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.\n       The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice \n     to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time \n     and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of \n     section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the \n     committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the \n     development of hearings:\n       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in \n     the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement \n     of such hearing.\n       2.

When statements are received in advance of a \n     hearing, the committee or subcommittee (as appropriate) \n     should distribute copies of such statements to each of its \n     members.\n\n\n         executive sessions for the purpose of marking up bills\n\n       In order to expedite the process of marking up bills and to \n     assist each member of the committee so that there may be full \n     and fair consideration of each bill which the committee or a \n     subcommittee is marking up the following procedures should be \n     followed:\n       1. Seven days prior to the proposed data for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide written notice \n     to each of its members as to the time, place, and specific \n     subject matter of such session, including an agenda listing \n     each bill or other matters to be considered and including:\n       (a) two copies of each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter (or committee print thereof) to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       (b) two copies of a summary of the provisions of each bill, \n     joint resolution, or other legislative matter to be \n     considered at such executive session; and\n       2. Three days prior to the scheduled date for an executive \n     session for the purpose of marking up bills, the committee or \n     subcommittee (as appropriate) should deliver to each of its \n     members two copies of a cordon print or an equivalent \n     explanation of changes of existing law proposed to be made by \n     each bill, joint resolution, or other legislative matter to \n     be considered at such executive session.\n       3. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an \n     executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, each \n     member of the committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) \n     should provide to all other such members two written copies \n     of any amendment or a description of any amendment which that \n     member proposes to offer to each bill, joint resolution, or \n     other legislative matter to be considered at such executive \n     session.\n       4. Insofar as practical, prior to the scheduled date for an \n     executive session for the purpose of marking up bills, the \n     committee or a subcommittee (as appropriate) should provide \n     each member with a copy of the printed record or a summary of \n     any hearings conducted by the committee or a subcommittee \n     with respect to each bill, joint resolution, or other \n     legislative matter to be considered at such executive \n     session.\n\n\n         committee reports, publications, and related documents\n\n       Rule 16 of the committee rules, requires that the minority \n     be given an opportunity to examine the proposed text of \n     committee reports prior to their filing and that the majority \n     be given an opportunity to examine the proposed text of \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views prior to their \n     filing.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Senate Resolution 36 \npresented earlier today by myself and Senator Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 36) relative to the retirements of \n     Arthur Curran, Donn Larson, and Richard Gibbons.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, when the First Congress convened in 1789, \none of the more pressing problems for the Senate was its inability to \nkeep a majority of Members in the Capitol long enough to establish a \nquorum, organize, and begin the business of Government. In response, \nthe Senate established the Office of Doorkeeper. As the first officer \nof the Senate, the Doorkeeper's primary responsibilities were to keep \nSenators in and, as proceedings were held in closed session for the \nfirst 6 years, keep everyone else out.\n  In 1795, the Senate began holding open sessions which required the \nopening of public galleries. And, once again, it fell to the \nDoorkeepers to maintain decorum and enforce the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, as I speak here today, and every day that the Senate \nis in session, there are more than a score of Doorkeepers, both on the \nfloor of the Senate and dutifully standing post in the galleries. The \nSenate is grateful for the dedication and service of the ranks of the \nmembers of the Office of the Doorkeeper. In particular, I want to \ncommend the service of three individuals who have given a cumulative \nservice of nearly 70 years to the U.S. Senate.\n  On behalf of the Senate I want to thank Messrs. Richard Gibbons, \nArthur Curran, and Donn Larson. Regrettably, I am informed that each \nwill retire at the end of this month.\n  Arthur Patrick Curran has faithfully served the U.S. Senate as a \nDoorkeeper for the past 21 years. Initially appointed by Vice President \nNelson\n\n[[Page S908]]\n\nRockefeller in 1975, 6 years later he was promoted to Superintendent of \nDoorkeepers and has served in that capacity until his retirement in \nJanuary 1997. In addition to his normal post at the Senate Chamber, Mr. \nCurran has performed his duties in numerous high profile Senate \nhearings, joint sessions, and Presidential inaugurations.\n  Mr. Curran, a native of Washington, DC, has strong links to New \nEngland and a keen interest in politics. In fact with his tall stature, \nbow tie, and stately appearance, he is often confused for being a \nSenator. On several occasions, as visitors have left the gallery, they \nhave congratulated him for his fine speech.\n  Donn Larson, Deputy Superintendent of Doorkeepers, is also retiring \nafter many years of dedicated service to the U.S. Senate. Donn started \nhis career with the Senate under an appointment from Senator Milton \nYoung (R-ND) in 1959. From 1961 to 1968, he worked in the Republican \nCloakroom, assisting the Secretary to the Minority.\n  From 1969 to 1977, Donn worked in the Federal Government. He served \nwith the State Department Inspector General for Foreign Assistance, as \nwell as with the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. In 1977, \nDonn returned to the U.S. Senate, and in 1981 assumed the position of \nDeputy Superintendent of Doorkeepers.\n  Richard Gibbons began service with the office of Doorkeeper in the \n94th Congress--1977. For a number of years, he served as the press \nliaison for the Doorkeeper's Office. During the 103d Congress, Richard \nwas assigned to work solely on the Senate floor, assisting Members of \nthe Senate.\n  Each of us have known these men over the years for their tireless \nefforts in maintaining decorum of the Chamber and galleries and \nassisting Members on the floor of the Senate. Countless letters of \nappreciation have been written by our constituents thanking these men \nfor there kindness and courtesies.\n  On the occasion of their retirement from Federal service, I want to \nextend the very best wishes of the U.S. Senate and a grateful Nation.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, this resolution commends the service of \nthree very important Senate staff members, members who have served this \ninstitution exceedingly well, in some cases for many years, even \ndecades. I want to add my own commendation and congratulations to these \nthree very distinguished members of our Senate family.\n  Arthur Curran has been the Superintendent of Senate Doorkeepers for a \nlong time. He was appointed by the Vice President in 1975, at that time \nVice President Rockefeller, and has served as our Superintendent of \nDoorkeepers since 1981.\n  Those duties involving his particular position are extraordinarily \nconsequential and far-reaching. He is responsible for joint sessions of \nCongress. He is also responsible for high-profile Senate hearings, and \nall of the inaugurations, including the one just completed last week.\n  He is a native of Washington, DC, and spent many summers in Maine as \nhe was growing up. But over the time that I have had the good fortune \nto know him, Arthur has also proved to me to be a real connoisseur of \ngood restaurants and has given me a lot of good tips over the years as \nto restaurants that I should try.\n  But far more important than his knowledge of good restaurants in the \narea, Arthur Curran has an institutional knowledge and respect that \nwill be impossible to replace.\n  Arthur Curran leaves tomorrow with our good wishes, with our thanks, \nwith our profuse respect. We thank him for a job well done. We \nencourage him to enjoy all of his new endeavors. And we thank those \nmembers of his family who have sacrificed, along with Arthur, that he \nmight do the kind of job that he has now for more than 20 years.\n  Donn Larson is the Deputy Supervisor of Doorkeepers. He, too, was \nappointed decades ago. He was first appointed by Senator Milton Young \nin 1959. He worked in the Republican Cloakroom from 1961 to 1968; and \nfrom 1969 to 1977 worked for the State Department and the Department of \nHealth, Education, and Welfare.\n  He returned to the U.S. Senate in 1977, and has been the Deputy \nSupervisor of the Doorkeepers, also, since 1981.\n  Donn Larson, like Arthur Curran, knows this institution. He has \nwatched Senators come and go. He has watched the progress of democracy \nand heard all of the noise of democracy each day with all of its \nvolume. His civility, his cooperation, his extraordinary demeanor is \nsomething that we will miss, beginning on Monday.\n  We again congratulate and commend Donn Larson for an extraordinary \ncontribution to his country and for a remarkable career here in the \nU.S. Senate.\n  Richard Gibbons--somebody we all know because he is right here on the \nfloor--is a floor attendant. He began working for the Senate \ndoorkeepers in 1977. For many years he worked as press liaison outside \nthe President's room just off the Senate floor. And during the 103d \nCongress, Richard was moved out to the floor where he has helped \nSenators and staff and everybody else who has come through with \nwhatever needs they might have. He has helped to keep order in the \nChamber, and he has done an extraordinarily effective job.\n  Richard Gibbons, too, deserves our thanks and deserves the respect \nthat he has now earned on both sides of the aisle. We commend him. We \nthank him. We wish him well in all of his future endeavors as well.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago, men and women who come to work with us \nin the Senate Chamber make an immense sacrifice, oftentimes in terms of \nthe income they could acquire at jobs outside of Capitol Hill, in time \nspent here when they could be spending it with their families. We thank \ntheir families for the support that they have given them. We thank them \nfor their understanding. We thank them for allowing us the opportunity \nand good fortune to work with them with the frequency and with the \nsuccess that we have.\n  So on this day it is with some sadness that we note the departure of \nArthur Curran, Donn Larson, and Richard Gibbons. But with great \nenthusiasm, we wish them well as they take on new roles and new \nresponsibilities and certainly many more opportunities in their lives \nahead.\n  I know this resolution will pass overwhelmingly, as it should, \nbecause Republicans and Democrats owe these three individuals a very \ndeep sense of gratitude.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the resolution \nappear at this point in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 36), with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 36\n\n       Relative to the retirements of Arthur Curran, Donn Larson \n     and Richard Gibbons;\n       Whereas Arthur Curran, Donn Larson and Richard Gibbons will \n     retire from the Senate on January 31, 1997;\n       Whereas Arthur Curran was appointed as a Senate doorkeeper \n     in 1975 by Vice President Rockefeller;\n       Whereas Arthur Curran rose to the post of superintendent of \n     doorkeepers and has dutifully served in that post for the \n     last 15 years;\n       Whereas Donn Larson first began his Senate career under an \n     appointment from Senator Milton Young in 1959;\n       Whereas Donn Larson served in the Republican cloakroom from \n     1961 to 1968, leaving to work in the Federal Government until \n     his return to the Senate in 1977, where he has served as \n     Deputy Supervisor of the doorkeepers since 1981;\n       Whereas Richard Gibbons has served as a Senate doorkeeper \n     since 1977, acting as press liaison outside the President's \n     room just off the Senate floor;\n       Whereas since the 103rd Congress Richard Gibbons has served \n     in the Senate Chamber and has diligently assisted both \n     Senators and staff alike in a myriad of tasks in addition to \n     his role of helping to maintain order in the Chamber;\n       Whereas each of these three gentlemen has faithfully served \n     the Senate and they have carried out their duties with \n     efficiency and good nature;\n       Now therefore be it resolved that the Senate extends its \n     thanks to Arthur Curran, Donn Larson, and Richard Gibbons for \n     their many years of dedicated service and wishes them well in \n     their future aspirations.\n       The secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     resolution to Arthur Curran, Donn Larson, and Richard \n     Gibbons.\n     \n                               ____________________\n     \n     \n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S907-1", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n[[Page S909]]\n\n\n\n                              THE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of Alan \nHantman of New Jersey, who will soon become the next Architect of the \nCapitol.\n  Mr. President, Mr. Hantman is eminently qualified for this position, \nand has a long and successful track record. Most recently, he served as \nvice president of facilities planning and architecture at Rockefeller \nCenter from 1986 until mid-July of last year.\n  As Architect of the Capitol, Mr. Hantman will be responsible for the \nmaintenance of a large and varied Capitol complex. I know he will do an \noutstanding job. Over the past 30 years, he has earned the respect of \nmany in his profession, who know him to be a man of great competence \nand leadership.\n  Mr. President, the Capitol is a very special place, not only for \nthose of us fortunate enough to work here, but for all Americans. \nIndeed, the image of our Capitol dome is a symbol of freedom and \nliberty throughout our world.\n  We are fortunate that this special symbol, and the great complex of \nwhich it is a part, will be in the hands of someone as competent as \nAlan Hantman. I wish him all the best in his new position.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Alan Hantman to be the next Architect of the Capitol.\n  Mr. Hantman's nomination is the culmination of a long and thorough \nsearch process conducted by the bipartisan Architect of the Capitol \nSearch Commission.\n  He has a distinguished record, having served as vice president for \narchitecture, planning, and construction at the Rockefeller Center. I \nbelieve he is in an excellent position to lead the Architect of the \nCapitol into the 21st century.\n  The U.S. Capitol is a unique historical institution. The new \nArchitect will face many challenges in leading the work force of 2,100 \nemployees. The new Architect will have to work on not only preserving \nthe historical integrity of the Capitol, but also of managing the work \nforce, which is comprised of dedicated and hard-working men and women \nmany of whom I am proud to say are Maryland residents. They are being \nrequired to do more work with less help.\n  I have had a particular interest in the Architect's employment \npractices and how the workers are being treated, most of whom are blue-\ncollar, minority workers. My concern dates back many years to the \ntenure of George White. Many of the workers under then-Architect White \ncame to me, as a last resort, to complain about the rampant \ndiscrimination that was prevalent within the Architect's office.\n  For instance, one worker with 30 years of service had never received \na raise until I intervened. This was a clear case of discrimination. \nAnd, there were many others.\n  I asked the General Accounting Office in 1992 to investigate the \nmanagement practices of the Architect's office. The GAO found that the \nArchitect's office did not have a modern personnel management system in \nplace.\n  As a result of the GAO report, I introduced legislation to establish \na professional management system, the Architect of the Capitol Human \nResources Act, which was passed into law in 1994. I also called for the \nresignation of George White, who failed to hold the managers and \nsuperintendents within the Architect's office accountable for poor \nmanagement practices.\n  My legislation made extensive changes to the personnel system in the \nArchitect's office. It established merit-based hiring and promotions, \nan equal employment opportunity program, equal pay for equal work, a \ntraining program, job evaluations, an open and fair disciplinary \nprocess, a confidential employee assistance program, and an employee \npersonnel manual.\n  Some of the law's requirements have been slowly implemented. I think \nit\n\n[[Page S912]]\n\nshould be the No. 1 priority of the new Architect to fully implement \nand enforce the law's requirements. I believe it is important for the \nworkers to know that their workplace will be free of discrimination. It \nis no more than what we require for all businesses.\n  I hope Mr. Hantman will function not only as an Architect, but as a \nsocial architect in running the Architect of the Capitol. I have \ntremendous hope that we will see change in the Architect's office. It \nis long overdue.\n  I want to maintain the current work force. I do not want to see the \nnext Architect rush to privatize services. It is important that we \nestablish an independent task force to review the impact of \nprivatization on employees, security, and cost-savings. I am confident \nthat Mr. Hantman Architect will be willing to listen to these concerns.\n  I believe the confirmation of the next Architect could mark the \nbeginning of a new and progressive era for the Architect of the Capitol \nand its employees.\n  I am prepared to work closely with Mr. Hantman to ensure that the \nreforms suggested by the GAO report and outlined in my law will take \nplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S909-4", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

ENSIGN, ACTING ARCHITECT OF THE CAPITOL\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, William L. Ensign, Acting Architect of the \nCapitol, is retiring on February 3, 1997, after 20 years of Federal \nservice. Bill began his distinguished career with the Office of the \nArchitect of the Capitol as the Assistant Architect in May 1980. He \noccupied this position until November 22, 1995, when, upon the \nretirement of George M. White, he became the Acting Architect of the \nCapitol.\n  Bill, in his role as Assistant Architect, was also the Director of \nArchitecture and the principal adviser to the Architect in all matters \nconcerning the architectural design of new buildings, the restoration \nand renovation of existing buildings, and the planning and adaptive \nreuse of facilities throughout the Capitol Hill complex of buildings. \nSpecifically, Bill was responsible for the Architecture and \nConstruction Divisions encompassing design, construction, and \nproduction technology.\n  In November 1995, Bill inherited the leadership of the office. In \nthis capacity he has been responsible to the Congress for all design, \nconstruction, care, operations, and maintenance of facilities within \nthe Capitol Hill complex of buildings.\n  Prior to service with this Office, Bill was president and chief \nexecutive officer of the firm McLeod, Ferrara, Ensign Chartered \nArchitects, from 1955 to 1980. He also served as an officer in the \nCivil Engineer Corps of the U.S. Navy from 1952 to 1955.\n  Mr. President, on the occasion of his retirement, I am honored to \nexpress and extend my gratitude and appreciation to William L. Ensign, \nfor his many years of dedication and professionalism to the Congress \nand the Nation. Bill's commitment and expertise has assured that future \ngenerations will be able to visit the buildings and grounds and enjoy \nthe rich history that is encompassed in the Capitol complex.\n  Mr. President, I thank Bill for his distinguished service and wish \nhim and his family the very best during his retirement years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S912-2", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT.

Mr. President, for all Senators' information, the Senate \nwill not be in session on Friday. There will be a pro forma session on \nMonday, which we just pointed out, at 9:30, with no business to be \nconducted. The Senate will be in session on Tuesday, and it is possible \nthat following the weekly policy luncheons on Tuesday, the Senate may \nconsider additional nominations that will come available. There are \nsome that are moving and, hopefully, have been reported, and maybe will \nbe ready by Tuesday. So Senators should expect the possibility of \nrollcall votes on Tuesday during the session. Members will be notified \nof the specific times we will have those votes scheduled.\n  Under a previous consent, the Judiciary Committee will be able to \nfile a report accompanying the balanced budget amendment on Monday. It \nis my hope we will then be able to begin consideration on that \nimportant constitutional amendment sometime during Wednesday's session \nof the Senate.\n  I also would like to remind my colleagues that the President's State \nof the Union Address is scheduled at 9 p.m. on Tuesday evening. All \nSenators are asked to be in the Senate Chamber at 8:30 p.m. on Tuesday \nso the Senate can proceed at 8:40 p.m. to the House of Representatives \nfor the address.\n  Mr. President, we do hope that we will have one or two Cabinet \nnominations ready next week. Again, it depends on whether or not they \nare reported by the committees and we get them filed and agree on a \ntime, which all Senators agree to, and have a vote. It looks likes it \nwill not occur before Wednesday or Thursday. We cannot make that \nannouncement at this time. We will continue to work on that next week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/01/30/senate-section/article/S912-5", "month": "01", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "30", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, FEBRUARY 3, 1997, AT 9:30 A.M.\n\n  Mr. LOTT.
