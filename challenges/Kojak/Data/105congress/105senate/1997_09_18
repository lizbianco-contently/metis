In the \nprocess of fulfilling such a mandate, the collective ethic which \npermeates this American experiment of ours has come to oppose slavery \nin any form, including slavery to those laws, policies, or procedures \nwhich may no longer speak to the challenges of our time and \ncircumstance.\n  We are about to embark on a journey through another century, so we \nask, Lord, may we approach the turn of our century in the same spirit \nthat our Founding Fathers and mothers approached theirs, by believing \nin our hearts, as Thomas Paine advised, that we have it in our power to \nbegin the world over again, to which we add: To make it infinitely \nbetter than it was before we entered it, to build toward an even \ngreater freedom and justice in ways never dreamed of before, and to \nembrace those of our citizens who have yet to share in liberty's \nbounty, as is their inalienable right.\n  We pray, therefore, that our deliberations and decisions transcend \nthe limits of political concerns to evolve statutes and ordinances, \nlaws and commandments which serve the people and provide for the \nhumanity. May they be laws which enhance justice and which help to \nestablish an everlasting peace both within the hearts of as well as \namong the inhabitants of our land.\n  May future generations look back upon the work fostered and initiated \nby us who will be their ancestors as we have looked to and built upon \nthe accomplishments of our Founding Fathers and mothers. May they come \nto praise us for expanding their freedom, their liberty, their \nopportunity for material and spiritual well-being, bringing ever nearer \nthe longed-for day of Thy kingdom on Earth. In whatever name we pray, \nlet us say Amen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hutchinson). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am very happy today to welcome to the \nSenate and Washington, DC, Rabbi Mell Hecht. I do this on my behalf and \nthat of Senator Bryan from Nevada.\n  I have been in the presence of Rabbi Hecht on joyous occasions, bar \nmitzvahs and bat mitzvahs, and also sad occasions where he has spoken \nat funerals. Rabbi Hecht is truly one of the spiritual leaders of the \nGreater Las Vegas area and the State of Nevada. That is why I was very \nhappy to be responsible for his giving the prayer to open this session \nof the Senate.\n  Rabbi Mell Hecht is really a community builder. He is an active \nleader in our religious community and as a result of his being active \nin our religious community with his spiritual leadership this has \ncertainly flowed over into the rest of the community. He is deeply \nconcerned about the community of man. He is an outspoken advocate for \nhuman rights. He has worked for peace in many different aspects of our \nsociety.\n  Rabbi Hecht has a great academic background. He has a bachelor of \narts degree from the University of Miami in Florida. He has done some \nof his undergraduate work at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, \nIsrael. He completed his bachelor of Hebrew letters and master of \nHebrew letters at the Cincinnati Union College where he was ordained a \nrabbi. He has been an Army chaplain and race relations officer in \nGermany. He served as chairman of the Humana Sunrise Pastoral Care \nCouncil, the National Conference of Christians and Jews, Nevada Clergy \nAgainst Drug and Alcohol Abuse, and the Jewish Federation Community \nRelations Committee. He has been on the boards of numerous civic and \ncharitable organizations. He has recently received his doctor of \ndivinity degree from Hebrew Union College in California.\n  Mr. President, again, it is with a great deal of honor and pleasure \nthat I welcome one of Nevada's spiritual leaders, Rabbi Mell Hecht, to \nthe Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9531-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to just briefly describe \nmy amendment, and then it is my intention to yield 2 minutes to Senator \nDeWine. And then of course I know Senator Harkin is here to speak on \nthe other side.\n  My amendment leaves the amount for the commitment to the arts at the \nsame level as the committee bill does. It does, however, make some \nreforms that I think will improve the NEA and most certainly will \nimprove the commitment to the arts and reconfirm the commitment to arts \nthat we have. It cuts the administrative costs of the NEA to 5 percent. \nI think, since the large part of the bill will require block granting \nto the States, that the administration does not need to be $17 million. \nI think $5 million then would be quite adequate to administer the \nnational part of the bill.\n  The Federal grants to national groups would be 20 percent of the \ntotal grant. In the Federal grants, we have a requirement for State \nmatching funds, which I think is a healthy thing for us to require, so \nthat any project that is funded with national dollars will also\n\n[[Page S9533]]\n\nhave a State commitment. Grants may not be used for obscene works, and \nthey will go for groups and institutions.\n  The rest of the money, the 75 percent, would be grants to the States \nso that the each State or territory is guaranteed at least what they \nhad in 1997. And, in fact, every State, except California and New York, \nwould get more funding for their arts commissions than they had last \nyear. Each State except California and New York will get more money \nthan they got in 1997, and they will be able to spend it according to \nthe wishes of their own arts commissions. I think it is very important \nthat this happen.\n  With the 20 percent Federal grants to the national groups, I think \nCalifornia and New York will be able to make up some of the loss that \nthey will receive because they have had the highest number of dollars \nthat have gone to the national arts.\n  In this, I think we have a good way to keep our commitment to the \narts to increase the access to the arts by children and people in all \nthe States of our great country. And I think it also will give the \nleeway for the national groups that deserve the support of the National \nGovernment, because we do want to keep the very top, top quality in our \narts so we can be proud, as a Nation, that we do have the world class \nopera, the world class ballet, the world class art museums that would \nactually be worthy of the civilization that our country has formed in \nits 221 years of democracy.\n  Mr. President, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, the Hutchison amendment recognizes that \nthere are arts programs, arts projects, that are of national \nsignificance and that they should be supported. The amendment does this \nwhile at the same time addressing the huge geographic disparity in \nfunding that the NEA elite, the NEA bureaucracy, has consistently and \narrogantly refused to address or, for that matter, even to acknowledge.\n  This inequality in funding is unconscionable. When you have States \nsuch as New York getting $21 million from the NEA, California, $8 \nmillion, while States such as Ohio with our 11 million citizens \nreceiving only $1.6 million, clearly something is horribly wrong.\n  Ohio comes in 46th in per capita NEA funding. New York gets $1.18 per \nperson; Wyoming, $1.24, Alaska, $1.21. Ohio gets 14 cents per person.\n  Again and again, the NEA has failed to address this problem. Let me \nsay this failure on the NEA's part points to broader problems at the \nNEA. For years now, Congress has been trying to set priorities for the \nNEA but nothing really has changed. I have grown increasingly \nfrustrated because of the seeming ease with which the NEA flouts \ncongressionally enacted policies. It sometimes seems as if the NEA uses \nas much, or maybe more, creativity in skirting our guidelines as NEA-\nfunded artists do in creating their works.\n  The NEA funds do support a number of worthwhile projects. However, I \nbelieve that NEA funding should really be targeted for programs for \nchildren and for underserved populations. Our scarce Federal dollars \nshould be used to bring the arts to our children and to the poor. I \ncongratulate my colleague, Senator Gorton, for including language in \nthe underlying bill to indicate this priority, and also to Senator \nJeffords for including it in the authorizing bill.\n\n  I certainly hope the NEA takes today's debate seriously. If, however, \nthe NEA continues to remain unresponsive to legitimate concerns, \nconcerns voiced by the people who are paying the bills, we can \ncertainly expect even more support for moves to abolish the endowment \noutright. That, Mr. President, would be a great shame--for everyone who \nloves the arts, and indeed for all Americans. It would be a shame that \nthe greatest country in the world, with some of the most talented and \ncreative artists in the world, could not intelligently and responsibly \nrun a national arts agency.\n  Mr. President, we can--and must--do better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is now my intention to yield 2 \nminutes to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my good friend, the Senator from Texas.\n  I rise today to support the amendment submitted by my distinguished \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison. I think her amendment \nrepresents a reasonable compromise to what has become a very divisive \nissue.\n  I think every Member of this Chamber would agree that some of the \nworks the NEA has funded in the past have been offensive. They call \ninto question the appropriateness of the Federal Government being \ninvolved in the promotion of the arts. Several years ago we had an \nexhibit here--and it had to be covered. We couldn't allow the Senate \npages to see it. It was absolutely unsuitable for public view--\ncertainly for young people. I personally was offended, and I think we \nall learned something from that.\n  Art works funded by a Federal agency should be those you take your \nchildren to see and, in the case of NEA-sponsored works, this has not \nalways been the case. But, certainly the arts, overall, have a \nlegitimate voice in our society. I think the amendment of Senator \nHutchison that would take 20 percent of the NEA budget and keep it here \nin Washington, DC to be distributed to works of national prominence is \nsatisfactory. It also addresses the concerns of those who do not \nbelieve it is in the Federal Government's jurisdiction to fund the \narts. She has an answer to that--send 75 percent of the money to the \nStates. This amendment will allow each of our States to develop the \narts locally, hopefully reflecting the true role of the arts and the \nrole they play in each of our communities.\n  I think this is a good amendment and merits the overwhelming support \nof this Chamber.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield myself--do I have 10 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield myself 8 of the 10 minutes. If the chair will \ninterrupt me, I will appreciate it.\n  This amendment all but eliminates the National Endowment for the \nArts. In other words, it eliminates a Federal role.\n  I believe the Senator from Texas is well-intentioned. However, the \nresult would be disastrous for the arts. NEA national leadership grants \nhave supported a number of very worthy projects that would not have \nbeen supported by a State. For example, the design competition in 1981 \nthat led to the creation of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. What State \nwould have funded that if it was not going to be in the State, but was \ngoing to be located in the District of Columbia?\n  The Senator from Ohio made mention of all the money that goes to New \nYork. Let's look at some of that money. Through the national leadership \ngrants, the NEA provided a grant to Chamber Music of America in New \nYork, but this grant sponsored chamber music rural residencies, which \nbrought professional musicians to small towns, such as Jesup and \nDecorah and Fayette and Mount Vernon, IA. Artists lived and worked in \nthese small towns for up to 2 years. They taught in the schools. They \nperformed concerts for citizens in the communities all over the State \nof Iowa. Thousands of Iowans benefited from this. But, if you look at \nthe grant, it went to New York. But the artists performed in Iowa, for \nup to 2 years.\n\n  If we take all of this money, as the Senator from Texas wants, and \ngive it just to the States, will, then, the State of New York fund a \nprogram that goes to Iowa? I rather doubt it. They will keep the money \nthere. But because we have the NEA making these grants, giving them \nout, then they can direct and guide those to go out to States like Iowa \nand Nebraska and Missouri, and States where we don't get a lot of money \nfor arts.\n  So, what State would fund a program like that? What State? Would \nTexas? Would Texas fund a program that would send artists to Iowa for 2 \nyears? I doubt that.\n  The NEA has also supported dance touring programs. The Alvin Ailey \ndance group traveled to Atlanta, GA;\n\n[[Page S9534]]\n\nRedding, OR; Tuscon, AR; Iowa City, IA; Milwaukee, WI. Would Texas fund \nsomething like that? I doubt it. Would New York fund something like \nthat? I doubt it. Would California fund something like that? I doubt \nit. But, because we have a National Endowment for the Arts, we are able \nto get this out.\n  A grant to the American Library Association sponsored the ``Writers \nLive At The Library.'' This program went all over America, to places \nlike Rapid City, SD; Medina, OH; Buchanan, MI; Muncie, IN. Would Texas \nhave sponsored that? I doubt it. Would New York alone have sponsored \nthat? I don't think so. But the National Endowment for the Arts did.\n  That is my point. You could look at a lot of these grants. They may \ngo to a State. But they seep out and go around the United States. If we \nadopt the amendment offered by the Senator from Texas, that will end. \nWe will not have a National Endowment for the Arts. We will simply have \na bunch of States out there. I rather doubt that States will fund \nprograms that will go to another State.\n  Mr. President, this amendment has never been reviewed or discussed in \nany format before. Present law provides 35 percent to the States. Under \nthe bill, under the leadership of Senator Jeffords, that goes to 40 \npercent. It was adopted by a 14-to-4 bipartisan vote in committee.\n  I might also point out that Federal funds are matched by the States \non a 1-to-1 basis. If you increase this amount of money to the States, \nthey will have to go to their State legislatures to get the amount of \nmoney up. Will that happen? Well, in some States it might, in some \nStates it might not.\n  I also will point out that the Hutchison amendment imposes a cap on \nadministrative costs of 5 percent. Right now the President's budget \ncalls for a cap of 14 percent. Here is the problem. Many of the State \nagencies are quite small, so State support varies from State to State. \nIf you put a cap on like that and you have low spending, that just \ndestroys the program. Obviously, as you know, the more money you have \nin the program the less the amount of administrative costs there are \nfor administering that program.\n  So the 5-percent cap would also not only hurt many of the State \nagencies, but would be disastrous for the National Endowment for the \nArts.\n  Mr. President, the Hutchison amendment is a severe and undeserved \nrebuke to the arts endowment. It may be well-intentioned, but I also \npoint out that if this is so good, why is this opposed by the very \nagencies that would supposedly benefit from this? The National Assembly \nof State Arts Agencies is opposed to this amendment. That organization \nbelieves that the current distribution between Federal and State is \nappropriate.\n  So, again, while it may sound good to give all this money to the \nStates, the fact is, the Chamber Music of America in New York came to \nIowa and lived there for 2 years in our small towns and communities. It \nmay have looked like a grant to New York, but it was run by the \nNational Endowment for the Arts. If you give all this money to the \nStates, if New York got all this money, would they then of their own \nvolition fund the chamber music program that we had in Iowa for 2 \nyears? As I said before, I doubt it, and I don't think Texas would \neither.\n  For those reasons, this amendment should be defeated. I am told also, \nand I have a letter from the White House--I will just read it:\n\n       The administration understands that an amendment may be \n     offered to increase significantly block grants to the States, \n     thus severely diminishing the Federal leadership role of the \n     NEA. In addition, the administration understands that an \n     amendment may be offered making it administratively \n     impossible for NEA to carry out its function.\n\n  That's the 5-percent cap.\n\n       If such amendments were adopted, the President's senior \n     advisers would recommend that the President veto the bill.\n\n  I believe this bill is too important to be vetoed. I believe the NEA \nis too important to be cut up, segmented and destroyed by this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2 minutes 50 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would like to reserve the last \nminute of the debate, so I will take my time up until the last minute \nand then yield to the Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I would like to respond to the remarks of the Senator \nfrom Iowa and say that it is most certainly not my intention to do away \nwith our national commitment to the arts. In fact, the opposite is \ntrue. That is why I keep the funding level because I do believe that \nall of our children will gain from having more access to and \nappreciation of the arts in our country. I want the budding artists of \nIowa to have equal access to the education that budding artists in New \nYork have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, let me just say that we have a lot of \nbudding artists in Iowa, a lot of them musicians. I can tell you, when \nthe Chamber Music of America came out and spent 2 years in our small \ntowns, it was wonderful. These wonderful artists went to these small \ntowns. They got these kids excited about music and about chamber music. \nI can't tell you how many hundreds of Iowa kids, I say to the Senator \nfrom Texas, were enthused and got involved in music and are progressing \nnow because of that.\n  That would not have happened without the National Endowment for the \nArts. It just simply could not have been funded by the State and \nwouldn't have been, and I don't think the State of Texas would have \nfunded it either.\n  Yes, there are a lot of budding artists out there, and that is why we \nneed a national program to reach out to these budding artists.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Jonathan \nKatz, CEO of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, be printed \nin the Record, in which he says they are opposed to this amendment and \nthat they are endorsing the current distribution of agency funds.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                              National Assembly of\n\n\n                                          State Arts Agencies,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 1997.\n     Hon. Ralph Regula,\n     Chairman, Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Regula: As you consider the resources \n     available to the National Endowment for the Arts, I thought \n     it might be helpful for you to have at hand the principles \n     advocated by the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies \n     (NASAA) on behalf of the state and special jurisdiction arts \n     agencies of the United States. These are attached.\n       Consistent with these principles, at the current funding \n     level of $99.5 million, the state arts agencies endorse the \n     current distribution of agency funds that enables the NEA to \n     demonstrate appropriate national leadership and also enables \n     it to support the leadership roles that state arts agencies \n     play. As the principles note, the state arts agencies do \n     support a higher level of funding for the agency overall \n     because that would enable more Americans in more communities \n     to enjoy the arts in more meaningful ways.\n       Please feel free to contact me if additional information \n     would be helpful to your office. Your support of public \n     funding for the arts and humanities is very much appreciated.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jonathan Katz,\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from \nAmericans United to Save the Arts and Humanities be printed in the \nRecord. They also say they endorse the present distribution of moneys.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                          Americans United To Save\n\n\n                                      the Arts and Humanities,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: Americans United to Save the Arts and \n     Humanities is a 501(c)(3) bi-partisan advocacy organization. \n     Our mission is to preserve federal funding for the National \n     Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the \n     Humanities. Americans United represents over 100 U.S. \n     business leaders from across the country who strongly support \n     federal funding for the arts and humanities Endowments.\n\n[[Page S9535]]\n\n       As you know, these agencies, particularly the National \n     Endowment for the Arts, have recently come under heavy \n     attack. The House has proposed eliminating the NEA entirely.\n       Imagine how such a loss would impact the economic activity \n     currently stimulated by the non-profit arts industry. As it \n     is, the non-profit arts industry generates $36.8 billion \n     annually in economic activity; supports 1.3 million jobs; and \n     produces $790 million in local government revenue and $1.2 \n     billion in state revenue. For every dollar the NEA invests in \n     communities, there is a twenty-fold return in jobs, services \n     and contracts. That is wise federal investing of taxpayer \n     dollars.\n       The members of Americans United feel strongly that the NEA \n     and NEH are agencies well worth continued federal funding. \n     Recently, Americans United business leaders sent the attached \n     letter to Senator Lott urging him to preserve federal funding \n     for our nation's cultural Endowments.\n       We hope that when the issue of funding for the NEA and NEH \n     comes to the Senate Floor for a vote, and subsequently goes \n     to Conference Committee, you will support our nation's \n     culture and heritage and ask your colleagues to preserve \n     current levels of federal funding for the Endowments without \n     crippling block grants.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard J. Franke,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           American United to Save\n\n\n                                      the Arts and Humanities,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 1997.\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lott: As business executives, we want you to \n     know how strongly we support continued federal funding of the \n     NEA and the NEH. While we recognize the tight constraints of \n     the federal budget, it is evident that there is a clear \n     connection between the federal investment in culture and the \n     willingness of corporations, foundations and individuals to \n     support cultural activity. Grants from the NEA and NEH are \n     required to be matched with private money. A ``seal of \n     approval'' from the Endowments demonstrates that a proposal \n     has passed a rigorous evaluation--a review that many \n     corporations and foundations do not have the expertise to \n     make themselves, and one which they take into serious \n     consideration as they make their own funding decisions.\n       Business supports the arts and the humanities for many \n     important reasons. A vigorous cultural life enhances our \n     communities, improves the imaginative and creative ability of \n     our employees, and spurs economic activity. The strength of \n     the cultural sector of our economy, generating $36.8 billion \n     annually in economic activity, supporting 1.3 million jobs, \n     producing $790 million in local taxes and $1.2 billion in \n     state taxes, is a direct result of the successful role of the \n     Endowments in fostering a broad range of cultural initiatives \n     over the last 30 years. As much as business values and \n     supports the arts and the humanities, the unfortunate reality \n     is that the corporate world can not replace the critical role \n     of the NEA and the NEH in evaluating and fostering cultural \n     initiatives. However, as business leaders we are very much \n     aware that the explosion of interest in American culture \n     worldwide is a key element of our competitive position in the \n     new global economy.\n       From the beginning, it has been the role of the Endowments \n     to encourage cultural programs of both local and national \n     importance. The proposal to fund the arts and humanities \n     through block grants to the states would severely limit the \n     cultural impact of federal dollars dedicated to cultural \n     projects. For example, performances and exhibits which travel \n     widely across state boundaries, often to rural areas and \n     small cities, would be that much more difficult to develop \n     and coordinate.\n       As the issue of federal funding for the NEA and NEH \n     progresses to the Senate Floor and the Conference Committee, \n     we urge you to recognize the enormous good accomplished by \n     relatively few, yet vital dollars by protecting federal \n     funding and a strong federal role for the National Endowment \n     for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.\n           Sincerely,\n         Members of Americans United to Save the Arts and \n           Humanities.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the U.S. \nConference of Mayors be printed in the Record. I won't read it all, but \nit says:\n\n       We need to maintain our federal commitment to preserve this \n     country's rich cultural heritage and traditions and to \n     nurture imagination and creatively to strengthen the future \n     of this country.\n\n  Again, in support of the distribution of funds that are in the bill, \nfrom the U.S. Conference of Mayors.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 The United States\n\n\n                                         Conference of Mayors,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1997.\n     President William Clinton,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Newt Gingrich,\n     Speaker of the House,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, Mr. Speaker and Mr. Majority Leader: \n     The United States Conference of Mayors joins leaders \n     throughout this country on Arts Advocacy Day to urge you to \n     support public funding for the arts and humanities at a level \n     that fulfills the federal government's responsibility to help \n     make the arts accessible to all Americans for the social, \n     economic and cultural well-being of the American public.\n       As we prepare to enter the new Millennium, we see the arts \n     and humanities serve as an essential and forceful vehicle to \n     educate our citizens, help our struggling youth, spur \n     economic growth in our communities, and bring us together as \n     a nation. We need to maintain our federal commitment to \n     preserve this country's rich cultural heritage and traditions \n     and to nurture imagination and creativity to strengthen the \n     future of this country. As mayors of communities of every \n     size and in every corner of America, we can tell you first \n     hand that the arts are critical to the quality of life and \n     livability of our cities.\n       In partnership with the $99.5 million federal investment \n     that the NEA made in our nation's cultural initiatives this \n     year (representing a 40% cut), the mayors invested $650 \n     million in local government funds and the governors invested \n     $275.4 million in state government funds for the arts through \n     our local and state arts agencies. However, this delicate \n     balance in shared responsibility of public support for the \n     arts is in serious jeopardy now. Congress cannot expect state \n     and local governments or the private sector to make up for \n     the cuts in the federal government's share.\n       Therefore, we call upon you to oppose the elimination or \n     phase-out of our federal cultural agencies and to oppose any \n     further reductions of their budgets. We further urge you to \n     maintain your federal longterm commitment to our nation's \n     cultural resources in communities large and small.\n           Sincerely yours,\n         Richard M. Daley, Mayor, Chicago, USCM President; Paul \n           Helmke, Mayor, Fort Wayne, USCM Vice Pres.; Deedee \n           Corradinl, Mayor, Salt Lake City, Chair, Advisory Bd., \n           Marc H. Morial, Mayor, New Orleans, Chair, Arts \n           Committee.\n\nUnanimously Adopted Policy Resolution at the 65th Annual Conference of \n                Mayors, San Francisco, CA, June 24, 1997\n\n\n         federal funding for the arts, humanities, and museums\n\n       (1) Whereas, the arts, humanities and museums are critical \n     to the quality of life and livability of America's cities; \n     and\n       (2) Whereas, the National Endowment for the Arts' and the \n     National Endowment for the Humanities' thirty plus years of \n     promoting cultural heritage and vitality throughout the \n     nation has built a cultural infrastructure in this nation of \n     arts and humanities agencies in every state and 3,800 local \n     arts agencies in cities throughout the country; and\n       (3) Whereas, the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA), \n     National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the Office \n     of Museum Services (OMS) within the Institute of Museum and \n     Library Services (IMLS) are the primary federal agencies that \n     provide federal funding for the arts, humanities and museum \n     programs, activities, and efforts in the cities and states of \n     America; and\n       (4) Whereas, federal funding serves as a catalyst to \n     leverage additional dollars for cultural activity--the annual \n     federal investment made to these three agencies (NEA @ $99.5 \n     million; NEH @ $110 million; and OMS @ $22 million) leverages \n     up to 12 times that amount from state and local governments, \n     private foundations, corporations and individuals in \n     communities across the nation to support the highest quality \n     cultural programs in the world; and\n       (5) Whereas, federal funding for cultural activities \n     stimulates local economies and improves the quality of civic \n     life throughout the country--the NEA, NEH and IMLS support \n     programs that enhance community development, promote cultural \n     planning, stimulate business development, spur urban renewal, \n     attract new businesses, draw significant cultural tourism \n     dollars, and improve the overall quality of life in our \n     cities and towns; and\n       (6) Whereas, the nonprofit arts industry generates $36.8 \n     billion annually in economic activity and supports 1.3 \n     million jobs--from large urban to small rural communities, \n     the nonprofit arts industry annually returns $3.4 billion in \n     federal income taxes, $1.2 billion in state government \n     revenue and $790 million in local government revenue; and\n       (7) Whereas, federal arts funding to cities, towns and \n     states has helped stimulate the growth of 3,800 local arts \n     agencies in America's cities and counties and $650 million \n     annually in local government funding to the arts and \n     humanities; and\n       (8) Whereas, federal funding for cultural activities is \n     essential to promote full access to and participation in \n     exhibits, performances, arts education and other cultural \n     events regardless of geography and family income; and\n       (9) Whereas, the NEA is in a highly precarious position \n     since this agency has been unduly politicized and has \n     incurred a disproportionate 39 percent cut in federal funding \n     in fiscal year 1996--bringing its budget down to 1977 \n     levels--and Congress has targeted this\n\n[[Page S9536]]\n\n     agency for complete elimination this year; and\n       (10) Whereas, last year's draconian cuts to the NEA's and \n     NEH's budget are beginning to have a serious negative effect \n     on the cultural infrastructure and survival of arts and \n     humanities institutions, arts organizations, artists, and \n     cultural programming at the national, state and local level; \n     and\n       (11) Whereas, the delicate balance in shared responsibility \n     and partnership for public funding of the arts and humanities \n     at the federal, state and local government levels is now in \n     serious jeopardy since local governments cannot make up for \n     the current and future funding cuts in the federal \n     government's share, now, therefore, be it,\n       (12) Resolved, That the United States Conference of Mayors \n     reaffirms its support of the National Endowment for the Arts, \n     National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Office of \n     Museum Services within the Institute of Museum and Library \n     Services and calls upon Congress to fund these agencies at \n     the President's FY '98 request level in order to fulfill the \n     federal government's responsibility to help make the arts \n     accessible to all Americans for the social, economic and \n     cultural well-being of the American public, as well as to \n     help sustain this nation's cultural infrastructure for public \n     support of the arts and humanities at the federal, state and \n     local levels, be it further\n       (13) Resolved, That the United States Conference of Mayors \n     calls upon the President and Congress to reauthorize the NEA \n     and NEH and to oppose any attempts to eliminate or phase-out \n     our federal cultural agencies; to oppose reducing their \n     budgets; to oppose mandating that all funds be blockgranted \n     to the states; and to allow local arts agencies to subgrant \n     federal grants.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Senator from Texas may say she wants \nto preserve and keep the National Endowment for the Arts, but this \nreally is a stealth amendment. This is the stealth amendment that will \nkill the NEA. It will do great damage to a lot of our small States like \nIowa, States that may not have a lot of money. We have a lot of budding \nartists, and we need the national commitment to the arts program to \nensure that these young poets and these young writers and these young \nmusicians and these young painters and these young artisans know that \nthere is a national commitment and they have the kind of support and \nthe kind of encouragement and the kind of role models that they need to \nencourage them in their efforts.\n  No, Mr. President, this stealth amendment would do drastic damage to \nthe NEA. It would kill the NEA, and we cannot afford to do that. I urge \nits rejection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Has all time expired other than my 1 minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That's correct.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, America's strength comes from its grassroots. It isn't \nGovernment that provides the spirit of America; it is the grassroots. \nGovernment policy should strengthen the people to establish their \npriorities, and that's what my amendment does. It strengthens the \nStates to create more access and more appreciation and more education \nin the arts for all the children of America. I believe that our local \ncontrol of education allows reading through phonics. I believe in old \nmath so that we learn our multiplication tables in addition to how to \nwork a computer and a calculator. I also think as basic to that is to \nlet our children have access to the arts so that they can produce \nworld-class art and arts appreciation. It shows that it is part of our \nbasic education that we would have a national priority.\n  Mr. President, my amendment keeps the national commitment to the \narts, and it keeps the control in the grassroots and the heartland of \nAmerica. I think it is the best balance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

It is the Sense of the Senate that, inasmuch as \n     there is disagreement as to what extent, if any, Federal \n     funding for the arts is appropriate, and what modifications \n     to the mechanism for such funding may be necessary; and \n     further, inasmuch as there is a role for the private sector \n     to supplement the federal, state and local partnership in \n     support of the arts, hearings should be conducted and \n     legislation addressing these issues should be brought before \n     the full Senate for debate and passage during this Congress.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

I think this \nis a very responsible approach to take. I urge our colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  There are a lot of ideas out here about how we might create a true \nendowment rather than going through this process year in and year out. \nWe are politicizing this issue to an extent I don't think it deserves. \nWe truly ought to look for ways to resolve this matter intelligently.\n  I think a good set of hearings, examining various ideas on how to \nbest fund the Endowment for the future make a lot of sense. I urge our \ncolleagues to support this suggestion and try to come together and see \nif we cannot get beyond this amendment process we go through each and \nevery year which I don't think serves our interests well, regardless of \none's perspective on how we ought to fund the National Endowment for \nthe Arts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1219) was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to lay it on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the majority leader and I, and I think \nmost Members, do wish to complete action on this bill today.\n  At this point, I know of three or four rather hotly contested \namendments: One by Mr. Hutchinson, the Senator from Arkansas, on \nAmerican heritage rivers; the possibility of one on immigration reform \nthat is, of course, not particularly germane to this bill, by the \nSenator from Florida, Mr. Mack; an Indian gambling amendment by \nSenators Enzi and Brownback; and one relating to money for gang \nsuppression on Indian reservations which would close down the Wilson \nCenter here.\n  I hope we could move forward on each of these promptly. I note that \nthe Senator from Arkansas is present. Perhaps his amendment can be put \nup next. We would seek a time agreement on it. I don't believe the \nother side is ready to agree to a time agreement yet. Perhaps the best \nthing to do is let the Senator from Arkansas introduce his amendment, \nspeak to it, and as he speaks to it and others are concerned about it, \nwe can see whether or not a time agreement can be reached.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Just briefly, I have been consulting with a number of my \ncolleagues who are concerned about the amendment. I think they are \nprepared to come to the floor. I know the distinguished Senator from \nConnecticut is here and is prepared to respond to the statements and \narguments made by the Senator from Arkansas.\n  We are prepared to enter into a time agreement, if perhaps we can \nwork one out in the not too distant future.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n       Excepted Committee Amendment Beginning on Page 96, line 18\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, what is the committee amendment to which \nall of these National Endowment for the Arts amendments--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I believe we are in a position to which we \ncan adopt that committee amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on that \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the committee amendment.\n  The excepted committee amendment beginning on Page 96, line 18, was \nagreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1196\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I call up amendment number 1196.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 1196, previously proposed by the Senator from \n     Arkansas [Mr. Hutchinson].\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of September 16, \n1997.)\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the following \nSenators be added to the amendment as cosponsors: Senator Shelby, \nSenator Gordon Smith, Senator Allard, and Senator Kempthorne.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment that \nI think supports one of our most fundamental rights, the right of \nproperty ownership. The fundamental right, I believe, is at least \neroded, threatened, by the Executive order signed by the President on \nSeptember 11. I am sure it is a well-intended Executive order, \ndesignating the American heritage rivers initiative. The initiative is \nintended, in the words of the President in his Executive order ``to \nhelp communities protect their river resources in a way that integrates \nnatural resource protection, economic development and the preservation \nof historic and cultural values, things that we all support.''\n  The difficulty is that we have an Executive order that, originating \nfrom the executive branch, has not gone through the committee process. \nIt has not received any congressional authorization, has not received \nany appropriation, but simply is something that has been ordered by the \nPresident. The funding for this initiative comes from eight Cabinet \ndepartments including the Department of Defense, Department of Justice, \nthe Department of Transportation, the Department of Agriculture, \nDepartment of Commerce, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Department of Interior, and the Department of Energy. In \naddition to all of the Cabinet departments, there is funding from a \nnumber of agencies as well: EPA, NEA, NEH, and the Advisory Council of \nHistoric Preservation.\n  The end result is funding from various departments and agencies apart \nfrom any congressional hearings, and apart from any congressional \nauthorization or appropriation.\n  I support riverfront revitalization but not at the expense of \ntrampling upon basic property rights and subverting plans and desires \nof local communities. I think riverfront revitalization should be \ncommunity-led and a community-driven process, not something that is \ndictated through an Executive order in Washington.\n  My amendment allows for the riverfront renaissance that communities \ndesperately need, while offering protections from further Federal \nencroachment. It allows the President's Executive order to go forward \nand it would allow the rivers initiative to go forward.\n  Congress has never authorized or appropriated one dime for the \nAmerican heritage rivers initiative, nor has it even defined the term \n``river community.'' The Executive order contains the term ``river \ncommunity'' without any kind of definition. This amendment would \nrequire congressional review of the 10 rivers that have been nominated \nfor designation. The Executive order lays out 10 rivers to be \ndesignated as American heritage rivers. We would simply say that when \nthose 10 rivers are designated, that Congress should have the right of \nreview and designation, confirmation of those designated rivers.\n  The amendment would require that all property owners holding title to \nlands directly abutting the riverbank shall be consulted and asked for \nletters of support or opposition to the designation.\n  Now, it has been wrongly conveyed by the opposition of this amendment \nthat somehow every property owner along the river would have veto power \nand that if any property owner objected to the designation or objected \nto participation in the heritage rivers initiative, that suddenly the \nwhole project would therefore be ended, or any possibility of receiving \nthat designation would be eliminated. That is not the case at all. We \nsimply believe that those most involved, those whose lives are going to \nbe most affected, the property owners along the river, would have the \nright to say yes or no. I think that makes perfect sense and that \nprocess is not guaranteed under the Executive order.\n  Let's ensure that they are notified and at least that they have the \nright of commenting and expressing their opinion.\n  In the amendment, we would define the river community as those who \nown property, reside, or who regularly conduct business within 10 miles \nof the\n\n[[Page S9538]]\n\nriver considered for designation. It is absolutely necessary for us to \nplace a definition as to what a river community is, and how it should \nbe defined.\n  The amendment would make the initiative subject to the existing \nprovisions of the Clean Water and Safety Drinking Water Acts. I hope \nthat would be supported by environmentalists. All of us are concerned \nabout the enforcement of environmental laws, and an Executive order \nthat will somehow be able to circumvent existing environmental law. The \namendment would ensure that this process, as it goes forward, would be \nsubject to existing provisions of the Clean Water Act and the Safe \nDrinking Water Act.\n  I agree we must revitalize our rivers and preserve their historic \ncharacter. This amendment ensures that it is not at the expense of \nthose who have chosen to be a part of the surrounding communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. We need to define \nriver community, we need to comply with existing environmental laws, \nand the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. We need to \nensure that property owners are notified that they have the right of \ncomment, that they have the right to write letters of opposition or \nsupport.\n  We need to provide in this Executive order for congressional review. \nIf there is one complaint I have heard from my constituents across the \nState of Arkansas, it is that, we as the elected representatives of the \npeople, too often have simply given up our legislative authority. We \nhave allowed the executive branch, through various Executive orders, to \nusurp what is legitimately and constitutionally our right and our \nresponsibility. This amendment represents one small area where we can \nsay that the President has issued an Executive order, and we now will \nensure that we have the right of review. This amendment would do that.\n  I think that we can once again assert our proper role by ensuring \nthat we can review the designation of the heritage rivers. Most \nimportantly, we would protect property owners from the encroachment of \nan ever-growing Government and an ever more intrusive bureaucracy. We \nwould ensure that the plans of the local communities are not subverted \nbecause of this new Executive order and that local communities, drive \nthe entire process. I believe the amendment is reasonable, it is \ntemperate, and it will reassure our citizens, our constituents, and \nthose along these important American heritage rivers, that we take \ntheir rights as property owners and citizens of this country and value \nthem greatly.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALLARD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment \nof my colleague, Senator Hutchinson from Arkansas. His amendment deals \nwith the American rivers heritage initiative. I should start off by \nemphasizing that his amendment does not stop the initiative, it does \nnot end it, and it does not hurt our rivers and their protection. This \namendment merely ensures that the Federal Government, based right here \nin Washington, DC, does not become the controlling authority of rivers \nthat have been used, cherished and developed by local communities all \naround this country, which, in some cases, the decisions made here in \nWashington may actually go against the wishes of the local community.\n  I raise the question, why is our President so afraid of having local \ninput into such an important process as the designation of our American \nrivers as heritage rivers?\n  This amendment ensures that the people who live alongside of a river \ncontinue to have a say in the future of that waterway. They are the \nvery ones who enjoy it for recreation, and they use it for commerce, \nand they actually own the private property on its banks.\n  This initiative lists the members that will be involved in a \ncommittee responsible for implementation. Each heritage river will have \na local bureaucrat that is going to sort of oversee the management of \nthe committee. There is going to be a committee superintendent. Look at \nthe members who serve on that committee. We have the Secretary of \nDefense, the Attorney General, Secretary of Energy, the Chair of the \nNEA, and the Secretary of HUD. These are all bright people, hard-\nworking people, I am sure; but how can they honestly know more about a \nriver, let's say, for example, that runs through Denver, CO--which is \nthe South Platte River--than those people who actually live in Colorado \nalong the South Platte, who actually know more about the seasonal \nimpact on this particular river? If they don't know more, why are they \nput in charge of future development of the river above and beyond local \ncontrol?\n  Nobody out West wants to come to Washington and try to tell people \nwho live along the Potomac how to control that particular river. Why \ndoes anybody want the administrators of these various agencies who live \nright here in Washington, DC, to have that type of control? And, \nfrankly, their knowledge of a river may be nothing more than their \nperception of what they see happening on the Potomac River during rush \nhour when they are sitting on the 14th Street Bridge.\n  So I do believe that the real expertise is back at the local \ncommunities, the people who live by and use the waters that we are \ntalking about in the heritage river designation. I know of one entity \nin Colorado that certainly doesn't believe the control should belong in \nWashington. They believe it should be back at the local level. That one \nentity happens to be the Denver Post, which recently released an \neditorial against the initiative, saying that common sense argues \nagainst the possibility that a Presidential appointee would know more \nabout the designated streams than those who live along its riverbanks. \nI happen to agree wholeheartedly with that editorial.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Sept. 14, 1997]\n\n                       Just Say No to Platte Plan\n\n       Colorado water watchers are eyeing President Clinton's \n     proposed Heritage Rivers project suspiciously, and with good \n     reason.\n       The plan would designate 10 American waterways as Heritage \n     Rivers, each to be run by a presidential appointee who would \n     coordinate local efforts with 13 federal agencies. Thus the \n     feds would become the rivers' bosses advising locals on where \n     to build parks and flood-control projects and setting \n     riverbed-cleanup priorities.\n       If this project is to do grand things for 10 American \n     rivers, then each river bosun and his crew of 13 would need \n     to know more about these streams than the people who live \n     along their banks, and common sense argues against the \n     possibility.\n       The South Platte, principal waterway of Colorado's \n     urbanized Front Range, is a candidate. Although once \n     exploited and neglected, the Platte is now flowing along \n     nicely, thank you, and that is because over the past century \n     Coloradans have figured out where to build those local parks \n     and flood control projects and set those cleanup priorities.\n       A look at the results bears this out. The Platte supplies \n     most of the Denver metro area's water. Its system of \n     reservoirs works well and provides flood control and \n     environmental safeguards. Platte River Greenway riverbed \n     rejuvenation has been a spectacular and continuing success, \n     with new parks to be built in Denver this year. In short, the \n     South Platte is not a river at risk.\n       There is, of course, plenty left to be done. Denver Mayor \n     Wellington Webb envisions the Platte as a showpiece among \n     urban waterfronts. He has supported the Heritage program and \n     pushed Denver as a candidate for more federal support. But \n     how much support the Heritage project might produce isn't \n     clear. No funds have been allocated, and no one knows where \n     its budget will come from.\n       The Colorado Water Congress, a coalition of cities, \n     counties, conservancy districts, farmers and other water \n     users warns that its fuzzy goals could upset the delicate \n     balance of water regulation between states and even upstream \n     and downstream towns, spawning a tangle of interagency \n     conflicts.\n       With a little luck, the South Platte might not be one of \n     the chosen ten. If it is, Colorado should decline on grounds \n     that it ain't broke, so don't fix it.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, along with the problem of allowing the \nFederal Government unchecked control of local rivers, there are several \nother problems with this initiative. I am worried about the lack of a \nrequirement stating that only affected individuals and organizations \ncan apply for designation. Senator Hutchinson's amendment puts limits \non what designates a river community and allows for the actual \ninterests of those who would be affected to be considered. It\n\n[[Page S9539]]\n\nrequires the opinions of property owners affected to be considered--\nsomething the administration obviously does not feel concerned about.\n  There has been a long trend in this country of slowly cutting away \nthe rights of private property owners. The administration's latest end-\nrun around the Congress--the establishment of this initiative--without \ncongressional authorization or appropriation, and the lack of a \nguarantee as to what constitutes a local community, and the lack of \ninput from the affected property owners in this initiative, is merely \nanother power grab of the Federal Government at the expense of local \ngovernment, local communities, and local property owners.\n  A vote for this amendment will be a step in the right direction. And \nI, again, would like to compliment my colleague in the Senate for \nstepping forward and addressing this issue. I am proud to be a \ncosponsor of his initiative.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the amendment proposed by the Senator from \nArkansas is a most interesting one. I think it is one that I am very \nlikely to support. There is, however, some opposition on each side of \nthe aisle. So we have been unable to reach any kind of agreement on a \ntime limit on it. A number of my friends on the other side of the aisle \ndo wish to speak to it. They are not here at the present time, so I \nwill suggest the absence of a quorum. I also suggest that there are \nother amendments on which time agreements may be relatively easy to \nreach. On this one it can't be reached. If the Senator from Arizona, \n[Mr. Kyl], is within hearing, I would appreciate taking up his \namendment as soon as possible. The same thing holds true for the senior \nSenator from Arkansas, who has one on which there might well be a time \nagreement.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise, with all due respect to my colleague \nfrom Arkansas, in opposition to his amendment. I say to my colleagues \nhere, with all due respect, my colleague is certainly one who has \nadvocated in the past that we ought to try to remove or eliminate as \nmuch bureaucracy as possible. I think he is joined in those sentiments \nby most of us here in Congress, that we ought to be trying to not \noverburden a process but trying to streamline it as much as possible.\n  I commend President Clinton for coming up with a very innovative and \ncreative idea on how we might highlight the importance of our river \nsystem in the United States. This program of designation of 10 great \nrivers in the United States, I think, has great value. It is something \nthat is community driven, rather than something coming from Washington.\n  Let me just share with my colleagues how this would work. First of \nall, there are no mandates or regulations involved in this at all. In \nfact, it must be supported by the congressional delegations, the \ncommunities involved, and it is very explicit as to how this process \nwould work. The amendment being offered by our colleague from Arkansas \nwould require communities to go through additional layers of Government \napproval before a river could be designated an American heritage river.\n  Just to give you an example, those of us in the New England area are \nunited--in New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, and Connecticut. We \nhave all come together in a delegation--the communities, the States--\nrequesting that the Connecticut River be one of those designated \nrivers. Very explicitly, if that support in the delegation from the \nGovernors in the communities along the river is not present then that \nriver is not going to be selected. It has been felt very, very \nimportant that there be community-driven, community-based support for \nthese efforts. And if it is nonexistent, the designation doesn't \nhappen.\n  Some of my colleagues may not want that designation. I can tell you \ncategorically that if the Senators in those States do not want the \nrivers in their States, be it Colorado, or in Arkansas, then it won't \nhappen. You don't have to worry about that. Nothing is going to be \nfoisted on any State here that is not supported by the communities.\n  What we are suggesting here is that we in the New England States \nwould like one of these rivers. In all due respect, I don't think it \nwould be fair for me in this kind of a situation to be suggesting as a \nSenator from Connecticut that the people of Arkansas or Colorado, or \nany other State, ought to be denied that designation if they feel they \nvery much like to see the Arkansas River or the Colorado River \ndesignated as one of these great rivers, with no regulations, no \nmandates, no money involved in it. It merely takes existing resources \nand tries to manage them in a way that the people at the local level \nwould like to see them designated and to enhance the cultural, the \neconomic, and environmental issues that they feel are very important.\n  I can tell you categorically that in my part of the country one of \nthe problems that has happened over the years is that too much of our \ndevelopment has occurred right on the river denying people access to \nthe river. One of the wonderful things about this city--our Capital \nCity--that I appreciate every morning as I come to the Capitol is you \ncan actually watch people on the banks of the Potomac River enjoying \nthe river. For too many of our cities, of course, we saw the highway \nsystems, and so forth, be developed between a city and its river. There \nis a great interest now in this country to try to restore, if you will, \nthe vitality of these rivers--to see if we can't come up with ways to \nrecognize the importance of them.\n  Again, the requirement that our colleague from Arkansas adds here \nwould delay the initiative designed to provide prompt assistance to \ncommunity-led efforts. After communities submit nomination packets to \nthe administration, the President selects rivers for designation. The \nCouncil on Environmental Quality would have to forward these \nnominations to Congress which must provide approval. However, the \namendment, as outlined, no process, or deadline, for congressional \naction would be required then to get approval basically of almost every \nsingle property owner. Imagine getting approval from the Connecticut \nRiver States, from the Canadian border on down to the Long Island \nSound, of every private property owner in New Hampshire, Vermont, \nMassachusetts, and Connecticut. It would kill it. Why not have an \namendment to eliminate it altogether? That might make more sense than \nmaking people go through a process that just kills it by bureaucracy. \nWhy not have an amendment that would say this amendment ought to be \neliminated? If that were the case, I would disagree with it. I would \noppose it. But at least it would be clear. The intent here, by \nestablishing a very lengthy process that would deny these community-\ndriven programs, I think, would be a huge mistake.\n  Let me also point out that there are no additional dollars involved \nhere at all in what has been suggested, and no new regulations, or \nchanges in existing law. The American Heritage Rivers Initiative does \nnot change the existing prioritization process for the Clean Water Act, \nthe Safe Drinking Water Act, or any other applicable Federal law. Given \nthat the American heritage rivers initiative imposes no new \nregulations, any activity undertaken to designate rivers would \nnaturally abide by the laws governing priorities of the Clean Water Act \nand the Safe Drinking Water Act, and other Federal laws.\n\n  State and local reviews: Any projects identified in a communities-\nnomination packet must undergo applicable State and local review \nprocesses. Property owners are key at this stage of the review. I can \nsay categorically that they are involved now in our New England area \nwith the Connecticut River. We pulled together the support. We have \nsolicited opinions from our local communities to get behind this \neffort. Obviously, local property owners have a more than adequate way \nof expressing their feelings about whether or not we ought to be going \nforward. There is strong feeling, in our area anyway, that this is a \nprocess that we approve of. We support fully and strongly that it ought \nto be included.\n\n[[Page S9540]]\n\n  As I said earlier, if delegations don't want rivers in their States \nto be included in this competition, if you will, to designate 10 \nrivers, then that is it. You are out. Don't worry about it. There is no \nway in the world that you are going to be included in this.\n  So, if the Colorado River wants to be excluded from the process, I \ncan categorically tell you that it will be out--or the Arkansas River. \nIf anyone stands up here today and votes for this amendment, I promise \nyou that you won't be included. You are out. Don't worry about it. But \nfor those of us who would like this designation, who feel strongly \nabout it in a bipartisan way, who believe that there is something of \nvalue here in trying to restore our rivers, to give attention to them, \nto appreciate the value of them historically, environmentally, \neconomically, we would like this designation. We think it will help us, \nand our local communities want it. They support it.\n  Frankly, to go through a long morass of bureaucracy, and going \nthrough one agency after another, coming back and getting approval, \nhaving every single property owner express their view one way or the \nother, this is just killing it--choking it to death.\n  So my hope is that our colleagues here would oppose this amendment. \nAgain, this has broad-based and community-based support in the country, \nand I think has great value in terms of those of us who care deeply \nabout seeing these rivers restored.\n  I can tell you. I live on the Connecticut River. I have my office on \nthe Connecticut River. In fact, it is a better Connecticut River. I can \nremember the days only a few years ago when the thought of swimming in \nthat river, or fishing out of that river, or eating any fish out of the \nriver, was unheard of. Today it has come back because there have been \ngreat local efforts to restore the vitality of that river. The salmon \nare coming back. The Connecticut River shad are back.\n  Dartmouth, in New Hampshire, and the University of Massachusetts all \nunderstand the value of this. Our communities of Hartford and \nMiddletown in Connecticut, and Springfield, MA, all believe that this \nis a very worthwhile project, and are solidly behind it.\n  It is not just one river. But I can tell you also that it is highly \ncompetitive. I know my colleague from New York, Senator D'Amato, is \ndeeply interested in the Hudson River. And great support exists in that \nState for the designation. I know the same case exists across the \ncountry. I think it is a healthy process that communities and States \nare going through.\n  To add to the regulatory burden here by requiring, as this amendment \nwould, a tremendous effort to get some designation here where there is \napparently opposition within those States, I would say to those people \nthat you need not worry about it.\n  In fact, for those of us who would like to designate and realize that \nit is highly competitive, maybe we ought to realize it the way it is \nhere. If we get a good vote, we can eliminate a lot of rivers from \nbeing designated. Because I can clearly tell you, if Members vote for \nthis, that is going to be a pretty strong case for those of us who want \nthe designation--that Senators who vote for this, those rivers ought to \nbe excluded from this process; and that we will just go with the \ncolleagues here who come from States that represent rivers that would \nlike to have this designation.\n\n  This is no money regulation. There are no regulations, no mandates, \nno money. It is community-based, community-driven, and community-\nsupported.\n  And, if you are opposed, if you are not included, why in the world do \nwe go through a process here where we require Congress to come up and \nsupport or deny and elongate things? It basically kills this. This is \nmaking a huge mountain, if you will, out of a trickle, in a sense. This \nis not that big a deal except to the extent that it allows for these \nrivers to be designated as important natural resources that our States \nwould like to protect and preserve for future generations. That is all \nit really is, and no more than that.\n  To come up here and suggest somehow that this is some great big \nFederal program is dictating to local communities somehow denying them \nthe process of making decisions about their own futures along these \nrivers is just not the case.\n  So, Mr. President, I urge our colleagues here, with all due respect, \nto reject this amendment when the time arises.\n  I note my colleague from Rhode Island wanted to be heard on this. I \nwill be glad to yield to him, or seek his own time.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Arkansas would \nlike to say a few words. Would he? If not, I will proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I am going to do something that I think is highly irregular. I \nearlier asked unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with. But after reading the letter that came from the Sierra \nClub, and a number the other organizations, and after listening to the \ncomments of my esteemed colleague, and my good friend, Senator Dodd, I \nreally think that it is essential that the amendment be read.\n  So I am going to proceed to do that. It is very brief. But I think \nthe American people, whenever my colleague says there is some great \nmorass, that we are adding some great regulatory burden--there are some \nI guess that would say democracy is a great regulatory burden; to ask \npeople to have some input on whether or not as property owners they \nwant to be part of this, that it is a terrible burden, I guess; but \nthat it is a big process to ask Congress to use its proper role in \nreview. I mean, when we look at wild and scenic rivers, we review that. \nWe have the right to make a determination on that.\n  I would like to read the amendment. I think we can perhaps better \nfocus our debate when we understand exactly what is in the amendment.\n\n                  American Heritage Rivers Initiative\n\n       During fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal year thereafter, \n     the President and other officers of the executive branch may \n     implement the American Heritage Rivers Initiative under \n     Executive Order 13061 only in accordance with this section.\n       Nominations.--The President, acting through the Chair of \n     the Council on Environmental Quality, shall submit to \n     Congress nominations of the 10 rivers that are proposed for \n     designation as American Heritage Rivers.\n\n  It doesn't exclude any rivers. The President, acting through his \nchair of the Council on Environmental Quality, will submit the \nnominations.\n\n       Prioritization.--The nominations shall be subject to the \n     prioritization process established by the Clean Water Act, \n     and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n  The point there being that we ought to comply with existing law, and \nthat if we were going to prioritize these rivers it should be on the \nbasis of where the greatest need is as determined by the Clean Water \nAct and the Safe Drinking Water Act.\n\n       Consultation with Property Owners.--\n\n  I used to wonder why the American people would object to this \namendment.\n\n       To ensure the protection of private property owners along a \n     river proposed for nomination. All property owners holding \n     title to land directly abutting riverbank shall be consulted \n     and asked to offer letters of support for or opposition to \n     the nomination.\n\n  I suppose that is a great burden--to notify the property owners, and \nlet them express themselves pro or con. But I think that is what \nAmerica is about. I think that avoiding that kind of process is what \nthe American property owners today, the landowners of this country, so \nobject to.\n  Consultation of property owners; that is No. 3.\n\n       Designation.--The American Heritage Rivers Initiative may \n     be implemented only with respect to rivers that are \n     designated as American Heritage Rivers by act of Congress.\n\n  That goes back to our review process.\n  Then the definition of river communities, which was totally omitted \nin the Executive order.\n\n       Definition of River Community.--For the purposes of the \n     American Heritage Rivers Initiative, as used in Executive \n     Order 13061, the term ``river community'' shall include all \n     persons that own property, reside, or regularly conduct \n     business within 10 miles of the river.\n\n  Without that definition, someone in another State could nominate a \nriver in Arkansas, or Connecticut, or Rhode Island. Or somebody in \nWashington State could nominate--I mean we have\n\n[[Page S9541]]\n\nto have some kind of definition as to what we mean. We are filling that \nvoid through this amendment.\n  That is the entire amendment. I have read it all, every word of it. \nSo let the American people determine whether or not there is something \nso objectionable as has been characterized by those who are opposing \nthe amendment.\n  I have much more to say. But that was the point of my seeking \nrecognition--to simply read the amendment for the American people, and \nfor my colleagues in the U.S. Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, to respond to my colleague from Arkansas--I \nknow my colleague from Rhode Island wants to be heard--my colleague \nmust be aware--I presume he is--of how the process works. The \nsuggestion somehow that this process excludes local property owners \nfrom expressing their opinions is just not the case. In fact, it is \nvery, very clear, as laid out by the Executive order, how the process \nwould work. Certainly local input and people expressing their views, \nwhether or not they are in favor or opposed to this, is very much a \npart of the process here.\n  This is complicating it by mandating through law. The implication \nhere obviously is that Congress is going to make the decision as to \nwhether or not these rivers in various areas are going to be designated \nso you have a vote of 51 to 49 picking this river or that. We are \ntrying to avoid that, to keep the politics out of it.\n  If you go back and look at how it works, it requires that there be \nlocal input and approval and support at the local level. That is the \nwhole idea. Obviously, to have Washington sit here and pick 10 rivers, \nwe don't know whether you want to be designated. So this is entirely \nsuperfluous. The process exists right now that requires that effort. \nSupport from local communities is all through the Executive order from \nthe administration as to how this would work.\n  My point is, if that is the case, if that is what we are doing, it \nrequires that input. To all of a sudden say we are going to have here a \nlaw that makes us go through congressional hearings and looking at all \nof this I think just is making more out of this than has to be the \ncase.\n  Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, I rise today because I believe the amendment \nbefore us is simply another thinly veiled attempt to attack the \nPresident's American Heritage River Program and to prevent any American \nriver from participating in this innovative initiative.\n\n  Rivers have always been an integral part of our Nation's history, and \nthroughout Virginia and across the United States activities are already \nunderway to enhance the economic, historic, cultural, recreational, and \nenvironmental value of our rivers. Local government officials, \nconservationists, and riverfront developers, however, have complained \nthat they cannot figure out which Federal programs they can use to pay \nfor their redevelopment and river restoration projects or how to make \ntheir way through the red-tape. The American Heritage Rivers Program is \ndesigned to lend a hand of assistance to these community-led waterfront \nprojects. The program will assist localities in gaining access to \nexisting Federal resources and will help bring their plans to life.\n  Mr. President, the American Heritage Rivers Program is voluntary and \nlocally driven. This is a citizens-up effort to revitalize our hometown \nrivers. Communities will nominate outstanding stretches of America's \nrivers and 10 rivers will be rewarded special recognition. Each \nAmerican heritage river will have access to a river navigator, a full-\ntime liaison who is knowledgeable about the needs of the community and \nthe multitude of Federal agencies and programs that could help meet \ntheir needs. The river navigator will help cut redtape and match \npriorities identified by the community with the services of the Federal \nagencies. The river navigator, however, will not have any power over \nlocal decision-making.\n  The American Heritage Rivers Program is solely an effort to increase \nlocal access to Federal programs that affect rivers, not to increase \nFederal management or regulation of rivers. The Federal Government will \nonly respond directly to community needs.\n  Mr. President, the Federal Government has the authority and \nresponsibility to coordinate the use of its limited resources in the \nbest possible manner. If Federal agencies already have programs \nauthorized and appropriated by Congress that are relevant to preserving \nand revitalizing our rivers, then an initiative that will help to \nensure these services are delivered more effectively and efficiently is \nexactly what we need.\n  I'm not sure when this program became so misrepresented that \nindividuals suddenly began to fear that the implementation of the \nAmerican Heritage River Program would place an unprecedented Federal \nstranglehold on property owners. Today I heard the American Heritage \nRivers Program referred to as an aquatic assault on the American people \nlaunched by President Clinton. That 13 Federal agencies will \nparticipate in the takeover of our Nation's rivers and a Federal \nemployee will be appointed to control all land use and management \nactivities within the designated area.\n  My only guess is these fears are rooted in a general distrust of \nanything that mentions the involvement of the Federal Government. But, \nin this instance, I find this distrust and these fears unwarranted.\n  The American Heritage Rivers Program simply promises to make a better \nuse of existing sources of Federal assistance and will only coordinate \nthe delivery of those services in a manner designed by the community. \nAnd communities can terminate their participation at any time.\n  Mr. President, the sponsor of this amendment says his constituents \nwant a community-led process that will make the right decisions for \ntheir particular community, not a federally dominated process that \ncould dictate to property owners how they can use their land. If that \nis what the people of Arkansas want, then that is exactly what the \nAmerican Heritage River Program has to offer. But, Senator Hutchinson's \namendment does not improve the American Heritage River Program, it only \ninterferes with the President's initiative.\n  This amendment would add unnecessary delays and burdensome \nrequirements to an initiative designed to streamline Federal assistance \nto community-led efforts. This amendment would even allow Members of \nCongress to block designations in other regions of the country, where \ncommunity and congressional support are strong. Additional \ncongressional bureaucracy will only stifle these citizen-led efforts.\n  Right now in North Carolina, Maryland, and Virginia, our rivers are \nunder assault and the attack is by a cell from hell, a fishing-killing \nmicrobe called pfiesteria. We should be focusing our resources on \nfinding the source of this microorganism and ensuring our water bodies \nare safe for swimming and for fishing. We should not be considering \namendments that attack any new or innovative approaches to river \nprotection and revitalization. That's why Mr. President, I ask my \ncolleagues to support the citizens and communities from around the \ncountry who continue to express resounding support for the American \nHeritage River Program and to vote against the Hutchinson amendment \nwhich stands in their way to protect and revitalize their rivers.\n  I agree entirely with my colleagues from Connecticut and Rhode \nIsland, from whom we will hear in just a moment.\n  This was designed to simplify the process. As I listened to the \namendment actually read, it will complicate the process. It will add \nadditional burden to something that is entirely voluntary. There is no \nnew money; there are no new mandates; no applicable provision of \nFederal law is in any way disturbed. This is simply an attempt to help \ncommunities that want to enhance both their environment and their \nprospects for economic development to do so with the aid of a navigator \nwho will simply coordinate the assistance.\n  The Federal Government is already authorized to bring to bear on the \nproject. That is what the National heritage river initiative is all \nabout. I hope my colleagues will recognize that by adding a very \nsignificant regulatory burden you would very substantially undercut the \nprospects for the success of this particular initiative. It is entirely \nvoluntary. Anybody who does\n\n[[Page S9542]]\n\nnot want to be a part of it does not have to be a part of it.\n  In my own State of Virginia, there is enormous excitement by the \nbusiness community, by the environmentalists, by all who want to \npreserve and enhance our environment and who want to take advantage of \neconomic development that flows from it. I hope at the appropriate \ntime, Mr. President, our colleagues will vote against this particular \namendment. And with that I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, every so often we are put in a difficult \nsituation with amendments presented by somebody we have great affection \nand respect for, yet we are not in a position to agree with the \namendment. Such is the instance here where we are now wrestling with \nthe amendment presented by the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, \nwith whom I have had the privilege of working on the Environment \nCommittee and who is a very valuable member of that committee. Just \nyesterday we worked closely on a very major piece of legislation which \nunanimously came out of the committee, and part of the reason it was so \nsuccessful in the committee was because of the help from the Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  But I must say I think he is making a mountain out of a molehill \nhere, if you would. Maybe I ought to put it in river terms in some \nfashion. What occurred was in the State of the Union Address the \nPresident announced a plan to create initiatives designed to assist \ncommunities in their efforts to clean up and restore rivers and \nriverfront areas.\n  Last week, he signed an Executive order creating the American \nheritage rivers initiative. He had previously announced that he was \ngoing to do it and had used that term, American heritage rivers.\n  This amendment would, in my judgment, derail that designation and add \na whole series of complexities to it that I will touch on in a minute. \nSince the announcement of this initiative in the State of the Union \nAddress, communities along two major rivers in my State, the Blackstone \nRiver and the Woonasquatucket River, have been invigorated by the hope \nof gaining this designation. They have had rallies and gatherings, and \nI have had the privilege of attending some of those. I could not help \nbut think, when the President announced this initiative, that he was \ndescribing an ongoing project we have in our State. It is the so-called \nBlackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor which was created by \nlegislation that I authored some 10 years ago.\n  In my years as Governor and first few years in the Senate, I came to \nview the Blackstone River as a nearly impossible problem. Many years of \npollution from toxic substances had wiped out much of the wildlife \nalong the river, and there had been terrific economic change. What once \nwere great mills there had moved away or been abandoned and, indeed, it \nwas a languishing situation.\n  Once this designation was made, as a result of technical assistance \nand advice from the National Park Service, a modest investment of \nFederal funds, enormous commitment from the local communities, business \npeople, and residents, this whole area is experiencing a renaissance.\n\n  Today, community leaders from the Blackstone River Valley are sharing \nwhat they have learned with individuals from the other rivers, the \nWoonasquatucket, for example, and they are working together on an \napplication for designation as an American heritage river. They want \nthis designation. Individuals from the communities are writing the \nPresident, sharing their thoughts with him what the rivers mean to \nthem, and we know this is a competitive situation. I must say I didn't \nknow the whole Connecticut River was seeking it, and that is a powerful \naggregation. They are favored. It goes through, I guess, three or four \nStates--starting up on the Canadian border and coming down Vermont and \nNew Hampshire and Connecticut, Massachusetts. However, we are very \nanxious that our rivers, the Blackstone and the Woonasquatucket, taking \nthe two together, would receive this designation.\n  The question is this Executive order. I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of the President's Executive order be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Section (d) of the Executive order says the following. I \nthink this is important:\n\n       Agencies shall act with due regard for the protection of \n     private property provided by the Fifth Amendment to the \n     United States Constitution.\n\n  That is what it says. There is nothing in this Executive order that \ninterferes with the rights of individual property owners along the \nrivers. Nominations for this designation must come from the communities \nand have to be supported by a broad range of individuals. Once the \ndesignations are made, if a community finds it no longer wants to be an \nAmerican heritage river, it can opt out. They are not bound into this \nthing. It is a very modest program. They get a designation. They get \nsomebody from the Federal Government, one of the agencies that will \nhelp the communities along the river, do some things that will improve \nthe quality of life along the river, make the river a more attractive \nentity in their lives.\n  As I say, the Federal role in these areas is limited to supporting \ncommunity-based efforts to protect and restore the rivers. So I support \nthe President's plan to designate 10 rivers. I support the goals of the \ninitiative which are to protect natural resources, encourage economic \nrevitalization, and preserve historic and cultural treasures, and I \nvigorously support the efforts of the communities that I mentioned \nalong the Blackstone River which is part in Massachusetts and part in \nRhode Island, and the Woonasquatucket River to get this coveted \ndesignation.\n  I would like to close, Mr. President, by touching on the Senator's \namendment, but I want to underscore that applications for this \ndesignation have to come from the communities. This is not some \nPresident in Washington reaching out and saying that this river is \ngoing to be an American heritage river. It can only come about through \nthe community seeking that designation. It has to have support from \nlocal residents. As I say, if they do not want to be in it any longer, \nthey can get out.\n  So for those reasons I reluctantly oppose the amendment of my \ndistinguished colleague from Arkansas.\n  The Senator from Arkansas read his amendment, and there are a couple \nof things in there that I find troublesome and I must say I am not \nquite sure what they mean. In the prioritization section, he says:\n\n       The nominations shall be subject to the prioritization \n     process established by the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act and other applicable law.\n  Now, it may well be, I suspect, that under the Clean Water Act the \nprioritization is those rivers that are what we call most unclean, if \nyou want to use that word, or the ones that are the most polluted. This \nis not geared solely toward a river cleanup in the sense of pollution \ncontrol. That, of course, comes under the Clean Water Act. The Senator \nis quite right; that is an important part of prioritization of the \nClean Water Act.\n\n  But this isn't the way, as I understand it, this act is to work. It \nisn't solely the President reaching out and saying we are going to \ndesignate the dirtiest rivers as American Heritage rivers because they \nneed the most help. There is very little financial help from the \nFederal Government, totally unlike the Clean Water Act where there are \nmassive grants, as the distinguished Senator knows, for wastewater \ntreatment facilities, either municipal or the law, of course, forces \nthe private companies that pollute in any fashion to clean up their \nact. That is not what this is designed for.\n  It goes on--and this is the point the Senator from Connecticut was \nmaking, that the provisions in this act really add a great layer of \nbureaucracy and red tape on top of what is an innocent process just \ngetting the designation.\n  Example:\n\n       Consultation With Property Owners.--\n       To ensure the protection of private property owners along \n     the rivers proposed for nomination, all--\n\n  All, every single--\n\n     property owners holding title to land directly abutting the \n     river shall be consulted.\n\n\n[[Page S9543]]\n\n\n  Now, this can go on forever, trying to find who is along the river. \nAre they a tenant? Do they own it? What proportion of ownership do we \nhave? In my State, we have factories that have been abandoned. They are \nowned by families that have disappeared. It is very hard to trace the \nownership and find out who exactly lives there and owns the property.\n  Then we get to definition of a river community, in which the Senator \nsays, ``For the purposes of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, as \nused in the Executive order, the term river community' shall include \nall persons that own property, reside or regularly conduct business \nwithin 10 miles of the river.''\n  Now, I am not sure what the Senator means by that, but that is an \nimpossible job, to bring in every person who lives within 10 miles of \nthe river--lives there, owns property, or regularly conducts business. \nI don't know what that means. Suppose I am a regular attendee at a \ncoffee shop along the river somewhere; I don't live within 10 miles, \nbut I have lunch every day at this coffee shop. Do I fall under the \nterm ``river community''?\n  So for those reasons, Mr. President--and again, I would be open to \nexplanation on this river community definition that the Senator \nincludes--I hope that this amendment will not be accepted.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Executive Order--Federal Support of Community Efforts Along American \n                            Heritage Rivers\n\n       By the authority vested in me as President by the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, \n     including the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n     (Public Law 91-190), and in order to protect and restore \n     rivers and their adjacent communities, it is hereby ordered \n     as follows:\n       Section 1. Policies.\n       (a) The American Heritage Rivers initiative has three \n     objectives: natural resource and environmental protection, \n     economic revitalization, and historic and cultural \n     preservation.\n       (b) Executive agencies (``agencies''), to the extent \n     permitted by law and consistent with their missions and \n     resources, shall coordinate Federal plans, functions, \n     programs, and resources to preserve, protect, and restore \n     rivers and their associated resources important to our \n     history, culture, and natural heritage.\n       (c) Agencies shall develop plans to bring increased \n     efficiencies to existing and authorized programs with goals \n     that are supportive of protection and restoration of \n     communities along rivers.\n       (d) In accordance with Executive Order 12630, agencies \n     shall act with due regard for the protection of private \n     property provided for by the Fifth Amendment to the United \n     States Constitution. No new regulatory authority is created \n     as a result of the American Heritage Rivers initiative. This \n     initiative will not interfere with matters of State, local, \n     and tribal government jurisdiction.\n       (e) In furtherance of these policies, the President will \n     designate rivers that meet certain criteria as ``American \n     Heritage Rivers.''\n       (f) It is the policy of the Federal Government that \n     communities shall nominate rivers as American Heritage Rivers \n     and the Federal role will be solely to support community-\n     based efforts to preserve, protect, and restore these rivers \n     and their communities.\n       (g) Agencies should, to the extent practicable, help \n     identify resources in the private and nonprofit sectors to \n     aid revitalization efforts.\n       (h) Agencies are encouraged, to the extent permitted by \n     law, to develop partnerships with State, local, and tribal \n     governments and community and nongovernmental organizations. \n     Agencies will be responsive to the diverse needs of different \n     kinds of communities from the core of our cities to remote \n     rural areas and shall seek to ensure that the role played by \n     the Federal Government is complementary to the plans and work \n     being carried out by State, local, and tribal governments. To \n     the extent possible, Federal resources will be strategically \n     directed to complement resources being spent by these \n     governments.\n       (i) Agencies shall establish a method for field offices to \n     assess the success of the American Heritage River initiative \n     and provide a means to recommend changes that will improve \n     the delivery and accessibility of Federal services and \n     programs. Agencies are directed, where appropriate, to reduce \n     and make more flexible procedural requirements and paperwork \n     related to providing assistance to communities along \n     designated rivers.\n       (j) Agencies shall commit to a policy under which they will \n     seek to ensure that their actions have a positive effect on \n     the natural, historic, economic, and cultural resources of \n     American Heritage River communities. The policy will require \n     agencies to consult with American Heritage River communities \n     early in the planning stages of Federal actions, take into \n     account the communities' goals and objectives and ensure that \n     actions are compatible with the overall character of these \n     communities. Agencies shall seek to ensure that their help \n     for one community does not adversely affect neighboring \n     communities. Additionally, agencies are encouraged to develop \n     formal and informal partnerships to assist communities. Local \n     Federal facilities, to the extent permitted by law and \n     consistent with the agencies' missions and resources, should \n     provide public access, physical space, technical assistance, \n     and other support for American Heritage River communities.\n       (k) In addition to providing support to designated rivers, \n     agencies will work together to provide information and \n     services to all communities seeking support.\n       Sec. 2. Process for Nominating an American Heritage River.\n       (a) Nomination. Communities, in coordination with their \n     State, local, or tribal governments, can nominate their \n     river, river stretch, or river confluence for designation as \n     an American Heritage River. When several communities are \n     involved in the nomination of the same river, nominations \n     will detail the coordination among the interested communities \n     and the role each will play in the process. Individuals \n     living outside the community may not nominate a river.\n       (b) Selection Criteria. Nominations will be judged based on \n     the following:\n       (1) the characteristics of the natural, economic, \n     agricultural, scenic, historic, cultural, or recreational \n     resources of the river that render it distinctive or unique;\n       (2) the effectiveness with which the community has defined \n     its plan of action and the extent to which the plan \n     addresses, either through planned actions or past \n     accomplishments, all three American Heritage Rivers \n     objectives, which are set forth in section 1(a) of this \n     order;\n       (3) the strength and diversity of community support for the \n     nomination as evidenced by letters from elected officials; \n     landowners; private citizens; businesses; and especially \n     State, local, and tribal governments. Broad community support \n     is essential to receiving the American Heritage River \n     designation; and\n       (4) willingness and capability of the community to forge \n     partnerships and agreements to implement their plan to meet \n     their goals and objectives.\n       (c) Recommendation Process.\n       The Chair of the Council on Environmental Quality (``CEQ'') \n     shall develop a fair and objective procedure to obtain the \n     views of a diverse group of experts for the purpose of making \n     recommendations to the President as to which rivers shall be \n     designated. These experts shall reflect a variety of \n     viewpoints, such as those representing natural, cultural, and \n     historic resources; scenic, environmental, and recreation \n     interests; tourism, transportation, and economic development \n     interests; and industries such as agriculture, hydropower, \n     manufacturing, mining, and forest management. The Chair of \n     the CEQ will ensure that the rivers recommended represent a \n     variety of stream sizes, diverse geographical locations, and \n     a wide range of settings from urban to rural and ensure that \n     relatively pristine, successful revitalization efforts are \n     considered as well as degraded rivers in need of restoration.\n       (d) Designation.\n       (1) The President will designate certain rivers as American \n     Heritage Rivers. Based on the receipt of a sufficient number \n     of qualified nominations, ten rivers will be designated in \n     the first phase of the initiative.\n       (2) The Interagency Committee provided for in section 3 of \n     this order shall develop a process by which any community \n     that nominates and has its river designated may have this \n     designation terminated at its request.\n       (3) Upon a determination by the Chair of the CEQ that a \n     community has failed to implement its plan, the Chair may \n     recommend to the President that a designation be revoked. The \n     Chair shall notify the community at least 30 days prior to \n     making such a recommendation to the President. Based on that \n     recommendation, the President may revoke the designation.\n       Sec. 3. Establishment of an Interagency Committee. There is \n     hereby established the American Heritage Rivers Interagency \n     Committee (``Committee''). The Committee shall have two co-\n     chairs. The Chair of the CEQ shall be a permanent co-chair. \n     The other co-chair will rotate among the heads of the \n     agencies listed below.\n       (a) The Committee shall be composed of the following \n     members or their designees at the Assistant Secretary level \n     or equivalent:\n       (1) The Secretary of Defense;\n       (2) The Attorney General;\n       (3) The Secretary of the Interior;\n       (4) The Secretary of Agriculture;\n       (5) The Secretary of Commerce;\n       (6) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development;\n       (7) The Secretary of Transportation;\n       (8) The Secretary of Energy;\n       (9) The Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency;\n       (10) The Chair of the Advisory Council on Historic \n     Preservation;\n       (11) The Chairperson of the National Endowment for the \n     Arts; and;\n       (12) The Chairperson of the National Endowment for the \n     Humanities.\n       The Chair of the CEQ may invite to participate in meetings \n     of the Committee, representatives of other agencies, as \n     appropriate.\n       (b) The Committee Shall:\n       (1) establish formal guidelines for designation as an \n     American Heritage River;\n\n[[Page S9544]]\n\n       (2) periodically review the actions of agencies in support \n     of the American Heritage Rivers;\n       (3) report to the President on the progress, \n     accomplishments, and effectiveness of the American Heritage \n     Rivers initiative; and\n       (4) perform other duties as directed by the Chair of the \n     CEQ.\n        Sec. 4. Responsibilities of the Federal Agencies. \n     Consistent with Title I of the National Environmental Policy \n     Act of 1969, agencies shall:\n       (a) identify their existing programs and plans that give \n     them the authority to offer assistance to communities \n     involved in river conservation and community health and \n     revitalization;\n       (b) to the extent practicable and permitted by law and \n     regulation, refocus programs, grants, and technical \n     assistance to provide support for communities adjacent to \n     American Heritage Rivers;\n       (c) identify all technical tools, including those developed \n     for purposes other than river conservation, that can be \n     applied to river protection, restoration, and community \n     revitalization;\n       (d) provide access to existing scientific data and \n     information to the extent permitted by law and consistent \n     with the agencies mission and resources;\n       (e) cooperate with State, local, and tribal governments and \n     communities with respect to their activities that take place \n     in, or affect the area around, an American Heritage River;\n       (f) commit to a policy, as set forth in section 1(j) of \n     this order, in making decisions affecting the quality of an \n     American Heritage River;\n       (g) select from among all the agencies a single individual \n     called the ``River Navigator,'' for each river that is \n     designated an American Heritage River, with whom the \n     communities can communicate goals and needs and who will \n     facilitate community-agency interchange;\n       (h) allow public access to the river, for agencies with \n     facilities along American Heritage Rivers, to the extent \n     practicable and consistent with their mission; and\n       (i) cooperate, as appropriate, with communities on projects \n     that protect or preserve stretches of the river that are on \n     Federal property or adjacent to a Federal facility.\n        Sec. 5. Responsibilities of the Committee and the Council \n     on Environmental Quality. The CEQ shall serve as Executive \n     agent for the Committee, and the CEQ and the Committee shall \n     ensure the implementation of the policies and purposes of \n     this initiative.\n        Sec. 6. Definition. For the purposes of this order, \n     Executive agency means any agency on the Committee and such \n     other agency as may be designated by the President.\n        Sec. 7. Judicial Review. This order does not create any \n     right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by \n     any party against the United States, its agencies or \n     instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other \n     person.\n                                                  William J. Clinton.  \n  The White House, September 11, 1997.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I find myself in the uncomfortable position of \noffering an amendment that is opposed by a chairman for whom I have the \ngreatest respect and greatest esteem and the highest regard. So it is \nwith that recognition that were I not so convinced of the merits of \nthis amendment, I would have to rethink its value and its submission.\n  When we talk about making a mountain out of a molehill, I think the \nopponents of this amendment are making a mountain out of a molehill. \nThis amendment has the simple purpose of protecting the rights of \nproperty owners and ensuring the input and participation of those most \naffected by these designations. It is not too much to think that \nCongress ought to ratify this designation, that Congress ought to have \na say or view in the designation of these rivers in what could be a \nvery, very broad program--eight cabinet departments, and four Federal \nagencies We have a process for the Wild and Scenic Rivers. Why not have \na say in the American heritage rivers initiative as well.\n  Now, my esteemed colleague said there is very little money involved. \nWe do not know. It has not been authorized, nor has it been \nappropriated. How much money is involved in this? Who can really give \nme an answer to that? There is no answer because we have eight cabinet \ndepartments and we have four Federal agencies, each one taking a little \nbit out of their pot. How much is involved? I would pose that question \nto those who are opposing this amendment. This has been presented as \njust a small initiative; that really we are making too much out of it \nand this is just a voluntary program. If it is a small program, we have \neight cabinet-level departments involved and four Federal agencies \nparticipating in it. That sounds like a rather major initiative to me.\n  If you will compare the simplicity of my three-page amendment to the \nlength of the Executive order, which has been submitted for the Record, \nI think one will see who is making a mountain out of what molehill.\n  Now, my esteemed colleague gave us some historical background as to \nhow this initiative came forward. Let me just amplify a little bit \nmore. The President officially announced this in his State of the Union \nAddress. It was published during the month of February in the Federal \nRegister, although it was not noticed to a great extent. Several public \nhearings apparently were held in the spring but congressional offices \nwere not uniformly notified of hearing dates. Equally troubling was the \nshort 3-week public comment period that was posted in the May 19 \nFederal Register. Because of the scope and the goals of the initiative \nand the magnitude of possible designations, I along with 15 of my \ncolleagues signed a letter to Kathleen McGinty, chair of the Council on \nEnvironmental Quality, asking for a 120-day extension.\n  That is all we asked for, extend the comment period. They gave 3 \nweeks for the public. This is being presented as, Well, we would \nwelcome all of those who are concerned about this to have adequate \ninput. The fact is, the administration gave 3 weeks for public comment, \nand we as the elected representatives of the people said, Please extend \nthat to 120 days. The administration only agreed to a mere 3 weeks. I \nthink that was a very inadequate response to a program that has never \nbeen authorized and never been appropriated.\n  As I read the letter that has been sent out to all of my colleagues \nfrom the American Rivers, from the National Audubon Society, National \nTrust for Historic Preservation, the River Network, and the Sierra \nClub, I hardly recognized the amendment of which they were speaking. \nThey outlined their objections to the Hutchinson amendment. They say \nthe Hutchinson amendment imposes ``unprecedented, onerous and \nunnecessary requirements.''\n  I read the amendment. So let the American people make their judgment \nas to whether that is an appropriate characterization of the amendment \nand whether asking Congress to approve, asking the property owners be \nnotified and given the opportunity to say yes or no to it, whether they \nlike it or not, if that is an onerous and unprecedented requirement.\n  Then they have four bullets in which they express their objections. \nListen to these objections. These are the objections of the American \nRivers, National Trust for Historic Preservation, Sierra Club, the \nNational Audubon Society, and the River Network. Objection No. 1, ``All \ndesignations would require congressional approval.'' Boy, that is \nsomething to object to, that Congress would actually approve it. They \nobject, ``The amendment would require all property owners along rivers \nto be identified and asked to support or oppose the nomination.'' Boy, \nthat is something to object to, to actually notify the property owners \nand give them an opportunity to say whether they support it or oppose \nit. This is the objection of these groups to this amendment. That is an \nonerous requirement, to notify property owners about this new \ndesignation that is going to impact their lives, impact their property, \nthe use of their property. They object, they say, ``The amendment would \nprohibit the initiative to assist nondesignated rivers.'' I don't see \nthat in the amendment.\n  Then they say, ``The amendment would create and impose on river \ncommunities a 20-mile-wide Federal corridor including all persons who \nown property, reside or regularly conduct business in the corridor.'' I \nsay to my distinguished colleague who questioned the definition, if you \ndon't like definition, give us a different definition. But at least \nthere is a definition of what a river community is. Because in the \nExecutive order there is no definition of what we are talking about \nwhen we say a river community. We thought there ought to be some kind \nof definition as to what a river community is, and the best way to \ndefine it is to designate those who are most impacted by it.\n  So, once again, I would never present any legislative offering that I \nam authoring as being a perfect legislative remedy. But I am suggesting \nthat there\n\n[[Page S9545]]\n\nis nothing intemperate or unreasonable about what we are seeking. We \nare seeking to ensure that private property rights are protected, that \nproperty owners have an opportunity for input, and that congressional \nreview and approval be preserved. That is our prerogative as those \nelected by our citizens.\n  Once again, if there is a mountain being made out of a molehill, it \nis those who would oppose a very commonsense amendment that would \nensure that those most impacted by another Federal initiative will have \ninput and have some protection for their rights and that those they \nelected to represent them up here would have a final say on whether \nthose rivers are so designated or not. I ask my colleagues to look \nbeyond the rhetoric and look at the reality of what this amendment \ndoes, the purpose of the amendment, and then grant their support for \nthe amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be relatively brief here. I gather \nthere are a couple of our colleagues who want to come over and be heard \non the amendment itself.\n  Let me suggest, first of all, to my colleagues here who have been \nfollowing this, there were more than 90 days of comment on the \ninitiative. In fact, as a result of that period of comment, there were \na number of important changes and clarifications to address some of the \nconcerns expressed regarding the initiative's implementation. I ask \nunanimous consent those changes be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material is ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Important Changes to the American Heritage Rivers Initiative as a \n                        Result of Public Comment\n\n       The goal of the American Heritage River initiative is to \n     support community-led efforts to spur economic \n     revitalization, protect natural resources and the \n     environment, and preserve historic and cultural heritage. \n     After more than 90 days of comment on the initiative, the \n     Administration made a number of important changes and \n     clarifications to address some of the concerns expressed \n     regarding the initiative's implementation.\n       The Administration is committed to ensuring that private \n     property rights, water rights, and other rights are fully \n     respected and protected under the American Heritage Rivers \n     initiative.\n       The American Heritage Rivers initiative will work in \n     coordination with laws and regulations that seek to reduce \n     pollution, improve water quality, protect drinking water, \n     manage floodplains, promote economic development, facilitate \n     interstate commerce, promote agriculture, protect wetlands \n     and endangered species, preserve important historic and \n     archaeological sites, and address other concerns.\n       The American Heritage Rivers initiative will not conflict \n     with matters of state and local government jurisdiction, such \n     as water rights, land use planning and water quality \n     standards, nor will it change interstate water compacts, \n     Indian tribal treaty rights, flood damage reduction, or other \n     existing rights. By achieving greater coordination between \n     programs and local needs, American Heritage Rivers will work \n     to build mutual understanding and better solutions to \n     existing and future problems. It will provide a forum in \n     which federal officials, community organizations, and other \n     stakeholders can examine how the range of regulations are \n     implemented locally.\n       Employees of the federal government, including the River \n     Navigator, may not as a result of the American Heritage \n     Rivers initiative infringe on the existing authority of local \n     governments to plan or control land use, or provide or \n     transfer authority over such land use; nor may the initiative \n     affect any existing limitations on or create any new \n     authorities for the participation of federal employees, \n     including River Navigators, in local zoning or land \n     management decisions involving private property.\n       The initiative will not supersede, abrogate, or otherwise \n     impair the authority of each state to allocate quantities of \n     water within its jurisdiction; and any proposal relating to \n     water rights in a community's plan must comport with all \n     applicable laws and interstate compacts. Nothing in this \n     initiative is meant to preclude any holder of a state water \n     right from exercising that right in a manner consistent with \n     state law.\n       In implementing the American Heritage Rivers initiative, \n     federal departments and agencies shall act with due regard \n     for the protections of private property provided by the Fifth \n     Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n       The American Heritage Rivers initiative is voluntary and \n     locally driven; communities choose to participate and can \n     terminate their participation at any time. Nominations must \n     come from the people who live and work along a river. Those \n     who rely on the resources but live outside the area may be \n     included in discussions about the plan of action, but may not \n     submit a nomination.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Furthermore, let me lay out how this works. This is not \njust sort of throwing this out. We are going to have some sort of \npolitical determination made regarding these 10 heritage rivers.\n  First of all, the administration stated that if a Senator or a Member \nof Congress opposes a designation in his or her State or district, the \ndesignation will not occur. That at least gives people an opportunity \nhere to express the wishes of their communities. So, today we will have \na vote on this. I presume that is the way people want to express how \nthey feel about this. If colleagues want to vote for the Hutchinson \namendment, the amendment of my colleague from Arkansas, that's a good \nindication of where you stand on this, and that can certainly narrow \ndown the process, I suppose, here. That would be, I presume, an \nexpression of how your constituency felt on this.\n  Second, the administration has proposed a panel of experts \nrepresenting economic development, including agriculture, natural \nresources, environmental protection, historic and cultural \npreservation, to review all the nominations and make recommendations to \nthe President. This would not only, I think, ensure a fair and \nobjective process, but guarantee the designations are made in a timely \nmanner. So it is not going to be made by one individual. You bring \ntogether people to determine what are the qualifications that ought to \nbe looked at. Certainly, some of the already existing Federal laws \nregarding clean water are very, very important. There are other \nconsiderations, and that ought to be a part of it.\n  Third, there must be broad-based support for this. In the nomination \npackage submitted, communities must show a broad base of support, \nincluding property owners, State, tribal, local governments, before \nthis package is going to be accepted.\n  Let me suggest here, by the way, that it spells it out. ``The \nadministration recommends that supporters should reflect''--I am \nreading here, now, ``the diversity of the community, including but not \nlimited to property owners, as appropriate, and as stated in the \nFederal Register notice they should include farmers, ranchers, \nlandowners, businesses and industries, education, arts organizations, \nyouth groups, community leaders, developers, community development \norganizations, historical societies, environmental groups and other \nnonprofit organizations, elected officials, State, tribal and local \ngovernments.'' You can't get much broader than that. You have to \ndemonstrate that kind of support.\n  Private property owners are an important element here. It is not \nlimited to that. If we are going to ask people to give comment out \nhere, certainly we are suggesting that ought to come from those people, \nbut there are other entities as well that are affected by it. \nBusinesses are affected by it. Universities are affected by it. \nCommunities are affected by it.\n  What the Register says here is get the comments from everybody here \nincluding private property owners. Does it say to get every single \nprivate property owner? No; that would be a nightmare. On the \nConnecticut River, 500 miles of river through four States and congested \nurban areas, are you going to get a comment from every private property \nowner? Why not kill the whole thing? That's the idea. Get rid of it. \nHave an amendment that says there should be no designation of 10 \nheritage rivers. That's a lot cleaner. But the idea somehow in four \nStates where we are applying--no guarantee we are going to be accepted; \nwe are for this in four States--the delegations are for it, the \ncommunities are for it, we have to go back now and go through 510 miles \non both sides of the Connecticut River, 10 miles on either side, and \nget comments from every single property owner, with all due respect, \nkills this.\n  There is a cleaner way of killing it; a cleaner way of killing it \nthan maiming this process and adding a huge bureaucracy where we go out \nnow, because we like this, and go through the next year or two where \nlocal communities, at some expense, are going out and getting comment \nfrom every single property owner. Talk about adding to the burden of a \nprocess. There is no\n\n[[Page S9546]]\n\nmandate here, no regulations, no money. Just a designated 10 rivers in \nthe country as being heritage rivers. Talk about adding to the cost of \nlocal taxpayers and communities--this amendment does that.\n\n  Here we require, the administration requires, broad-based comment. \nNominations may only be made--they may only be made by members of the \ncommunity. That is the only way this can occur. It doesn't occur \nbecause some Senator nominates it. It has to come from the community. \nThat is exactly the purpose and the intent here. So, the idea of going \nacross and saying we are going to exclude everyone else in the \nprocess--there are no new regulations or changes in existing law. The \nAmerican heritage rivers does not change the existing prioritization \nprocess for the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or any \nother preexisting law. Given that the American heritage river \ninitiative imposes no new regulations on any activities undertaken or \ndesignated on designated rivers, people would naturally abide by the \nlaw, obviously, in areas that are covered under those provisions of \nlaw. Any project identified in a community's nomination package must \nundergo applicable State, and local review processes. Property owners \nare key at this stage of the review. The administration believes such \nreview should remain a local issue and Federal agencies should assume \nno additional roles in what is a local decision.\n  In the nomination package, communities must demonstrate that members \nof the community have had an opportunity to comment and discuss the \nnominations and plan of action. That is required. When you submit your \npackage from a local community, you have to demonstrate you have gone \nout to the community and solicited the views of the people of your \ncommunity.\n  It even goes further, so it is not just a mayor or select person in \ntown, but it is actually that you have to demonstrate in the local \ncommunity you have solicited the comments and the views of people in \nthat community, including your private property owners.\n  In implementing the American heritage river initiative, Federal \ndepartments and agencies are required to act with due regard for the \nprotection of private property owners, provided by the fifth amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution, and as directed by Ronald Reagan, President \nReagan's 1988 Executive Order No. 12360.\n  I must say here, this has been pretty well thought out here, \nrequiring applications must come from the community. The community \nleaders must solicit the opinion of people in their communities. It \nalso solicits the views of others in addition to the private property \nowners along those rivers, but doesn't require every single one of \nthem, as does this amendment, as it insists. I read it to you. It says \nhere:\n  ``To ensure the protection of private property owners along a river \nproposed for nomination, all property owners''--I am reading now line \n17, 16 and 17--``all property owners holding title to land directly \nabutting river bank shall be consulted and asked to offer letters of \nsupport for or opposition to the nomination.''\n\n  All 510 miles of the Connecticut River? Along the Mississippi River, \nall property owners? Colorado River, all properties owners are required \nhere? It would be a nightmare. Why not just a simple amendment, ``There \nshall be no designation of American heritage rivers''? It is cleaner; \nup or down, yes or no.\n  What if in the process we go through this process by communities, by \ntowns all across the country going through this process, at great cost, \nand at the end we don't get designated, someone else does? I understand \nthat. But why make us go through all of this? Why not just say, ``We \ndon't like the program; get rid of it.''\n  As I said earlier, if people don't want this, if Members of Congress, \nthe delegation does not want it, believe me, you won't be included. It \nis simple, straightforward, guaranteed, no problem. If any Senators \nhere decide they don't want their States to be included, the rivers \nthat run through them, vote that way today and, believe me, the process \ngets thinner. Believe me, it gets thinner. Those of us in the New \nEngland States certainly feel that.\n\n  Senator Chafee of Rhode Island pointed out, on page 3, the definition \nof a river community:\n\n       For the purposes of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative \n     . . ., the term ``river community'' shall include all persons \n     that own property, reside or regularly conduct business \n     within 10 miles of the river.\n\n  I have almost 500 miles of Connecticut River, add 10 miles on either \nside of it and go up and down there, you add to my nightmare of \neveryone who abuts the river. Now I have to go 10 miles to either side. \nThis gets unbelievably cumbersome to try to do something as simple as \ndesignation of 10 heritage rivers--no mandates, no regulations, no \nmoney to try to manage it here and nothing can be done by a Federal \nagency that runs into opposition of local agencies and governments.\n  This has been well thought out, Mr. President, well thought out by a \npanel of people who will designate it. It is not going to be made by \nsomeone in the White House who picks out a river, but to try to see if \nwe can't come up with a group of people here who will make intelligent \nchoices about this.\n  This is really pretty straightforward. Again, I can tell you, and it \nmay differ from place to place in the country, but I gather it is \npretty competitive. We have people all across the country excited about \nthis.\n  We have had about six different meetings in my State. We invited the \nhead, the chief administrator, for the Environmental Protection Agency. \nWe had a huge crowd turn out expressing their support--the communities, \nthe business leaders--saying this is something we really want here.\n  Now to go back and say we have to get every single property owner for \n10 miles on either side on this thing to designate river communities, \nthis would be a great blow, I think, to millions of people in this \ncountry who would like to see their rivers restored, who like the fact \nthat there is a President in this country who has said we ought to pay \nattention to this.\n  Hopefully, this is just the beginning of a process where more rivers \ncan be designated in the future. I suspect we are going to have a lot \nof hurt feelings at the end of this process. We only have 10 that are \ngoing to be designated out of the entire country. But the fact that 10 \nwill be and maybe others can be to highlight the importance of these \nrivers, the communities and all the activities associated with it, I \nthink ought to be applauded. The fact that the administration has put \nin place a very deliberate, thoughtful process of where this should \nbegin, how it ought to be conducted, who makes the decisions, who is \ngoing to be consulted, I think is something that deserves applause, \nrather than coming up, as I say with all due respect, with an amendment \nthat would basically gut this process entirely and make it impossible \nfor millions of people across this country to celebrate their rivers \nand to try to restore them to the cultural, historic, economic, and \nenvironmental importance that they ought to have in this country.\n  For those reasons, at the appropriate time, I will offer a motion to \ntable this amendment and hope my colleagues will support it. I say that \nwith all due respect for my colleague from Arkansas. We have worked \ntogether on a number of different issues. I have great respect for him. \nI enjoy his company and service. I just have a fundamental disagreement \nwith what this amendment would do. I think it would be dangerous to \nwhat has otherwise been a very ennobling effort and one that ought to \nenjoy broad-based support here.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, with mutual respect for Senator Dodd's \nopposition to this amendment, three times my distinguished colleague \nhas suggested that a vote for the Hutchinson amendment will be a vote \nnot to participate in the American heritage rivers initiative. I assure \nmy colleagues, and I hope that Senator Dodd will join me in assuring my \ncolleagues, that this process is not so political that casting a vote \nfor an amendment designed to protect the private property owners would \nsomehow jeopardize later approval or selection as an American heritage \nriver. It is simply not the case.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield on that point, I will clarify it \nfor him.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Yes, I will yield.\n\n[[Page S9547]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. Any Member of Congress who wants to can object to their \nState being included and it will exclude that nomination. Obviously, \none can interpret a vote here.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Reclaiming my time, that, of course, is the case, but \na vote for the Hutchinson amendment is not, as it has been suggested, a \nvote against this initiative or a vote against having a river in your \nState participate in this program.\n  I think it gives the wrong appearance and the wrong suggestion for \nMembers of the Senate that somehow their vote on this amendment might \ninfluence whether or not rivers in their States would be selected and \nbe so designated.\n  There are many who came and asked me to sponsor an amendment similar \nto what was passed in the House in which funds were simply cut off for \nthis program. I resisted the desire to do that, because I didn't think \nthat the goals, as stated for the initiative, were bad, but I did \nbelieve that there needed to be some protections, and some assurances.\n\n  Senator Dodd says that this is somehow some backdoor way of killing \nthe program. Well, the House in effect did that. I resisted that \nbecause I didn't want to indicate I wasn't supportive of the goals of \nthe initiative. But I did believe that we needed to have a process that \nensured that it would guarantee the rights of private property owners \nalong these precious historic rivers would be protected.\n  It has been asserted that we have such a process in place. My \nconfidence in that process is somewhat shaken because of my experience \nwith the administration over this issue.\n  Fifteen U.S. Senators signed a letter asking for the comment period \nto be extended for 120 days, but we could not get the administration to \nhonor that request. Because our simple request was denied, I have a \nhard time accepting that the requests of average citizens would be \nhonored.\n  The process may look good on paper, but that is not the process in \nreality. If, in fact, there is such confidence that property owners are \ngoing to have input and those most affected are going to have adequate \ninput, then there shouldn't be any problem in accepting an amendment \nthat puts that assurance into statutory language.\n  The fact is, the process has been short-circuited. Those most \nimpacted and those most affected are not being given an opportunity to \nexpress themselves.\n  It has been suggested that this is a small program, voluntary \nprogram, no money involved. How can that be asserted? We don't know how \nmuch money is going to be spent. Nobody can tell me how much is going \nto be spent on this initiative because no one knows. There has been no \nauthorization. There has been no appropriation. We have eight Cabinet-\nlevel departments involved and four Federal agencies involved. Let's \nput that in the amendment, ``No money will be spent. We are going to \ndesignate these rivers and no money will be spent.'' No. We are not \ngoing to get that assurance because that is not the case.\n  How broad are the implications of this initiative? No one knows, \nbecause Congress has been cut out of the process, until this moment. An \nExecutive order, a short comment period, the process moves forward, and \nwhen one Senator dares to stand along with some colleagues who have had \nsome courage to cosponsor the amendment, suddenly we are imposing some \nterrible, onerous burden upon this program. Who objects to that? I \nbelieve this is why we were elected: to look at the executive branch, \nto rein in agencies that may go off without adequate public input and \nwithout a proper process. All we are doing in this amendment is \nassuring there is going to be such a process.\n  They say, ``Well, this is terrible to have to notify all the property \nowners.'' There are a lot of ways of notifying, and we have, both on \nthe State and Federal level. There are many different kinds of public \nnotification. You can do that through newspapers. You can do that \nthrough radio. You can do that through public service announcements. As \na former radio station owner, it was something we did that all the \ntime. It is common knowledge that newspapers give public notice all the \ntime.\n  It is important to ensure in statute that we are going to have public \nnotice to all property owners and that their input is desired. We want \nto know if you are for the initiative or against it, give us your \nideas. Give us your suggestions--that is not some kind of onerous \nburden. It is a fundamental part of freedom. It is part of liberty. It \nis part of the essence of a democratic republic. It is an asssurance to \nthe citizens of our country that they will have adequate input. It is \nnot to stand here on the floor of the U.S. Senate and say, ``Well, we \ncan't possibly notify everybody.'' We can and we should. The Amerian \npublic should know, and they have the right to give their thoughts and \ntheir suggestions on whether they are for it or they are against it.\n\n  If one is convinced that the property owners' input is going to be \nguaranteed under the current process, there surely should be no \nobjection to supporting this amendment and guaranteeing that they are \ngoing to have proper input. The fact is, we need to reassure the \ncitizens of this country that we in the U.S. Senate do take the rights \nof property owners seriously and that when we are going to designate \ntheir property, we are going to give it a title--we don't know what all \nthe implications of the American Heritage Rivers Initiative may be--it \nis incumbent upon us to guarantee that they are going to have the right \nto be involved in that process. That is what this amendment is about. \nLet's let them know. Let's let them have input. Let's let their elected \nofficials be able to make the final decision.\n  It is argued that for Congress to review and to approve the \ndesignations of these rivers is somehow to politicize the process. \nAnybody who has watched the executive branch operate over the last 4 \nyears--for that matter, I suspect you go could go back much further; I \nhave been in Congress since 1993--if you look back over those years, I \nthink it is very difficult to argue that designations and decisions \nbeing made in the executive branch are somehow nonpolitical.\n  If you wanted to depoliticize the process, bring it before the U.S. \nSenate, bring it before the House, bring it before the appropriate \ncommittees and let us ratify it. We do it all the time. We do it for \nthe wild and scenic rivers. This will allow Congress to have the same \nkind of input and the same kind of ratification process that we have on \nother programs.\n  No, that is not a bad thing; it is a good thing. It is a good thing \nto notify property owners, to ensure public input, to allow the elected \nrepresentatives of the people to have a say-so in these kinds of \nprograms. For many of us who have looked at the use of the Executive \norder over the last few years, we understand, we understand well, that \na nation that was built upon three equal branches of Government and a \nsystem of checks and balances. Too often the legislative branch has \nallowed our prerogatives to be usurped by an executive branch that \nwould just as soon govern by Executive order. Whether it is totally \nmeritorious or whether it may not be totally meritorious, we should \nhave a say in those kinds of decisions. Here is an area in which we, as \nthe legislative branch, can reassert our rightful constitutional \nauthority to review these decisions.\n  So I ask my colleagues to, once again, look at the actual language of \nthe amendment, look at the intent of the amendment, look beyond the \nrhetoric and support this very responsible, moderate, temperate \nprovision to ensure that the rights of our citizens are protected. I \nyield the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in strong opposition \nto this amendment, which would severely undermine the American heritage \nrivers initiative proposed by President Clinton in his State of the \nUnion Address this year.\n  Since the President's announcement, many communities across the \nNation, including impressive coalitions along the Connecticut River, \nBlackstone River, and Merrimack River in Massachusetts and New England, \nhave expressed their strong support for this new program. They \nrecognize it as an excellent opportunity to work in partnership with \nthe Federal Government to protect the environment and cultural \nresources that make each of these rivers a unique part of our history \nand heritage.\n  The initiative is designed to join the National Park Service's \ntechnical expertise with local decisionmaking, so\n\n[[Page S9548]]\n\nthat cities and towns across the country can decide how best to \nrevitalize their rivers and communities.\n  This amendment would impose a host of unnecessary Federal mandates \nthat would make it difficult for communities to nominate their rivers \nfor designation as American heritage rivers. It would be impossible to \ncarry out the program as President Clinton intended. The amendment \nwould dictate the size of each river corridor--requiring uniform \nboundaries with a 20-mile-wide span along each river--rather than \nallowing flexibility for local circumstances. It would require \nmandatory participation of each and every property owner within the 20-\nmile-wide boundary of the corridor, and upset the ongoing application \nprocess that many communities are pursuing in good faith to meet a \nDecember 10 deadline. It would also require congressional approval of \nthe President's selection of rivers, injecting politics into a \nnomination process that is currently based on merit.\n  This amendment is a frontal assault on the American heritage rivers \ninitiative. It would strip citizens of their ability to protect and \nrevitalize their rivers on their own terms, and give Congress the \nauthority to micromanage these important local efforts.\n  The American heritage rivers initiative has great potential, and has \nwon high praise from communities across the country. It makes no sense \nto change the ground rules of the game at this late stage, and I urge \nthe Senate to reject this amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for the last 2 weeks, we have seen \nfirsthand the threats facing our rivers. In Maryland and Virginia, \nrivers have been plagued with fish washing up along the banks with \nlesions. Although the State and Federal fish and wildlife agencies have \nnot been able to pinpoint the cause, I think we all can assume it is \nlinked to the health of these rivers. The President's American heritage \nrivers initiative was launched to identify those rivers which are \nfacing the greatest threats and assist communities revitalize the \nhealth of their backyard resources.\n  In Vermont, many of our rivers have already suffered such \nenvironmental harm that they can no longer sustain healthy fish \npopulations. Even in Vermont's first nationally designated wilderness \narea, the 16,000 acre Lye Brook wilderness of the Green Mountain \nNational Forest, streams are too toxic for fish. While the streams are \nremote from Vermont's population centers and industries, it stands \nsquare in the path of storms from the midwest, which carry pollutants \nthat puff out of coal-fired power plants and cause acid rain.\n  Although I would argue that Vermonters are the most environmentally \naware and involved citizens in the country, they cannot take on these \nenvironmental threats alone. The American heritage rivers initiative \nwill empower these communities to access Federal resources to help them \nprotect, preserve and develop their river resources. This is assistance \nVermonters have been asking for--assistance where the community \nidentifies the need, where the community controls the projects and \nwhere the community decides the outcome. This program is voluntary. \nThis program is grassroots.\n  Since the President announced this initiative, I have heard from \nVermonters up and down the Connecticut River asking me to nominate \ntheir river for this initiative. Although I whole-heartedly support the \nnomination of the Connecticut River, I told those communities that the \nnomination had to come from home, not from Washington. And this is as \nit should be. The nomination of the Connecticut has created a new \nenthusiasm for the Connecticut River in Vermont. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter I received \nthat demonstrates the widespread interest in nominating the Connecticut \nas part of this initiative.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 Connecticut River\n\n\n                                      Watershed Council, Inc.,\n\n                              Easthamption, MA, February 18, 1997.\n     Re ``Heritage River'' designation for the Connecticut River.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senator, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: In his ``State of the Union'' address, \n     President Clinton announced a national conservation \n     initiative of singular relevance to the Connecticut River. He \n     stated his intention to designate ten of the Nation's most \n     significant rivers as ``American Heritage Rivers.''\n       The Connecticut not only merits national recognition, but \n     it is the symbol of what a heritage river should be--an array \n     of extraordinary local conservation and economic development \n     actions that are bolstered and reinforced by government \n     resources and expertise. We ask for your support and active \n     efforts in Washington to see that the Connecticut is selected \n     as one of the Nation's ten Heritage Rivers.\n       Designation is intended to create a partnership between the \n     federal government and those who work at the local level to \n     protect and responsibly use river resources. It will not \n     bring federal regulation and mandates. Instead, it will \n     redirect federal resources and expertise to help Valley \n     residents safeguard our river environment, sustain and renew \n     our river communities, and preserve the historic and cultural \n     fabric of our river Valley. Individuals, communities, and \n     organizations already working in the watershed will define \n     the partnership and determine the support they want from the \n     federal government to aid us in conserving our river \n     resources and building the watershed economy.\n       The Watershed Council has put together a ``Connecticut \n     River Fact Sheet'' for you, detailing the many resources that \n     make the River special and worthy of heritage designation (a \n     copy is enclosed). Summarized, the top three reasons are:\n       1. The Connecticut is New England's longest river and \n     largest river system. The 410-mile river has a 11,260 square-\n     mile watershed that encompasses parts of four states--\n     Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont. \n     Besides its rich diversity of plants, animals, birds, fish \n     and other wildlife, the Connecticut supports recreation, \n     power generation, agriculture, and urban revitalization. It \n     provides 70% of Long Island Sound's freshwater. Its ``special \n     places'' include the Northern Forest at its headwaters, the \n     Connecticut River Macrosite below Hanover, NH, an \n     internationally recognized estuary wetland area below \n     Middletown, CT, and a host of significant historic, geologic \n     and cultural sites in the Valley.\n       2. The Connecticut River faces challenges that local and \n     state governments alone cannot resolve. The New England \n     Interstate Water Pollution Control Commission is about to \n     issue a report entitled ``The Health of the Watershed'' \n     detailing the water quality threats facing the River. \n     Problems that need attention include nonpoint source \n     pollution, toxins in fish, erosion, flow fluctuation, \n     combined sewer overflows (CSOs) and upgrading existing sewage \n     treatment plants.\n       3. There are willing local partners up and down the River \n     ready to work in partnership with the federal government. \n     There is a diverse network of nonprofit groups and local \n     agencies ready to take advantage of the opportunities and \n     resources that designation would bring to the Connecticut \n     River. These include nonprofit land trusts and local \n     conservation and historic preservation groups in each of the \n     four states; hydropower dam operators; the Great Falls \n     Discovery Center partnership in Turners Falls; the 13 \n     regional planning commissions in the Valley such as the North \n     Country Council, the Joint River Commissions, the Franklin \n     County and Pioneer Valley Planning Commissions, the \n     Connecticut River Assembly and the Gateway Commission; urban \n     revitalization efforts like Riverfront Recapture in Hartford \n     or the Springfield Economic Development Council; Hartford's \n     Metropolitan District Commission; and statewide and regional \n     conservation organizations like the Connecticut Chapter of \n     The Nature Conservancy, the Society for the Protection of New \n     Hampshire Forests, the Vermont Natural Resources Council, and \n     the Connecticut River Watershed Council.\n       For the Connecticut to shine in the company of rivers that \n     are already part of our national consciousness--the \n     Mississippi, the Columbia, the Rio Grande--we must all \n     champion its heritage nomination. Competition for this \n     national recognition and the allocation of scarce federal \n     resources it will mean will surely be fierce.\n       The decision on which rivers will be designated is expected \n     within the next 90 days, so time is of the essence. We urge \n     you to write to Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit this month to \n     express your support for selecting the Connecticut as a \n     heritage river. Secretary Babbit has visited the Valley \n     several times in the recent years and has spoken eloquently \n     about the Connecticut's natural and cultural values, so he \n     personally knows our River.\n       If you have further questions about the President's \n     American Heritage Rivers Initiative or need more information \n     about the Connecticut, please do not hesitate to have your \n     staff contact me. Meanwhile, the Council is already working \n     with a network of individuals, communities, and organizations \n     to gather the local nominations that will win the designation \n     for our River.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Whitty Sanford,\n                                     Associate Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. This widespread interest in the Connecticut River would \nnot be recognized by Senator Hutchinson's amendment. His amendment \nwould only define the ``river community'' as persons who live within 10 \nmiles of the river. The Connecticut River connects\n\n[[Page S9549]]\n\nfour States and supports a watershed of over 11,000 square miles. I \nwould argue that the river community stretches throughout this \nwatershed.\n  This amendment would also give priority to those rivers based on the \nClean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. Although I certainly \nagree that these laws should be key parts of the criteria, it overlooks \nthe other half of the President's initiative--economic revitalization. \nMany of our great American rivers were once the focus of our national \neconomy as the primary means of transportation and commerce. Much of \nthis role has been lost, but the economic link between communities and \nrivers has not. The Connecticut supports a rich agriculture community, \na recreation network and a renewed sportfishing industry. The economic \nimportance should also be recognized.\n  I support the President's interest in highlighting 10 rivers for \nrevitalization and hope that the program moves along quickly to bring \nour communities together around their rivers. I urge my colleagues to \ndefeat the Hutchinson amendment so that the program will not be bogged \ndown with unnecessary delay.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment offered by Senator Hutchinson that would have severe \nconsequences for President Clinton's American heritage rivers \ninitiative.\n  The American heritage rivers initiative is designed to support \ncommunity efforts on behalf of their own river resources and will help \nthese communities tell the rest of the Nation just how special their \nriver is. The Federal Government has a lot of expertise to offer to \nlocal communities on how to accomplish that goal, and we ought to be \nlooking for ways to share that wealth with communities who want it. I \nwanted to take a moment to explain why I think the initiative is the \nright way to accomplish these goals.\n  The initiative involves no new regulatory requirements for \nindividuals or State, tribal, and local governments. It is a voluntary, \ncommunity-defined effort that gives riverbank communities the option to \nwork in partnership with the Government to help cut redtape and match \ncommunity priorities with services provided by Federal agencies. The \ninitiative will allow communities to partner voluntarily with the \nFederal Government so that existing resources can be used more \neffectively. In this time of increasingly scarce funding, this is \ncertainly worth encouraging.\n  Individuals, communities, and organizations already working in the \nwatershed will define the partnership and determine the support they \nwant from the Federal Government to conserve river resources and build \nthe watershed economy. This initiative isn't a land grab by the Federal \nGovernment, or even a potential one. It is simply an effort to help \nsustain and renew river communities, and recognize the rich history and \ntremendous contributions of rivers to the Nation.\n  Second, safeguards are in place to ensure that the initiative will \nprotect the interests of river communities. Most importantly, \nnominations for designation as an American heritage river must come \nfrom the communities themselves. Unless a community wants an American \nheritage river, they don't have to have one. And there are \nopportunities to designate only stretches of river in case the local \ncommunities feel that designation of the entire river would be \nappropriate.\n  The nominations themselves must meet several criteria that \ndemonstrate designation is not going to interfere with anyone's \ninterests. For example, the nomination must have broad support from \nindividuals and organizations along the river. This means that a river \nwon't be designated unless it makes sense to the community--the people \nwho are closest to the resource and understand it best--that this \naction will be beneficial. Also, the nomination must show that the \ndifferent interests who live in the community--public, private, and \nlocal government groups--are willing to cooperate to protect the river.\n  Now what happens if a river receives an American heritage \ndesignation? The Federal Government simply makes a commitment to use \nexisting staff, resources and programs to assist river communities in \ntheir river restoration and community revitalization efforts. These are \nrelatively simple services but can be essential for local communities \nstruggling to gain the attention of the Federal Government. For \nexample, an Internet Home Page will be set up to provide communities \nwith information on river conditions and where to access other kinds of \ninformation important to the interests of the community such as \navailable grants, and where to get aerial photographs and advice from \nexperts. This kind of non-intrusive assistance will help to streamline \nthe bureaucracy that can be encountered when communities plan \ninitiatives to revitalize their surroundings. A commitment to a better-\nfunctioning government is in everyone's interests. In addition, this \nisn't a perpetual designation--any community may have this designation \nterminated at its request at any point in the future.\n  If a river receives the American heritage designation, the Federal \nGovernment agrees to act as a ``good neighbor'' to those communities \ninvolved. This means that the Federal Government will ensure that its \nactions have a positive effect on the natural, historical, economic, \nand cultural resources of the river communities. Agencies will be \nrequired to identify ways to inform local groups regarding Federal \nactions and must consult with American heritage river communities early \nin the planning stages of those actions to take into account the \ncommunities' goals and objectives. Communities also will be granted \ngreater flexibility to try out new and innovative approaches that \nsupport their needs. Reducing the bureaucratic obstacles communities \nface and committing the Government to plan around the communities' \nobjectives means that the Federal Government will be more responsive to \nthe needs of local areas--something we all want. The initiative will \nallow riverbank communities to build their watershed economy and \nconserve their river resources in better, smarter ways than might be \npossible currently.\n  In New England, communities along the Northeast's longest river and \nlargest river system--the Connecticut River--are sold on the American \nheritage rivers Initiative. The Connecticut traverses four States from \nits headwaters in New Hampshire to Long Island Sound and affects \nmillions of lives and livelihoods in the States through which it flows. \nUnfortunately, the Connecticut faces problems that State and local \ngovernments cannot resolve alone--run-off from lawn care and \nagricultural fertilizers and discharges from sewage treatment plants \npour into the river. Some fish contain unhealthful levels of toxins. \nSewers overflow into the river when it rains. A network of ready-and-\nwilling groups up and down the river want to work in partnership with \nthe Federal Government to help the Connecticut. These include State and \nlocal conservation and historic preservation groups, local businesses, \nhydropower dam operators, regional planning commissions, and urban \nrevitalization efforts. Designation of the river as an American \nheritage river would benefit every regional, state, and local effort to \npromote the Connecticut River Valley as a place of unmatched quality, \nwhere there is an opportunity to raise a family, expand a business, or \nspend a vacation.\n  Rivers are a cornerstone of this Nation's great history and define \nthe distinctive character of riverfront communities. Rivers are \nlifelines that rank among our greatest environmental, economic, and \nhuman resources. What we say and do in caring for all our rivers will \nsay to future generations not what we think about ourselves here in \n1997, but what we want the world to be for our grandchildren, and their \ngrandchildren. The American heritage rivers Initiative will help ensure \nthat our legacy to future generations reflects our commitment to work \ntogether to conserve and restore the environment, to protect cultural \nand historical resources, and to promote responsible economic \ndevelopment and tourism on our Nation's most important assets. The \ninitiative deserves out support. I urge opposition to Senator \nHutchinson's amendment.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition because I would \nlike to speak briefly on the introduction of legislation on campaign \nfinance reform and to submit my bill today\n\n[[Page S9550]]\n\nsince the bill is going to, apparently, be considered in some form by \nthe Senate next week.\n  I have consulted with the distinguished manager, Senator Gorton, who \nstated that it would be acceptable to him for me to take 10 minutes, \nand I consulted with Senator Enzi, who has been waiting to speak on \nanother matter, and I consulted with Senator Dodd, who may not be \nofficially in charge of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield for a point of information, Mr. \nPresident? Is this just to introduce some legislation? He is not asking \nfor any votes on any matter?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am just about to ask unanimous consent to proceed as \nif in morning business for the purpose of introducing legislation, but \nI wanted to state my purpose as to why I was seeking that time at this \nmoment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object if it \nis for the purpose of introducing legislation, as long as my colleagues \nare satisfied with this, I am as well.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank my colleague from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the introduction of S. 1191 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues. I yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1196, As Modified\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, in participating in this debate on the \nHutchinson amendment on the American heritage rivers initiative, and \nlistening to I think some very valid points that have been made by my \nesteemed colleague, I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment, and \nwould modify the amendment to read, on page 2, section (b), No. 3, \n``Consultation With Property Owners.--To ensure the protection of \nprivate property owners along a river proposed for nomination, the \ncomments of all property owners holding title to land directly abutting \nriver bank who wish to comment shall be considered.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nappreciate my colleague's efforts to modify this. I point out that it \nappears to me you have still got to go out and try to get the comments. \nBut, nonetheless, I appreciate the purpose behind his effort here, so I \nhave no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Will the Senator send the modification to the desk?\n  Mr. DODD. I would like to see a written version of this so we could \nhave it.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I will be glad to provide a written version.\n  The amendment (No. 1196), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 152, between lines 13 and 14, insert the following:\n\n             TITLE VII--AMERICAN HERITAGE RIVERS INITIATIVE\n\n     SEC. 701. AMERICAN HERITAGE RIVERS INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) In General.--During fiscal year 1998 and each fiscal \n     year thereafter, the President and other officers of the \n     executive branch may implement the American Heritage Rivers \n     Initiative under Executive Order 13061 (62 Fed. Reg. 48445) \n     only in accordance with this section.\n       (b) Designation by Congress.--\n       (1) Nominations.--The President, acting through the Chair \n     of the Council on Environmental Quality shall submit to \n     Congress nominations of the 10 rivers that are proposed for \n     designation as American Heritage Rivers.\n       (2) Prioritization.--The nominations shall be subject to \n     the prioritization process established by the Clear Water ACt \n     (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.), the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 300f et seq.), and other applicable Federal law.\n       (3) Consultation with property owners.--To ensure the \n     protection of private property owners along a river proposed \n     for nomination, the comments of all property owners holding \n     title to land directly abutting river bank who with to \n     comments shall be considered.\n       (3) Designation.--The American Heritage Rivers Initiative \n     may be implemented only with respect to rivers that are \n     designated as American Heritage Rivers by Act of Congress.\n       (c) Definition of River Community.--For the purposes of the \n     American Heritage Rivers Initiative, as used in Executive \n     Order 13061, the term ``river community'' shall include all \n     persons that own property, reside, or regularly conduct \n     business within 10 miles of the river.\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. My point in the amendment of course is to make \nCongress a partner in this process. And to the extent that this would \nbe difficult to implement, this change I hope will be helpful. I \nappreciate the Senator's indulgence.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe that most of the debate on this \namendment has been concluded. The Senator from New York [Mr. D'Amato], \nhas wanted to speak on it, on the same side as the Senator from \nConnecticut. He tells us that he can be available in about 10 minutes.\n  So on my own behalf, and on behalf of the majority leader, if, at the \nconclusion of Senator D'Amato's comments, debate seems to have been \nconcluded, it will be appropriate either to vote on the amendment \ndirectly or for the Senator from Connecticut to make a motion to table.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague would yield, I will inquire here and make \ncalls and see whether or not anyone else would like to be heard on the \namendment. If no one does want to be heard, I certainly have no \nobjection to going to a vote on this.\n  I would like to be able to comment myself at some point here on the \nmodification to the amendment that has been made by the author of the \namendment at some point here. That is why I want to see the writing, to \nmake sure I understand exactly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. DeWine). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me first of all say my opposition to \nmy colleague's amendment is difficult for me. I have the utmost respect \nfor him. We have a fine working relationship. Occasionally we have a \ndisagreement, as on this amendment. I know he feels very strongly about \nit.\n  My interests in the wilderness areas and the rivers of this country \ngo back to the time when I was Governor of the State of Arkansas. Long \nbefore Congress considered wilderness legislation, Arkansas was \nconsidering it. I must confess before God and everybody that my \nwilderness proposal was the only substantive legislation I lost or was \nunable to pass in my first term as Governor. It was considered a little \nbit of a radical concept.\n  Now, of course, we have millions and millions of acres in the \nnational forests and State forests set aside for wilderness areas. It \nwas a concept whose time had not come in 1971. I remember one \nlegislator said, ``Who wants a wilderness? If you want one, go grow \none.'' That is how shallow the thinking was about wilderness back then.\n  Fortunately, I was able to designate a few rivers as scenic rivers. I \nam pleased we were able to do that. I am a strong believer in \npreserving everything that has any aesthetic or cultural value.\n  Now, as I see this proposal, not my colleague's proposal, but as I \nsee what the President is proposing, I just do not understand, frankly, \nthe opposition. We have had some calls in our office suggesting that \nthis is a United Nations plot to take over private property. Well, I \nwouldn't be standing here saying that the President's idea is a good \none if I thought for a minute it was going to take people's property \naway from them, that there was some kind of cabal or conspiracy to do \nsuch a thing as that.\n  I guess that you could compare this to a scenic highway. In Arkansas \nwe designate scenic highways in our State. You know why we do that? To \nentice tourists to drive on those scenic highways. You drive a few \nmiles west of Washington, DC, and all you can see are signs saying \n``Scenic Highways.'' I have never heard any outcry from anybody in my \nState opposing scenic highways. We love them. They do wonders for the \nArkansas tourist industry.\n\n[[Page S9551]]\n\n  If I understand the proposal on the heritage rivers, it is designed \nso that the President would have to be told or he would have to be \nrequested by the people in the local community that they want to \ndeclare their river an American heritage river. If he did it, it would \nbe an honorary designation more than anything else. The only time any \nFederal resources would be committed to it would be if the local \ncommunity decided that they wanted to start a new project along the \nriver, as we have done in Little Rock, AR, with a beautiful new park.\n  In 1972, I attended a Southern Governors' Conference in Austin, TX. \nWe always have a big dinner at the close of those things. Lady Bird \nJohnson was my seatmate at dinner. I had never met her before. She is a \nvery gracious, charming woman. The Lady Bird Johnson Park out here is a \nreal tribute to her. She told me, ``Governor Bumpers, I was in Little \nRock about 2 weeks ago and I was staying in a brandnew hotel. I looked \nout my window toward the river and there was the county jail and a sand \nand gravel operation.'' She said, ``I believe that Little Rock is the \nonly city in the world on a major river that doesn't have a riverfront \npark that utilizes the beauty of the river and builds on the beauty of \nthat river.''\n  I came back and reported that to the city fathers in Little Rock. It \nwas rather embarrassing when she brought it to my attention. To make a \nlong story short, we now have one of the most magnificent riverfront \nparks in Little Rock, AR, today, of any State in the Nation. We have a \nweek-long Riverfest festival which everybody in Arkansas takes great \npride in.\n\n  There is nothing underhanded or sinister in this proposal. The \nPresident is not asking for legislative authority. He is simply saying, \nif the community of Little Rock came to him and said, ``We want this \nriver in our State declared an American heritage river,'' he could \nproclaim it, like giving them a plaque. Everybody in this body has \n1,000 plaques. What is wrong with that, providing recognition to \naesthetic values in this rather meager way?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Very briefly, my colleague from New York is here and I will \nyield to him, but I want to make a quick comment on the modification \noffered by our colleague from Arkansas to his amendment.\n  Certainly, while I appreciate the attempt here to lessen the burden \nof contacting every single person and property owner of this amendment, \nstill I respectfully suggest that it has some major flaws.\n  No. 1, it still suggests that Congress knows better about the wishes \nof local communities. We have a fundamental disagreement about that. As \nmy colleague, Senator Bumpers, said--and I am confident my colleague \nfrom New York will agree--this is community originated. The idea that \nwe would have the say over what our local communities want is contrary \nto the steps we have taken in the last few years. We have tried to \nstrengthen our local communities in almost every process.\n  No. 2, the consultation process suggests here that only private \nproperty owners be consulted for comment here. Obviously there are a \nlot of other interests here that would want to comment, beyond private \nproperty owners. What is suggested by the Executive order, you get \nbroad-based comments, including private property owners. And if we \nadopt this language, the argument is you exclude in the process these \nother people.\n  No. 3, the amendment says that we ought to define ``river \ncommunities'' as those that are 10 miles on either side; yet to make a \ncase, if we exclude them from commenting here, as the amendment does by \nimplication here, that, in my view, would be a mistake.\n  Last, this amendment, underlying it all, presumes that the program is \nintended to be some large, costly bureaucratic effort. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. It is anything but that. It is designed to be \njust the opposite of that, to be a community-based effort here to \nrecognize and designate the importance of the great rivers of this \ncountry.\n  Certainly I appreciate that there are those who get concerned when \nthey hear about Washington wanting to help, their abundance of good \nhumor about Washington wanting to help. In this case, that is exactly \nwhat it is. It has been a wonderful inspiration, Mr. President, to see \nthe communities come together all along these rivers and, in multi-\nStates, sort of competing in a healthy way to be designated one of the \n10 heritage rivers.\n  As I said at the conclusion of my earlier remarks, we ought to be \napplauding this. This is a worthwhile effort here. There is nothing \nsinister about it. There is nothing underhanded, no secret agenda, no \nmandates, regulations, or dollars associated with this in any way. Yet \nI suggest here, by this amendment, when you start reading it, I can see \nsomeone saying, ``Look, I wish to comment on this, but I didn't get a \nchance to comment,'' and you are in a lawsuit before you know it \nbecause we have adopted laws here that say that anyone who wishes to \ncomment ought to be able to comment.\n  Once you start doing that, you are inviting people to suggest \notherwise--``I wasn't heard,'' ``I should have heard,'' ``I wish to \ncomment, you didn't give me a chance.'' I don't think we want to go \ndown that road.\n  With all due respect to my colleague from Arkansas, I know my \ncolleague from New York, when he completes his remarks, will move to \ntable this amendment. I will join him in that motion and urge my \ncolleagues to support us in that effort.\n  I thank Senator D'Amato and Senator Bumpers for their leadership and \nhope we can reject this amendment and by doing so recognize the \nimportant effort that the President has undertaken as he did in \nmentioning this effort in the State of the Union Message.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, first of all, let me say, as well-\nintentioned as the legislation of the Senator from Arkansas is, I \nbelieve it presents a number of obstacles. I think while there are \nthose of us who are concerned with respect to undue Federal intrusion, \nthat is not so in the American Heritage Rivers Program because it is a \nprogram that by its very implementation must take place through the \ninitiatives of the local communities.\n  This is not a question where the President or Washington or Big \nBrother designates a river and says, ``I want this river to be in the \nprogram.'' This program comes about as a result of the initiatives of \nthe State and local governments.\n  For example, in New York, Governor Pataki has recommended that the \nHudson River be one of those rivers that applies for designation. \nIndeed, they have. Not only has the request come from the State, but it \nreally has come as a result of dozens and dozens of communities and \ncommunity groups along the Hudson River petitioning to be part of this \nprocess, that will help ongoing initiatives including the Hudson River \nEstuary Management Program, the Hudson River Greenway Program, local \nwaterfront revitalization programs. Again, dozens of communities and \ncities want to be part of this process.\n  The fact is that the State is ready to spend, along with this and \nlocal initiatives, some $75 million on the Hudson River.\n  What we are talking about is enhanced services to deliver the kind of \nupgrading that will bring an improvement of services to the people on \nthe river. If this amendment were enacted, we might well see an entire \nprogram that is ready for implementation and that involves local \ninitiatives thwarted, only because the initiative is a voluntary \nprogram that is locally driven and community based.\n  Now, some of the requirements that this legislation would bring about \nwould have the effect of denying access to and tying up the process. To \nnotify property owners in a 10-mile area and take comment--and I see my \ncolleague says that is not necessary; maybe he would like to address \nthat--but the burdens placed upon implementation, and the fact we get \ninto this process of having to designate raises concerns. Would \nCongress have to designate 10 rivers annually? And should that really \nbe the province of Congress, to say which of these rivers should be \npart of this program? Now, I believe in the separation of powers. I \nthink it is absolutely essential. But I am wondering how we would go \nabout that. Really, shouldn't it be the State and local governments \npetitioning the executive branch and having various requirements that \nthey must meet? And, of\n\n[[Page S9552]]\n\ncourse, we may or may not agree with the selection modality. I am not \nsuggesting that we just sign off. Obviously, we as representatives of \nour States and communities want to be in a position to see that there \nis fairness. That is why we are here, to keep some balance in the \nallocation of resources. I don't know whether or not we should be the \npeople who, on an annual basis, authorize the selection process of 10 \nrivers. I think that really should lie within the province of the \nexecutive branch having to meet some kind of competitive standard.\n\n  We are very excited by this Presidential initiative. Let's be very \ncandid here. The Governor of New York and the President of the United \nStates, in terms of political philosophy, have not always lined up on \nthe same side. Indeed, I say, on many occasions, they take opposite \npoints of view. So I think it is important when the Governor points out \nthat this is an opportunity for a State-Federal partnership on a basis \nthat makes sense without there being undue intrusion--because we reject \nundue intrusion. There is a process that is underway. Now, I can just \nimagine, if the Hudson River isn't designated, we will probably launch \na hue and cry as to why not. Of course, that is part of the process. If \nit is not designated and we think it should be, we would be prepared to \nask those questions. That is part of democracy; that is part of the \nprocess.\n  No one has the absolute, and no one's decisions and actions can go \nwithout the risk of being challenged in the court of public opinion, \nand that is what we would be doing. But I have every reason to believe, \nnotwithstanding the political differences and philosophical \ndifferences, for the most part, we will get reasonable decisions. I \nthink some of these issues are going to be very easy. There are some \nbodies of water where the local governments and State officials are \nanxious and can put forth a good case to be designated. Then they will \nget down to areas where it gets competitive and where reasonable people \nmight disagree. Are we going to say there won't be some politics \nentering into it? Of course, there will be. But it will be right here \non this floor within this body, I note, to the chagrin of many. The \nPresiding Officer would not believe that. But I can attest to the fact \nthat I believe that would be the case, in my limited experience in \nobserving these matters in the course of the past 17 years. And so it \nwould be in the House of Representatives.\n  Taking the political jockeying that would take place in terms of \ndesignating these rivers between the House and the Senate, that would \nreally be a lulu. You know, there is something called the rights of the \nminority, which this body in particular ensures, and I like that. I \nthink it is important. Even though we may have legislation and the \nmajority supports it, oftentimes, I think it is a necessary and \nimportant right. I think if we were to reflect on the history of this \nbody, we would find that sometimes those who are not in the majority \nhave held up legislative initiatives and, in the fullness of time, it \nhas come out that they were correct. So it is not bad. But I want to \nsay that it could be used in the manner which would make it difficult \nto get designations of the kinds of rivers that should be qualified.\n  So I will be, of course, forced to move to table this amendment on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Dodd at the appropriate time. I don't \nintend to do that until my colleagues have an opportunity to express \nthemselves.\n  Mr. GORTON. If the Senator from New York will yield, the Senator from \nMinnesota is here wishing to speak. I think it is appropriate that the \nSenator from Arkansas get to terminate the debate. If the Senator from \nNew York doesn't wish to stay, perhaps it would be appropriate for me \nto ask unanimous consent that the Senator from New York, together with \nthe Senator from Connecticut, be allowed to move to table at this \npoint, but ask unanimous consent that after the motion to table is put, \nbut before it is voted on, that the Senator from Minnesota have 5 \nminutes and the Senator from Arkansas have 5 minutes, after which a \nvote would take place on the motion to table. Would that be acceptable? \nI put that request to the Chair.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous-consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I make a motion to table on behalf of \nmyself and Senator Dodd, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 10 minutes of debate remaining. The \nSenator from Minnesota has 5 minutes. The Senator from Arkansas has 5 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I really am in strong opposition to the \namendment of my friend--and he is a friend--from Arkansas. I find it \nhard to understand why we would be creating additional hurdles, as this \namendment does, for communities to work together to restore and protect \nrivers and riverfronts. I think that is what this debate is all about. \nWe have a President who has initiated a program that will help local \ncommunities restore and protect rivers without any additional \nregulation, and Mr. President, for the life of me, I don't know why we \nwould want to support an amendment that would delay the start of this \nprogram, and which I think really would have no obvious benefit for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, while the Congress does have an oversight role--and I \nacknowledge that--this amendment, I believe, is a misplaced effort to \ninvolve all property owners in the designation process, that would \nreally create a whole new cumbersome process and give some form of veto \npower to a single property owner who might decide to object, for \nwhatever reason. So I think the amendment, however good-intentioned, is \nmistaken.\n  Mr. President, it seems to me that this amendment is about stopping \nthe American Heritage Rivers Program, not protecting property owners \nfrom some imagined Federal takeover of their property. The Senate is \nsupposed to be a voice of reason. I think by perpetuating the myth that \nthe Federal Government is somehow engaged in a land grab or a power \ngrab through this program is a dangerous game, and I think it is one we \nshould be very cautious about entering into.\n  Let me speak, in the last couple of minutes, about Minnesota. We have \nsome fine rivers in the State of Minnesota and many communities who \nwant to see this program go forward. One of those rivers, I think most \nof my colleagues are acquainted with, is called the Mississippi River. \nIt flows right past the State of my friend. I don't need to tell my \ncolleagues how important this river is to the Nation, how important it \nis to our Nation's culture, our history, and our economy. I will tell \nyou that in Minnesota we have mayors from communities such as Bemidji, \nat the headwaters of the Mississippi and from Minneapolis, St. Paul, \nSouth St. Paul, St. Cloud, Anoka, Wabasha, Winona, and others, working \nwith mayors in other States along the Mississippi to develop their \nnomination for this program.\n  So we have a lot of communities seeking designation of the Upper \nMississippi River to improve access to Federal riverfront \nrevitalization programs, and who are fully respectful of property \nrights, like other local governments across America who want to compete \nin this program. I think that if this amendment was passed, it would \nplace an insurmountable roadblock in front of the aspirations of local \ncommunities in the State of Minnesota and across America who are trying \nto make improvements and make the most of their river resources. Let me \nrepeat that. I think if the amendment passed, the biggest problem is \nthat it will create an insurmountable roadblock for a lot of our local \ncommunities who are doing their level best to make improvements and \nmake the most of their river resources. That is the problem.\n  I applaud the President's work. I applaud this initiative, this \nprogram, and I hope my colleagues will vote against the Hutchinson \namendment. I will certainly strongly support the Dodd-D'Amato motion to \ntable.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I think it has been a good debate. I \nthink\n\n[[Page S9553]]\n\nsome of the suggestions made and some of the points are very valid. We \nhave tried to respond to those.\n  I want to assure my distinguished colleague from New York that I \nbelieve the Hudson River's possibilities and its chances of being \ndesignated as an American Heritage will be enhanced by the adoption of \nthis amendment. One of the provisions is prioritization, which would be \nin accord with the Clean Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. \nThat will help the Hudson River. We don't designate the rivers in \nCongress. Congress doesn't designate them, but we would like to have \nthe right of approval. I think that is proper and appropriate.\n  The amendment does not undermine the Clinton Executive order. \nInstead, it assures that the rights of property owners will be upheld \nthrough the notification and comment process. It further assures that \nthe true interests of those residing near, owning property, or \nconducting business in the area of the river will be heard, and that \ntheir interests will not be muted by powerful outside lobbyists or \ninterest groups who desire to force their will on a selected community.\n  It should be understood that this initiative has never been \nauthorized, money has never been appropriated. It sweeps money from \neight Cabinet departments, four governmental agencies, allowing the \nFederal bureaucracy to dominate what should be a community-directed \ninitiative.\n  My friend and colleague from Arkansas, Senator Bumpers, made the \nanalogy of the Scenic Highways Program in the State of Arkansas, in \nwhich highways are called scenic highways, and signs are put up, and \nhow that helps tourism. I remind my good friend that the scenic \nhighways in Arkansas are approved by the State legislature. So I think \nif we are going to carry that analogy, Congress should assert itself in \nits proper role in approving these designations. That is what it is all \nabout.\n  We don't know the cost of this initiative, the magnitude of it. \nCongress needs to be involved in it. We want congressional approval. \nExecutive orders are being overutilized by this administration. \nCongress needs to reassert itself as an equal branch of Government. We \nwant the property owners to be protected. I have shown my good faith in \ntrying to make that workable. It is a workable amendment. We want those \nrivers to be prioritized in compliance with existing law, the Clean \nWater Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. It is a good amendment, it \nis a simple amendment, in contrast with the lengthy Executive order the \nPresident has issued.\n  This is a very simple amendment that provides very basic protections \nand ensures congressional input on these decisions in this program that \nwill be made. I will close with this. I ask my colleagues this \nquestion: If you owned property along one of these rivers, wouldn't you \nwant to be consulted? I think the answer to that is ``yes,'' and if the \nanswer to that question is ``yes,'' then you need to vote against this \nmotion to table and support the Hutchinson amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from Alaska [Mr. Stevens] is \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas).

I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to speak for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             New World Mine\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I will speak briefly on a subject that is \npart of the bill that is before the Senate, part of the bill on \nInterior. It has to do with the New World Mine. It has to do with the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund.\n  I rise to support the language that is in the Interior appropriations \nbill requiring that any expenditures out of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund to be used for the purchase of the New World Mine \nmust be authorized by the authorizing committee. That is also true of \nthe Headwaters Forest.\n  There is some notion that there was an agreement during the debate on \nthe budget with the administration that these funds would be available \nfor authorization. I think it was clear the other day when the Senator \nfrom New Mexico came to the floor and spoke and indicated that there \nwas no such agreement. I am here to congratulate the committee on that.\n  First let me make a couple of points clear. One is, I oppose the \ndevelopment of the New World Mine. I was one of the first elected \nofficials to oppose that. There are some places, in my view, that are \ninappropriate for mining. I think this is one of them. It is true they \nwere in the middle of EIS when the agreement was made to stop the mine, \nbut nevertheless I have opposed that long before the President signed \nthe agreement and came to Yellowstone Park with great fanfare and \nstopped the development of the New World Mine. I had opposed that. So \ndespite the rhetoric that is coming out of the White House and is \ncoming out of the CEQ at the White House, there was not an agreement, \nthere was not an agreement for the expenditure of this money.\n  This is not an issue of whether you want to protect Yellowstone or \nwhether you don't. We all want to do that. No one wants to preserve it \ncertainly more than I. I grew up just outside of Yellowstone, 25 miles \nout of the east entrance. I spent my boyhood there. I understand the \narea. I am also chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, and we \nworked very hard and will continue to have a plan to strengthen the \npark and to save parks. So that is not the issue. That is not the \nissue.\n  We will have before this Senate, as a matter of fact, at the \nbeginning of next year, a plan called Vision 20/20 which is\n\n[[Page S9554]]\n\ndesigned to increase the revenues that are available to parks, to do \nsomething about this $5 million in arrears in terms of facilities. So I \nam committed to the parks and I can guarantee you that we will have a \nprogram to do that.\n  What this involves is a commitment on the part of the administration, \na commitment on the part of the White House, a commitment on the part \nof Miss McGinty at CEQ who has become the political guru for White \nHouse natural resources to do what they indicated they would do.\n  Let me read just a little bit from the agreement that was made in \nYellowstone Park on the 12th day of August 1996, between Crown Butte \nMines, Crown Butte Resources, Northwest Wyoming Resource Council, and a \nnumber of others and the United States of America.\n\n       Objectives of the parties.\n       As set forth in greater specificity below, the objectives \n     of the Parties in entering into this agreement are to: (a) \n     provide for the transfer by Crown Butte to the United States \n     of the District Property in exchange for property interests \n     owned by the United States having a value of $65 million; * * \n     *\n       2. The United States will, as expeditiously as possible, \n     identify Exchange Property with a fair market value of $65 \n     million that is available and appropriate for exchange for \n     the District Property.\n\n  That is what it says in the agreement. That is what is agreed to. \nThat is what everyone thought we were doing.\n  The reversal now is the White House is saying well, there was an \nagreement that we will take cash out of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund for these items. That is not what the agreement was. There was not \nan agreement to do that. We are saying the White House should live up \nto the agreement that they signed back on August 12 of this year.\n  They have claimed no property to be found. I can't believe that. I \nhave talked to the owners of the mine and they are willing to accept \nmost any property that they could sell and turn into cash. So that is \nwhat it is all about.\n  I believe the current language in the appropriations bill is correct. \nThere is $700 million authorized in the Land and Water Conservation \nFund but the expenditure is not simply left to the discretion of the \nadministration but, in fact, the committees of jurisdiction have an \nopportunity, indeed, have a responsibility for the authorization.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            CROWN BUTTE MINE\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleague \nSenator Gorton for the position he has taken in this Interior \nappropriations bill on the proposed buy-out of the Crown Butte mine in \nmy State of Montana. I am very supportive of the position and the \nlanguage he has in this bill to address a very complicated and \nunfortunate issue.\n  A little over a year ago, while on vacation in Yellowstone National \nPark, the President took an action that still has me shaking my head. \nUsing an administrative decision, the President circumvented the \nprocess that Congress enacted to provide for the protection of our \nnatural resources in this country. The National Environmental \nProtection Act [NEPA] was designed to provide an indepth analysis prior \nto any action taking place on public lands throughout the Nation. The \neffect of this analysis is to make sure that any project being \ncontemplated is safe for the public and takes into account the welfare \nof the natural resources.\n  This administrative action which the President took, provides for a \ncash buy-out of the Crown Butte mine and entirely circumvented the NEPA \nprocess. The State of Montana, the mining company, and others had spent \nunlimited amounts of time and a great deal of money to go through the \nNEPA process. However, this work was completely undone by the actions \nof the President and the Council on Environmental Quality. With the \nNEPA process eliminated, to this day we still do not know what the \nresults of the environmental impact statement would have been. The \nadministration, overrode good, sound, scientific processes for a policy \nbased on a feel good mentality.\n  During the past year, several attempts have been made to come up with \neither property or money to fulfill the commitment made by this \nadministration to the mining company. The first of these attempts, the \nMontana initiative, a plan which the State of Montana developed with \nthe approval of the White House and would have swapped property in \nMontana for the Crown Butte property also located in Montana. This \nattempt failed, which would have provided compensation to the State of \nMontana for lost revenue, when the administration failed to bring the \nparties to the table to complete the negotiations. Later in the year, \nthe Council on Environmental Quality decided they could take funds from \none of the most successful environmental programs, the Conservation \nReserve Program, to pay off the company. This, of course, proved \nunacceptable to numerous Members of Congress, the farmers of this \nNation and several conservation and wildlife organizations. The \nadministration's attempts to complete this deal have shown little \nregard for the public and their involvement in the process.\n  Finally, as congressional leadership and the administration \nnegotiated the Balanced Budget Act, an outline for coming up with \nfunding was completed. I reiterate here, that this was just an outline, \nnot an agreement for specific projects. This agreement provided for \n$700 million to be placed into the Land and Water Conservation Fund \n[LWCF], for priority land acquisitions. No specific projects were \ndetailed in this agreement. Senator Domenici, who assisted in the \nnegotiations as chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, came to the \nfloor earlier this week to spell out what exactly was detailed in the \nagreement reached in the Balanced Budget Act. Senator Domenici read \nfrom the agreement which proves that no specific projects were included \nin the agreement.\n  The Chairman of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations \nSubcommittee was then placed in a position of deciding exactly how \nthose funds would be expended. I congratulate the Chairman for the work \nthat he did to come up with a reasonable approach to this issue. In \ndealing with this expenditure of funds, the Chairman has placed \nCongress back into the loop where they belong. The language in this \nbill provides that the funds will be set aside until Congress has the \nopportunity to authorize the spending on particular projects. Congress \nhas a responsibility to the public to review any and all expenditures \nof this magnitude. I have been elected to address the concerns of all \nthe people including the citizens of Montana who have been ignored by \nthis Presidential directive. In this particular arrangement, the \nadministration seemed to have overlooked one very important and vital \nperson in this whole scenario. Ms. Margaret Reeb, the owner of the \nproperty on which the mine itself would have been located.\n  What the chairman has done with this language is provide Ms. Reeb, \nPark County, and the State of Montana a chance to voice their concerns \nwith the administrative action he has taken. They are the biggest \nlosers in the action proposed by the President. In the case of Ms. \nReeb, the property owner, her private property rights have been \nviolated, as well as has her devotion to the heritage from which she \ncame. As for the State of Montana and Park County, well in an area \nwhere mining provides some of the best paying jobs in the State, income \nand economic development have been thwarted without even the slightest \nconsideration provided for this loss.\n  Mr. President, I commend the chairman for the work and the position \nhe has taken on this issue. He has shown great insight and provided \nleadership in the development of a solution that will provide Margaret \nReeb and others an opportunity to voice their say on this matter. I \nthank the chairman and appreciate his hard work.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1221\n\n     (Purpose: To provide for limitations on certain Indian gaming \n                              operations)\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the pending \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for himself, Mr. \n     Brownback, Mr. Coats, Mr.\n\n[[Page S9555]]\n\n     Lugar, Mr. Bryan, and Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1221.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN INDIAN GAMING OPERATIONS.\n\n       (A) Definitions.--for purposes of this section, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Class III gaming--The term ``class III gaming'' has the \n     meaning provided that term in section 4(8) of the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2703(8)).\n       (2) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n     meaning provided that term in section 4(e) of the Indian \n     Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n     450(e)).\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of the Interior.\n       (4) Tribal-state compact.--The term ``Tribal-State \n     compact'' means a Tribal-State compact referred to in section \n     11(d) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. \n     2710(d)).\n       (b) Class iii Gaming Compacts.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Prohibition.--During fiscal year 1998, the Secretary \n     may not expend any funds made available under this Act to \n     review or approve any initial Tribal-State compact for class \n     III gaming entered into on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act except for a Tribal-State compact or form of compact \n     which has been approved by the State's Governor and State \n     Legislature.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph may be \n     construed to prohibit the review or approval by the Secretary \n     of a renewal or revision of, or amendment to a Tribal-State \n     compact that is not covered under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Tribal-state compacts.--During fiscal year 1998, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Tribal-State \n     compact for class III gaming shall be considered to have been \n     approved by the Secretary by reason of the failure of the \n     Secretary to approve or disapprove that compact. This \n     provision shall not apply to any Tribal-State compact or form \n     of compact which has been approved by the State's Governor \n     and State Legislature.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have submitted an amendment to the bill \nthat comes as a result of several years of involvement with the Indian \ngaming issue in Wyoming. I want to mention, you may have a copy of an \nearly version of the amendment. I hope you have a copy of this more \nrecent version.\n  What we are trying to achieve with the bill is to be sure that the \nSecretary of Interior is not drafting any rules or regulations that \nwould bypass the States in the process of dealing with Indian gambling.\n  Now, that is what this amendment works to do, and I rise to join my \ndistinguished colleagues, the Senator from Kansas, Senator Brownback, \nthe Senator from Nevada, Senator Bryan, the Senators from Indiana, \nSenators Lugar and Coats, and the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond, \nin offering an amendment to the Interior appropriations bill.\n  This amendment would place a 1-year moratorium on the Secretary of \nInterior's ability to approve any new tribal-State gambling compact if \nthe compact has not been approved by the Governor and the State \nlegislature of the State in which the tribe is located. This 1-year \nmoratorium will give Congress an opportunity to review the approval \nprocess of Indian gambling compacts as well as the effect of gambling \non the society as a whole.\n  Mr. President, last year Congress approved the formation of a \nNational Gambling Impact Study Commission to conduct a 2-year study of \ngambling's political, social, and economic effects. By authorizing the \nstudy, Congress realized the potential dangers that the recent \nexplosion in casino gambling poses to society at large. While this \nstudy has yet to get seriously underway, the expansion of casino \ngambling is continuing at an alarming rate.\n  The desire for quick cash has had an effect on everyone, including \nnative Americans, and them as much as any other segment of the \npopulation. A Congressional Research Service report issued this past \nJune showed that since the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was passed in \n1988, the Secretary of the Interior has approved over 180 tribal-State \ngambling compacts. As of June of this year, 24 States now have gambling \non Indian reservations within their borders. Mr. President, 145 Indian \ntribes currently have one or more casinos on their lands. This \nproliferation of casino gambling on tribal lands and society at large \nhas not been without its negative effects. John Kindt, a professor of \ncommerce and legal policy at the University of Illinois, has concluded \nthat for every $1 in tax revenue that gambling raises, it creates $3 in \ncosts to handle such expenses as economic disruption, compulsive \ngambling, and crime. Gambling is an industry in which a precious few \nmake a fortune, while the penniless thousands pay the price with their \nshattered lives, painful addictions, and widespread crime.\n  In light of the detrimental effects of the proliferation of casino \ngambling, Congress should review the approval process of the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act to determine what long-term changes need to be \nmade to this act. While the regulation of gambling is generally \nreserved to the State governments, the power to regulate gambling on \nIndian tribal lands rests primarily with Congress.\n  Let me explain precisely what this amendment would do. The amendment \nmy colleagues and I are offering places a 1-year moratorium on the \napproval of any new tribal-State gambling compacts if the compacts have \nnot been approved by the Governor and the State legislature in the \nState in which the tribal lands are located. This amendment does not \nprohibit the individual States and Indian tribes from negotiating class \nIII gambling contracts. It simply requires if there is to be an \nexpansion of the tribal-State gambling contracts within a State's \nborders, these compacts must first be approved by the State's popularly \nelected representatives and Governor. Again, this moratorium is only \nfor a period of 1 year. A 1-year moratorium will allow Congress to \nreexamine the long-term approval process of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act to determine if the current process is in the best \ninterests of the tribes, the States and the country as a whole.\n  The rationale behind this amendment is simple: Society as a whole \nbears the burden of the effects of gambling. A State's law enforcement, \na State's social services and communities are seriously impacted by the \nexpansion of gambling, casino gambling on Indian tribal lands. \nTherefore, a decision of whether or not to allow casino gambling on \ntribal lands should be approved by the popularly-elected \nrepresentatives. I believe a 1-year moratorium on the approval of new \ngambling compacts which do not receive approval from the Governor and \nthe State legislature is a reasonable beginning to a very important \ndebate on reexamining the long-term approval process under the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support me in this effort. Again, the \namendment that we have presented would give a clear indication to the \nSecretary of the Interior that we do not want rules and regulations \nthat will bypass State authority and put the State in a situation--\nsince the gaming doesn't affect just the lands, just people on the \ntribal lands, it affects those immediately surrounding it to a great \ndegree. The further you are from the gambling, the less impact there \nmight be. But there is an effect on a greater number of people than \njust the tribe. In our State of Wyoming, we had an initiative about 3 \nyears ago to allow local option decisions on gambling. When that \ninitiative was first presented, according to polls, 70 percent of the \npeople were in favor of allowing that local option. We took a look at \nthe situations in the States surrounding us, what was happening, and \nwhen we had the vote, 70 percent of the people in Wyoming said, no, \nthat isn't the way we want our State to go, that isn't the way we want \nour neighbors to inflict their decisions on us. So the State, as a \nwhole, took an approach of not allowing class III gambling by 70 \npercent. That was with a lot of money against it.\n\n  So we have some concern in our State. My purpose with the amendment \nis to make sure the State's concerns would be represented in this, as \nwell as everyone else's. I mention that, with the first version I put \nout, I got a call from the Senator from New Mexico, Senator Domenici. \nHe had some concerns. He thought I was trying to eliminate a particular \ntribe in a particular place in New Mexico. That was not my intent. I \ntook a look again at the wording and changed it to the wording that has \ngone to the desk because, again, we want to emphasize\n\n[[Page S9556]]\n\nthat our purpose in this is to make sure that the States are involved \nin the decision as well.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Wyoming in \nhis remarks. Last year, I served as attorney general for the State of \nAlabama and dealt with this precise issue. There is a considerable \namount of litigation going on in the country resulting and culminating \nfrom the Seminole Indian case that was decided by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt last year. The basic problem is that under Federal gambling law, \nthere appears to be some confusion as to whether the Secretary of the \nInterior can intervene in the negotiating process between States and \nIndian tribes with regard to the kinds of gambling that would be \nallowed in the State.\n  For example, in Alabama, we have one particular Indian tribe that has \nthree distinct parcels of land, as I recall, in various parts of \nAlabama. If the Secretary of the Interior were to allow the tribe to \nhave casino gambling at any one site, they would also be able to have a \ncasino at the other two places within Alabama. That result has been \nresisted very steadfastly because three major gambling casinos would, \nin fact, let the wall down. Casino gambling would spread throughout the \nState, and it would not make any difference what the people of Alabama \nfelt about gambling or casinos in general as the casinos would be built \nwithout ever having put the matter before the people of Alabama for \nconsideration.\n  This is a very important national issue. It is a very important issue \nfor those who believe gambling should not be spread and for those who \nbelieve that the growth of gambling should only occur when the people \nhave voted on it. Allowing the Secretary of the Interior to \nunilaterally sanction tribal gambling is a way to get around popular \nelections that would allow local people and local officials to decide \nwhether to allow or disallow gambling. So it has a real serious effect. \nThe gambling industry has suggested repeatedly that they think if a \nState does not go along with their desire to have casinos on the \nreservations, then they could approach the Secretary of the Interior \nand get his permission. In fact, they have said that in Alabama for \nsome time.\n  As attorney general, my office researched the law governing this \nissue, and I came to the conclusion that the Secretary of the Interior \ndid not have the ability to sanction tribal gambling in this manner. In \nfact, I wrote him a letter in June of last year which explained the \nlegal arguments which appear to preclude him from exerting such \nauthority. But the possibility that the Secretary does retain such \nauthority has remained a matter of discussion among those involved in \nthe question of the spread of gambling in America, and there are \nprogambling forces that have suggested that the Secretary of the \nInterior does have that power.\n\n  This amendment, I think, would simply clarify the legislative intent \nCongress had when it passed the Gambling Act a number of years ago. \nThis amendment would not allow the Secretary of the Interior to \noverride the popular will of the people in the States where tribal \ngambling is at issue. I think it is very good policy.\n  I salute the Senator from Wyoming. I think he is right on point. If \nthe Secretary of the Interior were to be inclined to attempt to assert \nauthority in this area, we need to stop it. And if he doesn't intend to \nintervene and if he does not intend to assert such power, he should not \nbe offended by this legislation because I think it merely reflects the \nwill of this Congress.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Enzi \namendment on the temporary moratorium on the expansion of gambling on \ntribal lands. I will just make a very brief and succinct point. In the \nlast Congress, we passed Public Law 104-169, which established the \nNational Gambling Impact and Policy Commission. It was for the purpose \nof studying the social and economic impact of gambling and reporting \nits findings to Congress. I supported that legislation. I thought it \nwas important legislation, particularly since the gambling industry has \nexpanded so much. The industry rakes in $40 billion a year annually in \nthe United States. It operates in 23 States. The amount of money \nwagered annually in the United States today exceeds $500 billion --half \na trillion dollars.\n  There have been a number of questions regarding the industry overall. \nIt just seems to me that what we should do is a logical progression \nhere. We are saying there are a lot of questions regarding the impact \nof that amount of gambling taking place in the United States, that \npervasive amount, that size of money. What we should do now is, let's \npause for a moment and let's not expand this any further until we have \nthis Commission reporting back on what the impact is to the United \nStates.\n  There have been lots of allegations of negative impacts of the \ngambling industry. It is widespread, it is expansive, and it is in \nmany, many areas. Let's let this Commission meet, let's let them make a \nconclusion, let's let them report to Congress on these items before we \nexpand any further than the $40 billion, 23-State industry that it is \ntoday.\n  That is why I think the Senator from Wyoming is bringing up an \nexcellent point in this. Now, I don't want my views to be construed as \nin opposition to the chance for economically deprived Indian nations to \nbring needed economic activities to their communities. That is not what \nthis statement is about. I think it is a positive thing that tribes are \nstriving to provide employment and health care and housing and other \nimportant services, in light of the position of where they are \neconomically and the difficulty and the needs that they have. This \namendment does not ban Indian gaming. It does not affect gaming \ncompacts which are operational or already have been approved. It simply \nplaces a temporary prohibition on the Secretary of the Interior to \napprove any new tribal-State compacts.\n  I think, in light of this, a national commission that has been \nestablished, and the questions regarding a societal impact on the \noverall United States, that this is an appropriate approach. I commend \nthe Senator from Wyoming on this very reasonable approach.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, before proceeding with my remarks, I wish \nto state for the Record that there are two States in this Union that \nprohibit gambling of any sort--the State of Utah and the State of \nHawaii. In the State of Hawaii, it would be a crime to conduct bingo \ngames. There are no poker games, no slot machines and no casinos in the \nState of Hawaii. The same thing presents itself in the State of Utah. \nYet, I find myself rising to express my opposition to the amendment \nproposed by the distinguished Senator from Wyoming.\n  Though I am personally against gaming, and I would oppose any attempt \non the part of the State of Hawaii to institute gaming in our islands, \nI find that I support gaming for Indians because of two reasons. One, \nour Constitution states that Indian nations are sovereign and that we \nhave carried this out by treaties and by laws and by Supreme Court \ndecisions. Indian nations are sovereign.\n  Second, there were 800 treaties, Mr. President, as we stated a few \ndays ago, and of those 800 treaties, 430 are still lying idle in the \narchives of the U.S. Senate. These treaties have been lying there for \nover 100 years. And we have found that, though these treaties are in \ncorrect form and appropriate because of changes in circumstances, the \nSenate has decided not to consider them, debate them, have hearings on \nthem, or pass upon them. And 370 were ratified by this body. But, Mr. \nPresident, sadly, I think we should note that of the 370 treaties that \nwe ratified, we have violated provisions in every single one of them.\n  These were solemn documents and many of them had language and phrases \nthat were very eloquent, very dramatic. Imagine a treaty beginning\n\n[[Page S9557]]\n\nwith words, such as, ``As long as the sun rises in the east and sets in \nthe west, as long as the rivers flow from the mountains to the streams \nbelow, this land is yours.''\n  Indians started off with 500 million acres of land. Over the years, \nbecause of our violation of provisions in our treaties, and because of \nour refusal to consider these treaties, Indians have 50 million acres \nleft. This was their land. There were sovereign nations long before we \ncame here. When they gave up this land, we promised them certain \nthings, such as providing them shelter, education, and health \nfacilities. And what do we find in their land? Unemployment averaging \n57 percent. We pride ourselves with our low unemployment rate in our \nNation of 5.2--5.2 for the Nation and 57 percent for Indian country. \nSome unemployment rates are as high as 92 percent, Mr. President. The \nhealth conditions in Indian country are worse than in third world \ncountries--the worst statistics on cancer and the worst statistics on \nrespiratory diseases. And if you look at the social life in Indian \ncountry, it is a scandal. We as Americans should be embarrassed and \nashamed of ourselves. The suicide rate among the young people in Indian \ncountry is eight times our national norm. Some 50 percent of the young \nladies in Indian country have considered suicide.\n  If this Nation had lived up to the promises that we made many decades \nago, I would not be standing here speaking against the Senator from \nWyoming, because I am against gaming. Hawaii is against gaming. But, \ntoday, I find that I must speak in opposition.\n  Mr. President, regretfully, the chairman of the Senate Committee on \nIndian Affairs is not able to be with us at this moment because of a \nvery important and very urgent matter that suddenly came to his \nattention. He has asked me to express his concerns, and he has said \nthat this statement I am about to present meets with his approval, and \nso it is a joint statement of the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Ben \nNighthorse Campbell, and myself.\n  Mr. President, 2 months ago, Senator McCain, the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, and I introduced a bill to amend the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act. A hearing on this bill has been scheduled for \nOctober 8. It was not scheduled today. This has been announced, and it \nwas announced over a month ago, long before this measure was up for \nconsideration.\n\n  So I would like to suggest to my distinguished colleague from Wyoming \nthat the proper forum to consider his proposal would be before that \ncommittee. I can assure my friend from Wyoming that his proposition \nwill be considered with all seriousness.\n  We have consistently opposed efforts to amend the Indian Gaming Act \nin a piecemeal fashion. And this is what it is. We do so again today.\n  At a time when the Indian Affairs Committee, the authorizing \ncommittee, is making every effort to make adjustments in the act which \nwill reflect contemporary realities, this amendment only serves to \nundermine our efforts to assure that any amendment to the act is \nconsistent with over 200 years of Federal law and policy.\n  For the benefit of our colleagues here who may not be familiar with \nthe context in which this amendment is proposed, allow me to share with \nyou a few relevant facts.\n  Last year the Supreme Court of the United States ruled on one \nimportant aspect of the regulatory act. While the Court did not strike \nany provision of the act, its decision left a vacuum of remedies when a \nState and a tribal government come to an impasse in negotiations which \nwould otherwise lead to a tribal-State compact. These compacts, \npursuant to the law, govern the conduct of class 3 gaming in Indian \nlands.\n  The Secretary of the Interior has stepped into the void created by \nthe Court's ruling by inviting public comments on whether an \nalternative means of reaching a compact ought to be established through \nthe regulatory process until the Congress has the opportunity to act. \nThe Secretary has not had and does not have any intention to establish \nregulations on his own. He is assisting our committee. He is assisting \nthe Congress of the United States by inviting comments from all \ninterested parties--Indian country, gambling interests, government \nofficials, Governors, attorneys general, and present them to us. The \ndecision will be made here, not by the Secretary of the Interior.\n  This amendment is designed to preclude the Secretary from proceeding \nin what many believe is a constructive effort to advance the public \ndialog. If anything, we should be encouraging the Secretary to invite \ncomments so that it will help us to expedite our efforts. But this \namendment does not just prevent the Secretary from proceeding--it would \nalso effect a dramatic change in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act by \nfederally preempting the laws of each State.\n  I hope that my colleagues realize that this amendment, which looks \ninnocuous and reasonable, will have that effect of telling the several \nStates of this Union that, notwithstanding their constitution or their \nlaws, this is the way business is to be carried out.\n  Under the current law, the regulatory act does not touch any State's \nlaw or constitution. Mr. President, we did this very deliberately--when \nwe enacted the law.\n  Instead, the act recognizes that each State's constitution, and State \nlaws enacted in furtherance of the State constitution, may differ in \nmany respects. There are 50 States, 50 different constitutions, and 50 \ndifferent sets of laws.\n  Over the course of the last 9 years, as a function of litigation on \nthis very point, we have learned a lot about the various States' laws. \nFor example, some States and their constitutions provide that the \nGovernor is authorized to enter into contracts, agreements, or compacts \nwith another sovereign. The Governor is authorized to do that.\n  Other State constitutions would require the ratification of the \nGovernor's action by the State legislature. Some States don't require \nthat. Still, other constitutions provide that only the State \nlegislature can act for the State in terms of entering into binding \nlegal agreements. And there are other State constitutions that are \nsilent as to these responsibilities. In some States their laws \ndetermine when the Governor can act on behalf of the State and in what \ncircumstances the legislature must act. And the supreme courts of the \nvarious States have issued many opinions on these matters at great \nlength.\n  This amendment we are considering at this moment will now require \nthat no tribal-State compact can be approved by the Secretary unless \nboth the Governor of the State and the legislature of the State have \napproved this compact.\n  This amendment will, therefore, set aside the constitutions of the \nvarious States, the laws of the various States, and would impose new \nrequirements on each State, notwithstanding what their constitutions or \nlaw may provide to the contrary.\n  This is a very substantial change in Federal law effecting rights \nthat States jealously guard.\n  I know of no Governor who has expressed a desire to have the laws of \nhis or her State preempted by Federal law.\n  In 2 weeks' time the authorizing committee will carry this dialog \nforward and provide an opportunity for all affected parties to weigh in \nwith their views. We are hoping at that time the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming will present his views to the Committee on Indian Affairs. \nAnd this amendment, Mr. President, will preempt that very important \npublic discussion.\n  Mr. President, I want to make very clear that I do not question the \nwisdom of the proponents of this amendment. I just believe that there \nare others--State and tribal governments--upon whom the effect of this \namendment will be directly visited and who ought to have the \nopportunity to have their views known.\n  So, once again, Mr. President, I call upon the Senator from Wyoming \nto withdraw this amendment and allow the authorizing committee to \nproceed with our work where his concerns and the concerns of his \ncolleagues will have the benefit of full public consideration.\n  Mr. President, it is true that there are 171 compacts that have been \napproved. It is also true that there are about 120 gaming \nestablishments presently on Indian reservations. But it should be \npointed out that less than 10 are making money. I am certain all of us \nknow, or should know, that reservation lands are trust lands. Actually \nthe\n\n[[Page S9558]]\n\ntitles to those lands lie in the hands of the Government of the United \nStates. So, as a lawyer would say, they cannot be alienated. One cannot \ngo to the bank and say, ``I want to borrow $1 million, and I will put \nup this parcel of land as collateral.'' You can't do that with \nreservation lands. So, in order to initiate or establish a gaming \nenterprise, these Indian governments have to go out to other sources \nfor financing. When that happens, Mr. President, I am certain you \nrealize that the rates that they would have to pay are much, much \nstiffer than what you and I would be required to pay to a bank. Yes, \nmoneys are flowing in. But at this time Indians are not making that \nmoney. Operators are making that money.\n\n  But those Indian tribes that are making a few dollars have applied \nthose moneys to causes and to projects that we have failed to provide. \nThey are building schools that we should have built. They are building \nhospitals that we should have built. They are building homes that we \npromised them.\n  So, Mr. President, though I oppose gaming in any form, if this \ncountry is unable to or refuses to live up to the promises that we made \nby treaty, if this is the only way they can raise funds, so be it.\n  Mr. President, I hope that this body will give their committee, the \nCommittee on Indian affairs, an opportunity to conduct this hearing, \nreceive the views of all of our colleagues, and act accordingly.\n  So, with that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I really appreciate the remarks of my \ndistinguished colleague from Hawaii. I know of his long-time \ninvolvement in the Indian issue and of his long-time involvement in the \nSenate. In fact, I think he is the only person in the Senate who has \nbeen in the Senate since his State became a State.\n  There is a lot of tradition, a lot of history, and a lot of \nspecialization and involvement in this particular issue. I have to \nadmit that in the last few minutes I have learned a lot about the \nissue. From talking to him earlier in the morning, I learned a lot \nabout the issue. I also got an opportunity to talk to Senator Campbell. \nAgain, I learned a lot about the issue. I have been involved in it \nbefore. But there was a different level of involvement, and these are \npeople with a tremendous tradition and history on the issue.\n  Again, my intention with the amendment that I presented is to see \nthat the Secretary of the Interior does not bypass our process, that he \ndoesn't write his own rules with the opinion, or believe that that can \nbypass some of the States' involvement in the issue.\n  I do think that for the friendship and cooperation that has been \nbuilt up in some of the States over the years, that this is an issue \nthat still has to have the States' involvement. That is the only way \nthat people can live together and work together and make sure that the \nIndian interests and some of the Indian problems are solved along the \nway.\n  I appreciate the Senator's comments about the fact that only about 10 \nof the casinos are in a situation where they are making a lot of money. \nI have visited some of the reservations where the casinos are and have \nnoted the disappointment by the tribal members over how poorly their \ncasino was doing. I have seen that on nontribal casinos as well, \nbecause I followed the Colorado situation where the small businessmen \nin the small towns that were allowed to do the class 3 gaming looked \nforward to the time that they would be wealthy from gambling. They \nfound out that it takes some different talents than they had as small \nbusinessmen to run a big casino. So, they didn't make the money that \nthey had anticipated on it either, although there is a lot of money \nbeing made in a lot of places on gambling.\n  My intent on this is to make sure that the States are a part of the \nprocess. The Senator mentioned the hearing that is coming up. I really \nappreciate the fact that he is going to hold a hearing and cover some \nof these important issues. My amendment would not undo the hearing. All \nof the issues can still be addressed in that hearing. If a bill comes \nout of that hearing and it covers the issue of State involvement, or at \nleast this issue of whether the Secretary of the Interior can expend \nmoney to bypass the State process, if that is in there, I would work to \nbe sure that the repealer of this amendment is in that bill. I would \nwork for that passage. I don't think there would be any difficulty with \nit. I don't know of anybody who would oppose it if that were assured as \na part of that hearing process.\n  So, I commend him for his efforts already on this and his willingness \nto hold a hearing, which, of course, was already scheduled and planned \nwell before I ever even thought of an amendment, but his willingness to \nbe sure that that issue is addressed in there. That is what I got from \nhis comments.\n  We want to make sure that where the Court may have made some things \nunclear, they are clarified, and, again, that the State involvement in \nthe issue is not left out. People live too close together these days to \nhave the tribes separate from the States on the gaming issue.\n  Lastly, I will address the comments about federally preempting State \nlaws. That would never be my intent. Anybody who has looked at anything \nthat I have done in the State legislature or since I have came to \nWashington would, I think, agree that everything that I have done has \nbeen to assure States' rights. It is not my intent with this. As I \nlearn, I make changes.\n  I guess I would ask the Senator from Hawaii, if I made a change to \nthe amendment, one that would, instead of mentioning the Governor and \nthe State legislature--which I understand now in some States one has \nthe authority, and in some others the other has authority, and in some \nStates it requires both to participate in order to do it--if we could \nchange the wording so that if it was approved by a State in accordance \nwith State law in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, if that would be a \nwording change that would then make this acceptable in both places \nwhere I mentioned the Governors and State legislatures--because I would \nlike to make this so that I am not preempting State law. I don't intend \nto do that and would be willing to make that change if it would make a \ndifference.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to commend my friend from Wyoming \nfor his reasonable approach. But I must say that I would still have to \noppose the whole amendment because this is a piecemeal handling of this \nvery important proposition which we have before us.\n  I would like to read for the Record a statement issued by the \nadministration.\n  It says:\n\n       The Department--\n\n  The Department of the Interior--\n\n     strongly opposes denying any tribe the badly needed economic \n     opportunity envisioned and authored by IGRA.\n\n  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n\n       Indian gaming has provided benefits to over 120 tribes and \n     their surrounding communities in over 20 States. As required \n     by law, revenues have been directed to programs and \n     facilities to improve the health, safety, educational \n     opportunity and quality of life for Indian people.\n       The amendment--Of the Senator from Wyoming--\n\n     would deny similar economic opportunities for additional \n     tribes and communities.\n\n  Accordingly, I hope most respectfully that the Senator would \nseriously consider withdrawing the amendment, and I can assure him in \nbehalf of the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee that we will \naccommodate him to every extent possible. He can tell us what witnesses \nhe wishes to be heard. In fact, I am certain we will be able to \naccommodate him as to when the hearings are conducted. Our first day of \nhearings will be on October 8, but if he wants 3 days of hearings I can \nassure the Senator from Wyoming that he will have 3 days of hearings, \nor 4 days of hearings.\n  I can also assure the Senator that we will very seriously consider \nevery proposition that he makes. So I hope that his amendment would be \nwithdrawn.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, just 2 or 3 days ago, we had a not \ndissimilar discussion in this Chamber on proposals that would change \npresent law with respect to Indian and non-Indian relationships. There \nwere two provisions in\n\n[[Page S9559]]\n\nthis bill, of which I was the author, about the immunity of Indian \ntribes from lawsuit brought by non-Indians and on the way in which \nmoney was distributed to Indian tribes through the tribal priority \nallocations.\n  The Senator from Hawaii, with the same degree of eloquence that he \nhas used here this afternoon, spoke strongly against those amendments, \nalong with several of his colleagues, partly on the merits but with \neven more vehemence and eloquence perhaps from the perspective that \nthese were new proposals reversing many years of history about which \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs had had no opportunity for broad-based \nhearings, listening to both sides of the issue.\n  As strongly as I felt and feel about the justice of those two \nproposals, I certainly had to agree on that procedural matter with the \nSenator from Hawaii. There was last year one rather desultory hearing \non sovereign immunity, none on the distribution of money from the \nCongress to Indian tribes. Between now and the middle of next year \nthese two questions will be very seriously considered by the committee \nitself, by the General Accounting Office, and I think with increasing \nawareness by Members of the Senate. That history is in striking \ncontrast with the history of the policy that is the subject of the \namendment proposed by my friend and colleague from Wyoming.\n  I returned to the Senate after a hiatus in 1989 and joined that \nIndian Affairs Committee under the chairmanship of the Senator from \nHawaii. I cannot count the number of hearings the committee has had on \nthis subject. Indian gaming is not something that has a long history. \nIt was authored, if my memory serves me correctly, in 1988, and it has \nproliferated mightily ever since then with a graph with a steep upward \ncurve.\n  Objections and protests from Governors, from State attorneys general, \nand from communities have been constant from the time of a first \ncompact. Pressure from the Department of the Interior on States to \nenter compacts even when States did not wish to do so has been a \nconstant in this field. Attempts to overrule vetoes on the part of \nStates has been a constant effort ever since. Year after year after \nyear there are hearings on the subject in that committee and absolutely \nnothing happens.\n  Not only has no bill on the subject reflecting the views of those in \nwhose communities these casinos have been created or about to be \ncreated been reported, no bill on the subject at all has been reported \nand, to the best of my memory, none has ever come to markup so that \nmembers of the committee could vote on it.\n  So I simply have to tell my friend from Wyoming a promise of hearings \nis a hollow promise, at least if history is any guide to this question \nwhatsoever.\n  I must say to you, Mr. President, that I do come to this debate with \na relatively long history, not so much with respect to Indian gambling \nbut with respect to organized gambling overall. It was the subject that \ncame up the first year that I was attorney general of the State of \nWashington more than a quarter of a century ago. I have always been of \nthe opinion that under most places and under most circumstances it is a \nsocially highly dubious activity that has adverse social and cultural \nimpacts, rivaling those of other kinds of activities that we either \nprohibit or keep strongly under control.\n  At the same time, I recognize the desire under some circumstances to \ngamble is something that is a part of all of our human natures. \nTherefore, I have never been an absolute prohibitionist on the subject. \nCertainly, however, it seems to me that it is a subject important \nenough so that the views of the communities that are asked to take on \nchallenges and forms of business that they have never historically been \nvisited with ought to be given immense weight in making these \ndecisions. And they simply are not under the law as it exists at the \npresent time.\n  I cannot say what the intention or the expectations were of Members \nwho were here when the original bill was passed, but I do not think it \nwas the intention that in State after State and community after \ncommunity Indian tribes or their designees would purchase land off, in \nmost cases far off, of the historic Indian reservations and \nimmediately, with the compliance of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, put \nit into trust status so that it stopped paying taxes to the community \nand then license gambling activities on it. And yet that is what has \ntaken place in community after community across the country. In most of \nthese States it is an activity in which only this small group of \nAmerican citizens is permitted to engage. Very few States have taken \nthe drastic step of saying, well, the Federal Government can foist \nIndian casinos on us. We might as well let anyone ask for a casino \nlicense.\n  In most places, it is an activity that is available only for this \ngroup of people and only by the interference of the Federal Government. \nSo States lack the ability to enforce rational land and business \nregulations within their boundaries even outside the historic \nboundaries of Indian reservations.\n  By pure coincidence, Mr. President, in the group of clippings from \nour own State, which almost all of us get every day, I have today an \neditorial that was printed late last week in the Yakima, WA, Herald \nRepublic which uses the State of the occupant of the chair as an \nexample. I will share a little bit of it with you. It says:\n\n       Developments in Lincoln City, Ore., could serve as a wakeup \n     call for this state to step back and take a long, hard look \n     at the long-range implications of the proliferation of \n     gambling now underway.\n       Officials in Lincoln City, a picturesque family resort area \n     on the Oregon coast, have noticed some changes in the \n     landscape of the community since the advent of the Chinook \n     Winds Casino and Convention Center. A local tavern started \n     featuring exotic dancers while three new quasi-pawn shops and \n     a check-cashing business opened.\n       Longtime residents say they've noticed other changes in the \n     community and Lincoln City Mayor Foster Aschenbrenner said \n     the real effects of the casino on the community will take at \n     least two more years to fully realize.\n       ``People used to come here for the natural beauty of the \n     beaches and for swimming,'' said Merilynn Webb, who has lived \n     in Lincoln City since 1930. ``Now they come to gamble, and \n     that's a whole different mentality.''\n\n  I doubt that the people of Lincoln City voted on this change. I doubt \nthat the Oregon Legislature did. Perhaps the occupant of the chair will \nbe able to enlighten us on that. I doubt that there is a huge Indian \nreservation inside the boundaries of Lincoln City. Yet, this change has \ntaken place in that community without the kind of thoughtful, long-\nrange consideration that a community should be permitted to engage in \nbefore such activities are permitted.\n  Last year, this body and the House and the President agreed that the \nproliferation of organized and legal gambling in the United States did \npresent a number of very real social problems to the country. We \ncreated a commission on gambling to study those impacts and to make \nrecommendations to us with respect to them. The net effect of the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Wyoming would be at least for a \ntime--I wish the moratorium were for a longer period of time, but for a \nperiod of time to allow that commission to hold its hearings, to work \non its recommendations and perhaps give it the opportunity to make \nrecommendations to us in this connection while those recommendations \nstill may have some meaning rather than to wait until after it is all \nover. The offer of the Senator, the meaning of his amendment, is simply \nto say, ``look, why should this simply be a decision made by the Indian \ntribes themselves and the Department of the Interior without an \neffective right of veto, or an effective right to have these requests \nmeet the requirements of the general laws of each of the States \nconcerned?\"\n  I cannot think of a more reasonable request. I certainly can't \nbelieve that it is unreasonable to say that we should have a pause in \nthe creation of enclaves outside of reservations, in communities in \nwhich the Secretary of the Interior can authorize gambling, when we are \nway beyond reservation boundaries themselves.\n  In fact, I don't think--I don't know the answer to this question--\nthat many of these new casinos are going up in areas that are on the \nreservation. I know one current request to the State of Washington is \nfor a location 50, 60, 100 miles from the reservation that promotes it, \nright at the front gate of an Air Force base. There is no promise by \nthe Indian tribe that any significant share, any significant number of \nthe\n\n[[Page S9560]]\n\nmembers of the tribe will be employed in that casino. Almost certainly \nit will be run by an outside contractor and the tribe will get a \ncertain percentage of the take. It is not going to provide real job \nopportunities there, but it will have the same effect that every other \ncasino has. The money that is spent there is not being spent in small \nbusinesses in the community, or in other communities. There will be a \ncertain addition to the number of addicted gamblers and broken \nfamilies. And we don't have the opportunity to consider all of these \nimpacts.\n  The proposal by the Senator from Wyoming gives us an opportunity, for \n1 year, to pause to determine whether, whatever the positive impacts of \nthis law are, they are not outweighed by the negative impacts. It is \nnot permanent in nature. It will not outlast the effectiveness of this \n1-year appropriations bill. But it will cause us to be able to consider \nthese impacts.\n  I don't believe that in all these years since 1989 we have ever \ndebated this issue on the floor of the Senate. Certainly we have not \ndone so because of any bill reported by the Indian Affairs Committee. \nIn fact, it would seem to me that the goals of the vice chairman of the \ncommittee, the Senator from Hawaii, would be better served if we passed \nthis moratorium. I am certain that, if we pass the moratorium, the \nIndian Affairs Committee will consider the matter urgently, and I \nstrongly suspect we will see a bill of some sort reported by it. But, \nif history is any guide, withdrawing the amendment in exchange for \nhearings will cause us to be back here 1 year from today talking about \nthe same issue under the same set of circumstances that we are talking \nabout it today but with a dozen or more additional Indian casinos \nacross the country creating problems in each and every community in \nwhich they exist.\n  So I must say that I strongly support the effort being made by the \nSenator from Wyoming. I think it is the right answer. I think it is a \nthoughtful answer to a real national challenge that involves far more \nthan the question of whether or not particular Indian tribes are making \nparticular degrees of profits from these activities, or not. This is a \nquestion that goes far, far beyond that and I think can only be \naddressed thoughtfully and objectively, considering all of its impacts, \nif we have the kind of pause for which the amendment calls.\n\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the \npendency of this legislation, Tony Danna, a congressional fellow in my \noffice, be granted the privilege of the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I very sadly find I must rise and respond \nto the statement just made by my friend from Washington. First, he \nstated that a promise of a hearing is a hollow one. I find this rather \nsad, because I have always considered any promise that I have made for \nhearings as a very serious one. In fact, the hearings that the Senator \nalluded to were held by the Indian Affairs Committee in an extra large \ncommittee hearing room, and we accommodated every witness that was \nsubmitted to us by the Senator from Washington. We invited every person \nthat was on his list.\n  Furthermore, we made it known to the attorneys general and the \nGovernors of the several States. None wished to be heard. Every Indian \ncountry spoke up against the Senator's proposition. I don't think that \nwas a hearing that was taken lightly.\n  As to the hearings that will commence on October 8, I would like to \npoint out, respectfully, that the bill that we will be considering is a \nresult of over a year of consultation with attorneys general, with \nIndian leaders, with Governors. Before that, for 2 years Senator McCain \nand I traveled to the several States meeting personally, eyeball to \neyeball, with attorneys general, with Governors. We spent hours, we \nspent days, weeks, months, meeting with these officials to discuss the \nIndian Gaming Regulatory Act. We did not take our responsibilities \nlightly. We take it very seriously, especially in my case when I am \nopposed to gaming. I don't want to see people running gaming \noperations, people that I would not invite into my home. We take it \nvery seriously.\n  There was another matter that was brought up by my friend from \nWashington. He stated that Indian nations were purchasing parcels of \nland and having them placed into trusts by the Interior Department, and \nthen establishing gaming operations. This is the law that was passed 8 \nyears ago:\n\n       Gaming regulated by this act shall not be conducted on \n     lands acquired by the Secretary in trust for the benefit of \n     an Indian tribe after the date of the enactment of this act, \n     unless the Governor of the State in which the gaming activity \n     is to be conducted concurs in the Secretary's determination.\n\n  May I make this flatout statement, that the Interior Department has \nnot approved any gaming activity on any land acquired and placed in \ntrust if such gaming activity did not meet the concurrence of the \nGovernor. That is the law of the land. One would gather from the \ndiscussions of the Senator from Washington that Indians are, helter \nskelter, buying properties all over this Nation, placing them in trust \nand then, in turn, establishing gaming enterprises.\n  Yes, it is true that Indians are purchasing lands. They are trying to \nget back lands that belonged to them that were part of their \nreservations and taken away in violation of treaties and then placed in \ntrust. But then they need the approval of the Governor, and, if the \nGovernor has not granted this approval, there has been no gaming \nactivity. That is a fact, sir.\n  I can assure my colleagues that the promise we make of a hearing is \nnot a hollow one. We will accommodate every witness that they submit to \nus. We will give them ample time to testify. If it means meeting a week \nor 2 weeks, we will do so, because the matter before us is an important \none.\n  Yes, there are tribes that are making money on this. There are tribes \nthat are flourishing as a result of gaming activities. But there are \nonly 8 tribes out of 121 casinos that are making money. The Nation at \nthis moment is spending about $40 billion in gaming. Of that amount, $3 \nbillion is being spent in Indian country, but the profits of less than \n10 percent go to the Indians at this time.\n  So, we have treated the Indians badly. Let's not exacerbate that.\n  Mr. President, this is from the Secretary of the Interior:\n\n       I respectfully request that you oppose this type of \n     amendment to the Interior appropriations bill. I have \n     recommended to the President that he veto similar legislative \n     amendments placed in previous appropriations bills.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                The Secretary of the Interior,\n\n                                                       Washington.\n     Hon. Slade Gorton,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, \n         Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gorton: I understand that Senator Enzi intends \n     to offer an amendment to the FY 1998 Interior Appropriations \n     bill which would amend the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \n     (IGRA). The Department strongly objects to the proposed \n     amendment for several reasons.\n       IGRA was enacted to allow Indian tribes the opportunity to \n     pursue gaming for economic development on Indian lands. Since \n     1988, Indian gaming, regulated under IGRA, has provided \n     benefits to over 120 tribes and to their surrounding \n     communities in over 20 states. As required by law, revenues \n     have been directed to programs and facilities to improve the \n     health, safety, educational opportunities and quality of life \n     for Indian people.\n       The Department also objects to substantive policy \n     amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act without \n     hearings involving Indian tribes, state officials and the \n     regulated community. We have consistently supported efforts \n     to build a consensus between tribes and states for amendments \n     to IGRA that would improve the compacting process and \n     increase regulatory capacity. The Senate Committee on Indian \n     Affairs has scheduled a hearing on October 8, 1997 which will \n     focus on S. 1077, a bill to amend the Indian Gaming \n     Regulatory Act. This orderly process allows all parties \n     involved in Indian gaming to contribute testimony on how or \n     whether IGRA should be amended. Significantly amending IGRA \n     through the appropriations process circumvents the legitimate \n     expectation of tribal governments that their views will be \n     heard and considered.\n       The Secretary's trust responsibility to the tribes \n     coincides with Congress' requirement\n\n[[Page S9561]]\n\n     of only disapproving gaming compacts if they violate IGRA or \n     other Federal law. The proposed amendment would require both \n     state gubernational and legislative approvals, which would in \n     most cases present yet another barrier to a tribe's \n     successfully negotiating the long and complex procedure \n     necessary for entering into tribal gaming. Moreover, the \n     amendment requiring two state-level approval of a tribal-\n     state compact raises serious issues of Constitutional law \n     because it infringes on the State's Constitutional rights of \n     self government.\n       I respectfully request that you oppose this type of \n     amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill. I have \n     recommended to the President that he veto similar legislative \n     amendments placed in previous appropriations bills.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bruce Babbitt.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I listened to the debate, discussion, the \ncolloquy that has occurred between the Senator from Hawaii and the \nSenator from Wyoming, who is the sponsor of this amendment. I read the \namendment proposed by the Senator from Wyoming, and I believe that it \ndoes not in any way interfere with the operation of existing tribal-\nState compacts. It has no operative effect on those agreements, and I \ndo not understand that the Senator from Wyoming intends to have any \noperating effects.\n  Further, it is my understanding from reading the amendment that the \nSenator's intent is designed to prevent the Secretary of the Interior \nfrom unilaterally approving a compact and bypassing the State process \nthat has been established. He attempts to accomplish this by imposing a \n1-year moratorium.\n  No. 1, it does not in any way have an operative effect on existing \ntribal-State compacts.\n  No. 2, I think it is fair to say that the purpose of it is to prevent \nthe Secretary of the Interior, in effect, from bypassing the process, \nthe State compact negotiating process, to unilaterally approve such.\n  I support what the Senator from Wyoming is trying to accomplish.\n  I have had conversations with the Secretary of the Interior in the \npast, and I know he believes that he has the ability to do that \nunilaterally.\n  Having said that, the point that is made by the Senator from Hawaii \nis absolutely accurate. That is, as this language is cast in its \npresent form, it would preempt the State process by requiring both the \nGovernor and the State legislature to concur with any compact that has \nbeen negotiated with the tribal government. The Senator from Hawaii is \nabsolutely correct in the statement that he makes.\n  I believe that the Senator from Wyoming, responding to that concern, \nhas offered language that addresses that issue when he proposes to \nchange or modify his amendment by striking line 7 and interlineating in \nits place instead ``in accordance with the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nand State law,'' and at the bottom of page 2, striking all after the \nword ``approved'' on line 17 and inserting similar language. I believe \nthat he accomplishes the objective that I support and responds to the \nvery legitimate point that the Senator from Hawaii makes.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1221, As Modified\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe modified in the manner in which the Senator from Wyoming proposed.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BRYAN. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I certainly agree to that change. I had not \nproposed that change. I will be happy to do it. The intent was never to \ninfringe on any of the State procedures, but to accommodate the States \nin the way they have operated in the past. I ask for that change. In \nthe meantime we have gotten it typed up, and I send this provision to \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the appropriate place insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC.   . LIMITATIONS ON CERTAIN INDIAN GAMING OPERATIONS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--for purposes of this section, the \n     following definitions shall apply:\n       (1) Class iii gaming.--The term ``class III gaming'' has \n     the meaning provided that term in section 4(b) of the Indian \n     Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. 2703(8)).\n       (2) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n     meaning provided that term in section 4(e) of the Indian \n     Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. \n     450(e)).\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Department of Interior.\n       (4) Tribal-state compact.--The term ``Tribal-State \n     compact'' means a Tribal-State compact referred to in section \n     11(d) of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25 U.S.C. \n     2710(d)).\n       (b) Class III Gaming Compacts.--\n       (1) In general.--\n       (A) Prohibition.--During fiscal year 1998, the Secretary \n     may not expend any funds made available under this Act to \n     review or approve any initial Tribal-State compact for class \n     III gaming entered into the or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act. This provision shall not apply to any Tribal-State \n     compact which has been approved by a State in accordance with \n     State law and the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph may be \n     construed to prohibit the review or approval by the Secretary \n     of a renewal or revision of, or amendment to a Tribal-State \n     compact that is not covered under subparagraph (A).\n       (2) Tribal-state compacts.--During fiscal year 1998, \n     notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Tribal-State \n     compact for class III gaming shall be considered to have been \n     approved by the Secretary by reason of the failure of the \n     Secretary to approve or disapprove that compact. This \n     provision shall not apply to any Tribal-State compact which \n     has been approved by a State in accordance with State law and \n     the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. So that I understand the parliamentary \nsituation, the amendment is modified in the manner in which the Senator \nfrom Wyoming originally proposed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Hawaii for \nhis thoughtful comments, because he is absolutely correct that the \nlanguage that was originally selected would, indeed, preempt State law. \nI do not want to be a party to that. He, obviously, does not want to be \na party to that as well.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 1222 to Amendment No. 1221, As Modified\n\n(Purpose: To express the Sense of the Senate concerning enforcement of \n                   the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act)\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I send to the desk a second-degree \namendment, on behalf of Senator Reid and myself, and ask for its \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Bryan], for himself and Mr. \n     Reid, proposes an amendment numbered 1222 to amendment No. \n     1221.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INDIAN GAMING.\n\n       ``It is the Sense of the Senate that the United States \n     Department of Justice should vigorously enforce the \n     provisions of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act requiring an \n     approved tribal/state gaming compact prior to the initiation \n     of Class III gaming on Indian lands.\n\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to explain the purpose of my \namendment, which is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment. When the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act was enacted in 1988, the year before I joined \nthis body, a central concept was that class III gambling, such as \ncasino and parimutuel gambling, could be conducted on Indian lands with \na tribal-State compact approved by the Governors and tribes and then by \nthe Secretary of the Interior.\n  Today, there are hundreds of Indian gaming establishments across the \nNation offering class III gambling. I might just add parenthetically \nthat our experience in Nevada is that we currently have five such \ntribal agreements in which five tribes have entered into agreements \nwith Nevada's Governor pursuant to the provisions of the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act, and those compacts have been approved.\n  I want to make it very clear that I support the intent of the act, \nand I support the right of Indian tribal governments to enter into \ncompacts with States and to pursue gaming activity at a class III \nlevel.\n  Most of the tribal governments that have entered into these \nagreements are operating under the approval of these tribal-State \ncompacts, as contemplated by the original law. However, almost\n\n[[Page S9562]]\n\nfrom the beginning, there have been some tribes who have chosen to \noperate illegal class III gambling without an approved tribal-State \ncompact. Over time, some of these gaming operations have become legal \nby negotiating compacts with the States in which they are located. Some \ngambling operators, including some who take in millions of dollars each \nyear, have chosen to disregard, indeed, to flout the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act by blatantly continuing to operate illegal class III \ngames without an approved compact, as contemplated by the Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act.\n  Many of the Nation's Governors have appealed to Congress and to \nJustice to stop this; simply stated, to enforce the law. In the \nmeantime, these tribes continue to operate illegal gambling, believing \nthat the Justice Department would not move to shut them down.\n  To date, they have largely been right. The Department of Justice and \nU.S. attorneys across the country have done an abysmal job of enforcing \nIndian gambling laws. During the year since enactment of the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act, I have had several discussions with Justice \nabout this problem, both the previous administration and the current \nadministration. None of these conversations have been very \nsatisfactory.\n  It is time that illegal gambling is stopped. The Indian Gaming \nRegulatory Act is an important law, and it should be enforced. There is \nsimply no excuse for Justice not to do that. There are widespread \nconcerns about the lack of regulation in Indian-run gaming. Today, we \nshould and must make it clear to Justice that this Congress expects its \nlaws to be enforced. If Justice moved tomorrow to enforce the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act, those who conduct legal Indian gaming under the \nprovisions of the law would benefit.\n  I hope my colleagues will join with me in supporting this sense-of-\nthe-Senate provision. It is very simple, very straightforward. It does \nnothing to impede legal Indian gambling.\n  I repeat that I support legal Indian gambling. We have such in \nNevada. By this sense-of-the-Senate amendment, we are simply telling \nJustice that they should enforce existing Federal laws against illegal \ngambling. Simply: Do your job, enforce the law.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have no other speakers on this side on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I think this is a nice addition to the \namendment that we have, and I do support it.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, as a result of the Supreme Court \ndecision in Seminole of Florida v. State of Florida, we are in a \nsituation that could result in tribal gambling compacts being approved \nby the Secretary of the Interior without the benefit of State approval. \nI support the Senator's interest in protecting States rights to help \ndetermine the degree of gambling that could occur on Indian \nreservations.\n  The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act [IGRA] was carefully constructed to \nprotect both tribal and States rights in negotiating compacts that \nwould make casino style gambling legal. When the Supreme Court decided \nthe Seminole case, it held that the provisions in IGRA that allowed a \ntribe to sue a State for failure to negotiate were unconstitutional. \nStates are protected from suit by the 11th amendment to the \nConstitution.\n  We now have a void that some fear could be filled with a Secretarial \ndetermination to establish an alternate procedure that completely \navoids State participation in the compacting process. IGRA requires a \ntribal-state compact before casino type gambling is allowed to operate \non Indian reservations. This compact is intended to reflect State \ngambling law and hence varies from State to State.\n  Under IGRA, a refusal by the State to negotiate with a tribe triggers \na mediation process. If the mediation process does not result in an \nagreement, the Secretary is given authority to issue a compact based on \nthe mediators recommendation.\n  Senator Enzi is proposing language that would prohibit the Secretary \nof the Interior from approving compacts that do not have State \napproval. His amendment does not affect existing casinos that might be \nnegotiating with States for renewal of their compacts, but it does \nprohibit the Secretary from issuing compacts to legalize gambling if \nthose compacts are without State concurrence.\n  Mr. President, the first version I saw of Senator Enzi's amendment \nraised a strong concern in New Mexico that the Senator from Wyoming was \nattempting to cancel the compacts in New Mexico that were recently \napproved because the Secretary of the Interior chose not to approve or \ndisapprove. According to the provisions of IGRA, the Secretary is \nallowed 45 days to act. If he does not act, the compacts are deemed \nvalid.\n  New Mexico is the only State affected by the original language of the \nEnzi amendment. New Mexico was the only State to get compact approval \nof its compacts in 1997 because the Secretary did not approve or \ndisapprove the compacts. I immediately discussed this situation with \nSenator Enzi and he assured me that he did not intend to target the New \nMexico compacts because they are the product of years of tribal and \nState negotiations, law suits, court decisions, and legislative action.\n  Senator Enzi has changed his amendment to protect States like New \nMexico that have State concurrence in the gambling compacting process. \nWith this change, I am able to support his amendment to prohibit the \nSecretary of the Interior from unilaterally creating compacts for \nIndian gambling without State concurrence in the process. I believe his \namendment is important to protect the spirit of IGRA that recognizes \nthe competing interests of tribal and State sovereignty in determining \nprecise Indian gambling agreements.\n  I recognize the new difficulty faced by tribes that do not yet have \ntribal-State compacts in light of the Seminole decision. I believe a 1-\nyear moratorium on Secretarial authority is appropriate as insurance \nagainst new compacts that avoid State participation. I am also \nsupportive of legislative action that would clarify the process for \ntribes in States that refuse to negotiate, but I want to avoid a \nrestructuring of the tribal-State balances we have struck in IGRA.\n  There remain questions about the conditions and extent to which the \nSecretary and the tribe could initiate mediation and Secretarial \ncompacts. We need to address these questions, but I do not believe we \nshould leave the solution solely to the Secretary of the Interior. I am \npleased that Senator Enzi has changed his amendment to recognize the \nNew Mexico compacts and other compacts with State concurrence. They are \nclearly valid compacts under IGRA and we should not tamper with them in \nan appropriations bill.\n  I am now in agreement with Senator Enzi's effort to prohibit new \ncompacts from becoming legally binding if those compacts do not have \nState approval. New Mexico tribes and State government have gone \nthrough a long and hard process to reach agreement under IGRA. New \nMexico voters have been well represented and tribal rights have been \nrecognized. I believe each State should be allowed to participate as \nfully as New Mexico has in determining the extent of legal gambling on \nIndian reservations within its borders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the second-degree \namendment? If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1222) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, now that we have added the second-degree \namendment to my amendment, I would like to conclude my remarks so we \ncan move on with the other discussion that is so important to this \nappropriations bill.\n  I do have to respond to some comments that were made earlier. I am \nnot trying to do a piecemeal approach that will destroy what the Indian \nAffairs\n\n[[Page S9563]]\n\nCommittee is doing. I commend them for any activities they take. This \nis just a very small part of the appropriations, and it is to prevent \nthe expenditure of any moneys by the Secretary of the Interior that \nwould bypass the State's right to an involvement in this process.\n  I really appreciate the offer for the hearings, the offer to bring \nwitnesses, even so generous as to suggest that we could use 3 days. We \nhave been on this for almost an hour and a half, and that is really all \nI need, and I have used only a small portion of that. I think we have \ntalked about this issue to the extent that we can, because I have \nmodified it to put it in a situation where I am maintaining business as \nusual. We are assuring that there is a State's right to involvement in \nthe Indian gaming issue. That is the way it is at the moment, and this \namendment doesn't make any change in that.\n  There is some talk about the words ``1-year moratorium'' in this. \nThere is a 1-year moratorium because this is an appropriation, and the \nappropriation deals with 1 year's worth of expenditures, but it is not \na 1-year moratorium against the tribes being able to do anything. It is \na 1-year moratorium against the Secretary of the Interior being able to \nimpose himself on the process. The Secretary of the Interior cannot \nmake Federal law. We do that right here in conjunction with the House \nfolks. I am trying to make sure that we can keep that same process. So \nwe are not really asking for a 1-year moratorium on Indian gambling.\n  I heard the letter that was read, and I assume that letter was \nwritten before the changes were made here that I have allowed in this \namendment. If that letter was written and still intends to be a part of \nthis discussion, I have to say that I am offended. I am offended that \nthe Secretary of the Interior wants to impose his will and a threat of \na Presidential veto over business as usual that has already been passed \nby the Senate.\n  That is not a role that the Secretary of the Interior can have. We \ncannot give him that right. That is our right. That is our \nresponsibility. That is what we were elected to this great body to do: \nto make the law. He can suggest guidelines, and we already have a law \nthat suggests how this process works. The amendment, as it is now \nwritten, assures that all States have their rights in this process and \nthat the law continues the way it is now. I have sent the change to the \ndesk.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Alabama, Senator \nSessions, and the Senator from Missouri, Senator Ashcroft, be made \ncosponsors of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the body for their time and ask for their support \non this important amendment.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it may very well be this amendment can be \ndealt with by voice vote, but there also may be one more speaker who \nwishes to speak on it. We are checking that out, and so for the moment, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kempthorne). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe it is appropriate to put the \nquestion on the Enzi amendment, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment No. 1221, as modified, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 1221), as modified as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1223\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funding for law enforcement activities \n        of the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reduce gang violence)\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk. I do not \nknow whether it is at the desk yet, but I think it is not.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the committee amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Campbell, and Mr. Hatch, proposes an amendment numbered 1223.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title I, insert the following:\n       ``Sec. 1  . In addition to the amounts made available to \n     the Bureau of Indian Affairs under this title, $4,840,000 \n     shall be made available to the Bureau of Indian Affairs to be \n     used for Bureau of Indian Affairs special law enforcement \n     efforts to reduce gang violence.''\n       On page 96, line 9, strike ``$5,840,000'' and insert \n     ``$1,000,000''.\n\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. As my colleagues can see from the reading of the amendment, \nit is a very short, very simple amendment, that simply takes $4,800,000 \nfrom one project and provides it to another for dealing with the \nproblem of gang violence on our Indian reservations. I ask for my \ncolleagues' support.\n  The amendment is cosponsored by the distinguished chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, Senator Campbell, and the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch.\n  This amendment, as read, would provide the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nlaw enforcement with $4.84 million for antigang activities, equipment, \nand personnel. The offset would be from the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center for Scholars fund.\n  The Senate Judiciary and Indian Affairs Committees held a joint \nhearing yesterday, Mr. President, which examined the growing problem of \ngang violence in Indian country. Therefore, I think it propitious that \nwe are able to offer the amendment today to help alleviate the problem \nthat was identified in that hearing.\n  We heard from representatives of several Indian tribes, as well as \nthe Justice Department, about the problem of gang violence on our \nreservations.\n  Here are some of what we found.\n  According to the Justice Department, violent crime nationwide has \ndeclined significantly between 1992 and 1996. The overall violent crime \nrate has dropped about 17 percent, and homicides are down 22 percent. \nThat is the good news.\n  Here is the bad news. In the same period of time, homicides in Indian \ncountry rose an astonishing 87 percent, Mr. President. The Indian \nHealth Service tells us that the homicide rate among Indians is the \nhighest among any ethnic group in the country--2\\1/2\\ times the rate \namong white Americans. Numerous tribes, including the Navajo Nation in \nmy State of Arizona, record homicide rates that exceed those of \nnotoriously violent urban areas in our country.\n  The FBI reports a dramatic increase in violent crime attributable to \ngangs in Indian country, nearly doubling between 1994 and 1997. The \nBIA's law enforcement division identified 181 active gangs on or near \nIndian reservations in 1994. By 1997, that estimate had risen to 375 \ngangs with approximately 4,650 gang members. The Navajo Nation alone \nreports at least 75 active gangs. Think about that for a moment, Mr. \nPresident. Just one Indian tribe in the State of Arizona has 75 active \ngangs.\n  There is a small reservation just east of the Phoenix area that has \n19 active gangs on it. These are among Indian kids.\n  On the Menominee reservation in Wisconsin, there was a 293 percent \nincrease in the number of juveniles arrested between 1990 and 1994. And \nbetween 1995 and 1997, the U.S. Attorney's Office in the District of \nNew Mexico has noted an evolution in juvenile killings from reckless \nmanslaughters to vicious, intentional killings.\n  The crimes can be heinous. On May 15, 1994, a 20-year-old Subway \nsandwich shop clerk was gunned down while on the job on the Salt River \nPima-Maricopa Indian Community in Arizona. That is the reservation I \njust alluded to a moment ago. Shot six times, including once in the \nface, young Pat Lindsay later died. His attackers stole sandwiches, \nchips, and $100 from the sandwich shop.\n\n[[Page S9564]]\n\n  On South Dakota's Lower Brule Reservation in 1996, four gang members \nbroke into a police officer's car and threw in a Molotov cocktail.\n  Mr. President, why is it that Indian country is particularly \nsusceptible to gang violence? Part of the answer lies in demographics. \nThe American Indian population is fast growing and increasingly \nyouthful. Based on the 1990 census, 33 percent of the Indian population \nwas younger than 15-years-old versus 22 percent of the general \npopulation.\n  On the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona, about half of the \nreservation's population is expected to be under the age of 18 by the \nyear 2000.\n  Another reason for the growing problem is socioeconomic. American \nIndians lag in comparison to the general population, experiencing \ncultural disruption, poverty, chronic unemployment, and \ndisproportionate rates of alcoholism and substance abuse. These create \nan environment in which gangs can flourish.\n  Insufficient law enforcement and detention capability also contribute \nto the problem. Juveniles may be arrested, but tribes often lack the \ndetention facilities, the probation officers, adequate social services, \nincluding substance abuse programs, creating a revolving door for these \nyoung people.\n  So, Mr. President, the needs for this funding are apparent and \nurgent.\n  I realize of course the need to offset the additional funding \nproposed in this amendment, this $4.8 million. The offset we are \nproposing comes from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars. Funding for the center would be set at the level recommended \nin the House-passed version of the Interior appropriations bill--$1 \nmillion. The reduction, I said, amounts to $4.8 million.\n  The Wilson Center was the subject of a Washington Post article in \nJuly. And I ask, Mr. President, unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 18, 1997]\n\n         House Cut Would Kill Woodrow Wilson's Living Memorial\n\n                           (By Stephen Barr)\n\n       More than 30 years ago, when Congress decided to honor \n     Woodrow Wilson, it adopted a suggestion by Wilson's grandson \n     and created a ``living institution'' instead of erecting a \n     more traditional marble and stone monument to the nation's \n     28th president.\n       Today, that living memorial--the Woodrow Wilson \n     International Center for Scholars--operates with public and \n     private money in antiquated offices at the Smithsonian \n     Castle. The center is not a think tank and does not take \n     positions on issues, but sees itself as a house where \n     scholars in a variety of disciplines can gather.\n       But the Wilson Center appears to be at a crossroads. A \n     review by the National Academy for Public Administration \n     (NAPA) portrays the center as a splintered operation, \n     suffering from ``damaged morale'' and ineffective leadership. \n     The House, which ordered the review, voted Tuesday to give \n     the center $1 million for fiscal year 1998, essentially \n     enough money to disband.\n       The House decision means the center's future will be in \n     doubt until later this year, since the Senate seems likely to \n     continue its funding. A Senate Appropriations subcommittee is \n     scheduled to meet today, and a spokeswoman for Sen. Slade \n     Gorton (R-Wash.) said he would propose that the center get \n     the same amount it currently receives, about $5.8 million.\n       The dispute over the center has been overshadowed by the \n     clash over funding for the National Endowment for the Arts \n     (NEA), which receives its funding from the same \n     appropriations bill. Like the NEA, the Wilson Center is \n     caught up in the debate over how much the government should \n     subsidize cultural and intellectual activities.\n       Center supporters stress that it is neither partisan nor \n     ideological. ``I can't understand why the conservatives \n     should be voting against the center,'' said Gertrude \n     Himmelfarb, a neoconservative and professor emeritus at the \n     City University of New York. ``It is the least trendy of all \n     the institutions in the United States. Of all institutions, \n     this is one they should be supporting.''\n       But the center also faces a harsher kind of criticism: that \n     its existence no longer seems to make any difference, \n     particularly in public policy debates.\n       ``I want them to be relevant,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula (R-\n     Ohio), who heads the House subcommittee that placed the \n     center in jeopardy. ``Are they relevant as far as agencies of \n     government in town? I'm not sure they are. Are they relevant \n     to the public? Maybe a little bit.'' Regula added, ``They \n     don't seem to have a sense of mission; they're just kind of \n     drifting.''\n       The NAPA report argues that the Wilson center's operations \n     need to be pulled together so that visiting scholars not only \n     pursue their research but also contribute to the center's \n     specialized geographic programs. The principal purpose of the \n     center, the NAPA report said, is ``the bridging of the worlds \n     of learning and public affairs.''\n       Rep. David E. Price (D-N.C.), who led an effort in the \n     House to defend the center, said many of the center's \n     research efforts have ``a strong public policy connection'' \n     and said the NAPA report did not address the center's \n     relevance to such issues ``one way or another.''\n       Charles Blitzer, 69, a target of the NAPA report, has \n     presided over the center as its director for the last eight \n     years. During an interview at his office, where he chain-\n     smoked as the air conditioner struggled against the searing \n     heat outside, Blitzer noted that the NAPA report concluded \n     the center ``merits continued support.''\n       He dismissed much of the report's criticism, saying that \n     ``we are stuck on a semantic problem'' about how to define \n     the center's ``mission'' in Washington. For the most part \n     Blitzer said, he believes that scholars at the center \n     should be left free to pursue their studies.\n       According to the NAPA report, the center's only requirement \n     on fellows, in addition to fulfilling their study objectives, \n     is a five-minute presentation on their project to colleagues \n     and staff.\n       The center annually selects about 35 fellows, who receive \n     an average stipend of $43,000 and spend their time studying \n     and writing. Previous and current fellows include Raul \n     Alfonsin, the former president of Argentina; Anatoly \n     Dobrynin, the former Soviet ambassador to the United States; \n     Washington Post reporter Thomas B. Edsall; author Betty \n     Freidan; New York Times columnist Thomas L. Friedman; \n     novelist Carlos Fuentes; Harvard University professor Samuel \n     P. Huntington; and Itamar Rabinovich, the former Israeli \n     ambassador here.\n       More than 100 other scholars annually pass through the \n     doors of the center's geographic-based programs. They include \n     the Kennan Institute for Advanced Russian Studies and \n     programs devoted to Latin American, Asian, East and West \n     European, and U.S. studies. The center also operates the Cold \n     War International History Project and the Environmental \n     Change and Security Project, exploring such issues as global \n     population trends and how they fit into U.S. foreign policy.\n       Some of Blitzer's colleagues agree that an artificial \n     division separates Wilson fellows from the various programs \n     and needs to be addressed. ``Scholars working on their own \n     research can enrich programmatic activities and vice versa.'' \n     said Kennan Institute director Blair Ruble.\n       The NAPA report also heightened tensions over Blitzer's \n     management of the center, which was criticized in the NAPA \n     report. Blitzer rejected the criticism, saying he has worked \n     to improve the center's endowments, operations and \n     scholarship.\n       When he arrived, Blitzer said, the center had an endowment \n     of $4 million and $2 million in debts. Now, he said, the \n     center's endowment is valued at $24 million, and $3 million \n     has been raised to furnish new quarters in the Ronald Reagan \n     building at the Federal Triangle, where the center has a 30-\n     year, rent-free arrangement.\n       Regula has expressed concerns about the Wilson Center's \n     role since the early 1980s and at one point opposed Blitzer's \n     plans to move the center into the Reagan building. Now, \n     Regula's funding cut and the NAPA study have plunged center \n     officials into internal meetings on how to address what Latin \n     American program director Joseph S. Tulchin called a \n     ``constructive kick in the pants.''\n       Regula said he has ``no qualms'' about abolishing Wilson's \n     memorial if Congress concludes the tax dollars being spent do \n     not advance public policy or prove useful to society.\n       But, he added, ``I'm a fan of Woodrow Wilson. For his time, \n     he was a great president, and I like the living memorial. To \n     me, it beats bricks and mortar.''\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, as reported in this Post article, the Wilson \nCenter selects about 35 fellows each year who receive an average \nstipend of $43,000 to spend their time studying and writing. The only \nrequirement of the fellows is that in addition to fulfilling their \nstudy objectives, they provide a 5-minute presentation on their project \nto their colleagues and staff.\n  A review of the center's operations by the National Academy for \nPublic Administration earlier this year portrays the center as a \nsplintered operation, ineffective, and drifting. The House \nAppropriations Committee's report on the Interior bill notes that the \nonly accomplishment the academy could cite for the center was obtaining \nnew office space on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  The House committee concluded:\n\n       [T]he Center has operated so long without a clear mission \n     that it may be impossible to reestablish one within an \n     organization that has no relevance to real world public \n     policy issues.\n\n  It seems to me that we could put this $4.8 million currently \nallocated to an operation that has been widely recognized as drifting \nand ineffective toward the real and growing problem of gang violence in \nIndian country. That is what this amendment is all about, Mr. \nPresident.\n\n[[Page S9565]]\n\n  I express my appreciation to Chairman Campbell and to Chairman Hatch \nfor joining me in this amendment and for their leadership on this issue \ngenerally. I hope this amendment will be accepted and that we will \nbegin putting the resources we need into fighting the growing problem \nof gang violence in Indian country.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. I rise in the firmest opposition to this proposal.\n  Might I first state that I have not the least difficulty with the \nthought of the distinguished Senators that there might be more funds \nmade available to deal with gang violence among Indian populations. \nThat is a perfectly reasonable proposition. I do not claim any specific \nknowledge in my awareness of anything notable in that way of difficulty \nin the State of New York.\n  But, sir, I am appalled that this reasonable, modest proposal should \nbe advanced at the expense and the effect of destroying the national \nmemorial to President Woodrow Wilson. I have to tell you I was \naggrieved to hear the gratuitous comments about the Woodrow Wilson \nCenter that have just been made here on the floor.\n  There is a history, Mr. President, and I will not go into it in any \ngreat detail, but I am prepared to spend the rest of the day and \ntomorrow, if need be. But let me see if I cannot be brief about this so \nthat the Senate can get on with its work.\n  In 1961, the Congress, by joint resolution, called upon President \nKennedy to appoint a bipartisan commission for the purpose of proposing \nan appropriate memorial to Woodrow Wilson in the Nation's Capital. We \nhave just seen the opening of the superbly designed memorial to \nPresident Roosevelt. In a time sequence, it is not inappropriate that a \nmemorial to President Wilson would take place a quarter century \nearlier.\n  In 1968, after a bipartisan commission had deliberated the matter, it \nwas proposed that there be a living memorial to President Wilson--not a \nstatue and not a fountain. And in all truth, he was never known to be \nseated on a horse.\n  The idea arose from the same proposition put forth by the American \nHistorical Association that said that, for all the fine universities, \nthere was not a center for advanced studies here in the Nation's \nCapital where persons from around the world, and principally from the \nUnited States, could come and work in our archives, work on our various \nsubjects, land that wouldn't it be a fine thing that there should be \nsuch, and why not have it as a memorial to President Wilson, who was a \nuniversity professor, university president, a great teacher.\n\n  In 1968, the Woodrow Wilson Memorial Act was passed. The act's \npreamble stipulates that this memorial is not to be a statue or a \nbuilding bearing Wilson's name but rather a living institution \nexpressing ``his accomplishments as the 28th President of the United \nStates: A distinguished scholar, an outstanding university president \nand a brilliant advocate of international understanding.''\n  There is a nice bit of history here which I will not ask anybody to \nelucidate further, but the measure provides that the chairman of the \nboard of trustees be from the private sector and there be a mix of \npublic and private individuals, all appointed by the President.\n  On his last day in office, President Johnson appointed Vice President \nHubert Humphrey to be the first chairman of the first board of \ntrustees. It was something Hubert Humphrey, beloved Senator that we all \nknow and remember so well, that is what he wished to leave in public \nlife, as he assumed he would be doing, and go forward with.\n  It happened at that time I had been appointed assistant to President \nNixon. In my own work I have done some writing about Woodrow Wilson. \nPresident Nixon asked if I would be the first vice chairman. Now, there \nis a little bit of a problem here because if Lyndon B. Johnson was \nPresident, then Hubert H. Humphrey would be Vice President--not exactly \na person in the private sector--but President Nixon was not going to \nmake an issue of that.\n  This is something everybody knew about at the time and was excited \nabout at the time, and so we went forward. We have been at this now for \n30 years. The International Center has established an international \nreputation. The world over, there are persons in universities, in \ngovernments, who have been fellows here and retained a tie to the \ninstitution that is important. One does not wish to overstate, but it \nis an important fact of international life, particularly in the area of \ndiplomacy.\n  I might make the point that our present Secretary of State, most \nluminous and indefatigable Madeleine Albright, was a fellow at the \nWoodrow Wilson Center, and on the occasion of the 25th anniversary, \nPresident Bush arranged a dinner in the State Department. There were a \nseries of lectures. At one of these, Madeleine Albright had this sort \nof happy remark, in a lecture. She said, ``Let me begin by wishing a \nhappy 25th birthday to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars. I will never forget my own time at the center as a Wilson \nfellow. Where else can one do truly independent research, meet scholars \nfrom all over the world and get paid for working in a castle? I have \nalways felt in a town full of monuments, the center is unique because \nit is a living monument. It memorializes not only Wilson, but Wilson's \nlifelong effort as an educator and President, to map a trail for a \nfuture that would elude the traps of the past.''\n  She was referring, of course, to the Smithsonian Institution.\n  At the time the center began, small amounts of money were made \navailable from the Congress--about $5 million a year; now less. A \nfundraising effort has been made by the trustees to raise private \nfunds. They now are a larger part of the budget than what the Federal \nGovernment provides. But there was no place to locate. Such was the \nexpectation and understanding that the then Secretary of the \nSmithsonian, the Honorable S. Dillon Ripley, turned over that great \nRenwick Building, the Smithsonian Institution on the Mall, to the \ncenter. It's called among the family of Smithsonian workers the castle, \nand indeed it is a castle of sorts. It has been there ever since until \njust this moment. We have completed, on Pennsylvania Avenue, as the \nstatute requires and dictates, a building for the center as part of the \nRonald Reagan Building, which will be dedicated next spring.\n  Let me take the liberty, Mr. President, of citing comments of a few \nPresidents of the United States. First of all, Lyndon Johnson, who \nsigned the legislation, said ``The dream of a great scholarly center in \nthe Nation's Capital is as old as the Republic itself * * * This Center \ncould serve as an institution of learning that the 22nd century will \nregard as having influenced the 21st.''\n\n  There was a certain serendipity that its first 30 years should be \nlocated in the Smithsonian building. The Smithsonian building was \ncreated there for the advance and diffusion of knowledge--primarily in \nthe sciences but also in other areas. Here was the incubator for this \nnew center, ``an institution of learning that the 22nd century will \nregard as having influenced the 21st.''\n  Later in my remarks I will note that there is ample evidence that it \nhas already influenced the 20th century.\n  Jimmy Carter: ``The Wilson Center is a nucleus of intellectual \ncuriosity and collaboration on issues of critical importance to our \nnational well-being.''\n  George Bush, who, as I say, hosted a dinner at the State Department \non one of the anniversaries, said, ``In this alliance of scholars now \nworld-renowned for exploring some of the most vital issues that \nconfront mankind, Woodrow Wilson's ideals find their highest and most \neffective expression.''\n  Ronald Reagan, in whose building the center will be part: ``The work \nof this organization symbolizes the yearning by Americans to understand \nthe past and bring the lessons of history to bear upon the present.''\n  Richard M. Nixon: ``One of the most significant additions to \nPennsylvania Avenue will be an international center for scholars, to be \na living memorial to Woodrow Wilson. There could hardly be a more \nappropriate memorial to a President who combined a devotion to \nscholarship with a passion for peace. The District has long sought, and \nlong needed, a center for both men of letters and men of affairs.''\n  And now to our own President at this moment, William Jefferson \nClinton,\n\n[[Page S9566]]\n\nand this was just recently: ``Three years ago I had the pleasure of \nsigning legislation designating the great public space that will lead \nfrom Pennsylvania Avenue to the Woodrow Wilson International Center for \nScholars as 'Woodrow Wilson Plaza.' Now that the Woodrow Wilson Center \nis preparing to move into its own home, fronting on the plaza, I salute \nits world-renowned contributions to scholarship, international \nunderstanding, and public service over the last 30 years. The Wilson \nCenter will be a true living memorial to one of our great Presidents.''\n  I might add, just as a matter of serendipity, that the center will be \npart of that building construction, the Ronald Reagan Building, which \nwill finally complete, after 70 years, the Federal Triangle, which was \nbegun by Herbert Hoover, under Hoover's Presidency. Hoover was a great \nadmirer of Wilson and was himself an author of one of the finest books \never written on President Wilson.\n  This 30th anniversary, this impending move and the decision here in \nthe Congress to see that the building will finally go up--no hurry, 30 \nyears. It will be furnished out of private donations. Just this spring \nthere was a large dinner in New York where our most distinguished \nChairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Dr. Alan Greenspan, gave an \nextraordinary address at which we raised--it is a public matter--almost \n$1 million with a matching pledge for the furnishings, the books, the \ndesks, tables, and such.\n  On September 8 of this year the New York Times had an editorial on \nthe center saying, ``The center has been a tone of civility during \npolitical and cultural wars and a refuge for those persecuted \nelsewhere.''\n  A center for civility. You would be surprised how often a comment \nreturns to that quality in the Senate.\n  The Times goes on, ``The Center's House,'' referring to the House of \nRepresentatives, ``critics fault for lacking a public policy function \nby overemphasizing scholarly pursuits. This seems perversely to miss \nthe point. Washington is amply stocked with policy think tanks, and the \nCenter was never meant to churn out position papers. The hope, instead, \nwas to provide a forum where politicians and officials might encounter \nthose more alien muses of history, philosophy and literature.'' Could \nyou dispute that the center has stimulated prize-winning books, \nanimated innumerable public workshops and published a lively quarterly? \nEvery Federal dollar appropriated for the center is matched by a \nprivate donor.''\n\n  It goes on in that spirit.\n  The New York Times is generally thought to be a paper disposed to \nliberal views--its editorial page. The Weekly Standard, newly and \nhappily arrived in Washington, is nothing of the sort. Its editor, \nWilliam Kristol, is an avowed and energetic, hugely influential \nconservative. The Weekly Standard ran an editorial a little while ago \nwhen this dispute was coming out in the House, and it said, ``Save the \nWilson Quarterly!'' That is a published journal, scholarly, lively, \npublished once a quarter, and it said this: ``Having somehow resisted \nthe p.c.''--political correctness--``trendiness that has contaminated \nthe academy, the Wilson Center, under the auspices of the Smith1sonian \nInstitution, remains one of the few havens for disinterested \nscholarship * * *.''\n  I suppose, in the interest of full disclosure, I should say that I am \na regent of the Smithsonian, and I believe at this point I am the \nsenior regent appointed from the Senate, as well as the House.\n  But it says, ``Having somehow resisted the p.c. trendiness that has \ncontaminated the academy, the Wilson Center, under the auspices of the \nSmithsonian Institution, remains one of the few havens for \ndisinterested scholarship in the country.''\n  I began by quoting the New York Times editorial page, a page of \nliberal opinion. I went on to quote an editorial from the Weekly \nStandard, a journal of assertively conservative opinion.\n  Let me now quote George F. Will, one of the most learned, thoughtful, \nentertaining, and rewarding observers of the Washington scene we have \nhad in a long time. When he is not writing about baseball, he tends to \nwrite about politics. Occasionally, he enters the world of such as we \nare now talking about. He refers to an essay published in the Wilson \nQuarterly: ``The invaluable quarterly of the irreplaceable Woodrow \nWilson International Center for Scholars.''\n  See, we have here a living memorial to a great President, well \nestablished, known worldwide, read worldwide. There is a web site, \nthere is a radio program called ``Dialog.'' There is no end. There are \n200,000 listeners each week. We don't want to put this center at \njeopardy.\n  I am not in the least at a disinclination to provide funds for \njuvenile delinquency programs in Indian tribes or populations. But at \nthe cost, we can find those funds somewhere. To destroy this \nirreplaceable institution. We will start again. And, sir, it takes 30 \nyears to take root.\n  We have had a wonderful fortune in the persons who have led the \nCenter. James Billington, the present Librarian of Congress, himself a \ngreat historian, particularly of the Russian Empire, and then the \nSoviet Empire that succeeded it. James H. Billington is a trustee now, \nbut he was a great director for the longest while.\n  Then it was the fortune of the center to have for a long period \nanother distinguished scholar, a great administrator, great person, \nCharles Blitzer, who has just announced, at age 70, his retirement, but \nafter a distinguished career. He had been Assistant Secretary of the \nSmithsonian when the castle was opened up to welcome the new \ninstitution. He went from here to be director of the National Center \nfor the Humanities in North Carolina, and then he was summoned back to \nthe Wilson Center, and now having reached the age of retirement, has \nannounced he will retire at the time a successor is chosen. It might \ngive you a sense, sir, of the importance attached by Americans of every \ndisposition to the Center to know what the search committee is for the \nnew director.\n  First, James A. Baker III, former Secretary of State and trustee of \nthe Wilson Center. Next, James H. Billington, Librarian of Congress. \nMary Brown Bullock, a former fellow, former director of the Wilson \nCenter Asia Program, and now president of Agnes Scott College. William \nT. Coleman, Jr., a Wilson council member, former Secretary of \nTransportation, and a distinguished attorney here in Washington. I. \nMichael Heyman, a trustee and the Secretary of the Smithsonian \nInstitution. Gertrude Himmelfarb, one of the great scholars of our age, \na person who has transcended understanding of Victorian Britain. The \nBritish learn about their history from Gertrude Himmelfarb today. She \nwas formerly a fellow at the Center, professor emeritus at City \nUniversity of New York, and a former trustee. Chris Kennan, former \nWilson council member. Elizabeth McCormack, Associate, Rockefeller \nFamily & Associates, and former President of Manhattanville College. \nFinally, Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., Wilson council member and managing \npartner of Capricorn Management.\n\n  You see, sir, an extraordinary array of support, every President \nsince Lyndon Johnson who lined the legislation has attested--in this \ncase, to his hopes and now to the realization of those hopes for this \ncenter. Scholars from the world over. Our own Secretary of State--a \ngreat quarterly, an extraordinary audience in the world at a minimal \ncost to our budget and great advantage to our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I cannot imagine that we would do this act of \ndesecration. I would happily pledge my support to any effort to provide \nfunds for a juvenile delinquency program. But for now, I trust this \namendment will be withdrawn and, if not, it will be defeated. I hope it \nwould not have to have a vote. I cannot imagine the U.S. Senate, which \ncreated this institution, having to vote on destroying it for another \npurpose altogether, unrelated and as regards this issue of a profoundly \ndifferent order of importance.\n  Mr. President, I thank you. Seeing my friend from Colorado on the \nfloor, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I rise to support my friend and \ncolleague from Arizona in his efforts to address the needs of law \nenforcement in Indian country. Tribal governments are in desperate need \nof these funds, which will help them to combat the cancer of\n\n[[Page S9567]]\n\ngang activity growing throughout the country.\n  I listened very carefully to my friend and colleague, Senator \nMoynihan from New York, and I have to say that we are not trying to \nkill the Woodrow Wilson Center; we are just trying to prevent some \nyoung Americans from being killed. We are not trying to destroy it. We \nare trying to prevent a culture from being destroyed. I know, as all of \nmy colleagues know, that we have to make some very tough choices if we \nare truly going to get our deficit under control and balance the \nbudget. I don't know much about the Woodrow Wilson Center, but I \nsuppose it is very important from a scholarly standpoint. The lives of \npeople that are affected on Indian reservations with our youngsters \ngoing into gang activity, I think, is equally as important. I don't \nthink we can put a price tag on their lives.\n  The Senator talked about the memorial being a living memorial. I \nsimply believe that Senator Kyl is on the right track when he wants to \nkeep more youngsters on the Indian reservations also in that State--an \nalive State. They tell me that the scholars at the Wilson Center get \nabout $43,000 a year to study different projects. I was looking at some \nof the projects. Very frankly, they may be very important, but some of \nthem I don't quite understand.\n  Let me read into the Record a few of the projects that have been \ndone. Here is one: popular mystical sectarianism and models of \nrationality in prerevolutionary Russia; family and society in greater \nSyria; making China perfectly equal; creating language for \nwesternization in early Meiji, Japan. I went to Meiji University in \nJapan and I don't remember that one. The rise and fall of childrearing \nexperts in 20th century America. I would like to see somebody do a \nlittle more study on the rise and fall of children in America and where \nwe have to go to prevent them from getting more involved in gangs. One \nthat I almost can't pronounce is the malediction of malpractice \nmedicine and misfortune in post-colonial Zimbabwe.\n\n  That may be very important. I am not going to disagree with the \nSenator from New York. Maybe it is. I think that we have to recognize, \nthough, that writing about starvation and starving are two different \nthings. Doing studies about youngsters at risk who may be dying from \ngang violence and then talking to their families who have watched their \nyoungsters die in gang violence are two different things.\n  I wanted to reaffirm to the Senator from New York that we are not \ntrying to destroy the Woodrow Wilson Center. I am sure it is very \nimportant. We just know that there are some things that we face that \ndemand immediate attention, and we think this is one of the ways we can \ndo it.\n  As my colleague noted, over the past 5 years, homicide rates across \nAmerica decreased by 22 percent. But on Indian reservations, it went up \nby 87 percent during the same 5 years.\n  Yesterday, we had a joint hearing of the Indian Affairs and the \nJudiciary Committees. Testimony in that hearing revealed that gang \nviolence poses a very special threat to America's Indian tribes that \nthey are simply not equipped to deal with. Those tribes, we noted with \ninterest through the testimony, that have a closer proximity to \nmetropolitan areas, like Phoenix and Detroit, or any large metropolitan \nareas, that adds more and more pressure on inner-city gangs, like the \nCrips or Bloods, whatever, and they tend to migrate out and go to a \npath of least resistance--in this case, the Indian reservations.\n  Studies conducted by Federal agencies, universities, and tribal \ngovernments reveal that gang activity within Indian country has \nsteadily increased over the past decade. A study in 1997, as an \nexample, of 132 tribes conducted by the Bureau of Indian Affairs Law \nEnforcement Division estimated there were 375 active gangs with \napproximately 4,600 members. In Arizona alone, as Senator Kyl stated, a \nrecent FBI study identified 177 gangs on 14 different reservations.\n  Juvenile gang activities poses a unique threat to all jurisdictions. \nAnd, since there are multiple jurisdictions on Indian reservations, \nthere are often people who should be prosecuted that simply fall \nthrough the cracks because of the time consumed in defining who is in \ncharge, who has the jurisdiction for the person. In Indian country, the \npotential growth is even greater in this jurisdictional maze than it is \nfrom any downtown community that faces gang activities.\n  These limitations on tribal courts and law enforcement authority are \nimposed by the Federal Government. We can't continue to tie the hands \nof the tribal justice systems, refuse to adequately fund their law \nenforcement, and then expect them to do an adequate job in protecting \ntheir citizens against gangs.\n  The Office of Tribal Justice within the Department of the Interior \nrecently stated that ``* * * it is twice as likely that a reported \ncrime will be violent''--on the reservation--``as compared with the \nrest of the United States, yet there are only half as many law \nenforcement officers on Indian lands per capita.''\n  It is absolutely a problem that is just virtually out of control.\n  The complexity and severity of youth violence and criminal gang \nactivity within Indian country demands immediate attention. These funds \nwill enable tribal governments to protect their citizens, and they will \ngo far in fulfilling our obligation to protect and preserve the health \nand welfare of our Indian communities--and the people who are non-\nIndian who happen to live in those Indian communities.\n  I know that the Woodrow Wilson Center is important. They get a great \ndeal of private money from well-meaning and good-hearted Americans who \ncontribute regularly to that center--unlike Indian reservations. You \nrarely have people who are going to donate money to the Indian people \nwho are trying to reduce gang violence. They depend almost totally on \nFederal money to do this.\n  With that, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Kyl \namendment, and I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the Senator allow me just 2 minutes?\n  Mr. GORTON. I certainly yield to the Senator from New York.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his generous \nremarks about the center. But I also say that it is so easy to make fun \nof studies of ancient times and obscure subjects. But a great deal \ncomes with them.\n  In that New York Times editorial I spoke of, it says at one point:\n\n       That such a forum is needed was suggested by a Senator's \n     inept award several decades ago of a ``golden fleece'' to a \n     Wilson scholar for writing a paper on how Russia's czars \n     persecuted nomadic minorities centuries ago. This scene was \n     not remote or irrelevant to the author, Bronislaw Geremek, \n     the Polish medievalist who was to play a pivotal role in the \n     Solidarity movement.\n\n``who was to play a pivotal role in the Solidarity movement.''\n\n\n       In the humanities, as in natural sciences, ideas often \n     spring from improbable intersections.\n\n  I make a point again about a certain ``improbable'' intersection.\n  It was a study by a Polish medievalist of the way in which a central \nRussian empire persecuted nomadic tribes.\n  It was thought ridiculous here, but was part of the creation of a \ncareer which led to the independence of Poland.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for his generosity.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, two points rather briefly in opposing, \nwith regret, the amendment proposed by my two friends and colleagues:\n  The first is in no way to deprecate or understate the problem of gang \nviolence on Indian reservations, or, for that matter, in any other \nplace, but simply to point out that this bill includes greater \nincreases for Indian programs taken as a whole than it does for any \nother set of programs.\n  At the request of the President and of the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Domenici, tribal priority allocations are increased by some $76 \nmillion, the distribution of which is to be determined primarily by \nIndian organizations themselves, any portion of which can be dedicated \nto this purpose.\n\n[[Page S9568]]\n\n  Second, the appropriations bill managed by my friend from Colorado, \nthe chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee, the appropriations bill \nfor Treasury-Postal increases the so-called grant program to $13 \nmillion with specific reference to criminal gang activity on Indian \nreservations and a direction to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \nFirearms to help curtail that gang violence. This $13 million in that \nbill can be used in whole or in part for the goal that the two Senators \naim at. When one totals up all of the public safety and justice \nprograms in the bill before us, the Interior bill, that is an \nadditional $116 million-plus.\n\n  Obviously, not all of that, not even a large percentage of it, is \ngoing to be used to combat gang violence.\n  The point is that in this bill, and in the Treasury-Postal bill, \nthere is a true recognition of the seriousness of the problem and \nsignificant resources that can be devoted to dealing with that problem.\n  As a consequence, my attitude toward this amendment would change 180 \ndegrees if this amendment were an earmark of some of those tribal \npriority allocations specifically to gang-related violence. Personally, \nI think an earmark would probably be unnecessary.\n  I accept the seriousness of the problem, as described by my two \ncolleagues, and suspect that those who determine where those tribal \npriority allocations will go will share those views.\n  The point is that if this amendment had come out of Indian \nactivities, it would not need to be discussed here at any length. We \nsimply would have accepted it. Instead, Mr. President, it comes out of \nthe destruction of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial.\n  Last Thursday, when we began this debate, I presented this chart in \nthis large form here on the floor, but with a small one to every Member \nof the body, showing the relative division of moneys within the \nDepartment of the Interior budget--the green on the left being the \nmanagement of all of our public land, the various blues, almost $4 \nbillion in this bill, for Indian activities. Then we have to come all \nthe way over here to this very short line for all of the cultural \nactivities supported by this bill. In this short line, one-fifth of the \namount that goes for Indian programs in total is included in the \nSmithsonian Institution, the National Gallery of Art, the Holocaust \nMuseum, the two endowments that we debated some 4 days on the floor \nhere, and in a line that would be too small to see on a chart of this \nsize, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.\n  Mr. President, we should not slow up opportunities for scholarly \nresearch in the United States. We should not abandon an institution \nthat admittedly authorizes studies in a number of esoteric scholarly \npursuits. That simply isn't the way in which we ought to treat our own \nhistory, or our own culture. A place outside of the rest of the world \nfor longer or shorter periods of reflection and writing on the part of \nscholars is not, Mr. President, I am convinced a waste of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  I believe the House of Representatives was wrong to follow the course \nof action that it did in this respect. But by reflecting the views of \nthe House of Representatives, we are saying, fine, there will be $1 \nmillion to close down this memorial. It may not be exactly analogous to \nclosing down the Lincoln Memorial, though it is a memorial to a famous \nPresident of the United States. But we aren't considering closing down \nthe Lincoln Memorial because it doesn't make money or produce an \nimmediate income.\n  Woodrow Wilson was himself a scholar, a president of a university, \nand Congress deemed the best memorial to him would be a place at which \nscholarly pursuits could be followed.\n  But this amendment would destroy that institution forever in order to \nfund an activity for a single year for which there is already an ample \nsource of funds.\n  So, I must say that I believe it to be an ill-advised amendment--once \nagain, not so much because there can be criticism of the goal that it \npursues, but because the goal is already adequately pursued in this and \nother bills and should not be the excuse to destroy one of the smallest \nelements of this bill directed at the preservation of American culture, \nthe addition to our fund of knowledge about our own history and about \nthe world around us.\n  We can vote on this amendment. I hope, if we do, that it is defeated. \nWe could modify the amendment so that it becomes an earmark out of the \nalready large and justified appropriations for Indian activities, one \nthat has a greater increase this year than any other. We should not \nvote for it in its present form.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would like to speak for a few minutes \nperhaps to close the debate. I think perhaps most of the things have \nbeen said.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KYL. Of course.\n  Mr. GORTON. Senator Stevens is on his way to the floor. He wishes to \nspeak on it. So we will save time for him.\n  Mr. KYL. That is fine. I will speak for a few minutes. I know Senator \nBumpers is anxious to present another amendment, and I don't intend to \ntake a lot more time.\n  But I would like, Mr. President, to get to the essence of what we are \ntrying to accomplish here because the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee has made some constructive suggestions in the end, \nhowever, which do not capture the spirit of this amendment.\n  The whole point of this amendment is to prioritize among scarce \nresources.\n  It is true that we have funded Indian programs this year to the \nextent that we thought was possible, and that represents an increase \nover last year, and it represents an increase more than the other \nprograms within this budget were increased.\n  But, Mr. President, that is not to say much, because the needs of our \nIndian communities are so significantly greater than the amount of \nmoney that we can provide that this is a scant comfort, I think, to \nthose in our Indian communities.\n  I detailed, and my colleague Senator Campbell from Colorado detailed, \nsome of the things which we learned in the hearings yesterday jointly \nheld which discussed the dire situation on our Indian reservations \ntoday regarding gang violence and the need to, obviously, do much, much \nmore in a concerted way to alleviate that problem now.\n  So, while it is true that we could take money from some other Indian \nprogram and apply it to this program, I don't see that as a solution \ngiven all of the other needs that exist on our Indian reservations.\n  While it is also true that we have allocated $13 million toward a \nvery specific program--not to the BIA but the money goes to the BATF, a \ntotally different program for training--while it is true that that \nmoney is in this budget, that is not an adequate substitute for what we \nare trying to provide for in terms of very special operations \nrequirements to deal with the problems of gang violence.\n  Just to reiterate a couple of things--I will not take long--but there \nare half as many law enforcement officers per capita in Indian country \nas there are in the small communities outside Indian country.\n  We are not just talking about training people. We are talking about \nhiring people to be on the job and doing their job. In terms of the \ndetention facilities and all of the other personnel that are required, \nin every category it is far less than needed in Indian country, and \nthat is one of the reasons, as I pointed out from the testimony, that \nyou have this difficult problem of gang violence.\n  So when the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee says, well, \none thing we could do is simply take money from another part of the \nIndian budget and put it into here, that is true, but that is really in \na sense robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n  What we are suggesting, the chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee \nand myself, is to prioritize in a larger sense from the entire budget \nthat we have under consideration here, this Interior appropriations \nbudget.\n  What we are asking, Mr. President, is this question: As between the \nfunding that is being provided by the Federal Government, the Federal \ncomponent to the Woodrow Wilson Program and this particular need, which \none is more important in today's America? Which one does the Senate \njustify better to the taxpayers of America? Both Senator Campbell and I \nhave been very clear that we are not attempting to kill the Woodrow \nWilson Center. As a matter of\n\n[[Page S9569]]\n\nfact, it receives more in private funding than it does in Government \nfunding. We are simply reducing the amount of Federal Government \nfunding to the level recommended by the House of Representatives.\n  Last year, its budget was something like $12.5 million, and, as I \nsaid, more than half of that was from the private sector rather than \nfrom this Interior appropriation. So this is not an effort to kill that \ncenter. But I do think that because of the criticisms leveled at the \ncenter, among others, from the National Academy of Public \nAdministration, I think a study of significance and objectivity, \nbecause of some of those criticisms I think it is wise for us to ask \nwhether or not a priority of spending taxpayer dollars should put those \nmoneys into this program as opposed to the one which everyone here has \nsaid deserves support, our attempt to deal with Indian gang violence.\n  The distinguished Senator from New York talked about some of the \nleaders of the Woodrow Wilson Center, including the current director \nwho is about to step down. But one of the conclusions of this important \nstudy about the center is as follows:\n\n       The director's performance is deficient in a number of \n     areas. For example, he has not effectively articulated what \n     the Center does.\n\n  Mr. President, if the director of the center cannot articulate what \nthe center does, I wonder just how good a memorial to President Wilson \nthis really is. And since my colleague from Washington State compared \nthis to the Washington Monument, for example, I will do a little \ncomparing myself. It is true that the Washington Monument does not pay \na scholar $43,000 a year to write an esoteric paper, but I think it \ninspires 250 million Americans every year in ways that probably can't \nbe measured but help us to appreciate what our country stands for and \nto remember the great Presidents of this country. I would rather that \nthe Woodrow Wilson Center do a better job, frankly, of inspiring \nAmericans and reaching out to all 250 million Americans instead of its \nvery narrow focus on the somewhat esoteric papers that are written \nthere.\n  Our colleague from New York talked about the fact that one of the \nscholars noted: Where else can you work among intellectuals and get \npaid for working in a castle? It is a nice way of saying that it is a \nvery nice thing to be a recipient of this funding. I am sure for those \nwho get it, it is. Undoubtedly, some of the papers presented are very \nworthy.\n  One of the other criticisms that was leveled at the center from this \nreview of the organization by the National Academy of Public \nAdministration noted the fact that some of the employees of the program \nand program staff and fellows could benefit from more cooperative \nactivities and that they be urged to make some interactions obligatory \nrather than voluntary. They said that the center ``does not fully \nmotivate fellows toward cooperation and gives them the option to work \nin isolation from others. Some are called `phantom fellows' because \nthey seldom appear at the Center let alone interact with staff \nmembers.''\n\n  So apparently not all of the fellows who receive this stipend are \nparticipating in the activities described by the Senator from New York.\n  I am not here to criticize the Woodrow Wilson Center, but what I am \nsaying is that it is a troubled program. That cannot be denied. Now, \nadvocates of it, proponents of it will say it is going to be improved \nand it has performed a mission in the past. After all, we would not \nwant to do anything to suggest we do not honor Woodrow Wilson. \nObviously, none of us are suggesting that. But when on the one hand you \nhave a program that has been troubled and a program which can be \nsustained by private funding as opposed to support for Indian gang \nactivities, which, as the Senator from Colorado noted, is probably not \ngoing to be supported by private giving--it relies exclusively on the \nSenate and House of Representatives to provide the funding for those \nprograms in Indian country--I think in setting the priorities, we can \nsay that this $4.8 million is better spent on saving lives on the \nIndian reservations, as my colleague from Colorado put it, rather than \ncontinuing to fund that degree of support to the Woodrow Wilson Center.\n  Mr. President, again, I compliment the Senator from New York for his \nvigorous advocacy of the center. It is not our intention to kill it. I \ncompliment the distinguished subcommittee chairman for noting that \nthere are ways in which other Indian programs could have their funding \nreduced in order to support these important gang activity programs.\n  Again, I do not think that is a good option. We need more money than \nwe can possibly appropriate to Indian activities rather than simply \ntaking it from one Indian activity and putting it against this \nparticular problem. I think at the end of the day the answer here is \ntake this $4.8 million from the Government-sponsored portion of the \nWoodrow Wilson Center and apply it to dealing with the problem of gang \nactivity as part of the BIA budget.\n  I appreciate again the support of the distinguished chairman of the \nIndian Affairs Committee, Senator Campbell from Colorado.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Will the distinguished manager, the Senator from \nWashington, allow me just one word?\n  Mr. GORTON. I certainly will, and I think the Senator from Utah wants \nto speak briefly on the amendment as well.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. May I say in response to my friend from Arizona, first \nof all, that the remark about being paid to work in a castle was just a \nfriendly joke by Madeleine Albright, now our Secretary of State. She \nwas a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center in the 1980's.\n  As far as I know, no fellow makes $43,000 a year. No one is above \nthat. Some come for short periods, others for longer periods. Some come \nto the center and spend much of their time in the archives of the \nLibrary of Congress. It is a center for scholars, and they are \ndifferent one from another. They have different views. And they have to \nbe let do their work as they will.\n  Remember how Madeleine Albright finished her remarks. She said of the \ncenter:\n\n       It memorializes not only Wilson but Wilson's lifelong \n     effort as an educator and President to map a trail for the \n     future that will elude the traps of the past.\n\n  The cost of this is so small. Some stipends are moderate, are barely \nup to the living levels, a third of what an executive in one of our \nexecutive departments makes, but no one is in that life for the salary \nand no one is at the center for this purpose. The world is proud of \nwhat we have done. I hope, sir, the Senate would do the same.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent at this point, if I may, to \nintroduce a letter sent by the distinguished Librarian of Congress \nJames Billington to the second director after Mr. Baroody of the \nCenter, Joseph Flom, who is chairman of the board of trustees, setting \nforth the principal point that a center for scholars is not a think \ntank. It does not produce policy papers or policymakers. It can produce \npolicymakers. It produced Madeleine Albright, just for an example \ntoday, but it has a different purpose, one declared by Congress when \nCongress enacted this legislation in 1989.\n  I yield the floor and I thank the Chair.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                    The Librarian of Congress,\n\n                                                    June 30, 1997.\n     Joseph H. Flom, Esq.\n     Chairman, Board of Trustees, Woodrow Wilson International \n         Center for Scholars, New York, NY.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing as a statutory member of \n     the Board of Trustees to express my deep concern at both the \n     recommendation of a shut-down and the accompanying language \n     that has just been reported out on the Wilson Center from the \n     Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies of the House of \n     Representatives. As a former director of the Center, I may be \n     able to help provide some perspective on the central \n     institutional question that has been raised.\n       The main substantive charges against the Center as an \n     institution seem to be that it does not have a ``public \n     policy function,'' currently emphasizes ``scholarly pursuits \n     over its public policy objectives,'' and has lost effectively \n     ``the original goal of the Center to link these two worlds \n     [scholarly and public policy].''\n       I do not believe that the Center has ever formally had a \n     ``public policy function'' as that term is generally \n     understood in Washington; and I am troubled by the seeming \n     implication that a deep emphasis on scholarship is somehow a \n     distraction from (rather\n\n[[Page S9570]]\n\n     than a prerequisite for) making a distinctive contribution to \n     the overall public policy dialogue in Washington.\n       The Board, after the Center's initial shakedown period, \n     produced a major study by Dillon Ripley and William Baroody, \n     Sr., some time in 1972-73, basically suggesting that, in a \n     city with many public policy think tanks and a constant \n     preoccupation with immediate public policy concerns, the most \n     fundamental unmet need was to bring into Washington precisely \n     the kind of broad-ranging, high scholarly talent that did not \n     normally come here: to assemble each year a critical mass of \n     first-rate thinkers performing major projects--and then to \n     bring them into creative contact with the world of affairs \n     represented by almost all the rest of Washington. After \n     nearly a decade of commissions and discussions with Congress \n     about how to memorialize Woodrow Wilson (and a brief start-up \n     period that was largely focussed on public policy research), \n     the Board decided that the Wilson Center should not be \n     another version of the public policy think tanks that were \n     then well represented in Washington by organizations like AEI \n     or the Brookings Institution. The distinctive market niche of \n     the Wilson Center was to provide something which neither the \n     think tanks nor the universities of Washington were able to \n     provide: temporary opportunities for a sufficient number of \n     the highest quality thinkers, largely out of academia, to \n     pursue major projects in a place and atmosphere in which they \n     would also be brought in contact with the world of affairs. I \n     was hired in 1973 in response to this study; and, so far as I \n     know, the Board did not then foresee--and has not since \n     foreseen--a public policy mission or agenda as such for the \n     Woodrow Wilson Center.\n       The distinctive role of bringing top intellect to \n     Washington from all over the country and the world seems to \n     me even more needed now than it was nearly a quarter of a \n     century ago when I came to Washington to run the Center. \n     There has been since that time a great growth of public \n     policy think tanks in the Washington area, but almost no \n     expansion of the possibilities for world-class intellect to \n     be brought here for the kind of long-term, ranging and \n     reflective scholarship that the Wilson Center has \n     consistently sought out. Therefore, for the core mission of \n     ``strengthening and symbolizing'' the link between the worlds \n     of ideas and affairs, this type of Center may well have an \n     even more important and distinctive role to play now than it \n     did then.\n       I believe that the growth of public policy think tanks in \n     Washington has been a constructive development for our open \n     democratic society, but most of them are inclined (quite \n     properly) to develop advocacy as well as research roles; and \n     I think everyone agrees that this would be inappropriate (and \n     probably unsustainable) in a federally-supported institution. \n     No one, as far as I know, has accused the Center of having \n     been co-opted by the ideological or methodological biases \n     that often plague entrenched faculties and academic guilds. \n     Indeed, a great strength of the Center is its meticulous and, \n     I have felt over the years, remarkably unbiased process of \n     selecting fellows. As a member of the Fellowship Committee, I \n     have been impressed not just with the high quality and \n     variety of the selectees but also with the fairness and \n     objectivity of the selection process.\n       It seems to me that the Center has consistently had and \n     sustained a basic, twofold mission of competitively bringing \n     high-quality, first-class minds to do research on important \n     questions in Washington and of interacting them with the \n     broader world of affairs in this city. Such a broad mission, \n     of course, leaves many important and legitimate questions \n     unanswered: should more fellows be brought into the Center \n     with public policy projects? How much and what kind of \n     dialogue should be conducted within the Center and with the \n     world of affairs outside? To what extent should the Center be \n     internally organized by themes, disciplines, or regions as a \n     way of energizing the fellows? Should more practitioners be \n     included in the mix?\n       All these are recurring questions for which there is no \n     absolute right or wrong answer. Either the Congress or the \n     Board or both together may well want to undertake or to \n     commission some kind of overall assessment of the Center or \n     of the whole memorial idea--or may wish to produce a great \n     deal more in the way of explicit mission, strategy, or policy \n     statements.\n       I believe, however, that there would be very serious and \n     predictably negative consequences to any studies or \n     commissions undertaken with the presumption that the Center \n     should have some new and explicitly mandated public policy \n     mission or function. The Center would, first of all, become \n     political--not so much, probably, in the sense of acquiring a \n     distinct overall advocacy coloration, but in the sense of \n     becoming an inviting and exposed arena for the continuing \n     play of political pressures and advocacy agendas that would \n     increasingly influence the choice both of the issues to be \n     studied and of the fellows to study them. Center officials \n     would spend their time debating how to slice and distribute \n     pork--rather than how to bring new types of food to the \n     Washington table and find new ways to serve it better to more \n     people.\n       To be sure, a small Center retooled with a public policy \n     agenda could probably add a small amount to public policy \n     research and dialogue on current questions in this city. But \n     there is already so much of this kind of research in \n     Washington that the Center's contribution to public policy \n     would almost certainly be marginal at best and redundant at \n     worst. What would almost certainly be irreplaceably lost in \n     the process, however, would be the two benefits to society \n     that the Center has implicitly promised to provide for \n     nearly a quarter of a century: (1) the highest quality \n     standards for studies produced at taxpayer expense; and \n     (2) a shaping effect over the log term on the world of \n     affairs.\n       (1) An important, all-permeating weakness of the NAPA study \n     (justifiable perhaps in a ``review of Organization and \n     Management'') is its seeming failure to recognize that the \n     major ``product'' of this small Presidential memorial is \n     quite properly the quality of its intellectual activity. \n     Whatever one might justifiably add or subtract from the \n     programs, activities, and analyses of the Center, one should \n     not, it seems to me, embark on any serious comprehensive \n     reviews under the delusion that it will be possible to \n     sustain the high quality of the scholarship that has been and \n     is being maintained if there is any blurring at the Center of \n     its well established focus on the quality and promise of \n     individual fellow's projects.\n       The present director helped shape and support that core \n     commitment in the earliest days of the Center; and he and his \n     staff are to be praised for continuing to insist that \n     scholarly quality and long-term promise provide the \n     indispensable platform on which any serious and lasting \n     accomplishments have to be based.\n       (2) One of the key founding Board members said early in the \n     history of the Center that its mission was to be a place \n     which the 22d century would recognize as having helped shape \n     the 21st. Lasting, long-term impact was the desired pay-off; \n     basic scholarship on important questions was the armature; \n     the matchless scholarly resources of Washington provided \n     unique ammunition; and federal funds were to be provided \n     basically for venture capital with long-term prospects rather \n     than for short-term investment in the ever-shifting public \n     policy debates of this present-minded city.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              James H. Billington,\n                                            Librarian of Congress.\n\n  Mr. KYL addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. I just wanted to respond to Senator Moynihan, to the \nSenator's comment about the $43,000 stipends. According to the article \nin the Washington Post, which I submitted for the Record a moment ago, \nby Stephen Barr writing about the Woodrow Wilson Living Memorial--and I \nquote now:\n\n       The Center annually selects about 35 fellows who receive an \n     average stipend of $43,000 and spend their time studying and \n     writing.\n\n  Also if one does math of the $12,500,000 budget, roughly, of the \nprogram, I believe about $1.7 million of that is allocated for the \nstipend. And if you divide that number it averages out to something \nover $40,000 a year. So that is where I got my information that the \naverage stipend is about $43,000.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I must apologize to my friend. He \naccurately describes this passage from Mr. Barr's article on the \nFederal Page and the average stipend. But if I could just take a moment \nto go on to say what this same article says:\n\n       Previous and current fellows include Raul Alfonsin, the \n     former President of Argentina; Anatoliy Dobrynin, the former \n     Soviet Ambassador to the United States; Washington Post \n     reporter Thomas B. Edsal; New York Times columnist Thomas L. \n     Friedman; novelist Carlos Fuentes; Harvard University \n     Professor Samuel P. Huntington, and Itamar Rabinovich, the \n     former Israeli Ambassador here.\n\n  This is a great institution, been a great success. Can we not leave \nit to its great desserts, as it was intended?\n  I do want to tell my colleague I was in error, and I do apologize.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I find this debate very illuminating, and \nI congratulate the Senator from Arizona in bringing an issue to the \nattention of the Senate that I for one was not aware of. I do not treat \nlightly the conclusions of the Association for Public Administration \nwho have made their examination of the Woodrow Wilson Memorial. I think \nit deserves airing.\n  I think the deficiencies that are identified in that report should be \ndiscussed, and at some point I may find myself convinced to follow the \nSenator from Arizona down this particular road if in fact there is not \na significant change that would allow at least some objective observers \nto come to the conclusion that the Memorial was more fittingly \nfulfilling its mission than apparently it is now.\n  Having said that, I find that I will vote with my subcommittee \nchairman\n\n[[Page S9571]]\n\non this issue for the following reason, based on my own experience in \nterminating longstanding organizations.\n  When the Republicans took control of the Senate, I found myself on \nthe subcommittee for the legislative branch, chaired by the Senator \nfrom Florida, [Mr. Mack], and the two of us as a team began to look \naround the legislative branch to see what there was that we might \neither cut back or eliminate because it was not performing properly. We \nfocused in on the Office of Technology Assistance, OTA, and, as we \nspent time looking at OTA, we found that it did a number of very good \nthings. We also found that it was duplicative of a number of very good \nthings that had been done other places in the Government.\n\n  I was lobbied about as hard on that issue as any issue I can think of \nby Members, not only of this body, including the Senator who is now the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, but also Members of the other \nbody who came at me and said, ``we must hang on to the OTA for all of \nthese good reasons.''\n  Senator Mack and I agonized over this decision for a long period of \ntime. We examined the record of the OTA. We had the leadership of the \nOTA come before the subcommittee and we held open hearings, we \npresented to them our concerns and we gave them every opportunity to \nrespond. Ultimately, we came to the conclusion that the OTA was, \nindeed, duplicative of that which was being done in the Library of \nCongress, particularly the Congressional Reference Service, and however \ngood its performance was, we decided that it was redundant and we \nvoted, ultimately, to shut it down.\n  When you take something that has been part of America as long as the \nWoodrow Wilson Memorial has been, I think you owe it the same kind of \nopportunity to defend itself through hearings and examinations if, \nindeed, you are determined to kill it. As a member of the subcommittee \nbefore which such hearings would be held, I do not recall that the \nsubject has ever come up prior to the introduction of this matter on \nthe floor.\n  Much as I sympathize with and react to the need for more money in the \nIndian gang program, and if we can find more money I am more than \nsympathetic to finding an offset to make it happen, I am reluctant on \nthe basis of a debate on the floor--without a hearing, without an \nopportunity for these people to come defend themselves, to lay out \nexactly what they are doing in a full hearing circumstance where they \nare notified sufficiently in advance and are able to marshal their \narguments and their activities--to react to the debate on the floor \nsaying, ``All right, this sounds more logical as a priority than that \nand so I will vote to eliminate an agency that has been around for, \nwhat, 30 years?''\n  So, for all of my sympathy with my friend from Arizona, and I am \nreluctant to oppose him because he is usually right and he is very \nthoughtful and he does not give knee-jerk reactions to these things, I \nfind that I will be with my subcommittee chairman in saying that this \nis not the kind of thing to do at this late hour in this bill with an \namendment on the floor.\n  I would say to my friend from Arizona, if in the next appropriations \ncycle, which will be upon us so rapidly we will not be able to remember \nhow short the time was, he wants to raise this in the subcommittee, I \nwould support the actions of the subcommittee in having a hearing on \nthis and letting the people from the Woodrow Wilson Memorial come in \nand respond to the charges that have been made against them by the \nresponsible organization that has examined them. And I will keep an \nopen mind in that circumstance. But I reluctantly part company with my \nfriend from Arizona in this circumstance and at this time, because I do \nnot think it is fair to the people who are involved in the Woodrow \nWilson Memorial for the Senate to make this kind of a decision in this \nrapid circumstance.\n  So, I intend to be with my subcommittee chairman and intend to vote \nto keep the bill as it is in this regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I need make no more remarks on the subject \nmyself. I am asked, with great urgency, by the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Stevens, who is in intense \nnegotiations over the defense budget at the present time and is unable \nto be on the floor, to state that he is adamantly opposed to this \namendment and supports the Woodrow Wilson Memorial and hopes the \namendment will be defeated. That is all I have.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I just wanted to make one comment and then \nclose the debate and ask for the yeas and nays. I want to reassure my \ncolleague from Utah that our amendment does not eliminate the Woodrow \nWilson Center. It is not our intention to eliminate the Woodrow Wilson \nCenter. And nothing in it does eliminate the Woodrow Wilson Center. The \nmajority of its funds come from the private sector. One could argue \nthat removing this $4.8 million would have a significant impact upon \nthe Woodrow Wilson Center, but several times in the presentation you \ntalked about eliminating it. I just want the record to be clear that \nour amendment does not do that.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, just to clarify what was not meant to be \nmisleading, to leave the center with a million dollars would be with \nthe understanding that it would close, and I think this is something we \nwould regret for a very long time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the Kyl amendment, No. 1223. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FORD. I announce that the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] \nis necessarily absent.\n  I also announce that the Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka] is absent \ndue to a death in the family.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nMinnesota [Mr. Wellstone] would vote ``no.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, at \nthis point I know of only one other amendment on which a rollcall vote \nwill be required. That does not mean to say there are not others that \nwe will not be able to settle that might possibly require a vote. But I \nonly know of one more, and it will be proposed by the Senator from \nArkansas [Mr. Bumpers], but in a couple of minutes.\n  Right now I have two or three unanimous-consent requests on \namendments that have been agreed to.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GORTON. I will.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nlaid aside and the Senate proceed to the committee amendment beginning \non page 123, line 9.\n  Mr. GORTON. No. I object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GORTON. We have three or four unanimous-consent requests for \namendments we have agreed to that we would like to do first.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1225\n\n (Purpose: To provide funding for the engineering and design of a road \n                 in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senators Bennett and Hatch and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  It provides funding for a design of a road associated with the 2002 \nWinter Olympics, offset by a reduction in land acquisition in Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. Bennett \n     and Mr. Hatch, proposes amendment numbered 1225.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 5, line 17, strike ``$9,400,000'' and insert \n     ``$8,600,000'' and on page 65, line 18, strike \n     ``$160,269,000,'' and insert ``$161,069,000,'' and on page \n     65, line 23, after ``205'' insert ``, of which $800,000 shall \n     be available for the design and engineering of the Trappers \n     Loop Connector Road in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest''.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I appreciate the willingness of the \nChairman to include language regarding the design and engineering of \nthe Trappers Loop Connector Road in the Wasatch-Cache National Forest. \nI want to clarify the intent of this amendment which has been accepted \nby the Managers of the bill.\n  The language I have included provides $800,000 to the Forest Service \nto undertake the preliminary design and engineering of a road \nconnecting the Trappers Loop (SR 167) and Snowbasin, the site of the \n2002 Winter Olympics Downhill and Super ``G'' ski racing events. This \nroad is identified in their Master Plan as a Phase I project referenced \nin Public Law 104-333, Section 304. Is it the Chairman's understanding \nthat this language is consistent with the provisions set forth in \nPublic Law 104-333, Section 304?\n  Mr. GORTON. This is correct. The Senator from Utah rightly points out \nthat Section 304 of Public Law 104-333 recognizes Phase One facility \nconstruction and operation activities as set forth in the Snowbasin Ski \nArea Master Development Plan dated October 1995. This statute \nspecifically states that ``. . . `Phase I' facilities referred to in \nthe Master Plan . . . are limited in size and scope, and are reasonable \nand necessary to accommodate the 2002 Olympics, and in some cases are \nrequired to provide for the safety for skiing competitors and \nspectators.'' Clearly, this project falls within the parameters of \nPublic Law 104-333, Section 304 and is vital to the successful \nexecution of the Downhill event.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank my colleague for the clarification. Is it the \nCommittee's intent that the Forest Service proceed quickly on the \ndesign of this project?\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand that there is a very short time frame in \nwhich this project must be completed. Therefore, once funds are made \navailable by the enactment of this Act, the Committee fully expects the \nForest Service to proceed quickly with the design and engineering of \nthis road. However, the Committee is concerned that the Forest Service \nis not left with the full responsibility of funding this project. I ask \nthe Senator from Utah if the Olympic Committee and the State of Utah \nare pursuing other funding options for the construction of the road?\n  Mr. BENNETT. The Senator raises a good point. The Olympic Committee, \nworking in conjunction with the Utah Department of Transportation has \nbeen pursuing a number of funding options for this project. It is my \nintent to work closely with the Olympic Committee and the Utah \nDepartment of Transportation in these efforts. I thank the Chairman for \nhis assistance in this matter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1225) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1226\n\n(Purpose: To require the Chairperson of the National Endowment for the \n Arts to give priority to funding projects, productions, workshops, or \n              programs that serve underserved populations)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator DeWine and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  This amendment requires the National Endowment for the Arts to give \npriority in grantmaking to underserved communities.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       No funds provided in this or any other Act may be expended \n     to develop a rulemaking process relevant to amending the \n     National Indian Gaming Commission's definition regulations \n     located at 25 CFR 502.7 and 502.8.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my amendment to the bill is straightforward \nand simple.\n  It will prohibit the use of appropriated dollars to begin a \nrulemaking process by the National Indian Gaming Commission that runs \ncontrary to congressional intent.\n  Nine years ago, the Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act \nto regulate what was even then a rapid spread of gaming activity in \nIndian Country.\n  The act established a three-member Commission to promulgate \nregulations to control and oversee tribal gaming activities.\n  These regulations were intended to ensure the integrity of the games \nand to give States an assurance that gaming activities that were not \navailable to non-Indians similarly did not occur on tribal lands.\n  These regulations were four years in the making and have sustained \nlegal challenges all the way to the Supreme Court.\n  In essence, the regulations serve to classify and define the \ndifferent types of games allowed under the Indian Gaming Regulatory \nAct.\n  Games such as blackjack, craps, and roulette fall under the category \nof class III, basically casino gambling.\n  Games such as slot machines and video poker machines--the largest \nrevenue generators of gaming--also fall under the class III category.\n  Games such as bingo and traditional tribal gambling games fall under \nclass II and class I respectively.\n  For years these regulations have worked well. Electronic devices that \nclearly are class III, or slot-machine-type devices, have been \nregulated under class III gaming.\n  This is significant because class III, or casino-type gaming requires \nStates and tribals to enter into a compact and to regulate it.\n  Needless to say, unregulated casino gaming would be bad for \nconsumers, bad for States and bad for tribes.\n  Even so, for years, some tribes and manufacturers of gaming devices \nhave sought class II designation for devices that clearly are slot \nmachines or video poker-like devices from the National Indian Gaming \nCommission.\n  These efforts have failed because of the strict convention of the \nexisting regulations.\n  But now, this Commission has initiated an open-ended rulesmaking \nprocess that would seek to redefine what constitutes an electronic \ngaming device.\n  The lawyers at the Commission who initiated this process will tell \nyou that they simply want to clarify the definition of electronic or \nmechanical devices that are not games of chance but are vague under the \nexisting regulations.\n  They will tell you that they are simply clearing up confusion.\n  If that is the case, then why is their advance notice of proposed \nrulemaking so broad in nature? The solicitation in this notice, \npublished in the Federal Register, states that the Commission is \nseeking public comment--quote--``in its evaluation of the decision to \namend its current definition regulations'' end quote.\n  I would like to know how this decision was made. Who made this \ndecision to amend the definitions? How was it accomplished?\n  It certainly was done without any notification to a number of us who \nare familiar with this issue and interested in it.\n  Perhaps most importantly, Mr. President, I would remind the Senate \nthat the very same Commission that is now seeking to embark on an \nextensive rulemaking process is the one that only two months ago was \nbeseeching the Appropriations Committee to change current law so it \ncould collect more fees from tribes.\n  Why? Because this same Commission said it didn't have enough money to \nfulfill its legal mandate to regulate gaming.\n  Interestingly enough, less than half the tribes conducting gaming \nacross this country are in compliance with the existing regulations.\n  Mr. President, this Commission has been wracked with controversy. Its \nprevious chairman left under a cloud of alleged mismanagement.\n  This Commission needs to get its act together before it embarks on \nany rulemaking process, let alone one that undermines existing and good \nregulations and violates congressional intent.\n  We need, at least, Mr. President, some time for the committees of \njurisdiction of this Congress to have hearings on such a significant \nchange that could occur with the rewriting of these regulations.\n  This amendment will allow Congress time to be informed by this \nCommission about such a significant action.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I would like my colleagues and my \nconstituents to understand why I support the amendment of Mr. Reid \nregarding the classification of gambling devices by the National Indian \nGaming Commission. As we have experienced in New Mexico, the Indian \nGaming Regulatory Act [IGRA] was difficult to apply in our state, but \nit does draw some important lines and legal distinctions that are now \nunderstood by New Mexico tribes and the state government. IGRA now \nserves as the basis for the compacts that allow Indian gambling casinos \nto be legal in New Mexico and in our nation.\n  If we do not adopt the Reid amendment, I believe we will be \nimplicitly supporting an effort that has the clear potential of \nunraveling IGRA as we now understand it, without the benefit of \ncongressional oversight. The National Indian Gaming Commission has \nissued new regulations and started a public comment process that could \nresult in the removal of slot machines from the strict regulation we \nenvisioned for them under the system of tribal-state compacts we \ndesigned in IGRA.\n  Removing slot machines from this process and placing them under the \ncontrol of the National Indian Gaming Commission could ignite a renewed \ndebate about IGRA and result in undermining the delicate balance we \nhave struck between tribal and states' rights in regulating gambling \ncasinos on Indian reservations. We need to\n\n[[Page S9574]]\n\navoid even the perception that the National Indian Gaming Commission \nproposed regulations and changes in critical definitions could create \nthis scenario. Hence, we must take action to ensure continuation of the \ncurrent distinctions between those gambling activities that are now \nregulated by tribal-state compacts and those that can be regulated by \nthe National Indian Gaming Commission. These distinctions are essential \nto maintain if we expect continuing public and Congressional support \nfor IGRA.\n  Please allow me to explain further. Perhaps the most significant \ndefinition in IGRA is the definition of ``class III gaming.'' Class III \ngames are commonly understood to be casino style gaming such as poker, \nblackjack, roulette, and slot machines, with some variations depending \non state laws. Class II games are understood to be the original bingo \ngames and pull tabs that are allowed without the necessity of reaching \na compact agreement with state governments, but they are games that are \nregulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission.\n  The distinctions between class II and class III games are made in \nIGRA and are more precisely defined by regulations promulgated by the \nNational Indian Gaming Commission and published in the Code of Federal \nRegulations at 502.7 and 502.8. The final rules were published on April \n9, 1992 (57 FR 12392).\n  The National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) has the statutory \nauthority to regulate class II games and to distinguish between class \nII and class III gaming under statutory guidance. The definitions it \nhas published have served to determine which games fall into class III \nand hence into the realm of compacts between tribes and states. Without \nthese compacts, casino gaming (class III) would be illegal under IGRA.\n  New Mexico tribes are well aware of these distinctions as they have \ngone through an arduous process of negotiating with the Governor and \nthe State legislature. They have finally resolved this issue after two \nNew Mexico Supreme Court decisions and Federal district and circuit \ncourt decisions which eventually led to the state legislative solution. \nThe scope of class III casino gaming that is legal in New Mexico is now \ndefined under the compacts which relied on current definitions of class \nII and class III gaming. Not once during this long and difficult \nprocess did the tribes or the state question the type of gambling that \nwould be negotiated in the compacts. They relied on the NIGC \ndefinitions when they negotiated the compacts.\n  Now comes a disturbing new scenario. In the guise of up-dating the \ncurrent definitions of class II and class III gaming to take into \naccount technological changes and computer advancements of the past few \nyears, the National Indian Gaming Commission is now reopening the \nquestion of gambling devices to be placed into these two critical \ncategories.\n  What is disturbing is the distinct and likely possibility that this \nreopened process could result, after tribal consultation and public \ncomment, in the placing of slot machines into class II rather than \nclass III gaming, thus removing slot machines from the more strict \nregulation and control of the tribal-state compacts.\n  There is a distinct and negative outcome if the new rule-making by \nthe National Indian Gaming Commission results in removing slot machines \nor any other highly profitable gambling device from the legal \nprotections of the required compacts and places them under the control \nof the National Indian Gaming Commission, and hence subject only to \ntribal ordinances. This result would be a clear set-back for public \nsupport of the current law and could rapidly lead to the deterioration \nof the carefully balanced system we now have.\n  I am not accusing the National Indian Gaming Commission or the tribes \nof intending to reach this outcome. I am alerting both to the \nperception by many Senators that re-opening the definition process in \nthe latest proposed rule-making is clearly aimed at the section of \nnational law defining gambling devices and hence invites such tampering \npossibilities. I believe we have enough difficulty reaching gambling \nagreement, as we have seen for several years in New Mexico, under \ncurrent law and regulations. Adding the new possibility of removing the \nmost profitable gambling device from close legal scrutiny in the \ncompacting process is a dangerous move. Once this potential is \nunderstood by the public, I believe opposition to Indian gambling will \njustifiably multiply. The relatively stable situation we now have under \ncurrent law and regulation will become volatile.\n  Thus, I cannot agree with the seemingly innocent claim that the \nNational Indian Gaming Commission is simply doing its job by up-dating \nthese critical definitions. The technical changes we all see in \ncomputer technology are being used as an excuse to re-open the most \ncritical line drawn by the Congress in IGRA--the line between gambling \nthat can be simply regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission \n(headed by three commissioners appointed by the President) and gambling \nthat must come under the close scrutiny of state law and local voters.\n  Mr. President, I opt for the close scrutiny and local control by the \nstates through our current compacting process. I would also like to \nremind my colleagues and my Indian friends in New Mexico that slot \nmachines were understood to be part of the compacting negotiations, and \nagreements have been reached which allow the legal operation of slot \nmachines in Indian casinos in New Mexico. While I understand that there \nare problems with the compacts from both the State and the tribal \nviewpoints, at least the ground rules were understood, and agreements \nare now in place.\n  If we now raise the specter of allowing these most profitable \ngambling devices being removed from the purview of these compacts by \nredefining them to class II gaming, I predict we will have even more \nturmoil in the Indian gaming debate than we have had to date.\n  I sincerely hope my New Mexico Indian friends and leaders are not in \nsupport of the new rule making by the National Indian Gaming Commission \nbecause of the possibilities this rule-making process holds for \nremoving key elements of casino gambling from the compacts. I hope they \nwould oppose even the perception that this was their motive. I frankly \ndoubt that New Mexico Indian leaders have even discussed this \npossibility, but as their Senator and friend, I want to avoid a \ncontroversy we do not need in Indian gambling law and regulation.\n  I support Senator Reid's efforts to avoid this new firestorm in \nIndian gambling. By adopting his amendment and withholding the funds \nfrom the regulatory process changes I have just described, we can avoid \nthe clear potential this rule-making process has for unraveling rather \nthan stabilizing Indian gambling in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1228) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GORTON. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to \nspeak as in morning business for 3 or 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9553-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9574-S9575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO RED SKELTON\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to someone I \nknew and cared a great deal about.\n  I had the good fortune to consider Red Skelton a friend. I first met \nRed Skelton when I was Lieutenant Governor of the State of Nevada. He \nand I went to a rodeo together. At that time I found him to be jovial, \na real gentleman, and not taken with his celebrity status.\n  He has been tremendous to the State of Nevada. He has performed in \nthe north and the south. He has been involved in many charitable \nfunctions. We in Nevada consider Red Skelton part of Nevada.\n  Charlie Chaplin once said, ``I remain just one thing, and one thing \nonly--and that is a clown. It places me on a far higher plane than any \npolitician.''\n  This morning on public radio, Mr. President, Red Skelton was heard\n\n[[Page S9575]]\n\nagain. I heard from one of his prior performances. In that broadcast he \ntalked about why he felt being a clown was something that he always \nwanted to be remembered as--being a clown. He proceeded to tell \neveryone there how important it was that we remain, in many respects, \nin our childlike status--lots of energy, trusting other people.\n  So today I rise to ask politicians all over America and especially in \nthis body to pay tribute to America's favorite clown, Richard Bernard \nSkelton, better known to us as Red Skelton. He passed away yesterday at \nage 84.\n  He was the son of a grocer, who later became a circus clown. Mr. \nSkelton died 2 months before his son Red was born. His widowed mother \nworked as a cleaning woman and elevator operator to support her four \nsons.\n  Red Skelton started being a professional clown at age 10. So for \nalmost 75 years--three-quarters of a century--he has been making people \nlaugh.\n  He did not ask people to laugh. You had to laugh at Red Skelton. He \nbecame part of a traveling medicine show where he picked up vaudeville \nskills which served him so well for the rest of his life. His debut on \nradio was in 1937, and Broadway the same year. His first movie was in \n1938 entitled ``Having a Wonderful Time.'' He became a Hollywood star \nappearing in almost 50 films over the course of his life.\n  Skeleton often said that he was a ``man whose destiny caught up with \nhim at an early age.''\n  His destiny, Mr. President, was to make America laugh.\n  ``I don't want to be called `the greatest' or `one of the greatest.' \nLet other guys claim to be the best. I just want to be known as a \nclown,'' Red said, ``because to me, that's the height of my profession. \nIt means you can do everything--sing, dance, and above all, make people \nlaugh.''\n  Mr. President, last March I went to Palm Springs to present Red \nSkelton a Presidential commendation. We had a date set that the \nPresident of the United States was going to give that to him in the \nWhite House. But his ill-health prevented him from flying, so I \nproceeded to Palm Springs on behalf of the President to give Red \nSkelton this commendation from the President.\n  It was a wonderful luncheon that we had. He was very weak of body but \nalert of mind. For example, at that time even though he was confined to \na wheelchair, he wrote seven stories every week, and he would pick the \nbest out of the seven and put it in a book, and every year he produced \n52 short stories. That was Red Skelton up to the time he died.\n  We had a wonderful time that day in March. I will never forget it. We \nwere able to videotape that. He cracked jokes, and we had a great time. \nHe is somebody that I will remember, the people of Nevada will \nremember, and this country will remember.\n  Let me repeat the words of President Clinton, who honored Red Skleton \nwith a Presidential certificate commendation, signed on April 1, 1996, \nin fitting tribute to America's favorite clown.\n\n       A natural-born comic who got his first laugh from an \n     audience at the age of 10, Red Skelton has devoted a long and \n     productive life to entertaining people of all ages. Moving \n     from the vaudeville stage to radio, the movies and \n     television, he became America's favorite clown, creating \n     characters like Clem Kadiddlehopper and Freddie the \n     Freeloader, whom generations of Americans looked forward to \n     seeing every week. Red Skelton served his country well. From \n     his days in World War II and Korea as a soldier and an \n     entertainer for the troops, to his many years on the large \n     screen and small, he has given to all those lucky enough to \n     see him perform the gift of laughter and joy.\n\n  When I walked into the room to present Red with this certificate, he \nstill remembered me from our days attending rodeos together in southern \nNevada. He was deeply touched by this honor because more than anything, \nRed Skelton loved his country.\n  Red Skelton could have never been America's favorite clown if he \nwasn't already one of America's greatest patriots. Red fought for his \ncountry in World War II and Korea.\n  His definition of the true meaning of the Pledge of Allegiance will \nalways remain with me. I would like to repeat it for you today:\n\n       I, me, an individual, a committee of one.\n       Pledge, dedicate all my worldly goods to give without self \n     pity.\n       Allegiance--my love and devotion.\n       To the Flag--our standard, Old Glory, a symbol of freedom. \n     Wherever she waves, there is respect because your loyalty has \n     given her a dignity that shouts freedom is everybody's job.\n       of the United--that means that we have all come together.\n       States--individual communities that have unites into 50 \n     great states. 50 individual communities with pride and \n     dignity and purpose, all divided with imaginary boundaries, \n     yet united to a common purpose, and that's love for country.\n       of America\n       and to the Republic--A state in which sovereign power is \n     invested in representatives chosen by the people to govern. \n     And a government is the people and it's from the people to \n     the leaders, not from the leaders to the people.\n       for Which It Stands.\n       One Nation--Meaning, so blessed by God.\n       Indivisible--Incapable of being divided.\n       With Liberty--Which is freedom and the right of power to \n     live one's own life without threats or fear or some sort of \n     retaliation.\n       and Justice--The principle or quality of dealing fairly \n     with others.\n       for All--Which means it's as much your country as it is \n     mine.\n\n  Red Skelton always signed off every shown ``Goodnight and God \nBless,'' Yesterday Milton Berle, Red's closest friend told his old \nfriend ``Farewell and God Bless.''\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the citizens of Nevada, Red's wife, \nLothian, Red's family and friends, I say farewell, Red, and God bless.\n  I am grateful that the Senate of the United States is paying tribute \nto America's favorite clown.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my \ndistinguished colleague and friend from Montana, Senator Baucus, be \nrecognized for 10 minutes, without my losing the right to the floor, \nand that I immediately be recognized following the conclusion of his \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, first I want to thank my very good friend \nand colleague, Senator Bumpers, for yielding the time. It is very \ngracious of him. He has waited a good period of time to offer his \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to call on Congress to complete the New \nWorld Mine acquisition and protect Yellowstone National Park. Now that \nthe administration and congressional leadership have reached a budget \nagreement that allows for the acquisition of the New World lands, we \nneed to move decisively. We have belabored this matter much too long \nand now is the time to finish the job.\n  Yellowstone National Park was created 125 years ago. ``For the \nBenefit and Enjoyment of the People.'' Indeed, this is the entrance at \nmammoth Yellowstone Park. You probably cannot read the inscription over \nthe arch but it says ``For the Benefit and Enjoyment of the People.'' \nAnd of course, immediately to my right is the Old Faithful geyser.\n  Every year, Mr. President, 3 million people visit the park, bringing \ntheir children and grandchildren to enjoy the unspoiled beauty that is \nYellowstone--from the Roosevelt arch, which I am pointing to here on my \nright, at the original entrance, to the breathtaking grandeur of Old \nFaithful, to the spectacular wildlife which calls this unique place \nhome.\n  During the month of August, I was fortunate to be present to \ncelebrate Yellowstone's 125th anniversary with Vice President Al Gore. \nAs I entered the park, I remembered my first trip to Yellowstone many \nyears ago. The noble and majestic geysers, the boiling paint pots, and \nthe vast scenery were the stuff of magic to a small child--and remain \nso today.\n  These wonders cannot be seen anywhere else in the United States or, \nfor that matter, in the world. I guarantee you there is not one \nMontanan, young or old, that does not fondly remember his or her first \nvisit to the park, or anybody in our country for that matter. Finishing \nthe New World acquisition is critical so our children may witness the \nwonders of nature, much as we have over the past 125 years.\n  For the past 8 years, America has lived with the threat that a large \ngold mine could harm Yellowstone, our Nation's first national park. \nThis mine,\n\n[[Page S9576]]\n\non the park boundary, could irreparably damage the park by polluting \nrivers and devastating wildlife habitat.\n  In 1996, local citizens, the mining company itself, and the \nadministration, reached a consensus agreement that would stop the \nproposed mine--they all agreed; the administration, the local \ncommunity, and the company--and it would protect Yellowstone and \nsurrounding communities.\n  This agreement provides for the Federal Government to acquire the \nmine property from Battle Mountain Gold in exchange for $65 million. \nThe balanced budget agreement calls for this money to be appropriated \nfrom the Land and Water Conservation Fund.\n  The New World agreement, I think, is very important for two reasons. \nFirst, it protects Yellowstone National Park for future generations. \nWhat could be more important?\n  Second, it protects my State of Montana. It protects Montana's \nnatural heritage, but it also protects Montana's economy.\n  Many of the local communities surrounding Yellowstone depend on the \npark for their economic well-being. If the mine had been built, \nYellowstone would have been harmed, and with it the communities and the \nfamilies that depend on Yellowstone for their livelihood. It is for \nthis reason that a majority of local citizens and businesses oppose the \nmine and support the agreement.\n  In addition, the agreement obligates the mining company to spend \n$22.5 million to clean up historic mine pollution at the headwaters of \nthe Yellowstone River. This will create jobs and clean up the \nenvironment, thereby benefiting the regional economy and improving \nlocally fisheries.\n  As a Senator representing Montana, I will fight to ensure that \nMontana receives these benefits.\n  The bipartisan budget agreement provides an increase of $700 million \nin land and water conservation funding. Of this increase, $315 million \nhas been designated as funding for priority land acquisitions.\n  It is my understanding in speaking with the administration and with \nothers that the New World and Headwaters acquisition were specifically \ndiscussed as the projects that would be funded by the $315 million \ndesignation. It would be unconscionable for Congress to violate the \nspirit and the intent of the budget agreement by failing to appropriate \nthe funding necessary to complete the New World acquisition.\n  In addition, placing further restrictions such as requiring \nauthorization is both unnecessary and unwise. We need no additional \nauthorization. The agreement has been agreed to already. New legal \nprocedures, on the other hand, would just stall an already reached \nagreement, one that is widely supported and one that protects the park.\n  Every year, numerous land acquisitions that are not individually \nauthorized take place utilizing Land and Water Conservation Funds. By \nattaching strings to this acquisition--it is an authorization--Congress \nwill have done nothing but endanger Yellowstone National Park. Indeed, \nthe President's senior advisers strongly object to attaching any \nstrings to this funding, and if Congress insists on stalling and \ndelaying this agreement, the President may well veto the Interior \nappropriations bill upon the recommendation of OMB and other agencies. \nBecause Yellowstone is at stake, he would be right to do so.\n  I pledge here today to help lead the charge to uphold that veto if \nnecessary. When Yellowstone and Montana's heritage is threatened, I \nwill not sit idly by. We can and we must protect Yellowstone National \nPark.\n  I thank my good friend, the Senator from Arkansas, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n\n       excepted committee amendment beginning on page 123, line 9\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS.

The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I have come here today for the eighth \nconsecutive year to debate what I feel very strongly about and have \nalways felt strongly about. I have never succeeded. Since I am going to \nbe leaving next year, I know all my friends from the West are going to \nbe saddened by my departure, and so far I don't have an heir apparent \nto take on this issue.\n  First of all, I want to make an announcement to the 262 million \nAmerican people who know very little or nothing about this issue. The \nfirst announcement I want to make today is that they are now saddled \nwith a clean-up cost of all the abandoned mining sites in the United \nStates of somewhere between $32.7 and $71.5 billion. Now, let me say to \nthe American people while I am making that announcement, you didn't do \nit, you had nothing to do with it, but you are going to have to pick up \nthe tab of between $32 to $71 billion.\n  The Mineral Policy Center says there are 557,000 abandoned mines in \nthe United States. Think of that--557,000 abandoned mines, and 59 of \nthose are on the Superfund National Priority List. Mining has also \nproduced 12,000 miles of polluted streams. The American people didn't \ncause it; the mining industry did it, and 2,000 of those 557,000 sites \nare in our national parks.\n  Now, Mr. President, my amendment would establish a reclamation fund \nin the Treasury and it would be funded by a 5-percent net smelter \nreturn for mining operations on taxpayer-owned land. Royalties based on \ngross income or a net smelter return are traditionally charged for \nmining on private land and for mining on State-owned land.\n  Much of the hardrock mining going on in this country is being done on \nthe lands that you have heard me talk a great deal about--that is, \nlands that have been sold by the Federal Government for $2.50 an acre. \nHowever, a significant amount of mining goes on on lands where people \nhave a mining claim on Federal lands and they get a permit to start \nmining. The Federal Government continues to own the land. We don't get \nanything for it. We don't even get $2.50 an acre for that land. So my \nnet smelter royalty only applies to those lands which we still own.\n  Now, isn't that normal and natural? If you own land that has gold \nunder it and somebody comes by and wants to mine the gold under your \nland, the first thing you do is say, how much royalty are you willing \nto pay? Nationwide, that figure is about 5 percent. But I can tell you \none thing, and this is a major point, if somebody came to you and said, \nI want to mine the gold, the silver, platinum, or palladium under your \nland, the first thing you would demand is, How much are you going to \npay me for it?\n  The U.S. Government cannot because Congress won't let them charge a \nroyalty for mining on public land. We say, ``Here are some of the terms \nunder which you can mine. ``Sic 'em, Tiger.'' Have a good time. Make a \nlot of money. And be sure you don't send the Federal Government, \nnamely, the taxpayer of America, any money, and if you possibly can, \nleave an unmitigated environmental disaster on our hands for the \ntaxpayers to clean up.''\n  You know, Mr. President, I still can't believe it goes on. I have \nbeen at this for 8 years and I still cannot believe what I just said, \nbut it is true.\n  The other part of my bill establishes a net-income based reclamation \nfee based on the profits of the mining company on lands that were \nFederal lands but that have been patented by the mining companies; that \nis, lands which we have sold for $2.50 an acre. The only way in the \nworld we can ever recover anything from these mines is through a \nreclamation fee. It is altogether proper that we get something in \nreturn for the lands that we sold for $2.50 an acre and it is \naltogether proper that that money be used to reclaim these 557,000 \nabandoned mine sites.\n  Mr. President, here is a closer look at what I just got through \nsaying. The royalty rate in the Bumpers/Gregg amendment is 5 percent \nnet smelter return, which is typically what is charged for mining \noperations on private land. The royalty will produce $175 million over \nthe next 5 years. The reclamation fee ranges from 2 to 5 percent of net \nincome for operations on patented lands, the lands that we sold for \n$2.50 an acre. That produces $750 million. And altogether, those two \nprovisions would, over the next 5 years,\n\n[[Page S9578]]\n\nproduce $925 million--not a very big beginning on the roughly $32 to \n$70 billion we are going to have to cough up to clean those places up.\n  Mr. President, look at this chart right here. The thing that is a \nreal enigma to me, is that we make the coal operators in this country \npay us 12.5 percent of their gross income for every ton of coal they \ntake off of Federal lands. That is for surface coal. If it's an \nunderground mine the coal companies pay a royalty of 8 percent of their \ngross income to the Federal Government.\n  Natural gas. If you want to bid on Federal lands and produce natural \ngas, it is incumbent upon you to pay a minimum of 12.5 percent of your \ngross income. When it comes to oil, if you want to drill in the Gulf of \nMexico, you must also pay a 12.5 percent gross royalty.\n  There are oil and gas wells all over the Western part of the United \nStates. And for every dollar of gas or oil they produce, they send \nUncle Sam 12.5 cents.\n  But look here. For gold, they don't send anything. For silver, they \ndon't send anything. For platinum, they don't send anything. And since \n1872, when the old mining law was signed by Ulysses Grant, the mining \ncompanies have not paid a penny to the U.S. Treasury.\n  Now, Mr. President, in 1986--and I use this just as an illustration \nto tell you why we so desperately need this reclamation fund in the \nU.S. Treasury--there was a mine called Summitville in Colorado. \nSummitville was owned by a Canadian mining company called Galactic \nResources. They got a permit to mine on private land from the State of \nColorado. In June of that same year, their cyanide/plastic \nundercoating--and I will explain that in a moment--began to leak.\n  Let me stop just a moment and tell people, my colleagues, how gold \nmining is conducted. You have these giant shovels that take the dirt \nand you put it on a track and you carry it to a site and you stack it \nup on top of a plastic pad, which you hope is leakproof. And then you \nbegin to drip--listen to this--you begin to drip cyanide--yes, \ncyanide--across the top of this giant heap of dirt. The cyanide filters \ndown through this big load of dirt and it gathers up the gold and it \nfilters out to a trench on the side.\n  Now, you have to bear in mind that if that plastic pad, which I just \ndescribed for you a moment ago, is not leakproof, if it springs a leak, \nyou have cyanide dripping right into the ground, right into the water \ntable, or going right into the nearest stream, and so it was with \nSummitville. The plastic coating on the ground, which was supposed to \nkeep the cyanide controlled, began to leak. And the cyanide began to \nescape. And the cyanide began to run into the streams headed right for \nthe Rio Grande River. Galactic could not do anything. They weren't \nclose to capable of doing anything. And so the Federal Government goes \nto Galactic and says, ``We want you to stop this and we want you to pay \nus damages.'' Do you know what they did? They took bankruptcy. Smart \nmove. They took bankruptcy. So what does that leave the U.S. \nGovernment, which is going to ultimately have the responsibility for \ncontrolling this leakage of cyanide poison? It leaves us with a $4.7 \nmillion bond. That is the bond they had put up to the State of Colorado \nin order to mine.\n  Here you have a minimum of $60 million disaster on your hands with a \n$4.7 million bond. And so it is today, Mr. President--35 people \nemployed since 1986, controlling the cyanide runoff from the mine in \nColorado, and the ultimate cost to the taxpayers of this country will \nbe $60 million, minimum.\n\n  Here is one that is even better, Mr. President. This came out of the \nNew York Times 2 days ago. It is a shame that every American citizen \ncan't read this. It's called ``The Blame Slag Heap.''\n\n       In northern Idaho's Silver Valley, the abstractions of the \n     Superfund program--``remediation,'' ``restoration,'' \n     ``liability''--meet real life. For over a century, the \n     region's silver mines provided bullets for our soldiers and \n     fortunes for some of our richest corporations. The mines also \n     created a toxic legacy: wastes and tailings, hundreds of \n     billions of pounds of contaminated sediment * * *.\n       In 1996--13 years after the area was declared the nation's \n     second-largest Superfund site, the Justice Department filed a \n     $600 million lawsuit against the surviving mining companies. \n     The estimated cost of cleanup ranges up to a billion dollars. \n     The Government sued after rejecting the companies' laughably \n     low settlement offer of $1 million.\n\n  A $1 billion cleanup, and the company that caused the damage offers \n$1 million to settle.\n\n       The companies, however, have countersued.\n\n  They are countersuing the Federal Government, and do you know what \nthey allege? They say it happened because the U.S. Government failed to \nregulate the disposal of mining waters.\n  Can you imagine that? The company is suing the Government because the \nGovernment didn't supervise more closely. The story closes out by \nsaying, ``Stop me before I kill again.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the article from the New York \nTimes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          The Blame Slag Heap\n\n                           (By Mark Solomon)\n\n       Spokane, Wash.--In northern Idaho's Silver Valley, the \n     abstractions of the Superfund program--``remediation,'' \n     ``restoration,'' ``liability''--meet real life.\n       For over a century, the region's silver mines provided \n     bullets for our soldiers and fortunes for some of our richest \n     corporations. The mines also created a toxic legacy: wastes \n     and tailings, hundreds of billions of pounds of contaminated \n     sediment, leaching into a watershed that is now home to more \n     than half a million people.\n       In 1996, 13 years after the area was declared the nation's \n     second-largest Superfund site, the Justice Department filed a \n     $600 million lawsuit against the surviving mining companies. \n     The estimated cost of the clean-up ranges up to a billion \n     dollars. The Government sued after rejecting the companies' \n     laughably low settlement offer of $1 million. If the \n     companies don't pay, the Federal taxpayers will have to pick \n     up the tab.\n       The companies, however, have countersued, alleging, among \n     other things, that the Government itself should be held \n     responsible. Why? Because it failed to regulate the disposal \n     of mining wastes.\n       Do I believe my ears? In this era of deregulation, when \n     industry seeks to replace environmental laws with a voluntary \n     system, are the companies really saying that if only they had \n     been regulated more they would have stopped polluting? I've \n     heard the Government blamed for a lot of things, but \n     regulatory laxity was never one of them--until now.\n       In fact, Idaho's mining industry has long fought every \n     attempt at reform. In 1932, for example, a Federal study \n     called for the building of holding ponds to capture the \n     mines' wastes. The companies fought that plan for 36 years, \n     until the Clean Water Act forced them to comply.\n       Now Congress is debating the reauthorization of the \n     Superfund, and industry wants to weaken the provision on \n     damage to natural resources. If the effort succeeds, what \n     will happen in 50 years? Will the polluters sue the \n     Government, blaming it for failing to prevent environmental \n     damage?\n       Quick, stop them before they kill again.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Will the Senator yield specifically to his last comment?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Does the Senator know about the new science that comes out \nof the study of the Superfund site in Silver Valley, ID? Does he \nunderstand also that mediation on the Superfund is now tied up in the \ncourts--conducted by the State of Idaho--that has really produced more \ncleanup and prevented more heavy metals from going into the water \nsystem, and the value of that? Does he also recognize that the suit \nfiled by the Attorney General was more politics and less substance?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That is a subjective judgment, is it not?\n  Mr. CRAIG. I believe that is a fact.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is it not true that the company has countersued the \nFederal Government saying, ``You should have stopped us long ago''? \nIsn't that what the countersuit says--``You should have regulated us \nmore closely''?\n  Mr. CRAIG. But the countersuit says that based on today's science, if \nwe had known it then, which we didn't--you didn't, I didn't, and no \nscientist understood it--then we could have done something different. \nBut as of now this is not an issue for mining law; this is an issue of \na Superfund law that doesn't work, that promotes litigation. That is \nwhy the arguments you make are really not against mining law reform, \nwhich you and I support in some form. What you are really taking is a \nSuperfund law that is tied up in the committees of this Senate, is \nnonfunctional, and produces lawsuits.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Can you tell me where the Superfund law says if you\n\n[[Page S9579]]\n\nwere ignorant of what you were doing and caused the damage, you are \nexcused? Do you know of any place in the Superfund where there is such \nlanguage as that?\n  Mr. CRAIG. What I understand is we have a 100-year-old mine where we \nare trying to take today's science and, looking at it based on your \nargument, move it back 100 years. We should be intent on solving \ntoday's problems and not arguing 100 years later.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Is the State of Idaho willing to take over this cleanup \nsite and absolve the U.S. Government of any further liability?\n  Mr. CRAIG. My guess is that the State of Idaho with some limited \nassistance would champion that cause.\n  I have introduced legislation that would create a base of authority. \nWe believe it would cost the Federal Government less than $100 million. \nThe State would work with some matching moneys. They would bring in the \nmining companies and force them to the table to establish the \nliability. Guess what would happen, Senator. We would be out of the \ncourts. Lawyers would lose hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal \nfees. And we would be cleaning up Superfund sites that have been in \nlitigation for a decade, by your own admission and argument.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Senator, the U.S. Government has sued this company for \n$600 million. The Government estimates that the cleanup cost is going \nto be $1 billion. The Senator comes from the great State of Idaho, and \nI am sure they don't enjoy ingesting cyanide any more than anybody else \nin any other State would.\n  But the Senator would have to admit that Idaho couldn't, if it wanted \nto, clean up this site. It doesn't have the resources. It is the \ntaxpayers of this country that are stuck with that $1 billion debt out \nthere with a company which brashly says, ``If you would have regulated \nus closer, we wouldn't have done it.'' That is like saying, ``If you \nhad taken my pistol away from me, I wouldn't have committed that \nmurder.''\n  Mr. CRAIG. If you would yield only briefly again--I do appreciate \nyour courtesy--there is not a $1 billion price tag. That is a figment \nof the imagination of some of our environmental friends. There is no \nbasis for that argument. There isn't a reasonable scientist who doesn't \nrecognize that for a couple hundred million dollars of well-placed \nmoney, that problem goes away. But, as you know, when you involve the \nFederal Government, you multiply it by at least five. That is exactly \nwhat has gone on here.\n\n       I will tell you that for literally tens of millions of \n     dollars, the State of Idaho, managing a trust fund, has shut \n     down more abandoned mines, closed off the mouths of those \n     mines, and stopped the leaking of heavy metal waters into the \n     Kootenay River, and into the Coeur d'Alene, and done so much \n     more productively, and it has not cost $1 billion. Nobody in \n     Idaho, including our State government, puts a $1 billion \n     price tag on this.\n\n  This is great rhetoric, but it is phony economics.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, let me just say to the Senator from Idaho \nthat my legislation for 8 long years has been an anathema to him. I am \nnot saying if I were a Senator from Alaska, Idaho, or Nevada I wouldn't \nbe making the same arguments.\n  But I want to make this offer. It is a standing offer. If the State \nof Idaho will commit and put up a bond that they will clean up all \nthose abandoned mine sites in that State, that they will take on the \nresponsibility, and do it in good order, and as speedily as possible, I \nwill withdraw my amendment. I don't have the slightest fear. We all \nknow that this is a Federal problem. It is a Federal responsibility to \nclean up these mine sites. The only way we can do it is to get some \nmoney out of the people who got the land virtually free and who have \nleft us with this $30 billion to $70 billion price tag.\n  Let me go back, Mr. President, and just state that since 1872 the \nU.S. Government in all of its generosity has given away 3.244 million \nacres of land. We have given it away for $2.50 an acre. Sometimes we \ngot as much as $5 an acre. There are 330,000 claims still pending in \nthis country. And the Mineral Policy Center estimates that since 1872 \nwe have patented land containing $243 billion worth of minerals--land \nthat used to belong to the taxpayers of this country.\n  We now have a moratorium on all but 235 patent applications. But the \n235 applications, when they are granted, will represent the continued \ntaxpayer giveaway of billions of dollars worth of minerals and land.\n\n       Stillwater Mining Company in Montana has a first half \n     certificate for 2,000 acres of land in the State of Montana. \n     What does that mean? That means they are virtually assured of \n     getting a deed to 2,000 acres of land. It means that they are \n     virtually assured of paying the princely sum of $10,180. \n     Guess what is what is lying underneath the 2,000 acres: $38 \n     billion worth of palladium and platinum. My figure? No. \n     Stillwater's figure. Look at their prospectus. Look at their \n     annual report. They are saying to the people who own stock, \n     ``Have we pulled off a coup.'' We are going to get 2,000 \n     acres of Federal land for $10,180, and it has $38 billion \n     worth of hardrock minerals under it--palladium and platinum.\n\n  You know, one of the things that I think causes me to fail every year \nis that it is so gross, so egregious, that people can't believe it is \nfactual, that it is actually happening. But it is true.\n\n       Look at what happened to Asarco. They paid the U.S. \n     Government $1,745. What did they get? $2.9 billion worth of \n     copper and silver.\n\n  You never heard of a company called Faxe Kalk. Do you know the reason \nyou never heard of it? It is a foreign mining company. You don't \nusually hear of them. The other reason you don't hear of them is \nbecause they are a Danish company. One of the things that makes this \nissue so unpalatable is that many of the biggest 25 mining companies in \nthe United States are foreign companies.\n  We ought to go today to Denmark and say, ``We would like some of your \nNorth Sea oil.'' What do you think they would say if we said, ``Look, \nwe are going to start drilling here off the coast of Denmark. We will \ngive you a dollar now and then for the privilege.'' They would say, \n``You need to be submitted for a saliva test.''\n  But the Faxe Kalk Corporation comes here, and they say, ``You have \n110 acres out here in Idaho, Uncle Sam. We would like to have it. We \nwill pay $275 for it.''\n  So they go to Bruce Babbitt and they say, ``We will give you $275 for \nthis 110 acres.''\n  Do you know what is underneath it? One billion dollars worth of a \nmineral called travertine. It is a mineral used to whiten paper. That \nis $275 the taxpayers get and $1 billion a Danish corporation gets.\n  In 1995 the Secretary of the Interior was forced to deed 1,800 acres \nof public land in Nevada to Barrick Gold Co., a Canadian company, for \nits Gold Strike Mine. Barrick paid $9,000 for that 1,800 acres.\n  Mr. President, there isn't a place in the Ozark Mountains of my State \nwhere you could buy land for one-tenth that price.\n  The law required Secretary Babbitt to give Barrick, which is the most \nprofitable gold company in the world, land containing $11 billion worth \nof gold for $9,000.\n  I could go on. There are other cases just as egregious as that. For 8 \nlong years, I have stood at this very desk, and I have made these \narguments, as I say, which are so outrageous I can hardly believe I am \nsaying them, let alone believing them.\n  Newmont Mining Co. is one of the biggest gold companies in the world. \nThey have a large mine in Nevada which is partially on private land.\n  When people say that somebody is mining on private lands, if you will \ncheck, Mr. President, you will find that in most cases that land was \nFederal land that somebody else patented, and then somebody like \nNewmont comes along, and they say, ``You hold a patent on this land \nthat you got from the Federal Government for $2.50 an acre and we want \nto mine on it.'' Do you know what Newmont pays to the land owner on its \nmine in Nevada? An 18 percent royalty.\n  Mr. President, as I just mentioned, most of the land being mined on, \nso-called private lands, are private because somebody bought it from \nthe Federal Government years ago for $2.50 or $5 an acre.\n  True, it is private. They own it. They paid for it. The mining \ncompanies are willing to pay the States--they are willing to pay the \nStates a royalty. They are willing to pay the States a severance tax. \nThey are willing to pay the private owners of this country an average \nof 5 percent. But when it\n\n[[Page S9580]]\n\ncomes to paying the Federal Government, it is absolutely anathema to \nthem. There is no telling how much the National Mining Association \nspends every year on lobbying, on publicity, on mailers, you name it, \nto keep this sweetheart deal alive.\n  Since I started on this debate 8 years ago, the mining companies of \nthis country have taken out billions of dollars worth of minerals from \ntaxpayer-owned land. And do you know what the Federal Government and \nthe taxpayers of this country got in exchange for that? One \nenvironmental disaster after another to clean up. And so that is the \nreason my bill, which contains a royalty and a reclamation fee, goes \ninto a reclamation fund to at least start undoing the environmental \ndamage these people have done because it is too late to get a royalty \nout of them. The gold is gone. We got the shaft. They got the gold. And \nit is too late to do anything about it. But you can start making them \npay now to clean up those 555,000 sites.\n  Arizona has a 2 percent gross value royalty for mines located on \nState lands and a 2.5 percent net income severance tax for all mines in \nthe State. Montana, 5 percent; fair market for raw metallic minerals; \n1.6 percent of the gross value in excess of $250,000 for gold, silver, \nplatinum group metals.\n\n  All of these States charge royalties for mining operations on State-\nowned land. Most of them also charge a severance tax for mining \noperations on all land in the State. Mr. President, what do they know \nthat we don't? A lot. The States are collecting the money, but not \nUncle Sam.\n  Do you know why I have lost this fight for the last 8 years? Those \nStates that have mining on Federal lands have great representation in \nthe U.S. Senate. I know that every single Western Senator is going to \nstart flocking onto this floor as soon as I start talking about this \namendment.\n  Do you see anybody else on this floor who is not from the West? Do \nyou know why? My mother used to say, ``Everybody's business is nobody's \nbusiness.'' This is everybody's business, except it just doesn't affect \ntheir States. There are no mining jobs in their States. For 8 years I \nhave heard all these sayings, as to how many jobs you are going to \nlose, despite the fact the Congressional Budget Office says, ``None.''\n  ``You are going to lose all these jobs. It is going to discommode the \neconomies of our respective States.'' And yet the States don't \nhesitate. We have people in this body who are Senators from the West \nwho have served in State legislatures, who helped pass these laws, who \nhelped impose royalties and severance taxes against the mining \ncompanies. But somehow or other they go into gridlock when they get \nhere. At the State level they don't mind assessing these kinds of \ntaxes. The States need the money. We do, too. We are the ones who are \ntagged with this gigantic bill for reclamation.\n  Mr. President, I could go through a list of things I have here. Amax, \nfor example, pays 6-percent royalty on the Fort Knox Mine in Alaska. \nThe chairman of the Energy Committee 2 years ago passed legislation \nproviding for a land exchange on Forest Service land in Alaska. The \nKennecott Mining Co. was willing to pay the Forest Service a $1.1 \nmillion fee up front, and then a 3-percent net smelter return on the \nrest of it. We agreed on it, ratified it. I voted for it.\n  But, now, isn't it strange that here is a mine in Alaska that we had \nto legislatively approve--because of the ownership of the land, it \ninvolved a land exchange--and I was happy to do it because it was a \nfair deal and these people demonstrated an interest in paying a fair \nroyalty for what they took.\n  Mr. President, I will yield the floor. I will not belabor this any \nfurther.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator will yield for a question, \nbecause it affects my particular State?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I was getting ready to yield the floor. I want to say in \nclosing, I know a lot of people would like to get out of here as early \nas they can tonight. I don't intend to belabor this. I said mostly what \nI want to say. I may respond to a few things that are said, so I am \ngoing to turn it over to my friends from the West and let them respond \nfor a while, and then hopefully we can get into a time agreement after \nfour or five speakers have spoken.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I would like to respond to my friend \nfrom Arkansas on the mining issues he brings up.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Will the Senator yield for just a moment? When I \nintroduced this amendment, I failed to state that my chief cosponsor on \nthe bill is Senator Gregg from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Again, I would like to call attention to the statement \nthat was made by the Senator from Arkansas relative to the Green Creek \nMine. The thing that made that so different is the unique \ncharacteristic of that particular discovery, where all the components \nwere known relative to the value of the minerals. The roads were in, \nthe infrastructure was in. It was not a matter of discovery, going out \nin an area and wondering whether you were going to develop a \nsufficiency of resources to amortize the investment necessary to put in \na mine. So I remind my colleagues, there is a big difference between \nthe rhetoric that we have heard here and the practical realities of \nexperience in the mining industry.\n\n  We have seen both the effort by Canada and Mexico to initiate \nroyalties. What has happened to their mining industry? It simply moved \noffshore. We have to maintain a competitive atmosphere on a worldwide \nbasis; otherwise the reality for United States mining will be the same \nas was experienced in both Mexico and Canada.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in opposition to Senator \nBumpers' amendment. This is not the first attempt he has made, \ninitiating actions through the Interior appropriations process. We seem \nto be subjected to this every year. I know the intentions are good. But \nthe reality is that the amendment as offered represents a profound--and \nI urge my colleagues to reflect on this--a profound and wide-reaching \nattempt to reform the Nation's mining laws in a way that prevents any \nreal understanding of the impacts of the legislation. Because, as \nwritten, Senator Bumpers' amendment would not only put a royalty of all \nmining claims--all mining claims--but would also put a fee on all \nminerals produced off of lands that have ever gone to patent. Those are \nprivate lands. Let me, again, cite what this amendment does. It would \nnot only put a royalty on all mining claims, but would also put a fee \non all minerals produced off lands that have ever gone to patent. Those \nare private lands. So, this is nothing more than a tax. It is a tax. \nAnd it is this Senator's opinion that this makes Senator Bumpers' \namendment subject to a constitutional point of order.\n  Let me set this aside for a moment and address the specifics of my \nopposition to the amendment. This approach to revenue generation is no \ndifferent than placing a tax on, say, all agricultural production from \nlands that were at one time, say, homesteads. It is retroactive. Even \nthough Senator Bumpers doesn't like it, the fact remains that patent \nclaims are exactly the same as homestead lands. They are all private \nlands.\n  I cannot even begin to imagine the genesis of this punitive and \ndangerous amendment. This is an unmitigated attack on all things \nmining. We have absolutely no idea what impact this legislation would \nhave on our ability to maintain a dependable supply of minerals; no \nidea what environmental disasters would be created when this \nlegislation shuts down the producing mines across the country. We have \nno idea how many workers will be put on the unemployment line. We have \nno idea whatsoever on the effects of this legislation.\n  The issue is very complex. It is not appropriate that it be dealt \nwith in an appropriations process. There is a right way and a wrong way \nto go about mining reform. You can chose the right way and offer your \nreform in a fair and open process, giving everyone the opportunity to \nparticipate in the formation of the legislation, which is what Senator \nCraig and I, along with the cosponsors of the legislation, have \nattempted to do in the legislation that has been offered. Or you can, \nas I observe, do what Senator Bumpers has seen fit to do and offer your \nlegislation in a form where not one single person\n\n[[Page S9581]]\n\noutside the Senator's office has the opportunity to either understand \nor contribute to the process.\n  I think there is too much at stake in mining reform to treat this \ncomplex subject in such a dangerous and offhand manner. Senator Craig, \nalong with myself, Senator Reid, Senator Bryan, Senator Bennett, \nSenator Burns, Senator Hatch, Senator Thomas, Senator Campbell, Senator \nStevens, Senator Kempthorne, among a few, have introduced S. 1102, the \nMining Reform Act of 1997. As such, I encourage my colleagues to \nrecognize the time and effort that has been put into developing a \npackage of reforms that set the stage for a meaningful, honest, and \ncomprehensive reform. We are going to be holding a series of hearings \nto explore all aspects of the legislation and the effect it will have \non the Nation's environment and economy.\n  I know many Members have indicated their interest in the formation of \nthis legislation and the process of the hearings as they unfold and \nintend to participate. This is how reforms should take place. Reform \nshould take place in an orderly manner in the hearing process, and we \nhave lived up, I think, to the expectations of those who have \nindicated, ``All right, we will stand with you, but give us a bill.'' \nWe have met that obligation and filed a piece of comprehensive mining \nreform legislation.\n  We are going to consider the amendments as part of the process of \ndebate, and if they make a legitimate contribution to the mining reform \neffort--and I emphasize reform effort--we are going to adopt them. This \nis the appropriate method to resolve mining reform, not as a last-\nminute amendment to the Interior appropriations bill, which we have \nseen the Senator from Arkansas propose time and time again.\n  The reform that Senator Craig, I, and others have offered lays a \nsolid foundation upon which to build mining reform. Our mining reform \nbill should, I think, please reasonable voices on both sides. If you \nseek reform that brings a fair return to the Treasury, and it is \npatterned after the policies of the mining law of Nevada--and it works \nin Nevada--and it protects the environment and preserves our ability to \nproduce strategic minerals, I think you will find a great deal to \nsupport in this legislation. It does work.\n  The legislation protects some of the smaller interests, the small \nminers. It maintains traditional location and discovery practices.\n  Yes, it is time for reform, but it has to be done right. Bad \ndecisions will harm a $5 billion industry whose products are the muscle \nand sinew of the Nation's industrial output. The future of as many as \n120,000 American miners and their families and their communities are at \nstake. Any action to move on amendment is absolutely irresponsible to \nthose individuals, because it is the wrong way to do it.\n  I know you have heard this before, time and time again, but we do \nhave a bill in now and it is a responsible bill. We owe Americans a \nbalanced and open resolution to the mining reform debate. This reform \nmining legislation honors the past, recognizes the present, and sets \nthe stage, I think, for a bright future.\n  The legislation that we offer advances reforms in four areas: \nroyalties, patents, operations, and reclamation.\n  Let me be very brief in referring to the royalties. The legislation \ncreates the first-ever hard rock royalty. It requires that 5 percent of \nthe profit made from mining on Federal lands be paid to the Federal \nGovernment. This legislation seeks a percentage of the profit, not the \nvalue of the mineral in place. We do this for a very specific reason. \nFailure to do so would cause a shutdown of many operations and prevent \nthe opening of new mines. It would also cause other operators to cast \nlow-ore concentrates into the spoil pile as they seek out only the very \nhighest grade of ores.\n  America boasts some very profitable mines, but there is an equal \nnumber that operate on a very thin margin. The Senator from Arkansas \ndoesn't address the reality of what happens when the price of silver or \nthe price of gold drops and their margin squeezes. We have some mines \nthat actually operate during those periods with substantial losses.\n  That is why we designed our royalty to take a percentage of the \nprofits. Under the proposal that the Senator from Arkansas has \nproposed, time and time again, many of these mines would actually \noperate at a loss because they could not deduct their production costs \nprior to the sale of their finished product.\n  If the mine makes money, the public gets a share. That is a fair way \nto do it. Nobody benefits from a royalty system so intrusive that it \nmust be paid for through the loss of jobs, the health of local \ncommunities, and the abandonment of lower grade mineral resources.\n  Some would want to simply drive the mining industry out of the United \nStates because they look at it as some kind of an environmental devil \nthat somehow can't, through advanced technology, make a contribution to \nthe Nation. I say that they can, they will and, through this \nlegislation, they will be able to do a better job.\n  In 1974, British Columbia put a royalty on minerals before cost of \nproduction was factored in. Five thousand miners lost their jobs. That \nis a fact. Only one new mine went into operation in 1976. The industry \nwas devastated. The royalty was removed 2 years later in 1978.\n\n  That is the reality of the world in which we live and the \ninternational competitiveness associated with this industry. Years \nlater, the industry in British Columbia still has not completely \nrecovered. I happen to know what I am talking about because the Senator \nfrom Alaska is very close to our neighbors in British Columbia.\n  So I say to those who forget history, they are doomed to repeat it.\n  Patents: Patenting grants the right to take title to lands containing \nminerals upon demonstration that the land can support a profitable \noperation.\n  Patents have been abused, no question about it. A small number of \nunscrupulous individuals have located mineral operations for the sole \npurpose of gaining title and turning the land into a lodge or ski \nresort. These practices are wrong. They are not allowed under the new \nlegislation.\n  The reform that we have offered cures these problems without \npunishing the innocent. We would continue to issue patents to people \nengaged in legitimate mining operations, but a patent would be revoked \nif the land is used for purposes other than mining.\n  Operations: To separate legitimate miners from mere speculators and \nto unburden the Government from mining claims with no real potential, \nwe require a $25 filing fee be paid at the time the claim is filed and \nmake the annual $100 claim maintenance fee permanent.\n  Environmental protection: Our revisions weave a tight environmental \nsafety net. The reform permit process requires approval for all but the \nmost minimal activities. The bill requires reclamation, and the bill \nrequires full bonding to deal with abandonment.\n  The Senator from Arkansas doesn't acknowledge the effort relative to \nwhat this bonding will mean. It will mean that mines that are abandoned \nwill have a reclamation bond in place to make sure the public does not \nhave to bear the cost of cleanup. The bond is going to be there; it is \ngoing to be held. It is a performance bond, that is what it means.\n  As we address the responsibility for a prudent mining bill, please \nrecognize the contributions that have been made in trying to formulate \nsomething realistic that will address the abuses that we have had in \nthe past. That is what we do in our bill.\n  The bill addresses mines already abandoned by establishing a \nreclamation fund as well. Filing fees, maintenance fees and the royalty \ngo into that fund. So we have addressed that in a responsible manner.\n  For those who seek meaningful reform to the Nation's general mining \nlaws, then our legislation does the job. It fixes past abuses without \npunishing the innocent. It shares profits without putting people out of \nwork. It assures the mining operations cause the least possible \ndisturbance. And it makes sure we don't pay for actions of a few bad \noperators and provide sources of funds for reclamation.\n  Both sides of the mining reform debate have come a long way toward a \nconstructive compromise. I have met with Senator Bumpers on many \noccasions, and at one time actually thought we were going to reach an \naccord. But unfortunately we didn't. But we have gone ahead and put in \nthe bill. The bill will help carry us, I think, the last\n\n[[Page S9582]]\n\nmile and provide the balanced reform that has, so far, eluded us.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me, Senator Craig and others in \ncontinuing to craft this open and meaningful mining reform. With equal \nvigor, I ask each and every Member of this body to join us in opposing \nSenator Bumpers' proposal, a reform crafted in the dark of night and \noffered in a forum guaranteed to confuse and shroud the real impact of \nthe legislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I will not at this point speak to the \nmerits of the amendment. Both the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator \nfrom Alaska have done so, each of them repeating points that I can \nremember having heard almost verbatim in several previous sessions of \nCongress. My remarks will be much more narrow.\n  Section (d)(1) of this amendment states:\n\n       Any person producing hardrock minerals from a mine that was \n     within a mining claim that has subsequently been patented \n     under the general mining laws shall pay a reclamation fee to \n     the Secretary under this subsection.\n\n  The Senator from Arkansas quite properly described that fee as a \nseverance tax, and a severance tax it is. It applies only to minerals \ncoming out, presumably, in the future from certain classes of lands in \nthe United States. It is not something directed at the restoration of \nthose lands, but is to be used as a source of money for much broader \npurposes.\n  The Senator's description of it as a tax is accurate.\n  Article I, section 7 of the Constitution of the United States under \nwhich we operate states--and I quote--\n\n       All Bills for raising revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives.\n\n  No such tax appears in the similar bill that the House of \nRepresentatives has passed.\n  It is crystal clear to me that should this tax be added on to this \nbill it will be blue slipped in the House of Representatives, that is, \nit will not be considered on the grounds that that portion of the bill, \nthat subject of the bill could only originate in the House.\n  The House of Representatives is as jealous of its prerogatives to \noriginate tax bills as the Senate is to ratifying treaties or to \nconfirm Presidential appointments or to engage in any of the activities \nthat are lodged by the Constitution in this body.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  As a consequence, although there has been some time devoted to the \nmerits of this amendment, and because I believe that it clearly \nviolates article I, section 7 of the Constitution, I raise a \nconstitutional point of order against the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is debatable. \nIs the point of order well-taken, would be the question?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Parliamentary inquiry. Do we ask for the yeas and nays at \nthis time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is appropriate.\n  Mr. REID. I do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I hope that we can resolve this issue. It is quite clear \nthat it does violate the Constitution of the United States. That is by \ntaking the Senator's own statement during the time he was debating his \namendment. It is clear from his own statement that it is a violation of \nthe Constitution.\n  I say to my friends who are listening to this debate, Members of the \nSenate, that we would vote on this issue and if this issue prevails, of \ncourse, the amendment falls. But I would also say that we should look \nat this on the legal aspect. If this stays in this bill, the bill is \ngone. There is no question that it is unconstitutional and we should \nvote based on the constitutionality of this amendment, not on the \nmerits of the amendment.\n  I say to my friends that we have voted on some aspect of an amendment \nlike this on other occasions. My friend from Arkansas has framed it \ndifferently this time. Therefore, we have raised this point of order. I \nask that we dispose of this. It is getting late into the night. I \nrepeat, if this constitutional point of order is upheld, the amendment \nfalls.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know we will probably soon be voting \non this important amendment and on this important issue.\n  I was sitting in my office and listening to my distinguished \ncolleague from Arkansas, my friend and neighbor, and thought that I \nmight come down and try to give him some help and support, not that he \nneeds any more help in articulating the issue and speaking about it and \noutlining it, which he does so beautifully, but to let him know that as \na new member of the Energy Committee, one that just arrived here and \nhas not spent even a year here, and with him getting ready to retire \nand having announced his retirement, that I want to let him know I am \ngoing to pick up this ball wherever it may land today, I say to Senator \nBumpers.\n\n  I come from a State that has obviously some mining interests, but I \ncome from a State that has had oil and gas development and exploration \nfor many years.\n  I am from a position of understanding that when it is done correctly \nhow much of a benefit it can be in terms of jobs and economic \ndevelopment and helping people and enriching the corporations and \nbusinesses as well as the average working man and woman.\n  But I can also see from knowing about our history in Louisiana that \nwhen the laws are not fair, when they are not written with the taxpayer \nin mind, that the taxpayers can be shortchanged. When taxpayers are \nshortchanged, families are shortchanged, and when families are \nshortchanged, children are shortchanged. When I think of the hundreds \nof millions and billions of dollars that could have been allocated \ndifferently perhaps in the history of our State as we took out oil and \ngas, that would have been more fair to everyone.\n  I have to sympathize in a great way with what the Senator from \nArkansas is speaking about regarding many of our Western States.\n  To my great colleague and chairman of the Energy Committee, from a \nState very far from ours, I do not want him to think that I am meddling \nin other States' business. I have been in the legislature for many \nyears in my own State. But it is an issue that should concern every \ntaxpayer in America.\n  As we look for dollars to send our children to the best of schools \nthat we can provide, when we look and scrape for dollars to provide \nimmunization shots for them so that they can live a healthy life, when \nwe are looking for dollars every day to try to literally make decisions \nabout life and death, to not have these laws and rules and regulations \nestablished in such a way to just give fairness to the taxpayer is why \nI am here.\n  I am going to support this amendment. I am coauthoring this \namendment. I am going to work diligently with Senator Bumpers and other \nMembers on both sides of this aisle to learn more about the specifics, \nto be a strong advocate for reform and change, to make sure that this \nallocation is done fairly for the taxpayers, and for somebody in these \nrooms to start dealing the deal for the taxpayer for a change and not \nspecifically for a particular company or a particular entity. I know \nthat my colleagues from these other States will keep that in mind as we \nmove along with this amendment and this bill.\n  So I thank my colleague from Arkansas for his great work, for 8 years \nof his impassioned speeches, and hope that many Members of our Senate \nwill become more knowledgeable about this issue because I can \nunderstand by looking at this amendment, not even having read all of \nthe details of it, what is causing the consternation.\n  We are not talking about $2.50 or $1 or $15. We are talking about \n$750 and $550 million. When you talk about serious dollars, people wake \nup and get exercised about it. But it is about time maybe some of this \nmoney got into the hands of our children and families that need it that \ncould use it for other\n\n[[Page S9583]]\n\nthings that would be important, not to mention the environmental \nconcerns which are also of great concern to everyone.\n  So I am proud to support the amendment. I am happy for my name to be \nlisted as a coauthor. Since I just got here, I plan to spend a lot of \ntime working on the Energy Committee and look forward to working with \nmembers of the Energy Committee and others.\n  Mr. BURNS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I do not think there is a Senator in this \nbody who is not sensitive to families, is not sensitive to the working \nmen and women of this country.\n  Who do you think is employed by the mines? Do we just disregard the \njob opportunities? Do we deny America of a resource that is used in \njust about everything that we pick up, from pencils to what we tie our \nshoes with? Doesn't that involve families, children, and schools, and \nroads, and public safety? It is a resource. Families and people are \ninvolved.\n\n  There is a basic fairness here. There is a human factor. All of this \njust doesn't jump out of the ground into the truck and then a faceless \nperson drives a truck and a faceless person goes home to feed his \nfamily and pay his taxes, payroll taxes, insurance, workmen's comp. All \nof this is created out of commercial activity.\n  Now, if none of that is there, then you have even taken away the \nopportunity for upward mobility for the greatest number of people in \nthis country.\n  There is not anybody here that is not sensitive to people and to the \nworking men and women of this country or to families or even \ncommunities and all it takes to operate the communities, because to \nmany of them, this is a commercial opportunity.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wanted to speak briefly on the amendment \nthat has been offered. I recognize the Senator from Washington has \nraised the issue of constitutionality on this amendment. I leave that \nto constitutional attorneys in this body--of which he happens to be a \nleading one--to debate and discuss.\n  Let me mention quickly some of my concerns to the opposition of the \nunderlying amendment. I believe the Senator from Arkansas has brought \nforward an appropriate amendment. What we are talking about here is \nessentially corporate welfare. This is not about family, and whose \nfamilies does this or that, quite honestly. As a practical matter I \nbelieve the majority of the mining companies involved here, or a large \npercentage, come from other countries. We are talking about families. \nIt would be how we benefit families from different countries. It is a \nclassic case of corporate welfare.\n  The Senator from Arkansas has outlined in great detail, and very \nappropriately, what appears to a considerable outrage being perpetrated \non the taxpayers of America in that we are selling land at $2.50 an \nacre which generates billions of dollars worth of revenue to \ncorporations who pay virtually nothing in relationship to that revenue \nas it relates to the ore brought out of that land. In fact, the irony \nis they get a depletion allowance, a depletion tax allowance on the \nbasis of this $2.50 land--not using that as a basis--which shouldn't \napply to them to begin with because the land isn't purchased at a fair \nvalue. Yet they are given a tax break, a depletion allowance, in order \nto subsidize what is already grossly subsidized.\n  It is appropriate as we step forward, as the Senator from Arkansas \nhas, and say if you are going to make this type of money off lands \nwhich are publicly owned--and the land is not publicly owned by the \nState, it is publicly owned by the Federal Government, and the Federal \nGovernment is the people of this country, not just the people of one \nState--if you are going to make money off publicly owned lands, the \npublic should get some sort of return on it. That is only reasonable. \nThe public should have the right to expect that it would benefit from \nthe extraction of these valuable ores from land which they own, much as \nanybody who was a stockholder in a company would benefit from the \nprofits of a company. The taxpayer is essentially the stockholder. The \nland is owned by the taxpayer. Therefore, there is a legitimacy to the \nposition taken by the Senator from Arkansas that the value that is \nbeing withdrawn from this land should be returned in part, at least, to \nthe people whose land is being used.\n  If you own a farm and you discover there is oil under your land, as a \nprivate citizen, and you go to an oil company and say, ``Come on to my \nfarm and pump my oil out,'' you are not going to say, ``I will sell you \nmy land for $2.50,'' would you? Nobody would, no. You will say, ``Come \non to my land, I may lease it to you for $2.50''--I find that hard to \nbelieve for the purposes of pumping oil, ``but when you pump that oil \nout I will want a percentage of that profit.'' It is called a royalty \npayment. That is what is being proposed by the Senator from Arkansas.\n\n  It is totally reasonable in light of the staggering, staggering \nwealth which is generated from these mining claims in exchange for the \nminute amount of money that is paid for these mining claims. Estimates \nthat have been pointed out by the Senator from Arkansas: For as little \nas $1,500, people purchased mining claims that generated over $3 \nbillion; for as little as $275, people purchased mining claims worth \nover $1 billion; for as little as $9,000 people generated mining claims \nworth over $11 billion; and we have pending one where people will pay \nabout $10,000 for benefits of approximately $38 billion.\n  How can anybody in good conscience go back to their taxpayers and say \nwe just sold a piece of your land that has $38 billion worth of assets \non it; we just sold it for 10,000 bucks? Who would go to their \nneighbor, with a straight face, and say ``They just found oil on my \nland. I just sold it to the oil companies for $10,000. The oil is worth \n$38 billion. Didn't I get a good deal, neighbor?'' You would be laughed \nout of town.\n  I think people who have the responsibility, the fiduciary \nresponsibility of protecting the taxpayer and the taxpayers' land might \nalso be laughed out of town, or at least be voted out of town if they \ncontinue to pursue this course.\n  I strongly support the underlying amendment. I will leave it to the \nconstitutional lawyers to settle the constitutional point. But the \nconcept of giving the taxpayers a fair break on this issue, the concept \nof giving the taxpayers a decent return on this very valuable asset is, \nI think, very appropriate, and it is time we started putting an end to \nthis kind of corporate welfare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON. Two brief points. First, the Senator from New Hampshire \ndescribes what is an entirely reasonable point, it seems to me, if we \nare talking about land sold by the United States in the future.\n  But in effect he is saying a policy we ought to adopt is one that \nwould be analogous to something in my own State, where 20 years ago you \nsold shares of stock in Microsoft for $10 a share and they are now \nworth $100,000 a share today, and he says, ``Gee, I made a bad bargain. \nI ought to get some more of that back. I want a share of that profit.'' \nThat goes to the equities of the position.\n  The point before the Senate now is whether or not we can \nconstitutionally deal with this. The Senator from Louisiana made the \nperfect argument on our side. She said we aren't getting enough taxes, \nwe need to get more taxes out of these lands.\n  That is exactly what the Senator proposes to do--tax these lands. Tax \nbills must originate in the House of Representatives. This does not \noriginate in the House of Representatives. It is not something that \nthis body constitutionally can deal with. That is the point on which we \nare going to vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say, first of all, that I would have asked for a \ndivision, incidentally, before the point of order was made if I had had \nthe chance.\n  Let me make a parliamentary inquiry. Division is not in order after \nthe point of order is made, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Let me say to my colleagues that I didn't get a chance \nto ask for a division. So, if you want to stand on ceremony, if you \nwant to go home and tell the folks back home why\n\n[[Page S9584]]\n\nyou voted to continue giving billions of dollars worth of gold and \nsilver away every year because of this little fine, distinguished \npoint, you go ahead and do that. Be my guest.\n  If you are looking for something to hang your hat on even though you \nwould be entirely incorrect, you can do it.\n  Do you know something else? The Senator from Alaska, the Senator from \nNevada, the Senator from Idaho, and others who introduced this bill in \nthis Senate, they have a royalty provision in their bill. That bill, \nlike the bills I introduced, has been referred to the Senate Energy \nCommittee, not the Finance Committee. Obviously my amendment does not \ncontain a tax.\n  So we raise this little fine diversionary point and we hope that \npeople will forget that, since 1872, 243 billion dollars' worth of \ntheir property has been expropriated by the biggest corporations in the \nworld--not in America, in the world. So, candidate, when you see a 30-\nsecond spot next year saying, ``He voted to continue this foul, \noutrageous, egregious practice, and the landowners of this country, the \ntaxpayers who own it, you tax them for everything.'' How many times \nduring the budget debate did I hear the cries about the ``poor, taxed \nAmerican taxpayer?'' Go home and tell that taxpayer you were just \nkidding. If you weren't kidding, why are you voting to continue to give \nbillions of dollars worth of their property away every year?\n  The Senator from Alaska says, ``If you pass the Bumpers amendment, \nyou are going to drive all these mining companies offshore.'' Do you \nknow what my response to that is? If all you want to do, Stillwater \nMining Co., is take 38 billion dollars' worth of platinum off of 2,000 \nacres of land in Montana and give us $10,000 back for your $38 billion, \nso long, good riddance. What on Earth are we thinking about in this \nbody?\n  So, Mr. President, let me make this point one more time because I \npromise you there is going to be a lot of 30-second spots next year on \nthis issue. You cannot duck this one forever. You cannot campaign back \nhome on the finely crafted point of order made by the Senator from \nWashington that this doesn't belong in this bill and the House of \nRepresentatives will blue slip it. Since when did that become a big \nitem around here? If you are looking for something to hang your hat on, \nyou go ahead; you vote for the point of order and then go home next \nfall, and when you are in a debate with your opponent and he says, ``He \nhas voted time and again to give away these billions of dollars of \nresources that belong to you, the American people for nothing; he is \nwilling to make the oil companies pay 12.5 percent royalty, make the \ngas companies pay a 12.5 percent royalty, is willing to make the coal \noperators pay a 12.5 percent royalty, or an 8 percent royalty for \nunderground mining, but when it comes to gold and silver, he gets \nlockjaw, just can't get it out of the chute.'' You answer that when \nyour opponent hits you with that and tells you that the Federal \nGovernment would have received $12 billion in royalties since 1872 for \npatented land alone.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. No, I will not yield. Then you stand on ceremony. And \nwhen your opponent charges you with that, you say, ``Well, there is a \nlittle distinction. The Constitution says * * *.'' You see how that \ngoes over.\n  Let me make one other point. Even if the point of order was valid \nagainst the reclamation fee, which it clearly is not, how can anybody \nargue that the royalty is unconstitutional.\n  So I leave it to your conscience on how you want to handle this. I \nwill yield now to the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I ask my learned colleague if he thinks that the \nconstitutional matters are strictly in the realm of technical matters \nand are of no consequence, which is what the Senator from Arkansas \ninferred? This is a constitutional point of order, is it not?\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. It is a point of order.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It has great significance relative to the manner in \nwhich this body conducts itself.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. As the Senator knows, nobody in this body has shown a \ndeeper devotion to the Constitution of the United States than the \nSenator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Yet, the Senator from Arkansas says it is a \n``technical'' matter and of no consequence.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. All I'm saying to my colleagues is that you're not going \nto get a chance to vote on a division, you are not going to get a \nchance----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. That is not the fault of the Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. All I am saying is that the point of order was made \nbefore I could ask for a division. I am saying that could be worked \nout, and it could be easily worked out.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. We both follow the rules of the Senate. My question to \nthe Senator is, does the Senator from Arkansas regard this issue as a \ntechnical matter when it is a constitutional provision?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I still have the floor, do I not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas has the floor.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to ask for a division.\n  Mr. REID. Objection.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Somebody objected? I can't believe this.\n  Mr. President, like Mo Udall used to say, ``Everything that needs to \nbe said has been said, though everybody hasn't said it.'' I have said \nabout all I can say for the eighth year. I consider this the most \negregious thing that the Senate turns its back on every year. Of all \nthe battles I have fought, particularly on the defense budget and in \nthe Energy Committee, none of them are of equal importance to me as \nthis. It is an absolute enigma to me how this body continues to vote to \ncontinue this outrageous practice.\n  While you are telling them about that fine constitutional \ndistinction, in answer to why you are giving the gold and silver away \nto the biggest mining companies in the world, also remind them that not \nonly do we not get one farthing in return for our gold and silver, they \nhave just left you with a $32 to $70 billion cleanup cost.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Arkansas has stated there has \nbeen a fine distinction point raised. That fine distinction point is \nthe Constitution of the United States. I think that is something that \nwe should be concerned about. This country has been in existence for \nmore than 200 years, and this body has been in existence for more than \n200 years. I think if we are anything of significance, which I believe \nwe are, we are a country that is bound by the constitutional dictates \nset up by our Founding Fathers. The constitutional point of order lies.\n  Now, I also think, prior to voting on this, that we have to \nunderstand that much of what the Senator from Arkansas says, throwing \nthese numbers around, talking about 30-second spots, these are a \nfigment of someone's imagination. You cannot get out of here and talk \nabout billions of dollars in cleanup and all the problems caused by \nmining. The fact of the matter is that with rare, rare exception, all \nof the cases he has talked about are cases involving mines that have \nlong since been depleted, old mines where we had no reclamation laws, \nwe had no environmental laws. That is why the Superfund is attempting \nto go clean them up. Under modern day reclamation and mining in the \nWestern United States, we have good laws. He talks about leach mining, \nwhere you lay down a plastic pad and what if it leaks. Well, it doesn't \nleak. We have stringent controls that guarantees that.\n\n  I would also say, Mr. President, that I understand the feelings of \nthe Senator from Arkansas about mining--I believe it is a very \nimportant industry in this country--when he says--and he said this \nbefore--``If you do not like what we are doing to you in the United \nStates, adios.'' And he waves.\n  Let me talk about two of the States that are small States \npopulationwise. Let's talk about the State of North Dakota and see how \nimportant mining is to North Dakota.\n  The value of minerals mined in North Dakota for the year 1995 was \nalmost $308 million; directly contribution to Federal Government \nrevenues, $21 million is what the Federal government gains from the \nmining in a tiny State of North Dakota; total jobs gained directly and \nindirectly in North Dakota, 13,000 jobs.\n\n[[Page S9585]]\n\n  Take another very small State, the State of Wyoming, the smallest \nState populationwise, or maybe Alaska is, but one of the smaller two \nStates. The value of minerals in the State of Wyoming, over $2.5 \nbillion; jobs in Wyoming, 41,000.\n  The point is that mining is important. We are a net exporter of gold. \nThis has only happened during the last 10 years.\n  We talk about a favorable balance of trade. We have one in mining, \nwhich is very significant and important to this country. The price of \ngold has dropped significantly this past year. It was over $400 an \nounce, and now it is barely $320 an ounce. Mining companies are having \ntrouble making it.\n  So, I say also to my friend from Arkansas that every battle that he \nfights on the Senate floor is the most important battle that he fights. \nWe have heard him on a number of issues that he talks strenuously and \nvery passionately about. On every one, he tells us that it is the most \nimportant. I have great respect and admiration for his ability to \ndebate. But the fact is, sometimes we are debating facts that are not \nat issue.\n  The issue before this body today is a constitutional issue as to \nwhether or not the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas violates the \nConstitution. He has stated it does. I do not know if he wants a \nrollcall vote on it, or whether we should do it by voice vote.\n  I say through the Chair to my friend from Arkansas, I have a question \nfor my friend from Arkansas. He has acknowledged that his amendment \nviolates the Constitution.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I didn't acknowledge that. But go ahead.\n  Mr. REID. My question was, do you want a rollcall vote on that, or \nshould we do it by voice vote on a constitutional provision?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator does not have the option of doing that. He \nis going to be voting on the amendment, period. He is going to be \nvoting on the point of order raised by the Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator want a rollcall vote on that?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Absolutely.\n  Mr. REID. I thought there was an acknowledgment here in the Senate \nthat it did violate the Constitution.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. The Senator from Nevada is incorrect. My amendment does \nnot violate the Constitution and it deserves an up or down vote. What \nis the Senator from Nevada and the Senator from Alaska so afraid of?\n  Mr. REID. So, in short, Mr. President, there has been an \nacknowledgment, even by the proponent of the amendment--the Record \nspeaks for itself--that this amendment violates the Constitution.\n  I want everyone walking over here to vote to understand that we \nsaid--``we,'' those of us who have talked for years against the \namendments offered by my friend from Arkansas; and I will not describe \nthe amendments--we have said that we would offer mining law reform, and \nwe have done that. We have done that. This is a good bill. It calls for \na royalty, reforms the patenting process, and reclamation. It is a good \nbill. We have done that. We have kept faith.\n\n  I also want everyone to understand, especially on the Democratic \nside, this constitutional issue, or the underlying amendment, has \nnothing do with the regulation that we disposed of here yesterday on \nthe Senate floor. This has nothing to do with the issue--some \ncontroversy between the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from \nNevada--within the Democratic conference. This is a separate issue \ndealing with a tax, a tax that has been established with not a single \nhearing, with no debate whatsoever prior to getting here. It was thrown \nupon us here, on the Senate floor, this morning.\n  So I say we should go forward with this constitutional point of \norder.\n  In closing, let me say that the taxpayers of this country, the \nhundreds of thousands of people that work in mining, do care about \nmining. Their jobs come from mines. They pay taxes. And they provide \nfor one of the finest industries that we have in the Western part of \nthe United States.\n  I also say that we talk about environmental laws. I invite my friend \nfrom Arkansas, and anyone else that wants to see good reclamation, come \nand see what mining companies do in the modern-day West. Joshua trees \nare not torn up in a mining process. They must be saved so that when \nthe mining is completed they can be replanted.\n  The mining company not far from my hometown, Searchlight, NV--they \nhave a mining operation that has also a farming operation. They save \nall of the trees that have been uprooted from the mining. When that \nparticular part of the mine is closed, they have to replant the Joshua \ntrees.\n  So mining companies have contributed a lot environmentally to this \ncountry.\n  I think we have to understand that the passionate arguments of my \nfriend from Arkansas are based little on fact and much on passion.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, before we vote, I want to make just a couple of \nadditional remarks for the Record.\n  Listening to my colleagues speak about the Constitution and the \nintricacies of whether this is appropriate or not, compels me to say \nthat the most important thing about our Constitution in the United \nStates is the essential component written in that document about \njustice and fairness. That is what our Constitution is about. That is \nall this issue is about. It is about fairness and justice to the \ntaxpayers and to the families and to children in our country.\n  To the children who come to me now and in the future, and perhaps \nlook a little sad, telling me they come from families that may be poor, \nthey don't have what they need, I remind them that they are not poor, \nthat they live in a State and in a country with bountiful resources. \nThey actually own gold and silver that belong to them.\n  But for some reason that I am finding hard to understand, for over \n100 years this Senate and the House of Representatives refuses to \nacknowledge that this is not something we own, the 100 of us sitting \nhere; this is something that the public owns. It belongs not to us, not \nto a few companies, nor to many companies. It belongs to the children \nof America. This is their land. It is their gold. It is their silver. \nAnd it is our job to make sure they get a fair portion--not all of it--\nbut a fair portion of it. It is clear to me that they have not for 130 \nyears gotten their fair portion of what is theirs, what was given to \nthem--not by us, but by God, and others.\n  So I want to make that point for the Record.\n  I hope we will vote soon.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, first of all, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senator from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, be added as a \ncosponsor to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Second, Mr. President, I want to say to my colleagues \nthat on this point of order, if you want to vote ``no'' because of the \nconstitutional technicality which is raised by the point of the order \nby the Senator from Washington, bear in mind that the point of order is \nclearly not valid at all against the royalty provision in this bill.\n  The reason I can tell you that with absolute certainty is because the \nbill of the Senator from Alaska, the Senator from Idaho, and the \nSenator from Nevada, has a royalty provision in it. The Parliamentarian \nof this body referred it to the Energy Committee--not the Finance \nCommittee. There isn't any question that there is no point of order \nagainst the royalty provision in this bill.\n  Second, I would like to ask my distinguished friend from Nevada, if I \ncould have the attention of the Senator from Nevada----\n  Mr. REID. Which one?\n  Mr. BUMPERS. I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada if he will \ntell his 99 colleagues why Newmont Mining Co.--which is the biggest \nmining company in Nevada--why is it that they are willing to pay 18 \npercent royalty for private lands they mine on, and land which is a \npart of the very same mine which they got a patent on from the U.S. \nGovernment for $2.50 an acre, why they are not willing to pay any \nroyalty on that.\n\n[[Page S9586]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to respond to my friend from Arkansas.\n  First of all, again, with all due respect to my friend from Arkansas, \nit is somewhat misleading to say they get $2.50 an acre for land.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. They got it for $35----\n  Mr. REID. Let me finish my answer.\n  To develop that piece of land costs them tens of millions of dollars. \nYou don't simply go out in the deserts of Nevada or any place in the \nWest and locate a claim and start scooping out the gold. I am not \nsaying millions of dollars. I am saying tens of millions of dollars.\n  In addition to that, the unique situation that the Senator has \nraised, they also purchased next to their mine a ranch.\n  And the reason they purchased the ranch originally was so their \nmining operations would not interfere with the ranch property. They \nbought that ranch so their trucks could go through the property on \ntheir roads. They found on that land some mineral value. Since they \nowned the ranch, and they found some gold. And the reason they were \nwilling to do that, and pay the fee on land that they already had, is \nbecause they had an ongoing operation. They had already developed and \nthey discovered gold there, and it was the profitable thing for them to \ndo. They didn't do it, just to go out and then somebody said, ``You \nstart paying us 18 percent royalty.'' They already had a huge mining \noperation in the immediate vicinity of the property they agreed to \nlease.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator realize that the land on which they are \npaying 18 percent royalty was formerly Federal land and was patented by \na totally different person and they bought it, they bought it from \nsomebody else who paid the Federal Government either $2.50 an acre or \n$5 an acre? They are paying him, not the Federal Government.\n  You see, if they had been smart enough to get a patent before this \nother fellow did, they would not have had to pay anything. Now they are \npaying somebody else who patented the land 18 percent, but if they had \ngotten the patent from the Federal Government, they wouldn't have had \nto pay a penny.\n  Indeed, Senator, I don't want to make too much light of your \nargument, but I don't even know what your answer is. I still do not \nunderstand why it is they are willing to pay 18 percent royalty to a \nguy who patented the land from the Federal Government. It is now \nprivate land because he bought it for $2.50 an acre. They are willing \nto pay him 18 percent royalty but the other lands--it is a part of the \nsame lode of gold that they got a patent on from the Federal \nGovernment. They are not willing to pay one farthing, and the reason \nthey are not willing to, I say to the Senator, you and I both know the \nanswer, they got a bird nest on the ground.\n  Mr. REID. First of all, these lands started being patented a long \ntime ago. If you look at Carson City, which was before the 1872 mining \nlaw, they had a different way of patenting claims than started in 1872. \nClaims in Nevada have been patented for many years as they have in the \nWestern part of the United States. I can't give you the genealogy of \nthe claim about which the Senator speaks, but assuming my friend from \nArkansas is right, that it was originally patented by someone else and \nthen they purchased it, I say this.\n  First of all, the reason that Newmont Mining Co. or any other mining \ncompany would be willing to pay extra on it is because we live in a \nsystem of free enterprise where people pay what they feel they can pay \nin order to make a profit. And surrounding this piece of land is land \nthat they have spent tens of millions of dollars developing. The land \nthat they are leasing from another individual, this company, is land \nthat has already been patented. Newmont didn't have to spend a single \npenny to get the patents. That is very, very difficult. It didn't used \nto be very tough but now it is very difficult to patent.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Does the Senator know of any mine that has ever been \ndeveloped in the history of this country where a lot of money wasn't \nspent to develop it, on private land or Federal lands?\n  Mr. REID. Oh, sure.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. You always have to spend a lot of money developing it, \ndon't you agree?\n  Mr. REID. No, I would not agree at all. For example, under the 1872 \nmining law, you don't have to patent land. You can go out and locate \nland any place you want. In the town where I was born, a guy in 1898, \nwalking through there--the 1872 mining law was in effect--found some \ngold. It didn't cost anything to develop it. They started mining it.\n  But under modern law it is very difficult to patent a claim. That is \nwhy I talk about companies spending millions of dollars.\n  Around the area where I was born and raised, in Searchlight, we only \nhave one mine, which is right over the line in the State of California, \nowned by the Viceroy Mining Co. That relatively small mine cost $70 \nmillion before they took an ounce of gold out of the ground, $70 \nmillion. So, I mean, we talk about $2.50 an acre and it was patented \nland.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Were we to follow the Senator's logic to its logical \nconclusion, would this not be a fair summary, that it costs millions of \ndollars to develop land belonging to the United States but nothing to \ndevelop lands that belong to private interests?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. That's the reason they are paying royalties to private \ninterests.\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely not; because as you know--maybe the Senator from \nArkansas didn't understand my answer. Maybe he did not want to \nunderstand the answer. The fact is, as I have explained, the area of \nland where they have the lease and are paying royalties on land that \nwas patented a long time ago. They didn't have to spend any money to \ndevelop that. It was right there. They did not have to spend money to \nget a patent. It was already patented.\n  In modern-day mining it costs a lot of money to patent a claim. It \ndidn't use to. It does now.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. If that is true, why don't they just come in and say, \n``Look, we bought this land that had already been developed by somebody \nelse who patented it and it is not fair for us to take this because it \noriginally belonged to landowners and we want to pay a royalty on it.'' \nWould that be fair?\n  Mr. REID. I say respectfully to my friend from Arkansas, I do not \nunderstand the question. The fact of the matter is the profit motive \ngoverns mining companies, ranchers, as it does those who own clothing \nstores, automobile dealerships, and mining companies that are trying to \nmake money to pay the wages of people who work for them. I acknowledge \nthat.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. We are prepared to vote, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Mr. BRYAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the amendment \noffered by my good friend from Arkansas. I appreciate the deeply held \ncommitment of my colleague to the issue of mining law reform. As I have \ntold my colleague many times over the years, I agree with him that the \n1872 mining law is in need of reform--our differences on this issue are \none of degree.\n  The Bumpers amendment simply goes too far. If enacted, this amendment \nwould severely threaten the economic viability of the hardrock mining \nindustry in my home state of Nevada and throughout the western United \nStates.\n  For the fifth year in a row, Nevada's mines have collectively topped \nthe 6 million ounce mark in gold production. In 1996, there was a total \nof 7.08 million ounces of gold produced in Nevada. The state's rich \nlandscape has made Nevada the largest gold producer in the nation with \n66.5 percent of all production. In addition, it now accounts for 10 \npercent of all the gold in the world.\n  The most recent information from the State of Nevada indicates that \ndirect mining employment in Nevada exceeds 13,000 jobs. The average \nannual pay for these jobs, the highest of any sector in the state, is \nabout $46,000, compared to the average salary in Nevada of about \n$26,000 per year. In addition to the direct employment in mining, there \nare an estimated 36,000 jobs\n\n[[Page S9587]]\n\nin the state related to providing goods and services needed by the \nindustry.\n  The impression left by proponents of this amendment is that the \nmining industry has free reign to extract mineral resources from public \nland. Nothing is further from the truth. In my state, Nevada mining \ncompanies must pay taxes like any other business, and they also pay an \nadditional Nevada tax called the ``Net Proceeds of Mines Tax.'' This \ntax must be paid by mining companies regardless of whether they operate \non private or public land. The total Net Proceeds tax paid to the state \nin 1995 was approximately $33 million. With the addition of sales and \nproperty tax, the industry paid approximately $141 million in state and \nlocal taxes in 1995. In addition, the Nevada mining industry paid \napproximately $95 million in federal taxes in 1995.\n  The additional taxes imposed by the Bumpers amendment would be \nextremely onerous for mining operators in Nevada. These new taxes would \nlikely force many mining operations to shut down, thereby causing an \noverall reduction in federal and state tax revenues paid by the \nindustry. The bottom line is that the mining industry pays taxes just \nlike any other business, and in Nevada they pay an additional tax \ntargeted specifically to their industry.\n  The issue of reclamation is also central to the mining law reform \ndebate. The State of Nevada has one of the toughest, if not the \ntoughest, state reclamation programs in the country. Nevada mining \ncompanies are subject to a myriad of federal and state environmental \nlaws and regulations, including the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and \nEndangered Species Act. Mining companies must secure literally dozens \nof environmental permits prior to commencing mining activities, \nincluding a reclamation permit, which must be obtained before a mineral \nexploration project or mining operation can be conducted. Companies \nmust also file a surety or bond with the State or the federal land \nmanager in an amount sufficient to ensure reclamation of the entire \nsite prior to receiving a reclamation permit.\n  It is in the context of promoting the economic viability of the \nmining industry and of encouraging strong environmental reclamation \nefforts administered by the states that I view the debate over the \nreform of the Mining Law of 1872. As I have stated many times over the \nyears, I feel that certain aspects of the 1872 mining law are in need \nof reform. Specifically, I feel strongly that the patenting provision \nof the current law should be changed to provide for the payment of fair \nmarket value for the surface estate. All patents should also include a \nreverter clause, which would ensure that patented public lands would \nrevert to federal ownership if no longer used for mining purposes. I \nbelieve that mining law reform legislation should ensure that any land \nused for mining purposes must be reclaimed pursuant to applicable \nfederal and state statues. And finally, I believe that mining law \nreform legislation should impose a reasonable royalty on mineral \nproduction from Federal land.\n  Mr. President, the Mining Law Reform Act of 1997, of which I am a \ncosponsor, addresses each of the concerns I have just outlined. This \nlegislation would impose a 5% net proceeds royalty on mineral \nproduction from Federal lands. It would make permanent the $100 \nmaintenance fee for every claim held on federal land. It calls for the \npayment of fair market value for patented lands and includes a reverter \nprovision to ensure that patented lands are used only for mining \npurposes. Finally, the legislation directs revenues from mineral \nproduction on Federal lands to a special fund to assist state abandoned \nmine clean-up programs. It is my hope that this legislation will serve \nas the starting point for the debate over mining law reform in the \n105th Congress.\n  I agree with the Senator from Arkansas that we have waited long \nenough for Congress to enact comprehensive mining law reform. The aura \nof uncertainty that the industry has been forced to operate under for \nthe last decade is causing many companies to look overseas for their \nfuture operations. The number of U.S. and Canadian mining companies \nexploring or operating in Latin America continues to grow dramatically. \nI do not feel, however, that the legislation before us today provides \nthe proper context to rewrite the general mining laws.\n  I hope I will have the opportunity in the near future to work with \nthe distinguished Senator from Arkansas and other interested Members of \nthis body to craft a piece of legislation that we can move to the floor \nand enact in this session of Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. First, I thank my distinguished colleague from Nevada \nfor his very good statement. I disagree of course, but I appreciate him \nand consider him one of the best Senators in the Senate. He is, indeed, \nan honorable man, and his word is as good as his bond. I think he \nreally would like to sit down and work out some sort of reform \nlegislation, and I thank him for those words.\n  Before we vote, to my colleagues just let me say this; two things. \nNo. 1, this point of order made, this constitutional point of order: If \nyou are going to vote on this, you bear in mind that if we allow a \npoint of order to be made against my amendment, what is to stop others \nfrom raising points of order against any of your amendments where the \nopponents want to avoid an up or down vote?\n  No. 2, if you are worried about what the House of Representatives is \ngoing to do, bear in mind this is a House bill we are voting on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment that we are offering \nwould avoid further sales of petroleum from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. It accomplishes this goal by providing alternative sources of \nfunding for the Interior bill to replace the planned sale of $207.5 \nmillion that is now in the bill as reported by the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was established under the Energy \nPolicy Conservation Act of 1975. It is our Nation's primary insurance \npolicy against market chaos if there is an international oil supply \ndisruption. The Energy Policy and Conservation Act and Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve were authorized earlier this year in the Senate by \nunanimous consent.\n  For the past several years, the Interior Appropriations Act has \nincluded sales of the oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve as an \noffset to Federal spending in that bill. I recognize that such sales \nhave been proposed in the past by the administration, that they have \nbeen undertaken reluctantly by the Appropriations Committee. But \ndepleting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, even to fund the worthy \nprograms in this bill now before the Senate is an unwise policy.\n  In hearings before the Senate Energy Committee earlier this year, we \nhad several distinguished experts on world oil markets and on the \nMiddle East repeatedly emphasizing the fragility of the current \npolitical situation in the major oil-producing regions outside of the \nUnited States. We have no assurance that the near future might not \nbring unwelcome political changes that would result in a reduction in \nthe world's energy security. While the United States itself does not \nimport an overwhelming fraction from the Middle East, the world oil \nmarket is highly integrated, and shortages anywhere quickly translate \ninto higher prices at the pump here in the United States.\n  In this context, annual sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve amount to a piecemeal cancellation of our national energy \ninsurance policy. Moreover, our sales from the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve have been cited by other countries as justification for selling \noff their oil reserves to offset short-term spending needs that they \nthemselves have. We saw this happen in Germany earlier this year when \nthey sold oil from their strategic reserves to raise the extra revenue \nneeded to bring their budgets within the guidelines contained in the \nMaastricht Treaty.\n  Sales of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve have negative \nshort-term impacts for ordinary Americans, in addition to these longer \nterm threats to our Nation as a whole. Whenever the Federal Government \ndumps $200 million of oil on the market, it delivers a sucker punch to \nthe independent oil and gas producers who are operating on the margin \nof profitability. Our independent producing sector is an important part \nof the oil supply equation in the United States. The oil and gas \nindustry is the second largest industry in my State of New Mexico. If \nthere is a way to avoid inflicting these economic losses on these mom-\nand-pop operations that characterize a good deal of our domestic \nindustry, we need to do that. In this context, I will note that my \nefforts and those of my cosponsor have been strongly endorsed by the \nIndependent Petroleum Association of America, by the National Stripper \nWell Association and by the American Petroleum Institute.\n  Fortunately, we found a way to avoid sales of the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve in this bill without cutting $200 million of funding for \nprograms that affect Indian tribes, energy conservation, national \nparks, research and development, the arts, and the other vital subjects \ncovered by the bill. Pursuant to the Defense Authorization Act of 1996, \nthe Secretary of Energy is required to sell the Elk Hills Naval \nPetroleum Reserve. It now appears that the Secretary will receive more \nfor Elk Hills than is accounted for in the balanced budget agreement.\n\n  The amendment I am offering today takes these excess proceeds, uses \nthem as a funding source in place of oil sales from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve. We will not know the exact amount of the excess \nproceeds until January of 1998 when the administration sends the \nCongress a final proposal to sell Elk Hills under the 31-day notice-\nand-wait provision contained in the law that authorizes that sale. The \npossibility exists, though, that we could capture enough funds through \nthis amendment to obviate the need to sell oil from the Strategic \nPetroleum Reserve next year\n\n[[Page S9589]]\n\nand potentially beyond. This coupling will certainly be a consideration \nin my judgment as to whether it is a good idea for Congress to allow \nthe sale of Elk Hills to go forward.\n  This amendment is intended as a positive step to meet the needs being \naddressed by the Interior bill by tapping an alternative source of \nfunds instead of sales from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Stopping SPR sales as a source of general revenue is a good national \neconomic policy. It is good for our domestic oil and gas industry, and \nparticularly for the most vulnerable independent producers of oil and \ngas in my State and other petroleum-producing States.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I join with my colleague the Senator \nfrom New Mexico with regard to the amendment that he has offered.\n  What this amendment would do is avoid the ultimate budget gimmick, \nwhich is selling $60 a barrel oil for $18 and calling it ``income'' for \nthe American taxpayer. These oil sales would result in $173 million \nactual loss to the American taxpayer.\n  We have sold 28 million barrels of oil. What have we sold it for? To \ncontribute to balancing the budget. Think of the inconsistency here. We \ncreated the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in 1975. We created it because \nat that time we were dependent on imported oil for about 36 or 37 \npercent of our oil consumption. Today we are facing a 52 percent \ndependence on imported oil.\n  In light of our current situation, selling down the SPR simply makes \nno sense whatever. In 1975, when we were 32 percent dependent, we \nformulated the SPR with the idea we had to have a reserve oil supply in \ncase of national emergency, and suddenly when we are 52 percent \ndependent, we start to sell the reserve?\n  The oil from Elk Hills was supposed to go to the SPR, but we have \nwaived the requirement for the last 10 years, and the oil was sold to \nbalance the budget. Now we are selling Elk Hills, and it is only right \nthat some of the money go to the purpose of stopping the drain on SPR.\n  This amendment does not cost the taxpayers any money. What we are \ntrying to do is try to avoid a huge loss. This amendment works within \nthe budget rules and avoids a terrible policy result--both from the \nenergy and budgetary standpoint--buying high and selling low. But the \nGovernment seems to do it all the time. We are like the man in the old \njoke who was buying high and selling low and who claimed that he \n``would make it up on volume.''\n\n  So, today, Senator Bingaman and I are introducing this amendment to \nprovide a short-term source of funding for the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve.\n  Soon, the Department of Energy will complete the sale of the Naval \nPetroleum Reserve No. 1, as directed by Congress. We are optimistic \nthat the sale will raise more money than previously estimated. This \namendment would place proceeds in excess of $2 billion from that sale \nin a fund that would be used to pay for the SPR.\n  This amendment was proposed by the DOE and should, at a minimum, \navoid an oil sale in the next fiscal year. I think it is appropriate \nthat extra proceeds from the sale of the Naval Petroleum Reserve, after \ncontributing to deficit reduction, be used to stop the drain on our \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  The amendment will not permanently resolve the problems with \nproviding funding for SPR, but it should temporarily stop the bleeding. \nIn the face of our oil dependency, and the continuing drain on SPR, I \ncan't resist noting that there are still some in this body that oppose \nthe production of domestic oil resources.\n  So as it stands now, this body does not appear to support the \ndomestic storage or production of oil. Some may not like the reality \nthat this Nation will continue to need petroleum. Petroleum moves our \ntransportation system. We have no other alternative, at least none in \nthe foreseeable future. However, reality doesn't cease to be a reality \nbecause we ignore it. We are talking about people's lives, jobs, their \nlivelihood. I certainly understand the difficult task that the \nAppropriations Committee faces as it attempts to fund all of the \nimportant programs under its jurisdiction.\n  However, I must insist that, in the future, we resist the temptation \nto drain the SPR to meet these priorities, if indeed the SPR has an \nobjective at all, which is to serve as the country's energy security \nduring a time of crisis.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the amendment today. I also \nstrongly urge my colleagues to join with us to permanently end the \ndraining of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to fulfill our \nshortsighted, short-term desires.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I want to make a few points. The first \npoint is, I did speak to Secretary of Energy, Federico Pena, in the \nlast hour. He has authorized me to indicate to all Senators that he \nstrongly supports the amendment that Senator Murkowski and I are \noffering, and he believes it is a good public policy and a policy that \nwe ought to adopt here.\n  I also want to indicate a particular appreciation to Bob Simon on my \nstaff, who is the person who has done all the work in coming up with \nthis proposal.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section explanation of \nthe amendment be printed in the Record following my statement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n            proviso-by-proviso explanation of the amendment\n\n       The amendment strikes and replaces the section of the bill \n     dealing with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The following \n     are the key provisions of the new section:\n       The head of the section follows the existing bill by \n     appropriating $207.5 million for operations of the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve in FY 1998.\n       The first proviso stipulates that any proceeds from the \n     sale of the Elk Hills Naval Petroleum Reserve (known as Naval \n     Petroleum Reserve Number 1) that are in excess of $2 billion \n     are to be used to support the operations of the Strategic \n     Petroleum Reserve (and also for additional acquisition of SPR \n     oil), until those excess funds are expended. Thus, if the \n     sale of Elk Hills were to net $2.4 billion, under this \n     proviso, we would have the operations of the SPR covered for \n     the next two fiscal years. The budget offset, under CBO \n     scoring, for this extra spending is provided in the fourth \n     proviso, which I will address in a minute.\n       The second proviso takes care of the situation in which the \n     excess proceeds from the sale of Elk Hills are not enough to \n     fully cover the cost of operations of the SPR in fiscal year \n     1998. In such a case, SPR oil would have to be sold to make \n     up the difference, similar to what the current language of \n     this bill provides.\n       The third proviso addresses the fact that CBO and OMB score \n     the sale of Elk Hills differently. While this amendment does \n     not have Budget Act points of order against it, without this \n     proviso, it could theoretically trigger a budget sequester at \n     OMB, because of their scoring rules. This proviso eliminates \n     any possibility of an OMB budget sequester, and was worked \n     out in close cooperation with senior management at OMB, which \n     endorses this amendment.\n       The fourth proviso provides for a special sale of SPR oil \n     to offset the other spending in this amendment. CBO scores \n     the entire amendment as not increasing the overall spending \n     of the Interior Appropriations bill, so it is not in \n     violation of the Budget Agreement or any provision of the \n     Budget Act.\n       The final proviso of this new section transfers the funds \n     for operating the SPR into the appropriate account in the \n     U.S. Treasury. It is similar to the existing final proviso in \n     the existing section that is being replaced.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment is constructed in a fashion \nthat evades budget points of order. That is to say, no points of order \nwould be appropriate. But it does take advantage of a quite \nconservative estimate by the Congressional Budget Office of the \nrevenues that may accrue from the sale of Elk Hills.\n  I also note that the amendment could result in the Department of \nEnergy capturing several hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue \nthat could otherwise go into the General Treasury. As a member of the \nBudget Committee, this is a precedent about which I have some real \nconcern.\n  On the other hand, as I said from the time that the House bill passed \nand we worked on our own, I am not completely comfortable with the sale \nof oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, including the sale in the \nbill that is in the President's budget request and House action.\n  Having said all of that, balancing on both sides, I am willing to \naccept the amendment, as is my comanager from\n\n[[Page S9590]]\n\nNevada. We can deal with the issue in conference, and I hope that it is \neither acceptable or can be put into acceptable form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1229) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee \namendments be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1230\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mrs. Murray, \n     for herself, Mr. Gorton, and Mr. Murkowski, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1230.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of Title III, add the following:\n       Sec.   . Within 90 days of enactment of this legislation, \n     the Forest Service shall complete its export policy and \n     procedures on the use of Alaskan Western Red Cedar. In \n     completing this policy, the Forest Service shall evaluate the \n     costs and benefits of a pricing policy that offers any \n     Alaskan Western Red Cedar in excess of domestic processing \n     needs in Alaska first to United States domestic processors.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I want to discuss briefly my amendment to \nalter U.S. Forest Service rules regarding the export of Western Red \nCedar logs from Alaska. Today, because there are no Alaskan sawmills \nthat use this cedar, this National Forest timber is exported as raw \nlogs primarily to foreign customers.\n  That is a real problem for our independent mills in Washington and \nOregon who have traditionally been dependent on public timber. As we \nall know--and have discussed in the context of this bill--National \nForest timber sales have plummeted since the 1980s. The independent \nmills that have survived are technologically advanced, with a well-\ntrained workforce, but are always scrambling for reasonably-priced \ntimber.\n  As a rule, National Forest timber must be processed before it can be \nexported overseas. This Congress imposed that policy nearly 20 years \nago. There is almost unanimous agreement that federal timber should be \nprocessed in America to create the maximum number of American jobs.\n  One exception to the rule of domestic processing is that where no \nmarket for a certain species of tree exists, the Forest Service will \ndeem that species ``surplus.'' A surplus species can be exported in as \na raw log.\n  In Region 10, there are currently no Alaskan processors who can use \nthe Western Red Cedar. The Forest Service has, thus, deemed it surplus. \nBut it is definitely not surplus to the domestic needs of sawmills and \nworkers in the Pacific Northwest. I've been approached by several mills \nwho are desperate for this cedar, including Skookum Lumber in Shelton, \nWA, and Tubafor Mill, in Morton, WA.\n  My amendment requires the Forest Service to offer these national logs \nat domestic prices to mills in the lower 48 states. It requires the \nagency to establish a three-tiered policy giving Alaskans first \npriority, other American companies next priority, and only if no one \nwants these logs--which is highly unlikely--may they be exported \ninternationally.\n  Mr. President, this is a common-sense amendment. Members of the \nWashington delegation, including Representative Norm Dicks and former \nRepresemtative Jolene Unsoeld, have worked to make this policy change \nsince 1991. Now is the time to use these Federal resources for the \nbenefit of American working families.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment has been cleared on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1230) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I hope for only a very short period of \ntime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Not more than 5 percent of the \n     funds provided to the Secretary of Commerce under paragraph \n     (1) may be used to provide support for the Board and \n     administer grants under this subsection.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nmyself, Senator Stevens and Senator Murkowski.\n  The amendment would deposit $800 million into a newly created \nnational park and environmental enhancement fund within the U.S. \nTreasury.\n  The interest from the account would be dedicated to three purposes:\n  First, to make critically needed capital improvements in America's \nnational parks.\n  Second, assist States in their park planning and development needs.\n  Third, provide for research on the marine environment. This is \nstrongly endorsed by the National Parks and the Conservation \nAssociation, Natural Resources Defense Council, National Trust for \nHistoric Preservation, and Center for Marine Conservation.\n  I thank Senators Stevens and Murkowski for their assistance and \nleadership, as well as Senator Gorton, on this amendment.\n  The revenue which will finance this special account is oil lease \nrevenue awarded to the Federal Government by the U.S. Supreme Court \nearlier this year. Both the United States and Alaska claimed ownership \nof the land from which the oil was extracted.\n  Mr. President, we all know that the people of Alaska were bitterly \ndisappointed in the Court's decision to find on behalf of the Federal \nGovernment and to award the money to the Federal Treasury. \nNevertheless, the Court has rendered a final judgment.\n  I am pleased to say that passage of this amendment will enable us to \nemploy the money not only for the people of Alaska but for every other \nState.\n  Under this amendment, 40 percent of the yearly interest of the new \naccount--up to $20 million annually--will be dedicated to making high-\npriority capital improvements in our national parks. Now is the time to \nact. The integrity of the national historic treasures that comprise our \nNational Park System is at stake.\n  The GAO estimates that unmet capital needs throughout the system \ntotal more than $8 billion. Current funding levels are grossly \ninsufficient to meet these requirements.\n  Last year, out of the $1.6 billion that Congress appropriated to \noperate and maintain the 314 national parks, monuments, and historical \nsites, two-thirds were spent on park operations, leaving $400 million \navailable to finance capital improvements.\n  Let me remind you, Mr. President, that the GAO estimates that of the \nunmet capital needs throughout the system of more than $8 billion last \nyear, there was $400 million available to finance capital improvements. \nMr. President, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it \ntakes a long time to catch up.\n  Grand Canyon National Parks offers a historic and sobering example of \nthe magnitude of the funding shortfalls that we face. The parks' \ngeneral management plan calls for over $350 million in capital \nimprovements. This fiscal year the parks received approximately $16 \nmillion, of which only $12 million was available for capital purposes. \nThis scenario is repeated at parks throughout the country.\n  Mr. President, no one knows this better than the Senator from \nWashington, and the Senator from Alaska. I think it is important to \nstress we are not talking about luxuries. We are talking about needs. \nThe vast majority of the capital improvements we are talking about are \nnecessary to preserve the natural and historical resources that makes \nour parks so special.\n  Mr. President, earlier this summer, U.S. News & World Report featured \na cover story, which I have here, entitled ``Parks in Peril.''\n  I urge my colleagues to read what is a very enlightening and \ncompelling piece. The story was highlighted. I show it here, as \nfollows:\n\n       The national parks have been called the best idea America \n     had. But their wild beauty and historical treasures are \n     rapidly deteriorating from lack of funds, pollution, \n     encroaching development, overcrowding, and congressional \n     indifference.\n\n  I am not proud of that, Mr. President. None of us should be. The \nAmerican people love our Nation's parks, and rightfully expect us to \nexercise responsible stewardship of our natural treasures.\n  By passing this amendment we can take a significant step to remedy \nthe funding shortfall, and care for our parks in a responsible and \ntimely manner.\n  I know that the Senate Energy Committee--in particular, Senator \nMurkowski, Senator Bumpers, and Senator Thomas, and others--is working \ndiligently on comprehensive park funding and management reform \nlegislation. I applaud their efforts, and look forward to the fruits of \ntheir arduous labors.\n  But, while we await these reforms, we have an obligation to take what \naction we can to meet park needs. Every day we wait, the national \nparks--from Maine's Arcadia National Park, Yosemite in California, and \nAlaska's Gateway to the Arctic to the Florida Everglades--fall into \nfurther disrepair and neglect.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nletters of support from key conservation organizations who strongly \nsupport this amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9592]]\n\n                                                    National Parks\n\n\n                                 and Conservation Association,\n\n                                               September 16, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The National Parks and Conservation \n     Association (NPCA) is delighted to support your amendment to \n     H.R. 2107, the Department of Interior Appropriations bill, to \n     establish a National Parks and Environmental Improvement \n     Fund. As you know, NPCA is America's only private non-profit \n     citizen organization dedicated solely to protecting, \n     preserving, and enhancing the U.S. National Park System. An \n     association of ``Citizens Protecting America's Parks,'' NPCA \n     was founded in 1919, and today has nearly 500,000 members.\n       Our support for your amendment is based on our \n     understanding that the amendment contains the following \n     provisions:\n       1. Distribution of fifty percent of the interest earned by \n     the fund to benefit the National Park System and twenty-five \n     percent to benefit the State-side program of the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund. We understand that the remaining \n     twenty-five percent would be made available for a grant \n     program for marine research and education in and relating to \n     the water of the North Pacific ocean.\n       2. The National Park Service portion of the trust fund \n     allocation ``may be used for the design, construction, \n     repair, or replacement of high-priority National Park Service \n     facilities directly related to enhancing the experience of \n     park visitors, including natural, cultural, and historic \n     resources protection projects.''\n       The National Park Service faces a growing and alarming \n     backlog of projects vital to sustaining the resources of the \n     national parks and to ensuring the health, safety, and \n     enjoyment of park visitors. New revenue sources to supplement \n     regular appropriations must be found to assist the National \n     Park Service in fulfilling its congressionally-mandated \n     mission of passing on these precious lands unimpaired to \n     future generations. The unique natural, cultural, and \n     historic heritage embodied in our parks constitutes one of \n     the greatest treasures that belong to the American people.\n       Your amendment, as noted above, represents a creative and \n     welcome effort to enhance the resources available to the \n     National Park Service to protect and preserve our parks.\n       Through the funds it provides, the National Park Service \n     will be able to add meaningfully to its ability to preserve \n     historic structures, to protect cultural sites; to clean up \n     polluted areas; and to enhance transportation facilities, \n     among other important projects. Your amendment will make a \n     very worthwhile contribution, and we applaud you and all who \n     support you for your creativity and leadership in bringing \n     this initiative before the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Albert C. Eisenberg,\n                          Deputy Director for Conservation Policy.\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                               September 17, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation \n         Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the Center for Marine \n     Conservation, I want to express CMC's strong support for your \n     amendment to the Department of Interior Appropriations Bill \n     (H.R. 2107) to provide for the disposition of oil lease \n     revenue into the ``National Parks and Environmental \n     Improvement Fund.'' In particular, CMC applauds your \n     initiative to create a fund for the purpose of funding marine \n     research activities related to the fisheries or marine \n     ecosystems in the North Pacific, Bering Sea, and Arctic \n     Ocean.\n       CMC is especially interested in the Bering Sea ecosystem \n     and is committed to investigating new mechanisms to achieve \n     greater coordination of scientific research, and develop more \n     effective adaptive and ecosystem management to stem the \n     decline of several species in that ecosystem. Additional CMC \n     commends you, Senator McCain, for including representation by \n     an environmental interest on the North Pacific Research \n     Board.\n       CMC's only concern is that appropriations to this fund not \n     be offset by funds otherwise appropriated from the Land and \n     Water Conservation Fund in the Department of the Interior \n     Appropriation Bill. The Land and Water Conservation Fund is \n     vitally important to conservation.\n       CMC appreciates your continued effort to fund marine \n     research and conservation. We look forward to working with \n     you to conserve our marine heritage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 William R. Irvin,\n     Acting Vice President for Programs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                National Trust for\n\n\n                                        Historic Preservation,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 1997.\n       Dear Senator McCain: On behalf of the approximately 275,000 \n     members of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, I am \n     writing to support an amendment to the Department of the \n     Interior Appropriations bill, H.R. 2107, to establish a \n     National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund (the \n     ``Fund'').\n       Pursuant to this amendment, the oil lease revenues awarded \n     by the Supreme Court to the United States in United States v. \n     State of Alaska, totaling $1.6 billion, would be deposited in \n     the Fund. The interest earned by the Fund would be allocated, \n     subject to appropriation, as follows: 40 percent to capital \n     projects in the National Park System that enhance the \n     experience of park visitors, including natural, cultural and \n     historic resource protection projects; 40 percent to the \n     state side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund; and 20 \n     percent for a grant program for marine research and education \n     relating to the waters of the Northern pacific ocean.\n       This amendment represents a very positive and important \n     first step in addressing the multi billion dollar backlog of \n     deferred maintenance and necessary capital expenditures for \n     our National Park System. A solid consensus exists in the \n     Congress and the executive branch and the American public \n     that we must begin to address the problems in our National \n     Parks, to eliminate the accrued backlog with a systematic \n     plan implemented over the next decade, and to look for new \n     sources of funding in addition to regular appropriations. \n     Your amendment presents a creative means and mechanism for \n     enhancing funds available to both our National Parks and \n     state and local park systems. The National Trust is pleased \n     to offer our enthusiastic support for the amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Edward M. Norton, Jr.,\n                         Vice President for Law and Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, again the thrust of this amendment is to \nhelp our national parks. If we abdicate our responsibilities to \nmaintain the integrity of the National Park System we will have spoiled \nthe most precious part of our national heritage, squandered the \nbirthright of our children, and failed to meet one of our most basic \nresponsibilities. Let's not allow that to happen.\n  I want to again thank Senator Murkowski, especially Senator Thomas \nand Senator Bumpers, for the efforts they are making for an overall \nsolution to the problems in our National Park System. That work is \ndiligent, and needs to be rewarded. I look forward to their results. In \nthe meantime, I think this is an important step forward.\n  Mr. President, I thank the sponsors and the managers of the bill for \ntheir cooperation and assistance.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, this amendment provides funding to help \nresolve some of the most pressing concerns relating to national park \nand State recreation facilities, and to the ocean areas off Alaska.\n  The amendment would reserve $800 million that was not anticipated to \nbe received by the Federal Treasury in a case recently decided by the \nSupreme Court.\n  That case--cited at 117 S.Ct. 1888--involved a dispute between the \nFederal Government and the State of Alaska over the right to mineral \nlease revenue on the natural formation off the coast of Alaska known as \nDinkum Sands.\n  The Federal Government prevailed and received lease revenue plus \ninterest totaling $1.6 billion.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated earlier this year that the \nFederal Treasury would receive only $800 million.\n  Our amendment would deposit the other $800 million in a new fund \ncalled the National Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund. Beginning \nwith fiscal year 1999, the interest from this fund would be available \nfor: First, capital projects in the National Park System; second, State \noutdoor recreation planning, development, and acquisition; and third, \nmarine research important to the vast Federal and State waters off \nAlaska.\n  Forty percent of the annual interest would be available to design, \nconstruct, repair, and replace National Park Service facilities to \nenhance the experience of park visitors.\n  In Alaska this will go a long way toward expanding and upgrading the \novercrowded visitor facilities that have become a significant problem.\n  As Senator McCain mentioned, the need to upgrade the Park Service \nfacilities nationally is great, and may run into the billions of \ndollars. Our bill would create a mechanism specifically designed to \nbegin to address this problem.\n  Our amendment would make 40 percent of the annual interest available \nunder section 6 of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act to the \nStates to be used for outdoor recreation planning, development, and the \nacquisition of land.\n  The States, too, face a backlog in upgrading existing park facilities \nand creating new facilities.\n  Finally, our amendment provides 20 percent of the annual interest \nfrom the\n\n[[Page S9593]]\n\nNational Parks and Environmental Improvement Fund for marine research \nin, and relating to, the north Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea, and Arctic \nOcean.\n  These vast marine areas off Alaska comprise more than half of the \nNation's coastline, provide over half of the Nation's commercial \nfisheries harvest, and contain vast mineral resources important to \nAlaska and the Nation. This income was derived from those waters.\n  We face pressing concerns in these waters that touch every part of \nAlaska's coastline. Some of the immediate concerns include, to name \njust a few:\n  Declines in certain bird and marine mammal species in the Bering Sea; \na failure this year in our Bristol Bay and Kuskokwim salmon returns; \nexcessive fisheries harvests and other unknown activities in the Russia \nportion of the Bering Sea; environmental contamination in the Arctic \nOcean; subsistence whaling concerns; the need to develop new products \nand more environmentally efficient fishing methods; and the need to \ndevelop fisheries for underutilized species (such as the dive fisheries \nin southeast Alaska) that could help take the pressure off other fish \nstocks.\n  Our amendment would establish a North Pacific Research Board that \nwould set marine research priorities and recommend grants to tackle \nthose priorities. The Secretary of Commerce and Alaska Department of \nFish and Game, or their designees, would serve as cochairs of the \nBoard.\n  The Secretary of Commerce would approve or disapprove the Board's \ngrant recommendations. The amendment gives the Board very broad \ndiscretion in setting the priorities for the research grants.\n  We know of some of the issues that need immediate attention, but not \nall of them, and we can't know what the priorities should be in the \nfuture. To summarize, the amendment Senator McCain and I are offering \nwill improve the experience visitors have at our national parks and \nState parks, and will greatly increase our knowledge about the vast \nwaters off Alaska.\n  I urge other Senators to support this measure.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1232 to Amendment No. 1231\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the disposition of certain escrowed oil and \n  gas revenue received as a result of the Supreme Court's decision in \n                   United States v. State of Alaska)\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I have a second-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska (Mr. Murkowski), for himself, and \n     Mr. Thomas, proposes an amendment numbered 1232 to amendment \n     numbered 1231.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       In the amendment proposed by the Senator from Arizona \n     strike all after ``(a) Deposit in Fund.--'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof:\n       ``All of the amounts awarded by the Supreme Court to the \n     United States in the case of United States of America v. \n     State of Alaska (117 S.

Mr. President, let me commend my good friend, the \nSenator from Alaska, the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens.\n  I want to point out that my amendment is very similar to the one \noffered by the Senator from Arizona. It does, however, make one \nsignificant change that I think is critical to the success of this \ntrust fund.\n  Before I start, I want to say that I am particularly pleased that \nSenator McCain recognizes the significance of these funds--the $1.6 \nbillion that flowed from receipts that had been generated from lease \nsales in Alaska, the offshore, so-called ``Dinkum Sands.'' He has taken \nmy Senate bill, S. 1118, and used it as the model for his amendment. \nObviously believing that this authorization should occur on an \nappropriations bill.\n  My particular initial concept was to use $800 million to fund the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund.\n  I think the improvement that the Senator from Arizona and the senior \nSenator have added formulating consideration of the national parks, as \nwell as Arctic research, are to be commended. And, as a consequence, I \nthink the appropriateness of my second degree is worthy of \nconsideration.\n  My amendment differs specifically on one significant measure. It \nplaces simply all of the Dinkum Sands escrow account--that is $1.6 \nbillion--in an interest-bearing account in the Treasury Department as \nopposed to the amendment of Senator McCain, which would put only half \nof that amount--or $800 million in an interest-bearing account in the \nU.S. Treasury.\n  What we would do, Mr. President, is not utilize the principal but \nsimply the yield. The interest off the account would be approximately \n$120 million a year, and would be distributed in the same manner as the \nMcCain-Stevens-Murkowski amendment: Forty percent would go to our \nnational parks; 40 percent to the state-side Land and Water \nConservation Fund and 20 percent to Arctic research.\n  I might add the necessity of funding our national parks is as a \nconsequence of the billions of dollars in deferred maintenance that are \nassociated with those parks, and the reality that we clearly need some \ncapital improvement projects.\n  So, again there would be a long-term funding mechanism. And the \nmerits, I think, speak for themselves.\n  It would relieve the appropriators in the sense that this would fund \na good deal of what currently we have to fund through an annual \nappropriation process.\n  I am not going to go through the jungle of bureaucratic \ninterpretations and the manner in which the Budget Committee has to \noperate. But 40 percent would go to national parks capital improvement \nprojects, and 40 percent to the State, matching the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. That is a State and Federal matching program which \nhas done a great deal in the history of encouraging States, and the \npeople in those States and communities, to generate funding of their \nown with the Federal matching funds and pride for worthwhile projects \nin their communities. Twenty percent would go into marine research, \nprimarily in the Arctic.\n  Here is the authorization and appropriation chart for the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. You can see the that authorizations have \nsimply gone off the chart. We continue to authorize, and feel good \nabout it. We go home and say, ``We have authorized the project.'' But \nif it is not appropriated, why, it is window dressing.\n  You can see the red line, or the actual appropriations. They hit a \nhigh in 1977 of about $800 million. They dropped down to virtually \nnothing--somewhere in the area of $150 million in 1981, and they have \nleveled off. The state-side LWCF matching grant program has fared even \nworse.\n  Clearly, this is a worthwhile program. It is two for one: for every \nFederal dollar it is matched by state and local money.\n  There is the other chart, shows the demand for stateside Land and \nWater Conservation Fund grants.\n  Clearly, the demand is there from America, American citizens, and \ncommunities with regard to the benefits of this type of funding.\n  By placing only half of the Dinkum Sands revenue in this fund, I \nthink it will be self-defeating. It will not provide the money \nnecessary to adequately fund these programs, especially the State-side \nLand and Water Conservation Fund matching grant programs.\n  I would also like to say that as chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee, I intend to work with the Budget Committee and the \nAppropriations Committee next year to ensure that we have not just \ncreated another paper account. Rather, I promise to work to ensure that \nthe money earned off this account will be available for appropriations \nfor the very important purposes we set forth in this amendment.\n  Before the conference we would like to work with the Budget Committee \non how to best minimize the impact of this amendment on the \nappropriators. That is the only way we can answer the call of my \noutdoor recreation initiative to reinvigorate our parks, forests, and \npublic lands in order to enhance Americans' visits to those parks and \nconserve natural resources, wildlife and open spaces.\n  My bill--S. 1118--now a part of my second-degree amendment, would \ncreate a trust fund with the $1.6 billion Dinkum Sands escrow account. \nIt would use just the interest from the account as follows: 40 percent \nto fund capital improvement projects at our national parks; 40 percent \nto fund State-side LWCF matching grants; and 20 percent to fund arctic \nresearch.\n  With respect to the portion that would go to the state-side LWCF \nmatching grant program, for over 30 years those grants have helped \npreserve open spaces. They have built thousands of picnic areas, \ntrails, parks and other recreation facilities.\n  I urge my colleagues to look at the merits. This is one chance in a \nlifetime where we have found the funding, $1.6 billion. We can put this \nmoney in an area which has worked so successfully and address the \nlegacy that we have to maintain our national, state and local parks.\n  At a June 11 hearing, witnesses from across the country testified in \nsupport of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. It has helped fund \nover 8,500 acquisitions on 2.3 million acres and built 28,000 \nrecreation facilities in all of the 50 States. Federal Land and Water \nConservation Fund grants are matched dollar for dollar by State and \nlocal communities so Americans can get two for the price of one. My \namendment presents an opportunity to expand on that possibility.\n  The state-side of the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act makes it \npossible to have a national system of\n\n[[Page S9595]]\n\nparks, as opposed to just a National Park System. So one would ask, why \ndid Congress and the administration defund this successful program 2 \nyears ago? Well, that is a good question, Mr. President. They defunded \nit because they had other priorities.\n  This is an opportunity to address one of America's highest \npriorities, and that is our national system of parks. Working with the \ncoalition including Americans for Our Heritage and Recreation, the \nNational Conference of Mayors, the National Recreation and Parks \nAssociation and various endowment groups, we were successful in \nbuilding support for the Land and Water Conservation State grant \nprogram.\n  Senator Gorton, I think, heard the message. He put funding for the \nstate-side LWCF matching grant program in the Interior appropriations \nbill, for which we are most appreciative. I think his wise action \nensures the short-term viability of the stateside matching grant \nprogram.\n  Our next step, of course, is to find a long-term program for the \nState matching grant, and our amendment, like my initial effort, \ncertainly does that. That is why I support the initial amendment by the \nSenator from Arizona and the senior Senator from Alaska, Senator \nStevens. But as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nthe committee with jurisdiction over national parks, I recognize the \nreality of what we are doing here. We are moving without the \nauthorization of the respective committees, and I am certainly \nsensitive to that. But this is a rare and extraordinary opportunity to \naddress the disposition of funds that come in, and as a consequence I \nthink can best be used in the manner proposed in my amendment.\n\n  I might say further that I am happy that a portion of the interest \nwill fund this backlog of capital projects in our parks. We have held \ncommittee oversight hearings on March 13 and March 20 to tackle the \nchallenge of park maintenance, and I am glad to see Senator Thomas, who \nchaired this meeting, is joining me in this second-degree amendment.\n  I think it is important to recognize further, Mr. President, as we \naddress this rare opportunity, that we have had in the Energy Committee \nextensive hearings on this matter. This is a chance where America can \ntake better care of her parks, and it is our duty to restore their \nbrilliance, their luster. We face an $8.6 billion backlog of unfunded \nPark Service operations and programs in this country --$8.6 billion. We \nare not appropriating the funds. The interest earned by this account \nmay not be enough, and until the National Park Service has a system for \nsettling priorities for capital improvements and infrastructure repair, \nCongress is going to have to keep a close eye on how the money is \nspent. But we have the money and we are directing that it not go for \nadministration purposes of the Park Service.\n  The land and water conservation fund is authorized through the year \n2015 at $900 million a year. However, far less than that authorized \namount is appropriated each year, and we now have an opportunity to fix \nthe system.\n  Using the proceeds of this account for these purposes makes sense. It \nis consistent with the vision of the Land and Water Conservation Act \nand the promises made three decades ago. These promises were, I remind \nmy colleagues, that oil receipts, offshore oil receipts, will primarily \nfund the land and water conservation fund for public recreation and \nconservation in this country.\n  Well, it is fine to put it in, and obviously the industry is out \nthere and they are initiating a cash flowback, but it is not going \nwhere it was intended simply because there are other priorities. And I \nam not here to delve into the priorities.\n  Mr. President, if the underlying amendment were made law, the \ninterest on the account which could be spent on the stateside Land and \nWater Conservation fund grant program would only be somewhere between \n$16 million and $24 million--not much to be divided between the 50 \nStates, territories and Indian tribes. If the need in our country for \nrecreation is overwhelming, the very health of our Nation requires our \nattention, and the States are in the best position to address that \nshortfall.\n  I would like to point out, if the amendment that I have proposed is \naccepted, this amount we were looking at from the yield off the \nprincipal, not the expenditure, would total some $32 million to $48 \nmillion for the stateside LWCF matching grant program each year--a \nconsiderably increased sum and obviously more meaningful to the States \nand territories as well.\n  The needs in our country for recreation are overwhelming. The very \nhealth of our Nation and our natural human resources depend on programs \nsuch as this, particularly in the innercity areas. Again, every dollar \nwe provide to the stateside of the land and water conservation program \ndoubles the impact as far as this matter is concerned.\n  Finally, we have an opportunity to take a step to improve the System \nand reap benefits for our children and their children.\n  Finally, the question is, do you want to do just a little or do you \nwant to have a major impact--a major impact--on preserving open spaces, \nrefurbish and build picnic areas, trails, parks and other recreation \nfacilities. You have the opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask the remainder of my statement be printed in the \nRecord at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me turn to the issue of Arctic and North Pacific \nfisheries research--a critical issue I have worked on from my first day \nin the Senate:\n  My first speech on the floor of the Senate involved the importance of \nArctic research, particularly as it related to fisheries.\n  My first major legislative initiative was the Arctic Research and \nPolicy Act, signed into law by President Reagan.\n  The Arctic Research Commission, created by this Act, had as its first \nrecommendation the need to develop a fuller understanding of Arctic \nOcean, Bering Sea, and the ecosystems they sustain.\n  This amendment include our effort to fulfill the commission's \nrecommendations. I am pleased to see the commission play an important \nrole on the board created by this amendment.\n  I particularly like the approach of using proceeds from Arctic OCS \nrevenues invested in scientific research to better understand the \nArctic ecosystem:\n  Arctic wealth provided these revenues, so it is only fair to return a \nportion to help protect the Arctic itself.\n  The wealth of North America is in the Arctic. Not simply energy and \nmineral wealth--but also a wealth of renewable resources, a wealth of \nscenic beauty, a wealth of diverse living ecosystems, and a wealth of \nrecreational opportunities.\n  Our scientific investment in this part of the world is inadequate, \nparticularly when we compare it with what we spend for scientific \nresearch in the Antarctic, where we do not have people or resources.\n  Today we take another step in addressing this inequity. It isn't the \nfirst step, nor will it be the last.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. The mayors of every \ncity in the Nation want it, the Governors of every State in the Nation \nknow the good that can be accomplished.\n  I think the Chair.\n  I commend the amendment to the Senate, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment is not acceptable. We had \nworked all day with the senior Senator from Alaska and the Senator from \nArizona on a proposal that I had not previously seen that really ought \nto be authorized, even in its original form, and about which I have \nsome concerns, the composition of the research board, the involvement \nof the Department of the Interior, the way in which money is allocated, \nthe kind of scoring problems that we will have which will create \nproblems with the Budget Committee. But it seemed to me that the \ncompromise that we had reached on it among several of us was clearly \nworth going forward with.\n  This second-degree amendment involves now $1.6 billion, at 8 o'clock \nat night, when we were attempting to finish a bill on which it does not \nbelong because it needs to be authorized, and it has not been cleared \non the other\n\n[[Page S9596]]\n\nside. We made no attempt to clear it on the other side. I did not know \nit was coming. Other Senators, including the majority leader, feel as I \ndo. I move to table the second-degree amendment of the Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The clerk will call the roll \nto ascertain the presence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1234\n\n   (Purpose: To make $4,000,000 of funds appropriated to the Forest \n Service for emergency construction in fiscal year 1996, available for \n reconstruction of the Oakridge Ranger Station which was destroyed by \n                                 arson)\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I send another amendment to the desk and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. Smith of \n     Oregon, for himself and Mr. Wyden, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1234.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is an amendment on behalf of the two \nSenators from Oregon for repair of the Oakridge Ranger Station. It has \nbeen cleared by both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1234) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \namendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1235\n\n(Purpose: To direct the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture to submit to Congress a report on properties proposed to be \n acquired or exchanged with funds appropriated from the Land and Water \n                          Conservation Fund.)\n\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I offer an amendment that would require \nthe Administration to utilize certain criteria in preparing the \nprioritized list of land acquisitions and exchanges that would be \nconducted using the $700 million increase recommended in this bill for \nfederal land acquisitions and exchanges. This amendment places primary \nresponsibility for determining the priority of land acquisitions in the \nhands of the federal land management agencies charged with preserving, \nprotecting, and managing our nation's natural resources. At the same \ntime, the amendment preserves the prerogative of Congress to approve or \ndisapprove the Administration's recommendations prior to making any of \nthese additional funds available.\n  The amendment establishes seven specific criteria to be used by the \nNational Park Service, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the Bureau of Land Management in assessing proposed \nacquisitions and exchanges:\n  (1) the natural resources located on the land,\n  (2) the degree to which those natural resources are threatened,\n  (3) the length of time required for acquisition of the land,\n  (4) the extent, if any, to which an increase in land cost makes \ntimely completion of the acquisition advisable,\n  (5) the extent of public and local government support for the \nacquisition,\n  (6) the amount of federal lands already in the region, and\n  (7) the total estimated costs of the acquisition.\n  In addition, the amendment permits the Secretaries of Interior and \nAgriculture to consider additional matters in their assessments, but \nthey must explain to Congress in a report what those additional \nconsiderations were and how they were weighted in the prioritization of \nland proposals.\n  Over the years, Congress has wisely taken steps to preserve our \nnatural heritage. We have protected many remarkable natural areas \nthrough the establishment of national parks, monuments, wilderness \nareas, wildlife refuges, national scenic areas, and other conservation \nefforts.\n  While this nation has no shortage of beautiful country to be \npreserved and protected, there is a limited amount of funding available \nto accomplish these goals. As a result, our nation has a multi-billion \ndollar backlog in land acquisitions at both the Department of Interior \nand the Department of Agriculture. Because of this enormous backlog, I \nsupport the recommendation in this bill to make available an additional \n$700 million for the land acquisitions and exchanges, consistent with \nthe budget agreement.\n  What this amendment would require the Administration to do is not \nnew. The agencies already produce these types of rankings when \ndeveloping the President's budget request. The Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, \nand the Forest Service all compose priority based lists. In this case, \nwe will be requiring the agencies to perform the same sort of priority \nassessments on projects that would be funded with these additional \nfunds, to ensure that Congress has all the information necessary to \nreview the Administration's proposal.\n\n[[Page S9597]]\n\n  The amendment includes a requirement for the agencies to consider the \nextent of local support for an acquisition proposal, as well as the \namount of land in the area already owned by the federal government. \nPreservation of our natural resources is a high priority, but it must \nbe balanced with an awareness of the economic needs of local \ncommunities and their ability to plan for future growth and \ndevelopment. These two criteria will ensure that a community will not \nbe harmed unnecessarily by the removal of preservation lands from its \ntax base or by undue restrictions on development and economic growth.\n  I understand the concerns expressed by the Committee in the report \nlanguage about the costs of managing and maintaining current federally \nowned lands, and I believe the agencies should focus on acquisition and \nexchange proposals that would consolidate federal land holdings and \neliminate inholdings to lessen these costs. However, I think it would \nbe a mistake to fail to consider funding new acquisitions and exchanges \nthat would protect and preserve resources that might otherwise be lost \nto development in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned that the Committee has earmarked \n$315 million of the additional funding for two specific projects--the \nHeadwaters Forest and New World Mines acquisitions. I am not seeking to \nstrike those earmarks in this amendment, although I understand an \namendment may be offered to do so, which I would support. \nUnfortunately, these earmarks make clear the need for established \ncriteria for prioritizing the many pending acquisition requests at our \nland management agencies. My amendment would ensure that all funds \nwhich are available for pending land acquisitions and exchanges are \nused prudently and for the highest priority projects identified by \nfederal land management agencies.\n  Let me stress that I understand the right of Congress to review and \nrevise the President's budget request, as we see fit. My amendment is \nsimply intended to help us make those decisions by requiring input from \nthe federal land management agencies on the expenditure of the $700 \nmillion we are adding to this appropriations bill for land acquisitions \nand exchanges. Congress will still have the last word.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this amendment requires the administration \nto submit to Congress a priority list for lands to be acquired with \nmoneys appropriated in title V. Congress will make the ultimate \ndetermination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1235) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              grand staircase-escalante national monument\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to praise my good friend \nSenator Slade Gorton for his efforts in putting together this important \nlegislation. It is particularly important to my state, where over 70 \npercent of our land is owned or managed by the Federal government.\n  My colleagues will recall that one year ago, President Clinton stood \non the edge of the Grand Canyon in Arizona and designated 1.7 million \nacres of Utah as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument. Since \nthat time, we have been discussing the future of this monument and what \nthe short and long term impacts will be to my state and the surrounding \ncommunities. There are many questions and concerns that remain to be \naddressed. But, I am confident that during the next two years, the \nBureau of Land Management will develop a management plan which properly \nand effectively addresses these matters. For this reason, I am pleased \nthat H.R. 2107, the Interior Appropriations bill, includes $6.4 million \nfor the planning, management, and operation of the new monument.\n  Mr. President, regardless of where public opinion eventually comes \ndown on this new monument and the controversial way in which it was \ncreated, we should not forget the important lessons we have learned \nfrom the experience. When citizens are deliberately excluded from \ngovernment deliberations that so directly impact their homes, \ncommunities, schools, and families,\n\n[[Page S9599]]\n\ndamage is done to the very institution of democracy. This is what \nhappened prior to last September 18. Unfortunately, the message \nreceived by the people of Southern Utah last year was that the federal \ngovernment knows best and has the right to impose its narrow vision \nwithout regard to those most affected.\n  I am confident that we can go forward from here and begin the process \nof rebuilding the trust we lost one year ago. A vital part of this \nrebuilding process is the inclusion of those parties directly affected \nfrom the monument's designation in the development of the monument's \nmanagement plan. The Committee Report accompanying H.R. 2107 directs \nthe BLM to continue its cooperative efforts with state and local \ngovernments and the citizens of Utah in the plan's development. While \nthe Report gives specific and practical direction to the BLM, the \nlanguage also provides the agency with the flexibility its needs to \naddress the unknowns that will invariably arise in the early stages of \nthis sweeping process to develop a management plan.\n  I would like to state for the record that I am pleased with the \nprogress made so far by the BLM in working with the local communities. \nI am particularly glad to see that collaborative efforts have been \nformed between the federal agencies and the local communities involved, \nspecifically Kane and Garfield counties, where the monument is located. \nThe cooperative agreements that we renegotiated earlier this year are a \ngood start. They provide for continued local participation in the \ndevelopment of the monument's management plan as well as in the actual \ndelivery of visitor services.\n  Mr. President, we have learned in the West that the best manner to \nimplement successful land policies is to involve the communities that \nare directly affected by them. Wherever possible, we should proceed in \nthe spirit of a partnership between the affected local governments and \nthe national government. This is especially true with the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument, where many of the local citizens \nhave their entire lives invested in this region. They want to see the \nMonument developed; they want to see it succeed. They deserve a seat at \nthe planning table, and I am pleased the BLM is sensitive to this \nissue. In the end, the residents of the area will be providing the \nnecessary services to visitors.\n  In closing, I would like to commend the Chairman of the Subcommittee, \nSenator Gorton, and especially my colleague, Senator Bennett, for their \ndiligent efforts on the Appropriations Committee to ensure that the \nnecessary funding and direction will be there to help make the monument \na success for all involved.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   coal in the kaiparowits coal basin\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to discuss a matter related to \nthe pending legislation in that it concerns a study commissioned by the \nBureau of Land Management.\n  As my colleagues know, last September, President Clinton invoked the \nauthority granted under the Antiquities Act of 1906 to create the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah. The total \nacreage contained within the new monument is 1.7 million acres, or \napproximately an area the size of the states of Connecticut, Delaware \nand Rhode Island combined. This action, undertaken behind closed doors \nand without any input from the public, including the Utah congressional \ndelegation or Utah's governor, has caused considerable upheaval \nthroughout my state. I say this not because we are opposed to the \ndesignation of national monuments, but because of the process utilized \nto designate the monument and because of the short and long term \nimpacts to the local communities and their economies which, \nunfortunately, are currently unknown.\n  Those of us in Congress are working with the State of Utah and the \nClinton Administration to develop a management plan for the monument \nthat meets the needs of the managing agent--the Bureau of Land \nManagement (BLM)--the state, and the surrounding communities. I am \ngrateful that the report accompanying this year's Interior \nappropriations bill includes language to address these needs, and I \nwish to publicly thank Senator Gorton for his efforts.\n  At the same time, I am concerned about the atmosphere existing in my \nstate as it relates to the new monument. The manner in which the \nmonument has been designated has created a high level of mistrust among \ncertain parties. Unfortunately, there is considerable disinformation \ncirculating throughout the affected areas that compounds this problem \nand fans the fire of antifederal sentiment. To be honest, I can hardly \nblame them. A major torpedo was launched directly at these rural \ncommunities. If such an abuse of federal executive power ever occurs \nagain, it will be too soon.\n  Yet, while the citizens of my state remain angry and disillusioned \nregarding this entire episode, they understand it is fait accompli. As \nI anticipate the planning for the future of this new monument, \nincluding the preservation of Utah's existing rights as promised last \nyear by the President and the equitable exchange of state trust lands \ncaptured within the monument's boundaries, it is critical that an \nenvironment of trust be created among all parties involved in this \nprocess. That environment must be established first by ensuring that \nthe basis for decisionmaking is accurate and comprehensive.\n  Earlier this year, the BLM released a study prepared by BXG, Inc., a \nprivate contractor, entitled ``Kaiparowits Plateau--Coal Supply and \nDemand.'' This study discussed the marketability of the coal reserves \nof the Kaiparowits Plateau, which are located entirely within the Grand \nStaircase-Escalante Monument, and which are technically unreachable \nbecause of the monument's existence. Personally, I believe it is an \nabuse of the Antiquities Act to designate a monument simply to prevent \na coal mine from being developed, but that is what has happened in this \ncase and one of the primary reasons why the President signed this order \nacted in the fashion he did almost one year ago. Several pending \nlawsuits will determine if, indeed, this has been an unwarranted \nextension of the Antiquity Act's authority.\n  In the meantime, the BXG study concludes that the Kaiparowits coal is \nof poorer quality and higher cost than current reserves located in the \nWasatch Plateau and the Book Cliffs. As a result, they conclude that \nKaiparowits coal will have little or no demand until at least the year \n2020. These conclusions by BXG, and as far as I know, supported by the \nBLM, are erroneous and cannot go unchallenged.\n  The Director of the Utah Geological Survey recently analyzed this \nstudy and found that BXG used numerous invalid assumptions as it \nprepared its study.\n  For example, estimates of recoverable coal reserves in the \nKaiparowits Plateau were based on recovery amounts in the Appalachian \ncoalfield, a region with vastly different geology and history of \noperation. Kaiparowits coal recovery would be at least twice that of \nthe Appalachian region.\n  Also, the study assumes an average coal quality for Kaiparowits coal \ninstead of the quality of the coal that would actually be mined. The \nquality of coal produced from Kaiparowits would be comparable to \ncompliance coal currently mined in central Utah.\n  And, the productivity for a Kaiparowits mine was based on the average \nproductivity rate for all western long wall mines during 1990-95. \nHistorically, Utah underground mines are the most productive mines in \nthe U.S., and the nature of the Kaiparowits deposits would likely make \nthe new mines more productive than any others in the region.\n  Finally, the thick flat nature of Kaiparowits coal seams and their \nshallow overburden would lower costs for development, not increase \nthem, as assumed by BXG.\n  There are other deficiencies in the BXG study that have been \nidentified which I will refrain from mentioning here.\n  In sum, energy experts for the State of Utah using assumptions that \nare more appropriate for the resource characteristics and market \nconditions of the Kaiparowits Plateau coal fields have demonstrated \nthat coal mined from the Kaiparowits Plateau is of sufficient quantity \nand quality, and would likely have production costs that would make it \nan economically viable source of future supply for many utility and \nindustrial markets in the West.\n\n[[Page S9600]]\n\nWhat we have here may be a disagreement of what the facts mean among \nexperts.\n  Mr. GORTON.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC.  . IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW GUIDELINES ON NATIONAL FORESTS \n                   IN ARIZONA AND NEW MEXICO.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none of the \n     funds made available under this or any other Act may be used \n     for the purposes of executing any adjustments to annual \n     operating plans, allotment management plans, or terms and \n     conditions of existing grazing permits on National Forests in \n     Arizona and New Mexico, which are or may be deemed necessary \n     to achieve compliance with 1996 amendments to the applicable \n     forest plans, until March 1, 1998, or such time as the Forest \n     Service publishes a schedule for implementing proposed \n     changes, whichever occurs first.\n       (b) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to \n     preclude the expenditure of funds for the development of \n     annual operating plans, allotment management plans, or in \n     developing modifications to grazing permits in cooperation \n     with the permittee.\n       (c) Nothing in this section shall be interpreted to change \n     authority or preclude the expenditure of funds pursuant to \n     section 504 of the 1995 Rescissions Act (Public Law 104-19).\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment is to \nensure that the Forest Service can implement changes to the grazing \nprogram in the Southwest region in an orderly fashion.\n  Currently the Southwest Region of the Forest Service is working to \nimplement amendments it has made to the land use plans on all of its 11 \nNational Forests.\n  These amendments were made in response to litigation over threatened \nand endangered species habitat, and were adopted in June, 1996.\n  Since the amendments were adopted, the Forest Service has been taken \nback to court, because some groups believed that the they were not \nacting fast enough to implement the plans.\n  The Forest Service is now under a court order to maintain the status \nquo.\n  This has allowed them to continue working toward compliance with the \nforest plan amendments while the Appeals Court decides the case.\n  Since late July, when the injunction was issued, the Forest Service \nhas completed a review of over 1,300 grazing allotments in the two \nstates.\n  The review indicates that more than half do not fully comply, and \nover 250 have been determined to be of a ``high priority.''\n  Under the Forest Service's stated plan of action, they will study and \ndetermine the best way to bring these allotments into compliance with \nthe forest plans in priority order.\n  Once this is determined, the Forest Service will begin implementing \nchanges that are needed at the beginning of the next grazing season in \nMarch.\n  The plaintiffs in this case, however, have long been opposed to \nlivestock grazing on public lands.\n  This amendment does not preclude the Forest Service from taking \nappropriate and timely action to protect the threatened and endangered \nspecies.\n  It simply provides time for the agency to implement changes in a \nthoughtful and orderly manner, without the pressure from further \nlitigation.\n  This time will allow the Forest Service to work with those who to \ndate have been completely left out of this process.\n  These are the same people who are most likely to be adversely \naffected by implementation of the amendments.\n  I hope the Senate will support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Payments for Entitlement Land.--Section \n     6901(2)(A)(i) of title 31, United States Code, is amended by \n     inserting ``(other than in Alaska)'' after ``city'' the first \n     place such term appears.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Department of the Interior has \ninterpreted a provision I sponsored in the 1996 lands bill. This \ninterpretation reduces monies intended to go to Alaska's unorganized \nborough as a payment\n\n[[Page S9601]]\n\nin lieu of taxes [PILT] by over $950,000. I offer an amendment to the \nInterior appropriations bill to correct this.\n  After many years of working on this issue, the Congress last year \nenacted my proposal to qualify the unorganized borough in the State of \nAlaska for PILT. This provision of law--section 1033 of P.L. 104-333--\nmade clear that ``any area in Alaska that is within the boundaries of a \ncensus area used by the Secretary of Commerce in the decenniel \ncensus,'' and which did not qualify for PILT under the existing clause, \nwould qualify for a PILT. The only entity in Alaska that would qualify \nunder this provision is Alaska's unorganized borough. The Department--\nthrough the Solicitor--has correctly interpreted that the unorganized \nborough qualifies, but has incorrectly calculated the amount the \nunorganized borough should receive under the 1996 amendment.\n  PILT payments are generally calculated based on population and land \nacreage. The 1996 amendment specified that the unorganized borough's \nentire population and entire acreage would be used in the calculation. \nThe Secretary has not counted the entire population in the unorganized \nborough in calculating the borough's PILT allocation. Specifically, the \nDepartment has not counted the population of certain cities which have \nfederal lands within the unorganized borough.\n  According to the Regional Solicitor's May 30, 1997 opinion, if the \npopulation of each city within the unorganized borough were counted as \nintended by the 1996 provision, the State would be entitled to \n$3,362,339. If in Alaska the cities within the unorganized borough are \ncalculated separately, according to the opinion, the payments to the \ncities would be $78,557 and the payment for the unorganized borough \nwould be $2,333,764. These two payments total $2,412,321, $950,018 less \nthan the $3,362,339 the unorganized borough should be receiving.\n  The amendment today would clarify that the population of the cities \nwithin the unorganized borough in Alaska should be counted in \ncalculating the PILT allocation for the unorganized borough, and not \nseparately, as intended by the provision in the 1996 lands bill.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this does make a correction in connection \nwith bill payments to Alaska which I believe is appropriate and I \nbelieve has been cleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, included in the manager's amendment is an \namendment, I am pleased to cosponsor this amendment with my colleague, \nSenator Smith, to provide an additional tool in the toolbox, if you \nwill, for rural counties who have come under significant hardship in \nfunding law enforcement activities covering National Forest lands.\n  Most particularly, Mr. President, a number of Oregon counties have \nhad their sheriff's office budgets nearly busted by the need to address \nillegal, occasionally violent protests related to Federal timber sales \nand the regular management of National Forest lands in Oregon.\n  On nearly every timber sale protest, my office has worked very \nclosely with the Forest Service to find help. We have literally shaken \nthe Forest Service tree to find additional resources to help small \ncounties deal with their heightened law enforcement needs when one of \nthese demonstrations occurs.\n  While the Forest Service has been helpful, it has not prevented these \nrural counties from incurring, in some cases, nearly their entire \nyear's law enforcement budget on just one protracted timber protest.\n  Federal receipts must be used by Oregon Counties in the proportion of \n25 percent for schools and 75 percent for roads. This amendment simply \nallows counties to use surplus funds out of the share that is for \nroads, on law enforcement activities associated with the use of public \nroads of the county.\n  The Smith-Wyden amendment simply gives these counties--Douglas, Lane, \nKlamath, Jackson, and Josephine--a small tool to help them deal with \nillegal timber demonstrations that are political, and that are related \nto the Federal management of Federal lands. It is patently unfair that \nlocal\n\n[[Page S9602]]\n\ncommunities must bear this burden at all, but we believe that this \namendment will help.\n  I want to express my great appreciation to the chairman of the \nInterior Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, the ranking \nmember of the Interior Appropriations Committee, Senator Byrd, and to \nthe ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Bumpers, for working with me and Senator Smith on this \nprovision.\n  Mr. REID addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       ``Sec.   . Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in \n     payment for facilities, equipment, and interests destroyed by \n     the Federal Government at the Stampede Mine Site within the \n     boundaries of Denali National Park, (1) the Secretary of the \n     Interior, within existing funds designated by this Act for \n     expenditure for Departmental Management, shall by September \n     15, 1998: (A) provide funds subject to an appraisal in \n     accordance with standard appraisal methods, not to exceed \n     $500,000.00 to the University of Alaska Fairbanks, School of \n     Mineral Engineering; and, (B) shall remove mining equipment \n     at the Stampede Mine Site identified by the School of Mineral \n     Engineering to a site specified by the School of Mineral \n     Engineering; and, (2) the Secretary of the Army shall \n     provide, at no cost, two six by six vehicles, in excellent \n     operating condition, or equivalent equipment to the \n     University of Alaska Fairbanks, School of Mineral Engineering \n     and shall construct a bridge across the Bull River to the \n     Golden Zone Mine Site to allow ingress and egress for the \n     activities conducted by the School of Mineral Engineering. \n     Upon transfer of the funds, mining equipment, and the \n     completion of all work designated by this section, the \n     University of Alaska Fairbanks, School of Mineral Engineering \n     shall convey all remaining rights and interests in the \n     Stampede Mine Site to the Secretary of the Interior.''\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I believe this is the Stampede Creek \nMine amendment. I am not sure of the status of the issue, other than I \nbelieve the minority has agreed to it and it has been discussed. There \nwas a question by the occupant of the chair and by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  In 1987, the Federal Government, through the Park Service, blew up \nthe University of Alaska's mine. This was a mine that was a working \nmodel. It was in Denali National Park. It had been donated to the \nUniversity of Alaska School of Mines by a man by the name of Earl \nPilgrim who, in 1942, purchased the claim and continued to operate the \nmine--it was an antimony mine--until 1972. At one time, the mine was \nthe second-largest producer of antimony in the United States. It was \nlocated in an isolated section of the park preserve. The Stampede Mine \nwas found to be eligible for listing in the National Register of \nHistoric Places on June 20, 1989.\n  Today, the mine site contains--excuse me, did contain several \nhistoric workable structures. The site is rich in equipment, machinery, \ntools, and the myriad objects that make up the stuff of a mining camp. \nMany of these items are unique to the Pilgrim's operation and reflect \non his own inventiveness and mechanical skills.\n  In 1979, Stampede Mines, LTD, entered into negotiations with the \nNational Park Service and the University of Alaska. As a result of \nthose negotiations, the mining company made a donation to the National \nPark Service of the surface rights including road access from the \nairstrip, the historic buildings, water rights, and stream banks.\n  It was believed at the time that the National Park Service possessed \nthe wherewithal to better maintain and protect the valuable historic \nstructures. Unfortunately, in 1987, history would record that there was \nvery little merit to this line of thinking.\n  At the same time, the University of Alaska Fairbanks' School of \nMineral Engineering was donated all the mining rights, mining \nequipment, and fixtures, with mineral development restrictions for the \neducation of students.\n  Mr. President, the mineral development restrictions included \nprovisions which allowed for only educational use of the mineral \nestate. No commercial mining would be allowed, only small-scale \neducational mining, and even though the buildings, roads, trails, and \nairstrips were owned by the Park Service, the university is responsible \nfor maintaining them.\n  The School of Mineral Engineering was most pleased with the \narrangement and looked forward to providing their mining students a \nunique opportunity to learn firsthand about earlier- to present-day \nmining operations and equipment by having the mining mill to actually \noperate for the students. Given the chance, they would like the \nopportunity to conduct such an education program in the future.\n  The educational program is consistent with the intent of the \nuniversity's receipt of the property. The School of Mineral Engineering \nhas developed a meaningful program that provides for initiating \nactivities associated with instruction-investigation about \nenvironmentally sound mineral exploration and mining techniques in a \nsensitive natural environment, as well as studying the geology, \nbiology, and ecology of the area, and studying the historical aspects \nof the mine.\n  The program has already helped the mineral industry develop methods \nto explore for and develop minerals on lands located in sensitive areas \nthroughout Alaska, even on land controlled by the Department of the \nInterior.\n  Mr. President, it was to be an absolute win for the National Park \nService and a win in the field of education for the university. No one \nin their worst nightmares, would have believed that the National Park \nService could blow this opportunity.\n  During 1986-87 National Park Service personnel conducted field \ninspections of old mining sites located on their lands for the purposes \nof identifying potentially contaminated sites and hazardous conditions.\n  Toward the end of July 1986, the Stampede Creek site was examined. \nThe inspectors recommended immediate action to examine the safety of \nold blasting caps and chemicals at the site. Before taking any action, \nthe inspectors recommended that the ownership issue be resolved.\n\n[[Page S9604]]\n\n  In other words, Mr. President, someone actually considered private \nproperty. The matter was treated as serious, but not an emergency or \nlife-threatening. Nothing further occurred for 8 months.\n  Subsequently, National Park Service personnel and members of the U.S. \nArmy's explosive ordnance detonation team arrived, unannounced, at the \nStampede Mine site and on April 30, 1987, changed the configuration of \nthe mine site and its historic structures.\n  Mr. President, they moved 4,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate--private \nproperty of the University--and placed it on top of the still frozen \nStampede Creek. Ammonium nitrate may sound dangerous but in its \npackaged state it is nothing more than common fertilizer.\n  They piled 4,000 pounds of fertilizer on top of the creek and added \nseveral half gallon bottles of acid-more private property which they \nretrieved from the assay lab. Finally they added 45 pounds of high \nexplosives--set the charge and left the area.\n  Mr. President, let me refer to the pictures on my right which show \nthe Stampede Mine prior to this episode of the Park Service and the \nU.S. Army ordinance detonation team.\n  This is the Stampede Creek. This is the mill and the mine. The mine \nis back here in the hills. This is where the concentrates are \nrecovered, and so forth. The pictures show the facilities before the \nexplosion occurred.\n  I am going to show you the next chart which shows you what happened \nwhen the Park Service finished their work. This is what the mine and \nthe mill looked like. As you can see, it is totally devastated by the \nblast.\n  When the smoke cleared and all the debris fell back to the earth, \nthey found that the explosion left a crater in the creek 28 feet wide \nand 8 feet deep. They also noticed a substantial change in the mining \nsite, which is depicted by this photograph.\n  Let me show you again the creek which indicates the significance of \nwhat this crater did to this stream bed. You can imagine a hole 28 feet \nwide and 8 feet deep. And this creek flows down into the watershed that \nflows into the Tanana River which flows into the Yukon River, obviously \npolluting and killing fish along the way.\n  The Park Service did it, Mr. President.\n  In addition to the mine entrance and mill, damage occurred to other \nbuildings, trees, landscape, and stream bed. The bombing also blew up a \n5,000 ton tailings pile which by using USGS records for the current \nprice of metals would be worth approximately $600,000 in place. \nUnfortunately the heavy metals of the tailings pile were last seen \nmoving from the site and being scattered throughout the environment by \nthe force of the blast.\n  One of the most telling reports concerning this debacle is from the \nU.S. Army incident report No. 176-23-87 which stated that the NPS \npersonnel were aware that detonation would result in damage to the \nsurrounding buildings and according to Sergeant Seutter ``at no time \nwas it relayed to me that damage was unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, violations of the law are clear. There are violations \nof the Clean Water Act, the Historic Preservation Act, section 404 of \nthe Clean Water Act involving wetlands, not to mention the taking and \ndestruction of private property.\n  Further, since the explosion, approximately $2 million worth of \nmining equipment, some historic, has been damaged or destroyed due to \nexposure to inclement weather and the normal Alaska freeze and thaw \ncycles.\n  What I find equally outrageous is the fact that no one from the \nNational Park Service has, until most recently, said ``I am sorry''.\n  To be fair, during the course of the last 2 years the NPS has been \nworking with the university in an attempt to allow the university to \ncontinue its educational program. Unfortunately, the site in its \nreconformed condition lacks the historic integrity and lure that it \nonce possessed.\n  The university has located another historic mine site outside of the \nnational park boundaries that can meet the needs and requirements of \nthe university, its curriculum, and its students.\n  Mr. President, my amendment does not attempt to rectify all the wrong \nthat has been done. If we were to pass legislation, or use the court \nsystem, to right the wrong that has been accomplished, the cost would \nbe in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Some of the historic mining \nequipment loss due to the explosion and subsequent neglect is cost-\nprohibitive to replace.\n  My amendment would direct the Secretary: subject to an appraisal--and \nI emphasize ``appraisal''--to provide up to $500,000.00 to the \nUniversity of Alaska Fairbanks, School of Mineral Engineering; and, \nremove certain salvageable historic mining equipment to a location that \nwill be convenient for the university to pick it up and move it to a \nmine site outside of the park boundary.\n  One would question, ``Well, what is the justification for this \naction?'' There is none. The Federal Government blew up private \nproperty, and the Federal Government should be held responsible and \nmake restitution.\n  My amendment would require the U.S. Army: to provide two six by six \nvehicles to the School of Mineral Engineering; and, to construct a \nbridge across the Bull River at the Golden Mine site to allow unimpeded \ningress and egress for the activities conducted by the School.\n  My amendment will ensure that all remaining rights and interests in \nthe Stampede Mine site held by the university would be conveyed to the \nNational Park Service, which is the wish of the Park Service.\n  Mr. President, passage of this amendment, and its subsequent \nenactment into law, will ensure us that justice in this matter will \nhave been served and we will be able to put this incident behind us. \nAll accounts will have been satisfied.\n  Mr. President, the difficulty in asking the Park Service to meet \ntheir obligation as in stating ``may'' and mandate that they actually \nperform by stating ``shall'' is the difference between action and no \naction. We have encouraged the Park Service. We have asked the Park \nService. And now it is time to direct the Park Service to right this \nwrong because they blew up private property belonging to the University \nof Alaska School of Mines. This amendment would attempt to rectify that \nsituation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Hagel). The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, very briefly, I don't know about the \nparticular merits of the project. But I do consider the specific \nearmark for a certain sum of money. If this is going to proceed on the \nfloor, I think we ought to have a rollcall vote on it. So, if it is \nsought to pass by unanimous consent, I will be objecting to that and \nask that we have a rollcall vote on this specific earmark for a certain \nset amount of money.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, this is what I would propose.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Domenici be added as a \ncosponsor on the Abraham amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, we have one amendment by the Senator from \nAlaska on the Presidio that can be accepted. Then I believe the Senator \nfrom Alaska is going to withdraw his second-degree amendment to the \nStevens-McCain amendment. We can pass the Stevens-McCain amendment by \nvoice vote. Then I would suggest that we have stacked votes on the \nMurkowski amendment that has just been debated, followed immediately by \na vote on final passage of the bill.\n  That is my suggestion, if we can get those other unanimous consents \nahead of time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1232 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as a consequence of the discussion we \nhave had, it is my understanding that we have been able to address many \nof the concerns associated with the discussion on the $1.6 billion from \noil leases from offshore Alaska.\n  So it is my intention to withdraw my amendment.\n  Further, it is my understanding that Senator Gorton agrees with me \nthat\n\n[[Page S9605]]\n\nthe additional $800 million should be captured through legislation in \nthe authorizing committee.\n  I understand the floor manager would support that.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 1232, withdrawn\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. With that assurance, I would withdraw my second-degree \namendment.\n  Mr. GORTON. I believe I have to withdraw my motion to table that \nsecond-degree amendment, which I do.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, amendment No. 1232 is \nwithdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1231\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Now I think we can by voice vote accept the underlying \nfirst-degree amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1231.\n  The amendment (No. 1231) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1246\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof Senator Murkowski relating to the Presidio that has been cleared on \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Gorton], for Mr. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 1246.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place add the following new section:\n       ``Sec.   . Delete section 103(c)(7) of Public Law 104-333 \n     and replace with the following:\n       ``(7) Staff.--Notwithstanding any other provisions of law, \n     the Trust is authorized to appoint and fix the compensation \n     and duties and terminate the services of an executive \n     director and such other officers and employees as it deems \n     necessary without regard to the provisions of title 5, United \n     States Code or other laws related to the appointment, \n     compensation or termination of federal employees.''.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I have already explained the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1246) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1245\n\n  Mr. GORTON. Now, Mr. President, I believe that the leaders approve of \nit.\n  The question is the Murkowski amendment. It is a debated amendment.\n  Does the proponent of the amendment want to ask a rollcall on it or \nthe opponent?\n  Is not the question before the body now the Murkowski amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question before the Senate is the \nMurkowski amendment No. 1245.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. On that amendment I ask for a rollcall vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment there is not a sufficient second.\n  Now there appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Before we have a vote on that, I ask unanimous consent \nthat we adopt all further committee amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendments on page 46, line 15 through page 47, line \n25; page 115, line 1 through line 22; and page 123, line 9 through page \n124, line 20, as amended were agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there further debate on the Murkowski amendment? If not, the \nquestion is on agreeing to amendment No. 1245. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n           Title V--Priority Land Acquisitions and Exchanges\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I rise today to speak about Title V of H.R. 2107--the \nInterior Appropriations Bill. Title V provides an additional $700 \nmillion appropriation from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF), \npursuant to the Balanced Budget Agreement, for priority land \nacquisitions and exchanges. While I had sought to have more money \nappropriated to the state-side LWCF matching grant program, I commend \nSenator Gorton for appropriating this $700 million in a manner \nconsistent with the terms and spirit of the LWCF Act.\n  Over 30 years ago, in a remarkable bipartisan effort, Congress and \nthe President created the LWCF. The LWCF provides funds for the \npurchase of federal land by the land management agencies--the federal-\nside LWCF program--and creates a unique partnership among Federal, \nstate, and local\n\n[[Page S9606]]\n\ngovernments for the acquisition of public outdoor recreation areas and \nfacilities--the state-side LWCF matching grant program. The LWCF is \nfunded primarily from off-shore oil and gas leasing revenues which now \nexceed $3 billion annually, and has been authorized through the year \n2015 at an annual ceiling of $900 million.\n  However, LWCF monies must be annually appropriated. And, despite the \nincrease in offshore oil and gas revenues, the LWCF has not fared well \nin this decade. Expenditures from the LWCF have fluctuated widely over \nits life but have generally ranged from $200 to $300 million per year. \nIn the 1990s, total appropriations to both the federal and state sides \nof LWCF steadily declined from a high of $341 million during the Bush \nAdministration to $149 million in FY 1997.\n  Most significantly, all of the FY 1997 appropriation was for the \nexclusive purpose of federal land acquisition. In 1995, Congress and \nthe President agreed to shut-down the state-side LWCF program. For FY \n1998, the President requested $165 million for federal land \nacquisitions and only $1 million for monitoring previously funded \nstate-side projects. The President did not request any funds for new \nstate-side projects.\n  After submitting his budget to Congress, the President appears to \nhave seen the value of the LWCF. In the Balanced Budget Agreement, \nCongress and the President agreed to provide an additional $700 million \nfor priority land acquisitions and exchanges from the LWCF. President \nClinton wants all of this additional $700 million spent on Federal land \nacquisitions. He has not requested that any of this additional LWCF \nappropriation be used to fund the state-side LWCF matching grant \nprogram.\n\n\n                   Priority Federal Land Acquisitions\n\n  As Senator Domenici stated on the Senate floor, the Balanced Budget \nAgreement, and the accompanying Concurrent Budget Resolution, provide \nno specifics as to how this additional $700 million is to be spent. \nNeither the Balanced Budget Agreement nor the Concurrent Budget \nResolution mention, by name, any land acquisitions. Rather, \nCongressional leaders intended for this money to be appropriated \nthrough the normal legislative process. That is what Senator Gorton is \ntrying to do in the Interior Appropriations Bill.\n  The Clinton Administration has identified two priority Federal land \nacquisitions: the 7500 acre Headwaters Forest property in northern \nCalifornia and the 4000 acre New World Mine property in Montana. Last \nyear before the election, the Clinton Administration proposed, with \ngreat fanfare, to acquire both of these properties through land \nexchanges. However, because of the Administration's reluctance to work \nwith Congress to consummate these land exchanges, a number of problems \narose. The President then decided to acquire these properties through \nan outright cash purchase, using $315 million of the additional LWCF \nmonies provided in the Balanced Budget Agreement.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee, unlike its House counterpart, \nhas agreed to fund these acquisitions. However, it has made this \nappropriation contingent on the enactment of separate authorizing \nlegislation.\n  As Chairman of the authorizing Committee--the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee--I congratulate the Senate appropriators for \nrespecting the role of legislative committees. Title V of H.R. 2107 \nhonors this historical division of responsibilities among authorizing \nand appropriations committees and the processes of the Senate, and the \nCongress.\n  It also acknowledges that Congress needs to, and should, examine the \ndetails of the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions. The \ndecisions to acquire these properties were made with no public and \nlittle Congressional involvement. As a result, a significant number of \nunanswered questions surround both acquisitions. Examination of the \nacquisitions is best done by the authorizing committee.\n  As an initial matter, Congress needs to authorize the use of LWCF \nmonies. The LWCF Act provides a funding mechanism for the acquisition \nof Federal lands. It does not provide an independent basis for Federal \nland acquisitions. The LWCF Act specifies, with limited exceptions, \nthat LWCF monies cannot be used for a Federal land purchase ``unless \nsuch acquisition is otherwise authorized by law.'' From the information \navailable to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the exceptions \nto this prohibition do not apply to either the Headwaters Forest or the \nNew World Mine acquisition.\n  The Clinton Administration disagrees, contending that site-specific \nauthorization for the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions \nis unnecessary because existing statutory authorities allow the Bureau \nof Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service, or the Forest \nService to use LWCF monies. Yet, the Administration fails to analyze \nwith any specificity exactly how the other authorities apply to the two \nacquisitions and override the provisions of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund Act.\n  For example, the Clinton Administration opines that the Forest \nService has the authority to purchase the New World Mine property under \nthe Weeks Act. However, the Weeks Act was enacted for the purpose of \nacquiring eastern forested land. At the same time, the LWCF Act limits \nthe Forest Service's use of LWCF monies for acquisitions ``primarily of \nvalue for outdoor recreation purposes.'' Is recreation the primary \nvalue of the New World Mine property? Or, is the primary purpose of the \nacquisition to protect the character of Yellowstone National Park? What \nabout the fact that the LWCF Act limits the Forest Service's use of \nLWCF monies west of the 100th meridian? Will the New World Mine \nacquisition, at greater than 4000 acres, run afoul of this limitation?\n  Similar unanswered questions surround the Headwaters Forest \nacquisition. The Clinton Administration states that the Headwaters \nForest would be managed by the Bureau of Land Management. However, BLM \nis required to use LWCF monies for land acquisitions which are \nconsistent with the applicable land use plan and ``necessary for the \nproperty management of public lands which are primarily of value for \noutdoor recreation purposes.'' Is the acquisition of the Headwaters \nForest even addressed in the applicable land use plan? Is it the \nClinton Administration's position that the primary value of the \nHeadwaters Forest is outdoor recreation? If so, how will the public \naccess this new recreation resource? Or, because the Headwaters Forest \nhas been identified as critical habitat under the Endangered Species \nAct, is the Administration relying on the ESA as authorization for the \nacquisition? Does it then make sense for the property to be managed by \nthe BLM? Is it the Administration's position that the ESA authorizes \nthe acquisition of any and all private property containing endangered \nor threatened species and overrides the limitations in the LWCF Act?\n\n  All of these questions need to be answered before the Congress \naccepts the Clinton Administration's assertion that existing laws \nauthorize the acquisition of the Headwaters Forest and the New World \nMine and override the prohibitions in the LWCF Act. The Committee of \njurisdiction is in the best position to conduct such an examination.\n  Moreover, even if the Headwaters Forest and the New World Mine can be \nacquired by the President without the enactment of separate authorizing \nlegislation, Congressional authorization of the agreements is needed to \navoid other statutory requirements normally applicable to Federal land \npurchases. Because the purchase prices for both the Headwaters Forest \nand the New World Mine were the result of negotiation and dependent, in \npart, on other terms, the actual fair market value of the properties is \nunknown.\n  With respect to the New World Mine, a 1995 National Park Service \nreport estimates the fair market value of the property is less than $50 \nmillion. The Clinton Administration has agreed to purchase the property \nfor $65 million.\n  As to the Headwaters Forest, there is enormous discrepancy as to the \nproperty's value. The current owner contends the property has a value \nin excess of $700 million. A 1993 Forest Service appraisal values the \nproperty at $500 million. However, a 1996 analysis of the property \nconducted for the Department of Justice concludes that the property has \na value between $20 million, applying current environmental \nrestrictions, and $250 million, without any environmental restrictions. \nThe\n\n[[Page S9607]]\n\nHeadwaters Forest property will be acquired for $380 million in cash \nand property.\n  Moreover, the Clinton Administration apparently wants to ensure that \nthe fair market value of the properties is never determined. On June 9, \n1997, President Clinton submitted an amendment to his FY 1998 Interior \nAppropriations budget request to reflect the $700 million in LWCF \nmonies included in the Balanced Budget Agreement. The recommended \nstatutory language specifically references the negotiated purchase \nprices for the two acquisitions.\n  The accompanying budget justification states ``by ratifying the \nspecific lands to be acquired and the purchase prices contained in \nthose negotiated agreements, these provisions would also obviate the \nneed for the United States to undertake additional and costly \nappraisals under the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property \nAcquisition Act.'' The Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property \nAcquisition Act requires an appraisal of the fair market value of \nprivate property the Federal government desires to acquire, whether \nthrough negotiations or condemnation. One of the primary purposes of \nthis Act is to guarantee that any Federal land purchase is a good deal \nfor the American taxpayer.\n  It is bad precedent for Congress to bless the Administration's \nblatant disregard of this law. Congress needs to examine, and determine \nfor itself, the fair market value of these properties and, whether or \nnot the purchases are a good deal for the American taxpayer. This \nexamination is properly done in the context of authorizing legislation.\n  The magnitude of these acquisitions make the disregard of this law \neven more troubling. As noted in the Senate Appropriations Committee \nreport accompanying H.R. 2107, the $315 million spent to acquire the \ntwo properties is more than the total amount appropriated from the LWCF \nfor land acquisitions over the past two years. Those appropriations \nhave been used to acquire dozens of properties--the vast majority of \nwhich cost less than $1 million. None of them have been excluded from \nthe Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Act. \nThe Clinton Administration needs to explain to Congress why the \nHeadwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions warrant an exemption \nfrom the law.\n  Congressional authorization is further needed because the Clinton \nAdministration has committed the Federal government to more than the \npurchase of property.\n  The New World Mine agreement requires that $22.5 million of the $65 \nmillion purchase price be used to finance the clean-up of the property \nwhich is contaminated from historic mining activities in the area. \nHowever, LWCF monies are not authorized for environmental clean-ups.\n  While the Clinton Administration contends sufficient authorization \nexists for it to use LWCF monies to acquire the New World Mine \nproperty, nowhere does it argue that it may use $22.5 million of this \nLWCF appropriation for financing a private party's CERCLA-type cleanup. \nWhatever the contours of the debate over the proper uses and purposes \nof the LWCF Act, it is clear Congress never intended for the LWCF to be \nused as an environmental contamination insurance account. Yet, such an \nimpermissible use is precisely what the Administration now proposes. \nCongress clearly needs to review and authorize such a use of LWCF \nmonies.\n  At the same time, the Agreement to purchase the Headwaters Forest \nrequires that the Federal government and the property seller agree to a \nhabitat conservation plan under the Endangered Species Act for timber \nharvesting activities which will occur on the remaining 200,000 acres \nowned by the company. In fact, because of difficulties in negotiating \nan acceptable habitat conservation plan for this property, the timber \ncompany sued the Federal government. However, if the Federal government \nand company agree to a habitat conservation plan, and the Federal \ngovernment purchases the property, the company's case against the \nFederal government will be dismissed. To date, no such agreement has \nbeen reached. I question, however, whether it is good public policy to \nsettle litigation in this manner.\n  I have touched upon some of the issues raised by the two \nacquisitions. I have not talked about the Clinton Administration's \nfailure to acquire the properties through land exchanges, as originally \nproposed. Questions also exist about how, and at what cost, the Federal \ngovernment will manage the properties upon acquisition.\n  We have held no hearings on the New World Mine acquisition. We have \nheld no hearings on the Headwaters Forest acquisition. Congress had no \ninput into the decision to acquire them. In fact, most of us know \nlittle about the two proposals. We owe it to the American taxpayer to \nreview these acquisitions--a review best done by the authorizing \nCommittee.\n\n\n                 state-side LWCF matching grant program\n\n  I also want to comment on the appropriation contained in H.R. 2107 \nfor the state-side LWCF matching grant program. The state-side LWCF \nprogram has played a vital role in providing recreational and \neducational opportunities to millions of Americans. State-side LWCF \ngrants have helped finance well over 37,500 park and recreation \nprojects in all fifty states, including campgrounds, trails, and open \nspace.\n  The availability of outdoor recreation facilities is critical to the \nwell-being of Americans. People who participate in outdoor recreation \nactivities, are happier and healthier. Recreation is an important \ncomponent of our economy. Moreover, while trips to our National Parks \ncreate experiences and memories which last a lifetime, day-in and day-\nout, people recreate close to home. In Fiscal Year 1995, the last year \nfor which the state-side LWCF grant program was funded, there were \nnearly 3800 applications for state-side grants. Unfortunately, there \nwas only enough money to fund 500 projects. In the intervening three \nyears, the local and state demand for those resources has only \nincreased.\n  That is why state-side LWCF grants are so important. State-side LWCF \ngrants help address the highest priority needs of Americans for outdoor \nrecreation. At the same time, because of the matching requirement for \nstate-side LWCF grants, they provide vital seed-money which local \ncommunities use to forge partnerships with private entities.\n  Unlike the Clinton Administration, the Interior Appropriations \nCommittee has recognized the value of the state-side LWCF matching \ngrant program. It appropriated $100 million to the program over the \nnext four years and noted, in its report, that ``resource protection is \nnot solely the responsibility nor the domain of the Federal Government, \nand that States can in many cases extract greater value from moneys'' \nappropriated from the LWCF. I congratulate Senator Gorton on this \nappropriation and am optimistic that this provision will remain in \nConference.\n  I have attached to my statement, for inclusion in the Record, two \nrecent resolutions. The first, from the National Governors' \nAssociation, calls on the Federal government to revive the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund state-side matching grant program. This bill \ndoes that. The second letter, from the National Recreation and Park \nAssociation, urges the Senate to support the $100 million appropriation \ncontained in the Interior Appropriations Bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that these items be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               National Governors Association,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n\n                          Recreation Resources\n\n\n                                Preamble\n\n       The Governors believe that participation in outdoor \n     recreation provides important physical, mental, and social \n     benefits to the American public, and that responsibility for \n     providing diverse and high-quality opportunities for such \n     recreation is shared by federal, state, and local government \n     interests and the private sector. Continuing growth in demand \n     for outdoor recreation opportunities has brought overcrowding \n     to some areas, while budgetary constraints, environmental \n     pollution, and conversion of open spaces to other uses has \n     further added to the challenges we face. This is particularly \n     true of resources within physical and economic reach of the \n     majority of urban populations. The expansion, development, \n     and management of recreational space and facilities is an \n     important national challenge that can contribute to both \n     quality of life and the economy. To effectively meet this \n     challenge, federal recreation efforts must be modified to \n     include a far greater emphasis on state\n\n[[Page S9608]]\n\n     and local decisionmaking and on partnerships, particularly \n     with the private sector, than currently exists. The system \n     must also be reinvented to enhance program efficiencies and \n     effective program administration.\n\n\n                 A Vision for America's Great Outdoors\n\n       The Governors support a vision of a safe, clean, planned, \n     and well-maintained network of recreation areas available to \n     all Americans. Important objectives can be achieved by \n     reviving and strengthening the existing Land and Water \n     Conservation Fund (LWCF) and Urban Park and Recreation \n     Recovery (UPARR) programs. The Governors recognize the \n     valuable work done by the National Park Service Advisory \n     Board report, ``An American Network of Parks and Open \n     Space,'' with its call for a balanced formula for ensuring \n     state, local, and national funding allocations to meet the \n     nation's diverse needs for recreation resources. In addition, \n     the Governors support continuing substantial funding for \n     recreation programs through appropriations for the federal \n     land-management agencies and through the expenditure of \n     monies at the federal and state levels under programs such as \n     the Pittman-Robertson Act and the Aquatic Resources Trust \n     Fund. The Governors also encourage the continued use of \n     private capital for investment in recreation facilities on \n     public lands and further encourage increased funding for \n     operational expenditures for recreation facilities and \n     services through general fund appropriations and recreation \n     fees paid by those who directly use those facilities and \n     services. To ensure that recreation funds are spent wisely, \n     the Governors believe that, at every level of government, an \n     effort should be made to understand and accommodate \n     recreationists' needs and interests.\n\n\n                           guiding principles\n\n       The Governors believe that the creation and maintenance of \n     a nationwide network of recreation areas should be guided by \n     the following principles.\n       Priorities for spending funds must come from a sustained \n     effort to understand the needs of recreationists on the part \n     of those involved in local, state, and national planning \n     activities. State and local recreation resources planning \n     activities, including comprehensive outdoor recreation plans, \n     should continue to be a foundation for decisionmaking. The \n     Governors encourage a revitalized LWCF/UPARR program to \n     streamline federal requirements currently imposed on such \n     state planning and granting processes. At the same time, the \n     Governors acknowledge the importance of an open, public \n     process for allocating grants-in-aid and support continuation \n     of this important tool for effective citizen participation.\n       To assist in a better determination of national priorities \n     and their interaction with the expressed priorities of state \n     and local governments, the Governors also encourage \n     integration of federal recreation resource planning processes \n     with their state and local counterparts.\n       Programs for land conservation, preservation of cultural \n     landscapes, and recreation resource development require a \n     shared partnership among citizens, private landowners, all \n     levels of governments, and private organizations.\n       The equity of private property owners must be respected in \n     the implementation of recreation and conservation programs.\n       As the nation's recreation resources investments are made, \n     the Governors encourage continued attention to providing \n     quality recreation opportunities to all citizens, reflecting \n     the diverse needs for recreation that is safe, accessible, \n     affordable, enjoyable, and open.\n       National strategies and programs that aid state and local \n     governments should be flexible, effective, and efficient.\n       The long-term future of our nation's recreation resources \n     is dependent on a citizenry that is both familiar with and \n     appreciative of these resources. Programs that promote such \n     understanding and appreciation should be encouraged in both \n     the private and public sector.\n\n\n                                funding\n\n       The Governors believe that Congress should encourage the \n     provision of adequate and predictable funding for the \n     nation's outdoor recreation resources from both private and \n     public sources.\n       The Governors support the principle that nonrenewable \n     resources leaving federal ownership, such as oil and gas \n     recovered from the Outer Continental Shelf, should be used as \n     a means to establish assets of lasting value to the nation.\n       The Governors recommend that Congress make available no \n     less than 60 percent of funds for state and local governments \n     with the balance to federal agencies to be used by both \n     principally for the purposes of acquiring outdoor recreation \n     areas and providing for and protecting outdoor recreation \n     opportunities. The Governors also support increased private \n     investment in recreation facilities on public lands.\n       The Governors believe it is imperative to adequately \n     maintain public recreation lands and the facilities on them. \n     The Governors recommend that, in addition to general fund \n     revenues, where appropriate and practicable, user fees and \n     private sector funding should be considered to help achieve \n     this objective. The Governors strongly recommend that LWCF \n     not be used for these purposes.\n\n\n                 federal responsibility and partnership\n\n       Federally managed public lands and resources serve a \n     critical function in meeting national recreational needs, not \n     only in providing opportunities for outdoor recreation but in \n     providing the means, through the Federal Lands Highway \n     Program, to access and enjoy those opportunities. Federal \n     agencies should develop comprehensive outdoor recreation \n     resource use and access plans in consultation with state and \n     local governments and coordinate their planning with the \n     recreation resource needs identified by state and local \n     governments and private organizations. New federal \n     institutional arrangements are needed to give greater \n     visibility and authority to recreational program \n     administration on federal lands and to foster innovative \n     state, local, and private program partnerships. The \n     efficiency and effectiveness of federal recreational support \n     can be enhanced.\n\n\n                         railroad rights-of-way\n\n       The Governors believe that where it is consistent with \n     state law and respects the rights of adjacent landowners, it \n     is in the public interest to conserve and maintain abandoned \n     railroad corridors whenever suitable for use as public trails \n     and greenways, for other public purposes, or for possible \n     future rail use. Such efforts can help achieve the goal of \n     the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors of \n     establishing ``a continuous network of recreation corridors . \n     . . across the country.''\n\n\n                             scenic byways\n\n       The Governors believe that funding for the National Scenic \n     Byway Program, which recognizes the economic and social value \n     of fostering travel on the nation's most scenic routes, one \n     of the most popular forms of recreation in the country, \n     should be continued.\n\n\n                  user-pay/user-benefit grant programs\n\n       The Governors believe that grant programs that return fees \n     paid by users, for example, federal gasoline taxes or excise \n     taxes on specific products, to programs which directly \n     benefit those users, should be continued. Examples include \n     the programs funded under the Pittman-Robertson Act, the \n     Aquatic Resources Trust Fund, and the National Recreational \n     Trails Fund.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Recreation and\n\n\n                                             Park Association,\n\n                                  Ashburn, VA, September 10, 1997.\n\n               An Open Letter to the United States Senate\n\n       You will soon have an opportunity to vote on fiscal year \n     1998 appropriations for the Department of the Interior. The \n     Land and Water Conservation Fund state assistance program is \n     among the many important initiatives that you will consider. \n     We urge you to approve not less than the $100 million \n     appropriation for LWCF state assistance recommended by the \n     Senate appropriations committee in its version of H.R. 2107.\n       The LWCF state assistance program addresses the health and \n     welfare of our nation's citizens. By matching state and local \n     resources to complete priority projects for individual \n     communities across the nation, these resources provide access \n     to recreation and conservation opportunities for all American \n     citizens.They are the playgrounds where our children run and \n     shout. They are the swimming pools and playing fields where \n     we learn the values of teamwork, sportsmanship, hard work and \n     competition. They are the parks, picnic areas, pathways and \n     wild places where we find quiet and renew our connection with \n     the natural world. These places restore our minds and bodies \n     and enhance our quality of life. And most importantly, they \n     are accessible. They are down the street, across town, at the \n     metro stop and affordable regardless of economic status. This \n     is what sets these state and local investments apart from our \n     nation's great national parks, forests, refuges and public \n     lands. And this is why they are so important.\n       After two years without LWCF state assistance, thousands of \n     opportunities for conservation and recreation have been \n     delayed or lost. Restoring this program will allow projects \n     with available matching funds to move forward. It will also \n     renew the nation's commitment to its people to reinvest a \n     portion of revenues from the depletion of our energy \n     resources in state and local, as well as federal, recreation \n     resources. We hope we can count on your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     R. Dean Tice,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n   requiring land management agencies to prioritize additional land \n                              acquisitions\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to explain \nto my colleagues an amendment I had intended to offer to the fiscal \nyear 1998 Interior Appropriations bill. I was persuaded not to offer \nthe amendment because of my concern that opening up the section of the \nbill which provides an additional $700 million for land acquisitions \nand exchanges would embolden those who would earmark these funds for \nparticular projects, without consideration of the priorities of our \nFederal land management agencies. Therefore, I decided not to offer the \namendment at this time.\n  I do intend to pursue this proposal as separate legislation, and I \nsolicit the comments of my colleagues concerning this proposal, \ndescribed below.\n\n[[Page S9609]]\n\n  The amendment would require the administration to utilize certain \ncriteria in preparing the prioritized list of land acquisitions and \nexchanges that would be conducted using the $700 million increase \nrecommended in this bill for Federal land acquisitions and exchanges. \nThis amendment places primary responsibility for determining the \npriority of land acquisitions in the hands of the Federal land \nmanagement agencies charged with preserving, protecting, and managing \nour nation's natural resources. At the same time, the amendment \npreserves the prerogative of Congress to approve or disapprove the \nadministration's recommendations prior to making any of these \nadditional funds available.\n  The amendment establishes seven specific criteria to be used by the \nNational Park Service, the Forest Service, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the Bureau of Land Management in assessing proposed \nacquisitions and exchanges:\n  (1) the natural resources located on the land,\n  (2) the degree to which those natural resources are threatened,\n  (3) the length of time required for acquisition of the land,\n  (4) the extent, if any, to which an increase in land cost makes \ntimely completion of the acquisition advisable,\n  (5) the extent of public and local government support for the \nacquisition,\n  (6) the amount of federal lands already in the region, and\n  (7) the total estimated costs of the acquisition.\n  In addition, the amendment permits the Secretaries of Interior and \nAgriculture to consider additional matters in their assessments, but \nthey must explain to Congress in a report what those additional \nconsiderations were and how they were weighted in the prioritization of \nland proposals.\n  Over the years, Congress has wisely taken steps to preserve our \nnatural heritage. We have protected many remarkable natural areas \nthrough the establishment of national parks, monuments, wilderness \nareas, wildlife refuges, national scenic areas, and other conservation \nefforts.\n  While this Nation has no shortage of beautiful country to be \npreserved and protected, there is a limited amount of funding available \nto accomplish these goals. As a result, our Nation has a multibillion \ndollar backlog in land acquisitions at both the Department of Interior \nand the Department of Agriculture. Because of this enormous backlog, I \nsupport the recommendation in this bill to make available an additional \n$700 million for the land acquisitions and exchanges, consistent with \nthe budget agreement.\n  What this amendment would require the administration to do is not \nnew. The agencies already produce these types of rankings when \ndeveloping the President's budget request. The Bureau of Land \nManagement, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, \nand the Forest Service all compose priority based lists. In this case, \nwe will be requiring the agencies to perform the same sort of priority \nassessments on projects that would be funded with these additional \nfunds, to ensure that Congress has all the information necessary to \nreview the administration's proposal.\n  The amendment includes a requirement for the agencies to consider the \nextent of local support for an acquisition proposal, as well as the \namount of land in the area already owned by the Federal Government. \nPreservation of our natural resources is a high priority, but it must \nbe balanced with an awareness of the economic needs of local \ncommunities and their ability to plan for future growth and \ndevelopment. These two criteria will ensure that a community will not \nbe harmed unnecessarily by the removal of preservation lands from its \ntax base or by undue restrictions on development and economic growth.\n  I understand the concerns expressed by the committee in the report \nlanguage about the costs of managing and maintaining current federally \nowned lands, and I believe the agencies should focus on acquisition and \nexchange proposals that would consolidate Federal land holdings and \neliminate inholdings to lessen these costs. However, I think it would \nbe a mistake to fail to consider funding new acquisitions and exchanges \nthat would protect and preserve resources that might otherwise be lost \nto development in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I am very concerned that the committee has earmarked \n$315 million for the additional funding for two specific projects--the \nHeadwaters Forest and New World Mines acquisitions. I am not seeking to \nstrike those earmarks in this amendment, although I understand an \namendment may be offered to do so, which I would support. \nUnfortunately, these earmarks make clear the need for established \ncriteria for prioritizing the many pending acquisition requests at our \nland management agencies. My amendment would ensure that all funds \nwhich are available for pending land acquisitions and exchanges are \nused prudently and for the highest priority projects identified by \nFederal land management agencies.\n\n  Let me stress that I understand the right of Congress to review and \nrevise the President's budget request, as we see fit. My amendment is \nsimply intended to help us make those decisions by requiring input from \nthe Federal land management agencies on the expenditure of the $700 \nmillion we are adding to this appropriations bill for land acquisitions \nand exchanges. Congress will still have the last word.\n  Mr. President, as I stated at the outset, I intend to pursue separate \nlegislation to require the administration to submit annually with the \nbudget request a list of proposed land acquisitions and exchanges, \ncoordinated and prioritized among the four Federal land management \nagencies. The agencies would be required to consider the criteria set \nforth in the amendment described above, and the Secretaries of Interior \nand Agriculture would be required to explain the relative weight given \neach criterion, including additional criteria selected by the \nadministration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment I had \nintended to propose to this legislation be printed in the Record at \nthis point. And I welcome the comments and suggestions of my colleagues \nfor improving these criteria and the process of ensuring that scarce \nresources for land preservation are used prudently.\n  There being no objection, the amendment was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       On page 134, beginning on line 2, strike ``Provided'' and \n     all follows through ``heading'' on line 8 and insert the \n     following: ``Provided'' That the Secretary of the Interior \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture, after consultation with the \n     heads of the National Park Service, the United States Fish \n     and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the \n     Forest Service, shall jointly submit to Congress a report \n     listing the lands and interests in land, in order of \n     priority, that the Secretaries propose for acquisition or \n     exchange using funds provided under this heading; Provided \n     further; That in determining the order of priority, the \n     Secretaries shall consider with respect to each property the \n     following: the natural resources located on the property; the \n     degree to which a natural resource on the property is \n     threatened, the length of time required to consummate the \n     acquisition or exchange; the extent to which an increase in \n     the cost of the property makes timely completion of the \n     acquisition or exchange advisable; the extent of public \n     support for the acquisition or exchange (including support of \n     local governments and members of the public); the total \n     estimated costs associated the acquisition or exchange; the \n     extent of current Federal ownership of property in the \n     region; The extent to which the acquisition or exchange would \n     consolidate Federal holdings or eliminate its holding; the \n     owner's willingness to sell or exchange the property; and \n     such other factors as the Secretaries consider appropriate, \n     which factors shall be described in the report in detail; \n     Provided further, That the report shall describe the relative \n     weight accorded to each such factor in determining the \n     priority of acquisitions and exchanges''.\n       On page 134, line 12, strike ``a project list to be \n     submitted by the Secretary'' and insert ``the report of the \n     Secretaries.''\n\n\n                        gas utilization section\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee would be willing to enter into a colloquy with \nme regarding the gas utilization section of this legislation.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is my understanding that the administration request \nfor gas utilization was $4.8 million dollars.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is also my understanding that the House has added \nan additional $2 million above the administration request; and that the \nSenate has agreed to add $1.5m to the administration request.\n\n[[Page S9610]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is also correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I understand that some of the additional funds \nCongress has added may be used by the Department of Energy to fund an \n$84 million cost-shared private research project for the development of \na process for commercialization of a ceramic membrane used to convert \nnatural gas to synthetic crude which can then be transported via \nconventional oil transportation systems?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I understand that to be correct as well.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee I have taken a keen interest in the development of this \ntechnology. In fact at a committee hearing in July of this year we \ndiscussed some of these developing technologies. One thing that is \nbecoming clear when you talk about natural gas conversion to liquids is \nthat there is ``more than one way to skin a cat.''\n  In other words there seem to be a number of companies around the \nglobe that are developing this technology with their own particular \nnitch. I would not, at this time try to predict which particular \nprocess is going to emerge as the best, nor would I attempt to predict \nwhen this technology will be used on a commercial basis. By some \nindustry accounts this technology is here now. By others it is years \noff.\n\n  Would the chairman agree that it makes sense then to possibly look at \nother methods being used to develop this technology.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would defer to the chairman of the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee and agree that it would make sense to look at other \npotential technologies as well.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Would the chairman seek in conference to try and match \nthe House level of $2 million and try to preserve flexibility for the \nDepartment of Energy to support other cost-sharing projects looking at \nways to convert natural gas to liquids?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I would.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the subcommittee chairman, the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington would also support this?\n  Mr. GORTON. In light of the different technologies brought to my \nattention by the Senators from Alaska, I will indeed be inclined to \nfavor the House funding level in conference if that level will \nfacilitate investigation of alternative technologies while ensuring \nthat the current project moves forward.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will continue to monitor the existing project and \nthank the chairman and subcommittee chairman.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I seek unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy regarding Oklahoma Indian funding with the distinguished \nchairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Gorton.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Oklahoma \nis recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I understand the bill before us contains \nseveral categories of Interior Department funding for Indians, one of \nwhich is the ``new tribes'' account. I also understand that the \ncommittee has included, as requested by the Administration, $160,000 \nfrom this account for the Delaware Tribe of Indians, a tribe located in \neastern Oklahoma. Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from \nWashington, is that correct?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n\n                             Tribal Welfare\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I should like to engage in a discussion \nwith the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee \nabout a provision in this bill that is very important to the Indian \ntribes in my State. The committee report directs the BIA to spend $5 \nmillion from the Tribal Priority Allocation [TPA] to provide funds to \nIndian tribes that wish to run their own welfare programs in States \nwhere the tribal welfare caseload exceeds 50 percent of total caseload.\n  I am very grateful to my colleagues for recognizing the unique \nsituation that exists in my State. More than half of the welfare \ncaseload in South Dakota is made up of native Americans. Poverty on \nSouth Dakota reservations is very high; in the last census poverty \namong the South Dakota tribes was greater than 50 percent. My State has \nthe dubious distinction of having the poorest county in the country, \nand it is a reservation county. Unemployment is also very high. For the \nlargest tribes, it was 44 percent in 1995. The number of native \nAmericans in the potential labor force who are not working averages 68 \npercent and, on some reservations, is as high as 95 percent.\n  The native Americans in my State do not want to be dependent on \nwelfare. Representatives for the tribes have talked extensively with me \nabout how they want to build their economies and help their people find \ngood jobs. They dream of the day when all native American people will \nhave the opportunity to hold good jobs and have the satisfaction of \ncontributing to the economic strength of their communities.\n  For a number of complex reasons, this has been a difficult dream to \naccomplish. While they are working to improve their economies, they \nalso want to assume the responsibility and use the option that is \ngranted in the welfare bill to run their own welfare programs. They \nbelieve it is a matter of sovereignty, indeed even a treaty matter, \nthat they enter into this new relationship with the Federal Government \nin a way that is parallel to how the States are treated. They do not \nwant to be dependent upon the State. So they have asked for this \nfunding to make it possible for them to take over their welfare \nprograms and have a fair chance of succeeding in making their people's \nlives a little better.\n  That is why I feel this provision is so important, and why I want to \nmake sure it gives them the best chance at success. For this reason, I \nwould like to ask my colleagues a few questions.\n  As noted, the committee report indicates that $5 million would be \nprovided under the Tribal Priorities Allocation to Indian tribes in \nStates where the Indian welfare caseload exceeds 50 percent that wish \nto run their own welfare programs, and that the funds can be expended \nover a 2-year period. Is that also the chairman's understanding?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I would tell my colleague that, yes, the \nTPA account is authorized to expend funds for 2 years.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I mentioned that the tribes in my State \nhave indicated that they would like to run their own programs, but it \nis possible that some will decide it is not feasible for them to do so. \nThe way this proposal is currently structured, if this happens, I would \nwant to make sure that any unused funds revert to the TPA, and not the \nU.S. Treasury. Is it the committee's intent that, if all of the funds \nare not used 60 days prior to when they would otherwise lapse, they \nwould then revert to the TPA fund to be allocated according to the \nprogram's formula?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that, because these \nfunds are expended as part of the TPA account, any unused funds would \nrevert to the other uses of the TPA account. We would support allowing \nthis to happen 60 days prior to the end of the fiscal year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am in agreement with the subcommittee \nchairman. Such an arrangement would ensure that any funds not expended \nfor this welfare initiative would be used for other TPA priorities.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I would like to raise a technical detail \nthat is not addressed in the report language. One of the tribes in \nSouth Dakota, the Standing Rock Tribe, also extends into North Dakota. \nIt was my intention that, if that tribe chooses to submit a plan to run \nits own welfare program, the funds be available to run their program in \nboth North and South Dakota, and that the match for the tribal members \nin North Dakota be proportionate to the match that Standing Rock would \nhave received from their State. I should note that the amount of \nfunding is sufficient to allow Standing Rock to serve both its North \nand South Dakota members. Would the chairman and ranking member agree \nthat this would be possible under this provision?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I believe that could be accommodated under \nthe committee's language and would be happy to work with the Senator to \nmake sure this is the case.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, if the chairman and ranking member would \ncontinue to indulge me, I would like to clarify one more technical \npoint. The\n\n[[Page S9611]]\n\nreport language says that the funds would be available to tribes whose \ncaseloads exceed 50 percent of the total welfare caseload for the \nState. In point of fact, the tribes per se do not have caseloads, the \nStates currently run the programs. My hope is that the chairman \nintended to indicate that funds would be provided in States where \nnative Americans exceed 50 percent of a State's total caseload using \ndata collected by the Administration for Children and Families at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services in fiscal year 1995. Was that, \nin fact, the committee's intent?\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, yes, the intention was that the funds be \nprovided to tribes in a State where the number of native Americans as a \npercent of total State caseload exceeded 50 percent in fiscal year \n1995.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have one last question. As the Senators \non this committee are painfully aware, allocating discretionary \nspending in times of major budget cutting has resulted in many \ndifficult decisions. But, I would point out that the TPA account, which \nis the one from which this funding would be taken, was cut fairly \nheavily earlier in the 1990's and is only now starting to regain some \nof its resources. At the same time, the need among many of the tribes \nhas been growing steadily. Indeed, many parts of Indian Country have \nnot always shared in the economic boom that the rest of the Nation \ncurrently enjoys. I would like to ask my colleagues whether they might \nbe willing to find an alternative offset, one which does not take away \nresources from other tribes, in order to find this important provision. \nI am, of course, aware that the increase requested by the President for \nTPA included in this budget, as well as funding for this provision. \nWould my colleagues be willing to work with me during conference to try \nto find an alternative means of providing these funds?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Democratic leader clearly understands \nthe difficult problems we face in allocating limited resources for the \nprograms in our jurisdiction that are important for many of the Members \nof this body. However, we would certainly be willing to work with him \nduring conference to see whether alternative funds might be available.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I express my sincere gratitude to the \nchairman and ranking member of the Interior subcommittee for their \nassistance in this matter. Last year's welfare reform bill provides an \nimportant opportunity for Indian tribes to run their own welfare \nprograms. As I have said, I have met with representatives of all of the \ntribes in my State about this issue, and they care very deeply about \nit. I hope that, with these funds, they will be able to take on this \nimportant responsibility and help tribal members gain economic self-\nsufficiency.\n\n\n  CONTAMINATED DRINKING WATER ON THE FORT HALL INDIAN RESERVATION OF \n                                 IDAHO\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, will the Chairman yield for purposes of a \ncolloquy?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am happy to enter into a colloquy with the Senators \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I do not know if the Chairman is familiar with the problem \nfaced by the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe of Idaho regarding the \ncontamination of the groundwater on the Fort Hall Reservation where the \nTribe is located?\n  Mr. Gorton. I am.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Then the Chairman knows that since the 1970's a deadly \npoison named ethylene dibromide, or EDB, has been used as a pesticide \non the reservation. Over time, EDB has leached into the groundwater at \nunsafe levels. Currently, approximately 1,500 people, both on and off \nthe Fort Hall Reservation, are at risk. Most of those living on the \nreservation are served by one of two existing drinking water systems--\none operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the other by Indian \nHealth Service.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. Nothing is more important than ensuring all of our \ncitizens have safe and affordable supply of drinking water. Over the \nlast 6 years, both agencies have been very helpful. The Indian Health \nService has provided technical assistance and funding to characterize \nthe groundwater contamination and to investigate alternatives. Its \nefforts have included the drilling and testing of wells, conducting \nTribal meetings, providing educational material, and assisting in \nFederal coordination. In addition, the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe, Idaho \nDepartment of Environmental Quality, Environmental Protection Agency, \nBureau of Reclamation, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Indian Health Service, \nand others have devoted an enormous effort over several years to assess \nthe situation and develop alternative solutions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I would also like to bring to the Chairman's attention \nthat the Bureau of Reclamation has prepared a needs assessment on the \nEDB problem. This assessment concluded that the preferred alternative \nis the incorporation of the existing Indian Health Service water supply \nsystem into a new, larger drinking water system. Such a project would \ninvolve the drilling of new public wells outside the contaminated area \nand piping the water to the residents whose wells are unsafe.\n  Mr. GORTON. It would appear that such a recommendation would be a \nreasonable approach to provide for the delivery of safe drinking water \nto the 1,500 people currently at risk.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I agree with the Chairman. The recommendation \noutlined by the Bureau of Reclamation is the most logical and cost-\neffective alternative.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Of course such a project would be expensive. However, this \nburden would be spread out over the several agencies from all levels of \nGovernment which would share responsibility for its completion. The \nIndian Health Service already has identified and suggested several \nareas where it might be of assistance during the education, public \ninvolvement, and coordination phase. These include providing further \neducational assistance and public information materials, the \ninvestigation of alternative water sources, assistance in the selection \nand implementation of appropriate treatment technologies, the design of \nground water monitoring plans and schedules, and the coordination and \nsharing of data and analysis.\n  Mr. GORTON. Along with the other Federal agencies involved in the \nactual construction of the drinking water system, I would agree that \nthe Indian Health Service clearly has a role in the education and \nadvisement of the affected community, so long as the Service meets its \npriorities and other obligations.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I agree with the Chairman. Of course, we understand \nthat funding for this project cannot be guaranteed, given the many \ncompeting priorities faced by the Indian Health Service.\n  Mr. GORTON. Given the threat to the health of those exposed to the \ncontaminated drinking water, I would support whatever assistance the \nService could provide.\n  Mr. KEMPTHORNE. I thank the Chairman and am pleased to hear of his \nstrong support of this project.\n  Mr. CRAIG. I too would like to thank the Chairman. Seeing this \nproject started as quickly as possible has become a high priority for \nmyself and my fellow Idahoans. We are committed to getting this project \ncompleted and will be working over the coming months and years to see \nthat all necessary funds are appropriated for the project's \nconstruction. Beginning the education phase now, through the Indian \nHealth Service, will save valuable time and help relieve the threat of \ncontinued harm.\n\n\n          fossil energy r account: Coal mine methane program\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Senator Rockefeller and I would like to \nengage the manager of the Interior Appropriations bill in a brief \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be pleased to respond to my friend who is the \nranking member on the subcommittee and to his colleague from West \nVirginia, Senator Rockefeller.\n  Mr. BYRD. The committee's recommendation does not fund the \nadministration's $963,000 request for the Coal Mine Methane Program \nunder the Fossil Energy account. I believe that the House also declined \nto fund this program based on the belief that it was a ``new start.''\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I appreciate the fiscal constraints facing this bill and \nthe difficult task that our chairman has accomplished in a fair and \nbipartisan manner. However, I would hope that we could take a second \nlook at this methane recovery program.\n\n[[Page S9612]]\n\n  Mr. President, this program is not a new start as the House committee \nreport suggests. Congress appropriated money specifically for the Coal \nMine Methane Program in fiscal year 1995. Some of the funds for this \ninitiative were obligated prior to the rescission bill enacted in 1995. \nWhile the Department may have gotten off to a slow start with this \nprogram, for the past 18 months it has had five teams under contract to \nprepare phase II detailed project designs. The original appropriation \nto initiate these projects has been exhausted, and the funds requested \nfor fiscal year 1988 are necessary to complete the ongoing project \ndesigns. I am told that the five teams have provided costsharing in \nexcess of thirty percent.\n  The Department of Energy has indicated that the Coal Mine Methane \nProgram can make a significant contribution to the effort to curtail \ngreenhouse gases and estimates that within five years coal mine methane \ncollection and utilization systems could reduce emissions by an amount \nequivalent to 5.5 million tons of carbon dioxide [CO2] each \nyear. The Department's research is expected to demonstrate that the \nprivate sector can, remarkably, generate profit by utilizing and \ndestroying these waste gases. Given the large, cost-effective and near-\nterm potential of this research, the Department has proposed the Coal \nMine Methane program as one of its global climate change research \ninitiatives.\n  As the sponsor of Senate Resolution 98, I am clearly on the record in \nopposition to any binding international greenhouse gas emissions \nagreement that would injure the American economy or put us at a \ncompetitive disadvantage with any other countries. At the same time, I \nstrongly believe that we in Congress should promote the development and \nuse of technologies that can become economically competitive energy \nsources and which, at the same time, reduce potential greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  The Coal Mine Methane program clearly meets these standards. Turning \npollution into useful energy at a competitive price, with no subsidies \nand no new regulation, can be good for electric consumers, good for the \nenvironment and good for America, in general.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I completely agree with the comments \nof my senior Senator. I would note that three of the five teams under \ncontracts to the Department of Energy are working on projects in our \nState of West Virginia. I understand that the other two are located in \nAlabama and Ohio.\n  These five projects offer great promise compared to conventional \ngreenhouse gas mitigation efforts. A single, small coal mine methane \nproject designed to produce 10 megawatts of electricity is expected to \noperate at a profit. That same project would unequivocally produce \ncollateral greenhouse gas mitigation benefits equal to the carbon \nsequestered by approximately 14 million trees. In sharp contrast to the \nprofit generated by the coal mine methane project, tree planting would \ncome at a cost conservatively estimated at $18 million. So, DOE's \nmethane capture program makes dollars and sense.\n  This program is relatively small in terms of Federal cost but can \nleverage significant private sector investment and may generate \nconsiderable economic and environmental benefits for Americans living \nin the Appalachian coal regions. I hope that we may reconsider the \nrecommendation on this particular program.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, the Senators make a compelling case.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman. In that light, \nI inquire whether he would have any objection if the Department were to \nshift up to $500,000 to continue the Coal Mine Methane Program.\n  Mr. GORTON. As the Senator may know, the reprogramming threshold \nestablished by the committee's guidelines is $500,000. I do appreciate \nthe clarification that this effort would not be a new start. Should the \nDepartment be able to identify funds for a reprogramming, it should \nconsider the needs associated with completing the ongoing project \ndesigns.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I thank the manager of the bill for \nhis consideration and support of this matter.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I offer my appreciation as well. As always, \nthe Senator from Washington has been most fair in this deliberation.\n\n\n    engineering related services utilized by department of interior \n                                agencies\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to raise an issue with the \nChairman as we conclude the debate on the Interior Appropriations bill. \nI had intended offered an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators \nThomas and Murkowski to instruct the various agencies of the Department \nof the Interior to prepare a report to the committee regarding the \ninstances in which they have entered into InterAgency Service \nAgreements with other Federal agencies or into agreements with State \nand local governments on foreign entities. Unfortunately, we have been \nunable to reach agreement among members of the committee on the \nfeasibility and scope of this amendment. I am disappointed with this \ndevelopment and I will not offer this amendment this evening.\n  As the Chairman well knows, there are a number of architectural, \nengineering, geological mapping and even aircraft services that are \ncontracted out by the various agencies within the Department of the \nInterior. I simply would like to get a sense of the impact on private \nengineering and consulting firms when agencies enter into agreements or \ncontract for services within. I believe the information would have been \nvaluable to the committee. It would help the committee recognize \nopportunities to save money by using the private sector more often and \nit will help redirect agencies toward their core governmental missions. \nWhile I will not offer this amendment, I intend to continue to pursue \nthis information. I ask the Chairman if he would be also be interested \nin exploring this issue further?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Utah raises a good point. But given our \nvery short timeframe, I appreciate the Senator's decision to withhold. \nThe information to be gathered by any such inquiry would be very costly \nand time-consuming to develop, so I would hope that a more focused \neffort could be considered. The Senator is correct that cost-saving \nmeasures are important during tight budget times, and I appreciate his \ninterest in this matter.\n\n\n                  needed repairs to twin reservoir dam\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a \ncolloquy to bring to his attention the need for repairs to the Twin \nReservoir Dam located near Polson, MT.\n  Mr. GORTON. Certainly.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The dam is in need of $50,000 in repairs, and I would \nlike to know if the Chairman would support the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nif the BIA could allocate funds within existing resources to make these \nmuch-needed repairs.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would support whatever assistance the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs could devote to repairs of the Twin Reservoir Dam, so long as \nthe expenditure of any funds is consistent with the Bureau's \npriorities.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chairman.\n\n\n                        electrochromic research\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we would like to engage our dear friend, \nSenator Gorton, in a colloquy. He has once again drafted a difficult \nbill this year and has balanced difficult priorities. Within the energy \nconservation section of the bill, the committee has provided $500,000 \nmore than in fiscal year 1997 for electrochromic research within the \nbuilding equipment and materials section. We would hope that it is the \nexpectation of the chairman that this $500,000 increase will be used to \nfurther the development of Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition \n[PECVD] techniques for electrochromic technology.\n  Mr. MACK. Understand that this technology provides a flexible means \nto control the amount of light and heat that passes through a glass \nsurface. This is a superb energy savings opportunity important to the \nNation.\n  In recognition of the importance of this technology, Florida has \nprovided $1.2 million in State funds to develop this technology in \ncooperation with the University of South Florida and a licensee of a \ntechnology developed by the National Renewable Laboratory in Colorado.\n  Is it the Chairman's understanding that the Committee intends that \nthis project be a priority for the use of this $500,000 addition?\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate my colleagues bringing this technology to my\n\n[[Page S9613]]\n\nattention. It is indeed a promising technology that could produce \nsubstantial energy savings. Within the increase provided for \nelectrochromic research, I hope the Department will consider supporting \nthe PECVD project, provided this can be accomplished without a \nsubstantially adverse impact on ongoing projects in the electrochromic \nprogram. I further hope the Department will consider PECVD in \nformulating its FY 1999 budget request.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I concur with the subcommittee chairman's \nassessment. DOE should evaluate the potential benefits of this \ntechnology when considering its allocation of fiscal year 1998 funds.\n\n\n                              ihs funding\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I wish to inquire of my colleague from \nWashington State, Senator Gorton, chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, on the funding status of health facility \nconstruction projects within the Indian Health Service that are in the \ndesign and engineering phase. Prior to the 1998 appropriations process, \nthe Congress had funded about two-thirds of the design and engineering \nwork that is necessary prior to begin construction of the new Winnebago \nHospital. This hospital, now over 70 years old, serves the Indian \npeople in northeast Nebraska and northwest Iowa. The Indian Health \nService has indicated that another $650,000 will be needed to complete \nthe design phase. Does Senator Gorton share my understanding of this \nsituation?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, the Senator from Nebraska is correct as to this \nfunding shortfall. In addition, there are two other nonhospital \nfacilities in Arizona for which appropriated design funds have not been \nsufficient. The administration's fiscal year 1998 budget did not \nrequest design funds for these facilities either. This lack of a \nfunding request has meant that neither the House nor the Senate has \nincluded funds necessary to complete the design phase for the Winnebago \nHospital.\n  Mr. KERREY. I thank Senator Gorton for bringing this matter to the \nattention of the Senate. It is an incredible slip on the part of the \nIHS to have neglected to request these needed funds. It appears that in \nprevious years the IHS seriously underestimated the amount of funding \nthat would be required to complete the design phase of this facility. \nThis is why it is so puzzling that there was no request for additional \nfunding in this budget year. Every delay in funding means increased \nproject costs. My question to Senator Gorton and to Ranking Member Byrd \nis whether it is still possible for the Congress to find some funds in \nthis appropriations measure to be sure these projects stay on track?\n  Mr. GORTON. It is my understanding that a total of $2.1 million would \nbe needed to complete the design phase for the three projects. There \nsimply is not that leeway in the measure we are considering today. \nHowever, should funds become available as a result of conference \nagreements with the House, I will try to see that they are made \navailable for completion of the design phase of the three projects if \nthat is agreeable to my colleague, Senator Byrd.\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, Mr. President, at this point I think that this is the \nbest commitment that we can make to our colleagues from Nebraska and \nArizona. If we are not able to accomplish this, however, we can \nconsider including conference report language directing the IHS to \ninclude funding requests in the fiscal year 1999 budget to complete the \ndesign phase for these facilities; funding requests to begin first \nphase construction of these facilities might also be appropriate.\n  Mr. KERREY. I am very pleased that my colleagues are as concerned as \nI am about meeting the health needs of our native American people. As I \nmentioned earlier, the existing IHS facility at Winnebago is over 70 \nyears old and I would venture to comment that there are probably not \nvery many full-service hospitals in this country serving non-Indians \nthat have reached that not-so-venerable age. It is a shame and the \nshame rests mostly with the failure of the United States to fulfill its \nobligations to this country's first Americans.\n\n\n                  the land and water conservation fund\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wanted to clarify with the \nsubcommittee chairman and the ranking member the process, as described \non page 116 in the Senate Committee Report on the Interior \nAppropriations bill (S. Report 105-56), for the expenditure of land and \nwater conservation fund dollars provided in this legislation. Is this \nSenator correct in his understanding, Mr. Chairman, that the committee \nintends to work with the Appropriations Committee in the other body and \nthe administration to develop a list of projects to be funded with the \nremainder of $700 million in land and water conservation fund moneys \nthat are not allocated in this legislation for either specific Federal \nprojects or for the States?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes, the Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Is it the case that the administration will begin \ndeveloping this list as soon as possible?\n  Mr. GORTON. Again, the Senator is correct. After the list is \ndeveloped it will be provided to the Senate Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee and the relevant subcommittee in the other body for their \nreview and approval.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Does the Senator feel that it would be appropriate for \nSenators to contact Interior line agencies if they are aware of \nprojects they believe are meritorious, such as the Fish and Wildlife \nService's proposed Whittlesey Creek National Wildlife Refuge in my home \nState of Wisconsin?\n  Mr. GORTON. The Senator from Wisconsin is correct, and indeed, \nSenators are contacting appropriate Interior line agencies to make them \naware of projects as well as officials within the administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Does the senior Senator from West Virginia concur with \nthe Senator from Washington and myself?\n  Mr. BYRD. I do, and I thank the Senator for seeking additional \nclarification. It is common practice for Senators to assist Interior \nagencies by bringing particular projects to their attention so that the \nagencies may have the benefit of evaluating these projects for \npotential inclusion on the list.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first I would like to thank the managers \nof the bill for their hard work in putting forth legislation which \nprovides necessary funding for many things from National Parks to the \nBureau of Mines. The Interior Appropriations bill is the 12th of the 13 \nappropriations bills to come before the Senate this year.\n  Unfortunately, once again, this bill and the report language \naccompanying it contain numerous earmarks and pork barrel spending \nprojects.

Some of the earmarked projects funded in this bill have \nmerit--I do not dispute that. What I do object to is the process by \nwhich these funds are appropriated. Earmarking Federal tax dollars is a \nprocess which can no longer be tolerated in these times of fiscal \nrestraint.\n  It is unfair to the American taxpayer that we allow this to continue. \nIt is not right that we require the American taxpayer to foot the bill \nfor landscape architects to ``maintain a visually pleasing forest'' in \nthe Wayne National Forest in Ohio as this bill dictates. Why is it \nnecessary to have hard working Americans pay nearly $2 million for the \nredevelopment of a fire operations center in Billings, MT?\n  As I stated previously, Mr. President, these projects may have merit \nand may be very important--but how do we know that? Have they ever had \na hearing? Have these projects ever been competitively bid? The answer, \nsadly, is no.\n  Mr. President, I will not take any more of the Senate's time voicing \nmy objections. I will close by saying that I truly hope we can bring an \nend to the practice of earmarking funds in the appropriations process. \nThe American taxpayer deserves better than the wasteful spending that \nwe have seen in these twelve appropriations bills.\n\n\n                    u.s. mand and biosphere program\n\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to \nengage Senator Gorton in a discussion of the U.S. Man and the Biosphere \nProgram. As the Senator is aware, the House of Representatives, by a \nvote of 222 to 203, on July 15, 1997 passed the appropriations bill for \nthe Department of the Interior. Included as part of that legislation \nwas an amendment which prohibits funding for the U.S. Man and Biosphere \nProgram. Although a similar provision has not been included as part of \nthe Senate deliberations on this appropriation, I offer the following \nargument for its inclusion in the upcoming conference between the House \nand Senate.\n  Many of my colleagues may question exactly what the U.S. Man and the \nBiosphere Program is. After all you will not find it mentioned in any \nline item within this bill, nor will you find it housed in any of the \nagencies which receive appropriations under this bill. The U.S. Man and \nthe Biosphere Program or USMAB operates through the State Department \nand under the guidance of the United Nations Educational and Scientific \nOrganization [UNESCO] to designate tracts of American land as biosphere \nreserves. These areas are ``voluntarily'' subject to land management \nrequirements designated to facilitate ecological research and \npreservation. Currently, there are 47 biospheres in the United States \ncovering a land area approximately the size of Colorado, our eighth \nlargest state. Some biospheres, such as the Land Between the Lakes \nBiosphere in Kentucky, include populated areas with over 484,000 \nresidents.\n  Despite the size and breadth of this program it has never been \nauthorized by Congress, yet it is still 100% taxpayer funded. It is \nsupported through interagency transfers from a total of thirteen \ndifferent agencies. Collectively, these agencies contributed $210,000 \nto the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program in Fiscal Year 1997.\n  While the total value associated with this program may fly well below \nmany of our radar screens, the question and problems associated with \nthe U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program are very real and very much in \nthe minds of our constituents.\n  While I was serving in the House, some of my constituents brought to \nmy attention a proposal by the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program to \ncreate the Ozark Man and the Biosphere Cooperative, which would have \nencompassed part of my home state of Arkansas as well as part of the \nstates of Kansas, Missouri, and Oklahoma. As I began to investigate \nthis proposal some of the very worst fears of my constituents were \nconfirmed. The ``voluntary, honorary'' land designation represented a \npotential threat to the private property rights of my constituents. For \nexample, on page 120 of the Feasibility Study for the Ozark Man and the \nBiosphere appeared the following statement, ``Normally, there is no \nneed for change in land-holding or regulation following the designation \nof a biosphere reserve except where changes are required to ensure the \nstrict protection of the core area or specific research sites.''\n  Perhaps what was even more frightening was this biosphere was being \ncreated in secret. The steering committee responsible for attempting to \ncreate the Ozark biosphere admitted in their feasibility study that \nthey ``decided that public meetings would not be part of the interview \nprocess because such meetings tend to polarize views of the public and \nmay capture negative attention from the press.'' (Page 43 of the \nFeasibility study)\n\n  Many individuals will undoubtedly wonder how this was possible. Under \nwhat legislative authority did the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program \nundertake these initiatives? The answer is that there is no legislative \nauthority. Congress has never passed any law creating the U.S. Man and \nthe Biosphere Program authorizing them to engage in their activities. \nEven the web page for the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program admits \nthat ``No specific law exists for the U.S. Man and the Biosphere \nProgram.''\n  Proponents of this program will undoubtedly assert that my experience \nwas an isolated incident, and it was for the very reasons I cited that \nthe area around the Ozarks was never finally designated a Biosphere \nReserve. However, I would urge these individuals to look at the \ntestimony presented before the House Resources Committee this year, \nwhere local officials repeatedly testified that they were never \nconsulted about proposals to create biosphere reserves in their areas. \nI would encourage the proponents of this program to look to the Alaska \nand Colorado State Legislatures and the Kentucky State Senate, all of \nwhich passed resolutions opposing the U.S. Man and the Biosphere \nProgram, despite the fact that there are currently three biospheres in \nAlaska, four in Colorado, and two in Kentucky. To date, the U.S. Man \nand the Biosphere Program has taken no action to address the concerns \nof these State and local officials.\n  This is not to say that the U.S. Man and the Biosphere Program has \nnot produced some positive contributions to our understanding of the \nenvironment and mans relationship to it. However, until my questions, \nthe questions, of my constituents, the questions of the State \nLegislatures, and the questions of many of our colleagues are answered, \nI in good conscience cannot support using one more tax dollar in \nsupport of this program.\n  It is for these above stated reasons that I ask that the House \nadopted language be included in the Conference report.\n  I thank Senator Gorton, for the opportunity to present this very \nimportant issue for Conference consideration.\n  Mr. GORTON. I appreciate the Senator from Arkansas bringing his \nconcerns to my attention, and they will\n\n[[Page S9616]]\n\nhave considerable weight with me when the House presents its position \nin Conference.\n\n\n                Use of BIA Funds for Marty Indian School\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, first let me thank the distinguished \nChairman of the Subcommittee, Senator Gorton, and the distinguished \nranking Democrat, Senator Byrd, for their leadership and hard work on \nthis legislation. I appreciate their willingness to work with me and \nSenator Johnson to provide greatly needed assistance to the Marty \nIndian School in our state.\n  In the past, the Marty School has received funds sufficient to \nreplace its decaying high school facility. However, the elementary \nschool is 70 years old and is in serious need of immediate repairs. The \nfacility is not suitable to serve the educational needs of its students \nsafely. Recently, a piece of the ceiling in one of the elementary \nschool's buildings crashed onto the desk of a young student. \nFortunately, there were no injuries. However, the serious physical \nproblems at the school continue to pose a significant threat to its \nstudents. It is clear that eventually the entire elementary school will \nneed to be replaced.\n  Senator Johnson and I would like to ask if it is the intent of the \ncommittee that the report language that refers to the Marty Indian \nSchool, found on page 55 of the Committee Report, gives direction to \nthe Bureau of Indian Affairs to assess the serious structural \ndeficiencies, particularly those that could compromise the health and \nsafety of the elementary school students, and to endeavor to provide \nfunds from the emergency or minor repair programs of the Facility \nImprovement and Repair program to correct these problems at the \nearliest possible date?\n  Mr. GORTON. That is the committee's intention to the extent high \npriority requirements are identified and prioritized.\n  Mr. BYRD. That is my understanding.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank you for adding that language to the report. \nWhile we are delighted that these emergency repairs will be made if \nidentified as a priority, we wish to note that the BIA has determined \nthat the entire Marty facility needs to be replaced because it is no \nlonger economically feasible merely to shore up these very old \nstructures. Senator Daschle and I are delighted that the replacement \nhigh school is now being constructed. However, before long the \nelementary school facilities must also be replaced. I recognize the \nshortage of Facilities Improvement and Repair funds. Senator Daschle \nand I would like to work with the committee and the BIA to place the \nMarty Indian School elementary school on the priority list for future \nreplacement funds when that list is opened up.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Again, I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member and look \nforward to working with you on this issue. I am proud of the Marty \nIndian School. Under the leadership of School Board President, Mike \nRedlightning, and past President Robert Cournoyer and the other Board \nMembers, the school has a wonderful working relationship with the \nYankton Sioux Tribal Council. Support for the Marty Indian School \nindeed is strong among the Yankton Sioux people.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member \nand ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a brief history \nof the Marty Indian School that has served the Yankton Sioux people of \nthe Marty area so well for so long.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        The Marty Indian School\n\n\n                     school background and history\n\n       Marty Indian School is owned and operated by the Yankton \n     Sioux Tribe. The Marty Indian School is a legal entity of the \n     Yankton Sioux Tribal Business and Claims Committee and is \n     authorized to operate, maintain and administer Marty's \n     educational programs on behalf of the Yankton Sioux Tribe. \n     The school is located on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in \n     southeast South Dakota near the South Dakota/Nebraska border \n     four miles east of the Missouri River and 13 miles southwest \n     of Wagner, South Dakota. The original Yankton Sioux Nation \n     consisted of about two thirds of the portion of South Dakota \n     lying east of the Missouri River. The original reservation \n     consisted of 400,000 acres established by the treaty of 1858. \n     Tribal enrollment for both on and off reservation Yanktons is \n     over 7,000. Marty Indian School serves Students in grades K-\n     12 in their Instructional programs. The school also operates \n     a dormitory program for students in grades 6-12. Of the 796 \n     school age children living on the reservation in 1994-1995, \n     290 or 38.94% of those children attended Marty Indian School. \n     The remaining students attending The Wagner and Lake Andes \n     public schools.\n       Marty Indian School, formerly known as St. Paul's Indian \n     Mission, began in 1926 by a missionary priest from Indiana, \n     Father Sylvester Eisenmann, O.S.B. The leaders of the Yankton \n     Dakota people wanted formal education for their children \n     because they realized that change was coming for the Yankton \n     Tribe. In April, 1921, three of these leaders, Thunder Horse, \n     Edward Yellow Bird, and David Zephier made their trek to St. \n     Meinrad Abby in southern Indiana to request that Father \n     Sylvester be assigned as the permanent missionary on their \n     reservation. They camped on the lawn of the Abby until the \n     abbot agreed to their plea.\n       When Father Sylvester first came to the present site of \n     Marty Indian School, he built a two story school building and \n     a chapel. He named the mission after Martin Marty, the first \n     South Dakota Roman Catholic Bishop. Osotewin--Smoke Woman--\n     (to become know as Grandma White Tallow) donated the land for \n     the new school and the farms needed to support it. The school \n     was built building after building as the demand for space \n     grew and funds were collected. Since its inception, through \n     the labor of many devoted workers, Marty Indian School's \n     campus has grown to include twenty-seven buildings on thirty \n     beautifully landscaped acres.\n       In its early days, the students learned a great deal from \n     doing. During various construction phases, the students \n     worked on the building projects for half of the day, and went \n     to school the other half. There was a shoe shop on the \n     campus, a printing shop where the bilingual newspaper was \n     published, and the school ran a farming operation.\n       In March 1975, the ownership of Marty Indian School was \n     transferred to the Yankton Sioux Tribe from the Benedictine \n     Fathers of Blue Cloud Abby. Since that time, the school has \n     been operated by the Marty Indian School Board of Education. \n     Marty has continuously maintained full academic accreditation \n     with exemplary ratings from the State of South Dakota \n     Department of Education.\n       In the fall of 1994, Marty entered the Effective Schools \n     Program. Since that time a new mission statement has been \n     adopted which involves parents and staff. A comprehensive \n     survey was completed. In-service training has been held on \n     learning styles and teaching strategies. An in-service \n     concerning centering on the issue of restructuring the school \n     was held for all teaching and dorm staff in August of \n     1995. A curriculum committee consisting of representatives \n     from the community, tribal education office, \n     administration and teaching staff has been meeting for two \n     years to make curriculum more relevant to students and \n     increase student learning. This last year a Tribal \n     Education Code was adopted by the Yankton Sioux Tribe.\n       In 1995, the Tribe was presented with the Lyle Richards \n     Memorial Award for exemplary service to Indian children by \n     the South Dakota Indian Education Association. Two middle \n     teacher, Carrie Ackerman-Rice and Cynthia Goter, were named \n     Middle school teachers of the year. Dorothy Kiyukan, the \n     Intensive Residential Guidance Program Director, was named \n     National and State Indian Educator of the year in 1994. Karen \n     White Horse was honored as Home Living Specialist of the Year \n     in 1991 by the National Indian School Board Association.\n       For the last year, the SET Team (School Effectiveness \n     Team), and Curriculum Committee have been gathering data to \n     assess the direction of the school. The school plans to break \n     ground on a new educational building in the spring of 1996. \n     Plans include incorporation of the latest state-of-the-art \n     technology. Many curriculum changes are needed as the school \n     moves from text based curriculum to outcome based education, \n     with academic and behavioral objectives.\n\n\n                         educational philosophy\n\n       The educational philosophy of the Marty Indian School has \n     evolved since its inception. The school was founded because \n     the community leaders wanted education for their children to \n     prepare for the changes which they saw coming. The current \n     leaders of the school recognize the acceleration of change in \n     the world in which they live, and hold to the original basic \n     tenet of the founders--the education of their youth is vital \n     to the future of their culture and way of life.\n\n\n                           mission statement\n\n       The Mission of the Marty Indian School, in partnership with \n     the Yankton Sioux Tribe and its communities, is to offer a \n     safe supportive environment: to provide intellectual, social, \n     and cultural values needed to prepare our students for a \n     multi-cultural Circle of Life; and to instill self discipline \n     and respect for self and others.\n\n\n                               education\n\n       We believe that Marty should serve the educational needs of \n     all students. The educational needs of the students include \n     self-development in spiritual and moral values, in \n     intellectual insight, emotional stability, effective human \n     relations, and physical fitness. A special need of Marty \n     students is the awareness, understanding, appreciation and \n     enrichment of their nature culture, and being free of alcohol \n     and other drugs.\n\n[[Page S9617]]\n\n       We believe that Marty should serve the educational needs of \n     the adult Indians in the area and encourage community \n     involvement in the educational opportunities available at \n     Marty. It is our philosophy that Marty is the educational \n     center for the Yankton Sioux Reservation. We believe that \n     true education on any level is the instilling of the desire \n     for continued learning through the development of a healthy \n     curiosity, active interest, and enlivened ambition.\n\n\n                                STUDENTS\n\n       It is the philosophy of Marty to provide a safe and secure \n     learning and living environment to Marty students K-12. The \n     objectives are: To assume full responsibility for all \n     students--including their conduct, safety and presence--\n     during the time they are in attendance, in class or residing \n     in the dormitories; and to provide accountability standards \n     by establishing and enforcing adequate student check out \n     procedures.\n\n\n                               COMMUNITY\n\n       It is the responsibility of Marty that the operation of \n     Marty is the responsibility of the Indian people themselves. \n     We believe that the successful operation of Marty depends on \n     the quality of service and the dedication of the people who \n     administer the various programs at Marty. We also believe \n     that Marty is the social service center the people of the \n     area, and the facilities and personnel of Marty are valuable \n     resources for effective educational projects and human \n     relations program.\n       Objectives for the betterment of student dormitory life \n     are: to provide training programs to the dormitory staff by \n     developing a regular course of instruction and a \n     comprehensive in-service schedule in which each staff member \n     will learn the necessary techniques in providing a safe \n     domiciliary environment.\n\n\n                            SCHOOL COMMUNITY\n\n       Marty has as its goal the total education of its students \n     at Marty and the self-improvement of the people in the local \n     area. In order to accomplish this goal, objectives are \n     delineated in regard to education: Marty will maintain an \n     accredited school for grades K-12. As facilities and staff \n     are available, the specific needs of Indian students will be \n     served.\n\n\n                          nps gateways funding\n\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished \nmanager of the bill in a colloquy concerning the funding for National \nPark Service natural programs and the Rivers and Trails Conservation \nAssistance Program.\n  It is my understanding that the FY 98 Interior Appropriations Bill \nprovides an increase of $1 million for the RTCA program, and that the \nCommittee has directed that this increase be specifically applied to \nactivities within the scope of the existing program, not to new \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In FY 97, the committee provided $200,000 from the RTCA \naccount for the National Park Service's Chesapeake Bay Program Office \nto implement its Chesapeake Bay Action Agenda. The Committee's support \nenhanced NPS's ability to provide important financial and technical \nassistance to communities and organizations implementing their \nwatershed protection, heritage area or heritage tourism strategic \nplans. These projects are terrific examples of community-led \nconservation, interpretation and preservation efforts that complement \nother Chesapeake Bay Program activities and illustrate NPS's unique \nrole as a formal participant in the Bay Program.\n  I note in the Committee report that a number of worthy projects have \nbeen mentioned as deserving of continued funding from this program. I \nwould ask the Senator whether NPS Chesapeake Bay Program Office \nactivities would also qualify as a continuing project to receive \nfunding from RTCA.\n  Mr. GORTON. Most certainly--The project the Senator describes appears \nto be a good example of the type of work intended to be funded with the \nadditional funding provided by the Committee.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I share the Chairman's observations and \nencourage the National Park Service to continue its support of this \neffort.\n\n\n                         blue pike study (Usgs)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose \nof engaging the distinguished chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee in a brief colloquy regarding the fish known as the blue \npike.\n  Mr. President, the blue pike was officially declared extinct in 1983 \nunder the Endangered Species Act. This highly valued species, prized \nfor food and sport, prospered in Lakes Erie and Ontario prior to its \ndisappearance in these lakes. But recently, I have been made aware of \nreports from the Erie, PA area that the blue pike can still be found in \nCanadian lakes. It this is so, we have an exceptional opportunity to \nbring a species back from the brink of extinction.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that the Biological Resources Division \nof the U.S. Geological Survey consider investigating the existence of \nthe blue pike. The Chairman has shown excellent judgment in \nrecommending a bill which includes a $1 million increase for \nrestoration of the Great Lakes fisheries and habitats in this \nlegislation, and I think this is an appropriate area where this \nimportant work can be carried out. I am advised that this study and \nrestoration plan could cost $250,000. This is a small price to pay to \nrealize the economic and environmental benefits this study, if \nsuccessful, would surely produce. Accordingly, I look forward to \nworking with my colleague from Washington to address the blue pike \nissue.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. I agree that the blue pike study deserves thorough \nconsideration by the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\n\n    ensuring adequate law enforcement services on the yankton sioux \n                              reservation\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, Senator Johnson and I have recently been \ninformed of two urgent matters on the Yankton Sioux Reservation in \nSouth Dakota that require immediate attention. The boundaries of the \nYankton Reservation are the subject of an ongoing legal dispute. \nAlthough the final status of the case will be resolved in the coming \nyear by the Supreme Court, lower court decisions have already \ntransferred criminal jurisdiction over tribal members within the \ndisputed boundaries of the reservation to the Yankton Sioux Tribe. As a \nresult, the tribe's patrol area has increased from 38,000 acres to \n400,000 acres and the number of arrests and detentions by the tribe has \ntripled. The cost of providing these law enforcement services has \ncorrespondingly increased from $56,000 to $308,721. We are informed the \ntribe is in need of $250,000 to accommodate these increased costs.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. In addition, the reservation's juvenile detention center \nis undergoing a much needed, year-long renovation that has required the \ntribe to find alternative housing for the residents of the facility. \nThe annual cost of placing the up to 20 juveniles the tribe houses per \nday in alternative facilities will cost at least $400,000. These \nresources cannot be found within the tribe's existing budget. Absent \nadditional resources, Bureau of Land Affairs [BIA] officials state the \ntribe will be forced to release some offenders into the community and \nborrow money in order to incarcerate the most violent offenders.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. It is our hope that BIA funds can be made available to \nthe tribe for these pressing law enforcement needs during fiscal year \n1998. If there is special consideration for the funding requirements of \nunderfunded tribes pursuant to section 118 of this bill, would you \nagree that the BIA should consider providing up to $650,000 to the \nYankton Sioux Tribe for these purposes?\n  Mr. BYRD. I agree that these are two serious problems. The Yankon \nSioux Tribe is struggling to maintain adequate law enforcement services \nand provide housing for juveniles in the criminal justice system. If \nadditional funds are available through the TPA program, then the tribe \nis encouraged to identify these requirements as a priority in its \nallocation of funds.\n  Mr. GORTON. I agree as well. I recognize that funds are not available \nin the tribe's existing budget to accommodate these responsibilities. \nIt is clear that alternative housing must be provided for juveniles in \nthe criminal justice system while the existing detention facility is \nbeing renovated. These additional requirements should be considered in \nthe allocation of TPA funds.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nassistance.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the colleagues for their attention to this \nimportant problem, and ask unanimous consent that a letter from Timothy \nLake of the BIA providing additional details about these problems be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S9618]]\n\n\n         U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Indian \n           Affairs, Yankton Agency,\n                                 Wagner, S.D., September 11, 1997.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     317 Hart Senate Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: This is in response to your request \n     for information as it relates to the existing reservation \n     boundary decision and its impacts on juvenile and adult \n     detention.\n       First, the decision created an increase in Federal and \n     Tribal jurisdiction. Prior to June, 1995, we were exercising \n     criminal jurisdiction on 38,000 acres of trust land. The \n     State of South Dakota was asserting its jurisdiction on all \n     fee lands within the boundary. The reservation boundary \n     consist of 400,000 acres of land. Since June 1995, we have \n     been exercising jurisdiction over all Indians within the \n     400,000 acre reservation. As you can see, our area has \n     increased 10 fold. Much of the crime is committed in the \n     cities of Wagner, Lake Andes, Dante and Pickstown. These \n     cities were previously handled by city and county law \n     enforcement.\n       Our adult prisoner care is contracted with Charles Mix \n     County, and Lower Brule Agency. To illustrate a impact is to \n     look at the previous year before the decision from June, 1994 \n     to June 1995. We had a total of 672 arrest and prisoner \n     detention cost of $56,000.00. The first year after the \n     decision (June 1995 through June 1996) shows us arresting \n     2,078 and detention cost of $308,721.00. Another interesting \n     illustration is the road miles we previously patrolled. The \n     BIA had 22 miles and now we patrol 314 miles within the \n     reservation.\n       The Yankton Sioux Tribe was operating a juvenile hold-over \n     facility that was not intended for long term juvenile \n     detention but turned out that way. The Tribe was fortunate to \n     receive a grant (1.3 million) from the Justice Department to \n     renovate their hold-over facility to an approved juvenile \n     detention center. The Tribe was incurring the expense at \n     $250,000.00 per year to house juveniles.\n       Because of liability concerns, lack of funding, and the \n     renovation project, the Tribe closed the facility at the end \n     of August. The facility should be fully approved and \n     operational by October 1998. We now have no where on the \n     reservations to house juvenile offenders. I have made \n     arrangements with the juvenile detention facility at Kyle, \n     South Dakota. They will house ten of our juveniles at a rate \n     of $50.00 per day per juvenile. This equates to a cost of \n     $182,500.00 per year. The daily average of juveniles that the \n     Tribe was holding in their hold-over facility was 20.\n       I will need to locate another juvenile facility to hold the \n     balance. I am sure the cost to house the remaining juveniles \n     at another facility will be more costly than the Kyle, SD \n     facility. We must also deal with the time, manpower and \n     vehicle cost to run these juveniles to Kyle and wherever. It \n     is easy to see that we can spend $400,000.00 a year on \n     juvenile detention. Once the Tribe's renovation project is \n     completed, we must begin to pay the cost to house our \n     juvenile offenders at their facility.\n       There are four (4) full-time FIA police officers at this \n     agency. The Yankton Sioux Tribe was successful in securing \n     six (6) additional officers through the Justice Department \n     COPS Fast program. However, COPS fast funds can only be used \n     for salaries so we have to provide these officers with \n     equipment as well as vehicles to patrol.\n       As the Yankton Sioux Tribe has communicated to you, the \n     Tribal Priority Allocation (TPA) process does not allow for \n     such a large increase to our law enforcement program. We can \n     not maintain our fiduciary responsibility by decreasing all \n     reservation programs by $650,000.00 and increasing law \n     enforcement by this amount. The whole reservation TPA budget \n     for fiscal year 97 if 1.6 million. The Tribe will need these \n     funds added to its TPA base.\n       I hope I have answered your inquiry to your satisfaction. I \n     appreciate the interest that you have shown on the impacts of \n     the reservation boundary decision.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Timothy C. Lake,\n                                                   Superintendent.\n\n\n  bureau of indian affairs funding for the northwest indian fisheries \n                      commission and other issues\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, much tribal management of salmon \nresources in western Washington State is conducted through the \nNorthwest Indian Fisheries Commission. Historically, the Commission \nreceived its funding directly from the Bureau of Indian Affairs under \nthe Western Washington--Boldt Implementation and Pacific Salmon Treaty \naccounts under trust accounts. Beginning five years ago, however, a \nportion of these monies was re-routed for administrative purposes \nwithin the BIA system, passing through the Tribal/Agency Operations, \nTribal Priority Allocation line item in the BIA appropriation. This \nsystem worked fine for several years, but funding reductions to Tribal/\nAgency Operations in recent years have resulted in an approximately 13 \npercent cut to these accounts. Now these funds are being rerouted back \nto the original line items of Western Washington--Boldt Implementation \nand Pacific Salmon Treaty in the trust accounts, but at the reduced \nlevel.\n  Since both the Western Washington--Boldt Implementation and Pacific \nSalmon Treaty accounts were only included in the Tribal Priority \nAllocations system for administrative, pass-through purposes, it is \ninappropriate for these line items to be continued at only the reduced \nlevel. Full funding for these accounts should be restored. Congress did \nnot reduce funding for the trust accounts. In addition, Congress has \nannually adopted the Pacific Salmon Treaty budget as developed by the \nU.S. Section of the Pacific Salmon Commission, and at no time has this \nfunding been reduced. Also, within the FY-98 funding levels, Tribal \nPriority Allocations are being restored, but not the Western \nWashington--Boldt Implementation or Pacific Salmon Treaty funds. These \nfactors provide significant justification for restoring these subject \nfunds in the FY-98 budget. While the trust account budget is now set, \nthe BIA may utilize appropriate funds from another account, such as \nTribal Priority Allocations, to fully fund these important programs of \nthe Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I agree, the BIA should have the ability \nto restore funding for the Western Washington--Boldt Implementation and \nPacific Salmon Treaty accounts from Tribal Priority Allocations. In \naddition, I suggest that the BIA and the Department of Interior modify \ntheir budget proposal for the next fiscal year to ensure that the trust \naccount includes full funding for Western Washington--Boldt \nImplementation and Pacific Salmon Treaty.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the House Committee Report (105-163) for \nthe Interior Appropriations bill recommends that within the $3,000,000 \nprovided for the ``jobs in the woods'' initiative under non-recurring \nprograms, Operation of Indian Programs, $400,000 should continue to be \nused by the Northwest Indian Fisheries Commission for the Wildstock \nRestoration Initiative. Although the Senate Committee Report does not \nmention this account, does the Chairman of the Subcommittee, the \ndistinguished Senior Senator from Washington, agree with the guidance \nof House Committee Report?\n  Mr. GORTON. The ``jobs in the woods'' initiative is an important \nprogram for displaced timber workers in western Washington. The \nWildstock Restoration Initiative is a key component of the overall \ninitiative. I will support efforts in the Conference Committee to \nsecure funding for the Wildstock Restoration Initiative.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate Committee Report on this \nappropriations measure directs the Bureau of Indian Affairs on page 52 \nof the report to include a private sector representative on the BIA \ntask force to implement recommendations of an Inspector General's audit \nof the Wapato Irrigation Project on the Yakama Indian Reservation. In \naddition to this representative, it was the Chairman's and my intention \nto also include a representative of the Yakama Indian Nation on the \ntask force.\n  Mr. GORTON. That is correct. The BIA task force on the Wapato \nIrrigation District should include a private sector representative and \na tribal representative.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his cooperation.\n\n\n                         kaiparowits coal basin\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let me say to my good friend from \nWashington, Senator Gorton, and the distinguished Senator from West \nVirginia, Senator Byrd, that it seems to me, in light of the scientific \ndisagreements between the recently conducted BXG findings and the \nongoing data collection and analysis by the Utah Geological Survey, \nthere is sufficient reason to revisit the BXG study regarding the \nKaiparowits Coal Basin located in the Grand Staircase-Escalante \nNational Monument. Do my colleagues from Washington and West Virginia \nagree that the significant disparate findings of these studies warrant \nadditional review before the BXG work is accepted as fact?\n  Mr. GORTON. In view of some of the concerns which have been raised, \nBLM should consider working with all the experts, including the Utah \nGeological\n\n[[Page S9619]]\n\nSurvey, to ensure that there is an accurate reading of the current and \nfuture state of the Kaiparowits Plateau coal.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President. I share the sentiments expressed by the \nsubcommittee chairman.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank my colleagues for their responses.\n\n\n                    allegheny national forest (USFS)\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition for the purpose \nof engaging the distinguished chairman of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee in a colloquy regarding the Allegheny National Forest in \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. President, I would suggest that the U.S. Forest Service consider \nthe possibility of funding the following three projects, all of which \nwould enhance visitors' experiences in the Allegheny National Forest.\n  The first project is for the construction of a central office in \nMarienville, Pennsylvania. For more than a decade, the Allegheny \nNational Forest has requested funding to carry out this project. \nCurrently, Allegheny National Forest Service employees work out of two \nsmall office buildings, a trailer, and two warehouses located \nseparately from the district office. Construction of a central office \nwill help alleviate additional travel and communications costs as well \nas improve the efficiencies in work coordination.\n  The second project involves the rehabilitation of three boat-access \ncampgrounds on the Allegheny Reservoir. These sites were constructed in \nthe 1960s, but they have each outlived their expected life spans. \nCompletion of this project would go a long way to improving access for \nthe estimated 11,800 visitors who use these campsites each year.\n  The last project concerns rehabilitation of the Buckaloons Recreation \nArea. This area is located within the designated Wild and Scenic River \ncorridor of the Allegheny River. I am advised that visitors' complaints \nfocus on water facilities, parking, and access to the area. The funds \nneeded for this project would improve the Buckaloons Recreation Area to \nallow Pennsylvanians and others to more fully enjoy the Allegheny \nNational Forest.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with my colleague from \nWashington to address these three important funding issues.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nPennsylvania. I am aware of the importance of the Allegheny National \nForest to Pennsylvania and I believe that these three projects deserve \nthorough consideration by the U.S. Forest Service. Accordingly, I \nintend to work with the Senator from Pennsylvania to secure funding for \nthese important rehabilitation projects in the Allegheny National \nForest.\n\n\n                  recreation fee demonstration program\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Interior and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Subcommittee and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nForest and Public Lands of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee \non an issue related to the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program. In the \nfirst year of operation of Fee Demonstration projects, flaws in the \nprogram's application are coming to light. These are flaws that I \nbelieve can be corrected through a clarification of the policy \narticulated by Congress in 1996.\n  I am generally pleased with the overall results of the Recreation Fee \nDemonstration Program. As various Fee Demo projects have been \nimplemented, some problems have occurred. Public acceptance of new or \nhigher fees has been enthusiastic in some quarters and hostile in \nothers. However, the program has shown promise overall.\n  Constituents have brought to my attention the threat of private \nsector displacement by recreation managers in some National Forests. As \nprivate permit terms expire, it appears at some Fee Demo sites there is \nan intent to discontinue reliance on the private sector for delivery of \nrecreation goods and services. In other instances, the agencies are \nchoosing to go into direct competition with the private sector. The \nForest Service will now be offering so-called Heritage Expeditions, \nwhich may evolve as whitewater rafting expeditions, archaeological \ndigs, or expeditions into Indian Country--activities offered in \nabundance by community recreation programs, outfitters and guides, \nenvironmental educators, lodges, marinas and dude ranches throughout \nrural America.\n  If this type of activity is allowed under Fee Demo, more and more \nconcessions may likely be taken from private sector operators and \nplaced into the hands of federal employees to operate. At a time when \nfederal employment rolls are being steadily trimmed, new employees will \nbe required at recreation sites to collect fees, perform maintenance, \nplan and participate in interpretive and recreational activities. I do \nnot believe this was the intent of the Fee Demonstration Program.\n  This problem seems to be developing in other states. We need to send \na clear message to the land management agencies involved in the Fee \nDemo project that Congress did not authorize this program to enable the \nagencies to displace or discourage existing and future investment by \nthe private sector.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague from Arizona. \nIdaho has experienced similar problems with implementation of the \nRecreation Fee Demonstration Program in this first season of operation.\n  My colleague, the gentleman from Arizona, has identified a serious \nproblem: use of Fee Demo authority to put the government into direct \ncompetition with the private sector. It has happened in Idaho under Fee \nDemo this summer, and I appreciate the gentleman's effort to bring this \nunfortunate development in the implementation of the Fee Demo program \nto the attention of our colleagues in the Senate.\n  It was on the Wild and Scenic section of Idaho's Snake River in \nHell's Canyon that the Forest Service conducted a pilot Heritage \nExpedition trip in July. The Heritage Expedition element of the Fee \nDemo program will be conducted regionwide next year in the Pacific \nNorthwest and in the Southwest Regions of the Forest Service, and I'm \ntold that the concept may be adopted nationally in the very near \nfuture.\n  Essentially, the new Heritage Expedition initiative puts the Forest \nService into direct competition with an adventure travel industry that \nis already highly competitive. Dozens of these businesses compete with \neach other at every primary tourist destination in the country. \nThousands more have invested private capital to create and sustain \nunique market niches on the fringes of the National Park System, or \ntucked away in some remote corner of the National Forest.\n  At Hells Canyon, the demand for access to the river and along trails \nand limited camping facilities is very competitive and increasingly \ndifficult for resource managers to resolve. Environmentalists hold \nstrong views that the river corridor is being trampled by boaters and \nhikers. Boaters cling tenaciously to levels of float boat and jetboat \nuse that have increased steadily over decades. The Forest Service has \nto date been entirely unable to reduce conflicts between these various \nusers groups, let alone soften the shrill cry from those who would \nradically reduce use altogether. Congress has stepped in to arbitrate a \nportion of these issues, and the situation is now the subject of rather \nheated congressional hearings.\n  In pricing and advertising a whitewater Heritage Expedition through \nHells Canyon last July, the Forest Service executed an extraordinary \npiece of business. It advertised a ``deluxe, fully catered'' whitewater \nand camping trip in which the fourth night would be spent ``in the \nluxury of'' a historic lodge. The four-day trip was offered, and I \nunderstand fully booked, for the ``fee'' (the agency's term of choice) \nof $1,740.\n  The Forest Service did use the services of a river outfitter in \nconducting this trip and spent the final night at a commercial inn. \nThere may have been other director costs not evident from the agency's \nadvertisment of this trip in the Internet. But, I do not believe that \nthis is what we contemplated when we approved the Fee Demonstration.\n  It's important to note that a commercial operator in Hells Canyon \nwould not be allowed by Forest Service river managers to charge the \npublic such an exorbitant fee, no matter what amenities were tacked \nonto the basic outdoor experience.\n\n[[Page S9620]]\n\n  It was advertised by the Forest Service that a portion of its fee \nwould directly fund ``preservation, protection, and future management \nof Hells Canyon's irreplaceable heritage resources.'' When the job of \nanalyzing this initial pilot Demo Fee program is complete, it be \nimportant to know how much agency staff time and support costs were \ndiverted from normal responsibilities in order to plan, package, market \nand conduct this trip.\n  Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Arizona. Such \nactivities as running expeditions were not what was intended when we \napproved the Fee Demonstration Program.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank my colleagues for bringing this matter to the \nCommittee's attention. In a letter to Regional Foresters on February \n25, 1997, Forest Service Chief Dombeck clearly stated that the Fee \nDemonstration is not intended to displace concessionaires. That was \nclearly not the intent of this Committee when we passed the Fee \nDemonstration Program. I thank the gentleman for calling this to the \nattention of the Committee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Burns and I see the distinguished \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Interior Appropriations on the floor \nand we would like to engage him in a discussion regarding assistance \nfrom the Department of Energy (DOE) to help finance the construction of \na pipeline to transport carbon dioxide (CO2) now produced as a waste \ngas at the Great Plains Gasification (Great Plains) plant near Beulah, \nNorth Dakota to existing oil fields to be used for enhanced tertiary \noil recovery.\n  Mr. GORTON. I will be happy to discuss this matter with my \ncolleagues.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We thank the Chairman. This project will enhance tertiary \noil recovery efforts in North America which will help the United States \nand Canada secure greater energy independence from foreign oil. It is \nalso critical to the long-term operation of Great Plains, which has \nbeen a priority for the federal government since it sold the plant to \nthe Dakota Gasification Company in the late 1980s.\n  The financial assistance Senator Burns and I are proposing would \nconsist of a loan from funds currently available to DOE in a Great \nPlains trust fund. DOE staff has reviewed the details of the CO2 \nproject and the Department believes that a loan is appropriate if so \ndirected in an appropriations bill.\n  Is the Chairman willing to work with us and the House conferees to \ninclude Statement of Managers language in the conference agreement that \npermits DOE to provide such a loan at reasonable terms to the owners of \nGreat Plains and to the government?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am unfamiliar with the details of the proposed CO2 \nproject, but I can assure my colleagues from North Dakota and Montana \nthat I will work with you, Senator Byrd and the House conferees to \ninclude Statement of Managers language allowing the Department of \nEnergy to make a loan to the owners of Great Plains for the CO2 \nproject, provided the project is consistent with our country's overall \nenergy and environmental policy objectives and is worthy of federal \nsupport.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I wish to thank the Chairman for his cooperation.\n  Mr. BURNS. I am also supportive of this loan for the construction of \na pipeline to transport the excess CO2 from the Great Plains \nGasification plant to existing oil fields to enhance tertiary oil \nrecovery. Some portions of these fields lie within the boundaries of my \nstate of Montana, and would assist with the economic development of \nthis area. I would like to thank both the Chairman and my colleague \nfrom North Dakota for working with me to reach some sort of \nunderstanding on the importance of language in the conference report.\n\n\n    Regarding the US Forest Service Rocky Mountain Research Station\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, the chairman knows, the Forest Service \nrecently completed the consolidation of the Intermountain and Rocky \nMountain Research Stations in Fort Collins Colorado. I had some serious \nreservations with this consolidation, but in the interest of reducing \nthe federal budget, I reluctantly agreed to allow the consolidation to \nproceed. Allow me to share with my colleagues what some of those \nconcerns were.\n  I was concerned that the proposed merger would actually produce the \ncost savings promised by the Forest Service. I was further concerned \nthat any administrative savings would be offset by increased travel \ncosts of staff traveling to Fort Collins. And since the consolidated \ncenter would be responsible for providing research for approximately 60 \npercent of the nation's forest lands, I was particularly concerned that \nthe new center would have the ability to provide quality services to my \nconstituents once consolidation removed the administrative process one \nstep further from Utah. Finally, I was most concerned that the \nemployees currently stationed in Utah would be jeopardized by \nconsolidation. While I received numerous assurances that no positions \nwill be eliminated in Utah due to consolidation, it was still unclear \nthat the employees based in Utah would continue to have substantive \nresearch responsibilities.\n  As I mentioned, despite these reservations, I reluctantly concluded \nthat the merger should proceed. I sought your assurance that the \nCommittee would revisit the consolidation next year to determine if the \npromised benefits and savings have indeed been realized. If these \nsavings have not been met, I requested that the committee take the \nappropriate action to rectify the situation. Is it still the Chairman's \nintent to revisit the consolidation?\n  Mr. GORTON. I recall the Senator from Utah raising these issues in a \nletter to me last March. I again say to him that the Committee remains \nconcerned that the estimated savings provided by the Forest Service may \nwell not be achieved. It would be an unfortunate waste of taxpayer \ndollars to have permitted this consolidation to go forward if the \nForest Service fails to reach the savings promised. The Committee would \nbe happy to revisit the consolidation issue next spring during the \nhearing process.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the Chairman for his efforts.\n\n\n                           newfound gap road\n\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with \nChairman Gorton about Newfound Gap Road in western North Carolina. The \nNational Park Service is responsible for the maintenance of this road, \nwhich runs through Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and it is the \nmajor route for many residents of the area. The road reaches elevations \nof 5,000 feet, so there is substantial snowfall in the winter, and I am \nconcerned about the snowfall removal effort from the NPS. The road was \nclosed on 42 days over the 1995-96 winter, and it was closed on 13 days \nover the 1996-97 winter, but the last winter was exceptionally mild. \nThe NPS pledged increased efforts, but I am unaware of real changes in \ntheir methods, and I am concerned about prospects for this winter. Is \nthe chairman aware of these problems?\n  Mr. GORTON. I am well aware of this issue. The Great Smoky Mountains \nNational Park received a $1.06 million increase for Fiscal Year 1997 \nand a $400,000 increase for fiscal year 1998. This is a large amount of \nmoney, and I expect it to be well spent. This committee is reluctant to \nseize the management prerogatives of the NPS, but I want to ensure that \nthis road is maintained for the people of western North Carolina, and \nis available for use for as many days as reasonably achievable. The \nHouse and Senate Appropriations Committees have previously expressed \nconcern about Park Service maintenance of this road, and I expect the \nService to be responsive to our concerns.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. I am pleased to hear that the Committee understands \nthe importance of this issue. The NPS expects to spend a lot of money \nfor personnel costs, but I don't see evidence of a real commitment to \nincreased maintenance of Newfound Gap Road. The NPS produced a plan \nlast year to answer our concerns, but it was a superficial document \nthat offered little encouragement, so I am glad to hear the chairman \nstate that he expects NPS to be more responsive. This is important to \nthe community, and I hear support for these people, but the NPS will \nneed to take concrete steps to resolve this issue. The NPS cannot use \nsalt on this road because of environmental concerns, so it needs to \nlook at new equipment such as motorgraders, but I do not hear much \nabout that. Robert Stanton, the new NPS director, told\n\n[[Page S9621]]\n\nme that he is eager to work with us. He is a good man, and I am \nconfident that he will make some changes, but the NPS budget plan for \nthe Great Smoky Mountains National Park concerns me.\n  Mr. GORTON. The Park Service has ample flexibility to consider \nequipment purchases if that is necessary for proper maintenance. The \nDirector is aware of the problem and I encourage him to remain \nattentive to the situation so that this road remains open as much as \npossible through the winter.\n\n\n                       michigan lakes and streams\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nacquisition of 7600 acres of private land located in Michigan's Huron \nand Manistee National Forests by the U.S. Forest Service.\n  As the result of a settlement between the State of Michigan and one \nof Michigan's power companies, 11,000 acres of the utility's land are \nbeing--or have been--transferred to the Great Lakes Fisheries Trust. \nThe trust is a coalition of the State's environmental agencies and \nseveral conservation groups which was established as part of the \nsettlement and is authorized to sell these lands in order to capitalize \na trust fund that will support projects to restore the Great Lakes \nfishery.\n  Approximately 7,600 of the settlement acres lie within or along the \nboundaries of the Huron-Manistee National Forest, and a significant \nportion are located along the popular Au Sable and Manistee Rivers. \nBoth these rivers boast some of the State's best fishing. The \nacquisition of these parcels by the Forest Service would ensure the \nprotection of the water and forests and species located within them.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my colleague would yield for a moment, it is my \nunderstanding that the bill appropriates $700 million from the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund [LWCF] for land acquisition which have been set \naside for a variety of projects, some of which will be identified after \nconsultation with the administration and the House. I believe \napproximately $285 million of those funds have not been designated for \nspecific projects.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. The senior Senator from Michigan is correct. These funds \nhave been budgeted but have not yet been earmarked for specific \npurchases.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If my colleague will yield further, I think it is also \nimportant to point out that the sale of these inholdings by the Great \nLakes Fishery Trust will help generate funds for fishery enhancement \nprograms and preserve critically important frontage along rivers that \nflow into the Great Lakes. If, however, these lands are not purchased \nquickly, then the Great Lakes Fisheries Trust could face significant \ncosts, including taxes and administrative fees. Such costs would put \nthe trust in the uncomfortable position of either having to sell these \nlands commercially or paying these costs and thereby reducing the flow \nof funds destined for financing improvements in the Great Lakes \nfishery.\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. My colleague is again correct. the Great Lakes Fisheries \nTrust and the Forest Service have a great opportunity to protect some \nof Michigan's pristine natural resources. Unfortunately, if we do not \nact soon, this opportunity will quickly slip away.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator from Michigan yield for a question?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I would be happy to yield to the \ndistinguished Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. GORTON. Can my colleague tell me whether the U.S. Forest Service \nhas expressed an interest in purchasing these lands?\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Yes, the Forest Service has expressed its desire to \npurchase these acres. I understand that this acquisition is on the \nForest Service's priority list.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senators from Michigan for bringing this to \nmy attention. I understand how important this issue is to them both and \nwill give it due consideration as the conferees consider Federal land \npurchases during the conference.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish to thank the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman for his consideration and hard work in support of \nthis Nation's parks, national forests, and wildlife refuges.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I appreciate the Senator's consideration and my colleague \nfrom Michigan's efforts and interest on this matter. Also, I want the \nchairman and Senator Byrd to know that I have communicated our interest \nto the administration and urged that this item be put on their priority \nlist.\n\n\nchickamauga-chattanooga national military park highway road relocation \n                                project\n\n  Mr. COVERDELL. Will the distinguished chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Subcommittee on Interior yield for a question?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to yield to the senior Senator from \nGeorgia for a question.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. As the Senator well knows, Federal funding for the \nChickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park highway road relocation \nproject is very important to myself and the State of Georgia. Your \nprevious support for this project has been especially helpful and \nappreciated. I note that in the fiscal year 1998 Interior \nAppropriations Committee report, on page 38, it states ``that the Park \nService intends to allocate $2.8 million in fiscal year 1997 to \ncontinue work on the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park \nhighway road relocation project, and that additional funds will be \nallocated in fiscal year 1999 from Federal Highway Lands Program \nfunds.'' In addition, the report also states that ``the committee \nsupports efforts to complete this project in fiscal year 1999.''\n  I appreciate the subcommittee chairman's interest in this important \nissue. However, I am concerned that it appears that no funding will be \nallocated for this project in fiscal year 1998. This has been an \nongoing road construction project and any further delay in its \ncompletion will cause additional burdens to my State. It is my \nunderstanding that the Park Service has made assurances that it will \nprovide at least $8.85 million in fiscal year 1998 from its Federal \nHighway Lands Program funds. Is the Senator aware of these assurances \nmade by the Park Service?\n  Mr. GORTON. Yes. I am aware that the Park Service has indicated that \nit will provide an estimated $8.85 million in fiscal year 1998 from its \nFederal Highway Lands Program funds to continue work on the U.S. \nHighway 27 bypass around the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military \nPark in Georgia. The Senator should be aware, however, that the current \nauthorization for FLHP expires with ISTEA on September 30, 1997, so any \nallocations for fiscal year 1998 are dependent upon enactment of a new \nauthorization and evaluation of the total funding allowed.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. If the subcommittee chairman would further yield, it \nis my understanding that the House's version of the fiscal year 1998 \nInterior appropriations bill includes report language which reflects \nthe Park Service's assurance and sets aside a minimum of $8.85 million \nfor this project. I believe it is critical there be no further delays \nin completion of this project or gaps in funding from the Park Service. \nWould the chairman be inclined to include language similar to the House \nin the conference report to the fiscal year 1998 Interior \nappropriations bill?\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to work with the senior Senator from \nGeorgia on this issue. I realize how important the Chickamauga-\nChattanooga project is to you and the State of Georgia. I appreciate \nall your hard work and diligence on this project.\n  Mr. COVERDELL. I thank the chairman for his help. I yield the floor.\n\n\n              RenOvaTiOn of MonTezUma CreeK HeaLth cLiNiC\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. I thank the distinguished Chairman, Senator Gorton, for \nhis support on a matter of particular importance to the Utah Navajo \npopulation of San Juan County. The issue involves the Montezuma Creek \nHealth Clinic in Montezuma Creek, UT.\n  For nearly 3 years, my colleague Senator Hatch and I have worked \ntogether to improve the delivery of health care services to the \nresidents of San Juan County. This area is located in an extremely \nremote part of southeastern Utah and is the home of approximately 6,000 \nNavajos. The Montezuma Creek Clinic is very important to this rural \ncommunity. However, the existing facility is in extremely poor \ncondition and has undergone numerous repairs. The clinic comprises a \npatchwork of a mobile trailer connected to a permanent structure which \nis approximately 40 years old.\n  In an effort to make improvements to the clinic, the committee \nprovided\n\n[[Page S9622]]\n\n$100,000 for planning and renovation of the existing structure. These \nfunds will be matched by the State of Utah and the Utah Navajo Trust \nFund that collectively will provide at least $300,000 for renovation of \nthe facility. However, I do have a question for the Chairman regarding \nthe intent of the committee report language with respect to how these \nfunds can be spent.\n  Mr. GORTON. I would be happy to provide a clarification.\n  Mr. BENNETT. The committee report language on page 98 states: ``The \nCommittee does not intend for any of these funds to be used for \nfacility or program [expansion], but rather, for improvement of \nexisting conditions.'' My concern is over the word ``expansion.'' As a \npractical matter, the renovation of the facility may result in an \nexpansion of the overall structure. This is especially apparent since \nthe clinic is partially housed in a temporary structure and replacing \nit may, in fact, increase the overall square footage of the clinic. \nThey clinic's staff also informs me there is a critical need to \nincrease the size of the emergency room as well as add additional \nexamination rooms in order to handle the current heavy caseload. \nMoreover, in order to comply with Federal and State building codes, \nsome expansion of the facility will be needed. Clearly, these measures \nare designed to accommodate existing services and, as such, should not \nbe viewed as an expansion per se.\n  Mr. GORTON. I understand the Senator's concerns. The committee \nintends that the funds are used toward the design and construction of \nrenovating and improving the existing facility. Making improvements to \naccommodate existing services is certainly acceptable. Such measures \nwould include replacing temporary housing with a permanent addition as \nwell as enlarging the emergency room, or adding examination rooms. The \nuse of the word expansion in the committee report was used to indicate \nthat the committee cannot ensure that additional funding--beyond what \nis currently provided in this bill--will be provided by virtue of \nfacility improvements being made at this location. If additional costs \nare anticipated because of a larger facility than presently exists, the \ncommittee will consider these needs but can make no guarantees.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I understand the Chairman's position. The funds provided \nby the committee are a positive step in improving the conditions at the \nMontezuma Creek. I think my colleague for the clarification and, once \nagain, appreciate his support for this important project. I also want \nto thank Senator Hatch for his support and work on this project.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, increasingly frequent catastrophic die-\noffs of fish and waterfowl at the Salton Sea have led experts to \nconclude that the entire ecosystem is in crisis and could perish in the \nnext five to ten years unless dramatic measures are taken. The crisis \nhas dire implications for migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway because \nthe Salton Sea is a critical stop for species migrating along the \nPacific Coast. Urgent scientific research is underway, but scientists \nhave not yet identified the cause of the environmental crisis. The \narea's agriculture, wildlife, water usage, and environmental health \nsystems are in jeopardy.\n  Another massive die-off is occurring now. Previously, the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service and the U.S. Geological Survey worked in \npartnership with the California Department of Fish and Game to deal the \ndiagnosis of dead species, rehabilitation of sick birds, and the \ndisposal of carcasses to avert the spread of disease. Unfortunately, \njust a few weeks ago, California withdrew most of its field personnel \ndue to costs and concerns about the potential health threat to state \nfield personnel. California's withdrawal has resulted in a significant \nincrease in the workload of an already undersized federal staff at the \nSea.\n  I therefore ask the Chairman of the subcommittee to work with me to \ninclude the following report language in conference.\n\n       Spurred by the accelerated rate of species decline at the \n     Salton Sea, the Committee directs the Secretary of the \n     Interior to create a plan for Department of the Interior \n     activities in the Salton Sea region in Southern California; \n     to submit the plan to Congress no later than April 15, 1998; \n     and to make every effort to consider any preliminary \n     recommendations in the FY 1999 Budget request. The plan \n     should seek to be as comprehensive as possible, and to be \n     compatible with important factors including water transfer \n     plans, environmental restoration needs, economic factors \n     (including agriculture) and the rights of Native Americans. \n     The Department shall develop the plan in cooperation with the \n     State of California and the Salton Sea Authority. In addition \n     the Committee urges the Department to consider the funding \n     needs of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge for \n     operations including laboratory support from the U.S. \n     Geological Survey, supplemental field staff during declared \n     die-off episodes to recover dead and dying wildlife and to \n     monitor wildlife health at the Sea, on-site and remote field \n     hospital operations for sick wildlife from the sea, \n     incineration and disposal facilities for dead wildlife, and \n     for high priority research needs identified by the 1997 \n     Salton Sea Needs Assessment Workshop.\n\n  Mr. GORTON. I recognize the importance of addressing the emerging \ncrisis at the Salton Sea. I share your concerns, and will carefully \nconsider this language for possible inclusion in the Statement of \nManagers accompanying the conference report on the Interior bill. I \nwould note, however, that the funding constraints under which the \nInterior agencies operate do not allow for agencies to perform tasks \nthat should rightly he the responsibility of the States. Should the \nconferees request the report suggested by the Senator for California, \nsuch report should include a discussion of an appropriate division of \nresponsibilities among the federal government, the State of California, \nand other relevant agencies.\n\n\n        Technical Corrections to the Utah Miner's Hospital Grant\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would like to discuss briefly the \ntechnical corrections made in this bill to Section 116 of the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1997. I wish to point out to my \ncolleagues that the original language was intended to ratify the State \nof Utah's legislative decision to allocate all funds generated by two \nfederal land grants for a miner's hospital to the University of Utah in \nSalt Lake City for construction and support of a physical \nrehabilitation center. However, the original language inadvertently \nfailed to include the statutory citation of the first of the two land \ngrants for a miner's hospital. The technical amendments correct this \nomission, clarifying Congress' ratification of the Utah legislature's \nactions with respect to funds generated from miners' hospital land \ngrants in both 1894 and 1929.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator from Utah for the clarification. Will \nthe Senator briefly outline the history of these land grants?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Certainly. In the Utah Enabling Act, Congress granted \nthe new State of Utah the right to select 50,000 acres of \nunappropriated federal lands for support of a miner's hospital for \ndisabled miners. This 1894 grant was supplemented in 1929 by the grant \nof an additional 50,000 acres. In the late 1950's, the Utah \nlegislature, with the support of the United Mineworkers of America, \ndetermined that accumulated funds from these two grants could best be \nused for the construction of a rehabilitation center that would serve \nboth miners and the general public, rather than for the construction of \na standalone hospital for the limited number of disabled miners in the \nstate. This facility was constructed in 1965 and operated under the \nsupervision of an advisory commission that included representatives of \nthe State's mining unions. Subsequent state legislation has provided \nthat ongoing funds generated from the two land grants are to be used to \nsupport this rehabilitation center.\n  Mr. GORTON. Will the Senator explain for the benefit of our \ncolleagues the need for Congressional ratification of the Utah \nlegislature's actions concerning these grants?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Although the rehabilitation center was constructed with \nthe support of the United Mineworkers of America, and has been open to \nuse by the state's miners, some have questioned whether the Utah \nlegislature was permitted under the Utah Enabling Act to use funds \ngenerated from these grants for a rehabilitation center open to both \nminers and the general public, as opposed to a facility open only to \nminers. Section 116 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year \n1997 was intended as Congressional approval of the Utah legislature's \nactions with respect to use of accumulated and ongoing funds from these \nland grants.\n\n[[Page S9623]]\n\nHowever, as I have noted, that Act referred only to the 1929 land grant \nand inadvertently failed to cite the 1894 land grant. These technical \namendments correct that omission.\n  Mr. GORTON. I thank the Senator for the clarification. I am pleased \nthat we can now bring this issue to closure.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise in support of H.R. 2107, the \nfiscal year 1998 Interior and related agencies appropriations bill.\n  I congratulate my good friend, the senior Senator from Washington, \nfor his diligence in fashioning this important appropriations measure. \nHe has done a masterful job throughout the process.\n  Mr. President, the pending bill provides $13.7 billion in new budget \nauthority and $9.1 billion in new outlays to fund the programs of the \nDepartment of Interior, the Forest Service of the Department of \nAgriculture, the energy conservation and fossil energy research and \ndevelopment programs of the Department of Energy, the Indian Health \nService, and arts-related agencies.\n  When outlays from prior-year budget authority and other completed \nactions are taken into account, the bill provides a total of $13.8 \nbillion in budget authority and $13.7 billion in outlays for these \nprograms for fiscal year 1998.\n  I support the bill with the adoption of the manager's amendment to \nbring the bill within the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for budget \nauthority. The reported bill is $38 million in outlays under the \nsubcommittee's allocation.\n  It has been my privilege to serve on the subcommittee with the \ndistinguished chairman. I appreciate the subcommittee's support for \nseveral priority projects in my home State of New Mexico.\n  I support the bill with the exception of the provisions relating to \nIndian tribes, which I will speak to later in the debate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a table displaying the \nBudget Committee's scoring of the Interior and related agencies \nappropriations bill for fiscal year 1998 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n              H.R. 2107, INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS, 1998: SPENDING COMPARISONS--SENATE-REPORTED BILL\n                                         [Fiscal Year 1998, $ millions]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                      Defense       Nondefense         Crime         Mandatory         Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-reported bill:\n    Budget authority............  ..............          13,701  ..............              55          13,756\n    Outlays.....................  ..............          13,691  ..............              50          13,741\nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget authority............  ..............          13,700  ..............              55          13,755\n    Outlays.....................  ..............          13,729  ..............              50          13,779\nPresident's request:\n    Budget authority............  ..............          13,747  ..............              55          13,802\n    Outlays.....................  ..............          13,771  ..............              50          13,821\nHouse-passed bill:\n    Budget authority............  ..............          12,980  ..............              55          13,035\n    Outlays.....................  ..............          13,382  ..............              50          13,432\nSenate-reported bill compared\n to:\n    Senate 302(b) allocation:\n        Budget authority........  ..............               1  ..............  ..............               1\n        Outlays.................  ..............             -38  ..............  ..............             -38\n    President's request:\n        Budget authority........  ..............             -46  ..............  ..............             -46\n        Outlays.................  ..............             -80  ..............  ..............             -80\n    House-passed bill:\n        Budget authority........  ..............             721  ..............  ..............             721\n        Outlays.................  ..............             309  ..............  ..............             309\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote.--Details may not add to totals due to rounding. Totals adjusted for consistency with current scorekeeping\n  conventions.\n\n                         timber road subsidies\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, yesterday, I voted against the Bryan \namendment regarding timber road construction subsidies. I would like to \ntake this opportunity to explain my reasons for doing so.\n  First, and most important, I believe the amendment goes too far. I \nhave consistently opposed the current subsidy because I believe it is \nunfair to use the value of natural resources that belong to all \ntaxpayers to offset the full cost of access roads needed by the timber \nindustry to harvest those resources for their own profit. I agree with \nthe proponents of the amendment that this is nothing more than a \nhandout of federal assets at a loss to the taxpayers.\n  However, because many of these roads serve dual or multiple purposes, \nI do not believe it is fair to shift the cost entirely to the timber \nindustry, unless the industry is the only user of the road. This is a \nposition I had clearly staked out in an amendment I offered in late \n1995. In that amendment, I proposed to change the current system to \nrequire timber companies to pay a fair share of the costs of \nconstruction and maintenance of forest access roads. If, for example, \nthe road would be used half of the time for recreation, maintenance or \nfirefighting access, or some other legitimate purpose, then the timber \nindustry would only have to pay for half of road construction. If, \nhowever, the road would only serve the timber company, the company \nwould pay the entire cost of construction.\n  I believe this is a fair means of allocating responsibility for \nconstruction and maintenance costs--based on actual use of the road. \nThe Bryan amendment would have gone much too far and unfairly penalized \nthe timber industry.\n  Second, the amendment would have cut $10 million from the Forest \nService budget for road construction and maintenance. Anyone familiar \nwith some of the roads through our nation's forest lands recognizes the \nneed for more funding, not less, for maintenance of existing roads. \nEven supporters of the amendment pointed out that the Forest Service \nhas a $440 million backlog of road maintenance needs for existing \nroads.\n  Many of these roads were built and paid for by the timber industry, \nand have since been turned over to the Forest Service. Many of them \nremain multi-purpose roads, providing ready access for the timber \nindustry as well as the public and others to our forest areas. The \nForest Service budget for maintenance of these roads is limited, and \nthe Bryan amendment would have cut funding that could be used to \nmaintain existing forest roads.\n  Finally, the amendment does not adequately protect the counties from \na cut in the funding they receive from timber sales. Because the timber \nindustry would be required to fully fund access roads, companies would \nlikely submit lower bids for the timber. County governments rely on \nrevenues from timber sales to maintain their own roadways. Because the \nmoney counties receive is based on a fixed share of total timber \nrevenues, a smaller pot would mean less money to the counties. The \nNational League of Counties has written a very strong letter opposing \nthe Bryan amendment.\n  Let me address briefly the concerns of environmental organizations \nabout the timber access road program. I believe we have to strike a \nbalance in our forest management policy between preservation and \nproduction, focusing on healthy, well-maintained forests that will be \npreserved for future generations.\n  However, I doubt seriously that eliminating the road construction \nsubsidy for timber companies would result in less logging of our \nforests. The key to limiting logging and road-building in our forests \nis a rational, reasonable forest management policy. In fact, because \nthe revenue from timber sales would decline with lower timber bids, our \nforests could actually be harmed.\n\n[[Page S9624]]\n\nThe Forest Service would have even less funding to carry out its \nimportant preservation and management activities, and those wishing to \nutilize these roads for recreational access to forest lands would be \ndenied that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, this amendment was cast as an anti-pork amendment. My \ncommitment to eliminating pork-barrel spending is quite well known to \nmy colleagues, whether it be earmarks in an annual appropriations bill \nor corporate subsidies. But it is important that we look at the details \nof this amendment, because it would have had serious consequences for \nlocal communities and others who use these roads that I do not believe \nthe authors intended, and which have nothing to do with pork.\n  Mr. President, for these reasons, I voted against the Bryan \namendment. I will continue to pursue elimination of unfair and \ninequitable corporate subsidies, including the current timber access \nroad subsidy. One mechanism which would help in the effort to eliminate \nsuch subsidies is an independent, non-partisan commission to study all \ncorporate subsidies and prepare a package of recommendations for \nCongressional review and action, and I have authored a bill, S. 207, \nwith several of my colleagues to set up such a commission. And I am \nprepared to work with Senator Bryan and my colleagues to craft an \namendment to eliminate this inequitable corporate subsidy and put in \nplace a fair and equitable program to share the costs of timber access \nroads among all users, and to ensure that rural counties already \nstrapped by declines in the timber industry are held harmless.\n\n\n                             new world mine\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, more than a year ago I addressed this \nbody to tell my colleagues about a proposed gold mine that posed a \nmajor threat to Yellowstone National Park. Crown Butte Mining, Inc. \nproposed to construct a 72-acre impoundment area with a dam that would \nbe somewhere between 75 and 100 feet high, which would have a plastic \nlining on the bottom and some sort of a cap on top to keep oxygen away \nfrom the 5.5 million tons of tailings from the mining operation that \nwould go into this impoundment area. The purpose of keeping the oxygen \naway from it is to keep the waste from turning into sulfuric acid. This \nearthfill dam would be located high about Yellowstone National Park and \nthe Yellowstone River, in one of the most seismically active, \nearthquake-prone areas of the country. An area where it snows thirty \nfeet a year.\n  I introduced a bill at the time to withdraw Federal lands from around \nthat mine from further disposal under the mining laws, and to draw \nattention to this problem. I said at that time that my bill would not \nlegally stop Crown Butte from proceeding with the mine, but that I \nhoped my bill would discourage them and dissuade them from doing it. I \nsaid that I hoped that Crown Butte, as good corporate citizens, would \nnot force the issue and leave us to wonder whether or not this 5.5 \nmillion tons of tailings that they proposed to impound there could \npossibly break loose and pollute the Clarks Fort and Soda Butte Creek, \nwhich flows right into Yellowstone National Park.\n  To their credit, Crown Butte has not proceeded. They recognized that \nthe public wanted to protect Yellowstone, and they were going to have \nto overcome some fairly significant environmental problems. And they \nreached an agreement with the administration and with local \nconservation groups that had sued them, and they agreed to let the \nUnited States buy out their interest. They reached that agreement more \nthan a year ago, and the only thing that is required for it to be \nconsummated--for Yellowstone to be protected from this threat and for \nthe company to receive what they believe is fair compensation--is for \nus to fund that agreement in this bill.\n  The Interior Appropriations bill includes $65 million for this \npurpose. So we have the money to accomplish this goal of protecting \nYellowstone National Park.\n  Unfortunately, as the bill currently stands, it requires further \nlegislation for the administration to actually use the money for that \npurpose. I hope we dispense with that requirement. The question is \nsimple--do we protect Yellowstone National Park through an agreement \nwhich is supported by both the mining company and the National Park \nService, and which involves paying the mining company the appraised \nvalue of its property? Or do we need to kick this around for another \ntwo years, and reward the mining company for being a responsible \ncorporate citizen by saying, ``We've got to think more about this''?\n\n  As the ranking minority Member of the Senate Energy Committee, I am \nvery sensitive to that Committee's responsibilities. But it is quite \nclear that no new law is required for this agreement to be consummated. \nIt involves purchasing private inholdings in a National Forest--\nsomething the Interior Appropriations Committee has funded in hundreds \nof places over the past several years on the authority of existing law.\n  The question is simple. Do we take the opportunity to save \nYellowstone, or throw it away?\n  I went to Yellowstone when I was 12 years old--breathtaking. I never \nforgot any part of it, the geysers, the magnificent waterfalls--all of \nit. Here is the first national park in America. Yellowstone, a crown \njewel. To allow a huge industrial development generating hundreds of \ntons of highly acidic mine waste to threaten to destroy the first \nnational park in America, one of the real crown jewels of the world, \nnot just America, is absolutely unacceptable.\n  Many times we find that we in this chamber can't agree on some \nproposal to protect environmental values because there is another side, \nand a conflict. Here there is no other side. The mining company wants \nto solve this problem. The conservation community wants to solve this \nproblem. I hope that when we take this matter up in conference, we will \ndrop this requirement for further legislation and simply solve the \nproblem.\n\n\n         WEATHERIZATION AND STATE ENERGY CONSERVATION PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Gorton for \nincreasing funding for the Low-Income Weatherization Assistance Program \nand the State Energy Conservation Program from the levels provided in \n1997. As a strong supporter of these programs, I am encouraged to see \nthe Senate reverse the disheartening trend of the last few years \nwhereby the programs had been reduced to 50 percent of the 1995 level.\n  These programs are very important in Vermont, where high energy costs \nare a stark reality. Last year, Vermont and the entire Northeast \nexperienced a dramatic price spike in heating fuel, twenty-five percent \nhigher than the previous winter. These price spikes hurt all \nVermonters, but low-income families carry a greater burden. Energy \ncosts account for fourteen percent of their total income, four-times as \nmuch as the average household. The Weatherization assistance program \neases this burden by helping families insulate their homes, replace \ninefficient heaters and ventilation systems and seal drafty windows and \ndoors. One thing Vermont has plenty of is drafty, old houses.\n  But the Weatherization assistance program is not just about keeping \nhomes warm, it is also about keeping homes safe. The program gives \npriority to houses with unsafe chimneys and wiring, cracked heating \nsystems, carbon monoxide and combustion air concerns, and faulty \nmechanical systems. In Vermont, this program is saving lives. Let me \nshare one example with my colleagues. During a routine energy audit at \nthe home of an elderly couple, the weatherization auditor found \nextremely high and dangerous levels of carbon monoxide being emitted \nfrom the gas cooking range. He discovered that when the power goes out, \nthe couple puts a blanket up around the kitchen and uses the cooking \nrange for heat. As it turns out, the couple had been suffering from \ncarbon monoxide poisoning in the dark every time there was a power \noutage. Through the Weatherization program, the defective valve system \nwas replaced to make the home easier to heat and healthier for the \ncouple.\n  Finally, the Weatherization and State Energy Conservation programs \nmake economic sense. The Weatherization program returns $1.80 in energy \nsavings for every $1.00 spent on weatherization activities. The average \nsavings per home that participates in these programs is $4,000 \nannually. Again, these are savings for low-income families who are \nhaving to make\n\n[[Page S9625]]\n\nthe tough choices between heating their homes and feeding their \nchildren. These programs also benefit our economy as a whole, by \ncreating jobs in the energy efficient technology industry and in the \nservice sector. In Vermont, for every dollar we spend on energy \nefficiency, over seventy percent remains in our economy.\n  I commend Chairman Gorton for his support and look forward to \nsupporting the Senate level in conference as the minimum necessary for \nthese critical programs. As we attempt to make our nation more energy \nefficient we cannot turn our backs on the programs that actually work \nand deliver real benefits to real people. Whether these programs are \ninsulating the homes of the elderly, disabled or poor, or helping to \nreduce energy costs for our hard-pressed schools and hospitals, we need \nto support these effective programs. I hope that we can have a \nsuccessful conference in this area.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to commend my colleague Senator \nGorton on his amendment to provide kindergarten through 12th grade \neducation funding directly to local educational agencies. Last month, I \ntraveled through my home State of Missouri to discuss education and the \nimportance of parent involvement in their child's education. I strongly \nbelieve that parents are the key to educational progress. As I visited \nwith parents, educators, and local school officials, they were in full \nagreement concerning the education of our children; they need the \nflexibility to improve the quality of education at the local level \nwithout federal intrusion. As responsible parents and educators, the \nneed for our children to be properly educated was a top priority.\n  Over the last 30 years, federal involvement in education has \nburgeoned and I am disturbed by the growth of federal involvement in \nwhat is constitutionally the right of states: to provide for high-\nquality, public education. This growth has been a wolf in sheep's \nclothing: states and localities have been offered additional funding in \nexchange for adhering to federal rules and regulations. The result has \nbeen that local school officials, who are directly accountable to \nparents, have experienced increasingly less control over education.\n  The Gorton amendment gives local schools and States what they have \nbeen requesting for years: the flexibility to develop challenging \nacademic standards and programs that works in each locality. States and \ncommunities are where the action should be in designing standards and \nprograms. It is at those levels that disputes are most likely to be \nresolved and important local priorities recognized. We must return to \nthe traditional role of education and reduce federal control.\n  States and local school districts are making great strides in \neducating our young people; however, the federal government cannot \ncontinue to impede their ability to provide a high-quality education \nwhich they are perfectly capable of doing. The Gorton amendment sends \nus in the right direction, allowing both parents and educators to work \ntogether for quality education. It is bringing education back where it \nbelongs: at the local level. We have lost too much already by the \nimpositions of the federal government, and it is time to remedy this \nproblem to prepare our children for the 21st century.\n  This amendment will ease regulations that prevent teachers, school \nadministrators, and parents from doing what is best to improve their \nschools. Our goal is to ensure that our children are equipped with \nsolid academic basics, which is learning to read, write, compute, \nthink, and speak. There is no need to reinvent the wheel because we \nknow what works and that is parents, teachers, and local communities \nworking together to find local solutions to local problems to educate \nour children. We know that our children could be doing better and I \nwant to ensure that local schools have every possible resource to make \nthat happen.\n  Mr. President, the Gorton amendment will help strengthen our \neducational system by increasing local school district's flexibility \nand funding to improve the quality of education for our children. I am \nproud to support this amendment and urge my colleagues to adopt this \nprovision in conference.\n\n\n                   NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR HUMANITIES\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the National Endowment for Humanities (NEH). While I am aware of \nthe national importance of the NEH, I am particularly supportive of \ncontinued federal funding for NEH because of the regular and critical \nfunding my state of South Dakota receives. Grants from NEH are vital to \nthe people of my state in preserving the rich and unique cultural \nheritage of South Dakota and the surrounding great plains states.\n  NEH programs exemplify the type of federal-state-local partnerships \nthat have traditionally fostered a collective dedication to cultural \nand historic education. The NEH gives state humanities councils the \nnecessary freedoms to meet local education needs. In the last five \nyears, institutions in South Dakota have received roughly $2.7 million \nfrom the NEH and the South Dakota Humanities Council for a variety of \nlibrary programs and exhibits, literary publications, and cultural \nheritage visitors centers.\n  The South Dakota Humanities Council relies on the NEH for 90 percent \nof its funding. That support goes directly to schools and small \ncommunities for projects like ``Calamity Jane: The Woman and the \nLegend'' produced by the Deadwood Historic Preservation Commission, and \n``Lakota: Language, History, and Culture'' at the Bonesteel Fairfax \nSchool. At the same time, broader educational projects continue the \nliterary legacy of many of this nation's most acclaimed authors and \nlong time South Dakota residents, including Laura Ingalls Wilder, who \ngave us the ``Little House'' series, and L. Frank Baum, author of the \nclassic ``The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.'' This year, South Dakota \ncelebrated Baum's work with the Wizard of Oz Festival in Baum's \nhometown of Aberdeen. This festival bloomed into a statewide, year-long \ncelebration, including reading programs in public schools, travelling \neducational programs, and symposiums involving scholarly \ninterpretations of Baum's work at state colleges and universities. This \nfar reaching festival celebrating Frank Baum's literature was made \npossible through several NEH grants.\n  The many NEH-funded heritage fairs and events held throughout my \nstate every year are endorsed by the South Dakota State Arts and \nHumanities Councils, as well as state and local tourism authorities. \nRecently, the South Dakota State Humanities Council received one of \nonly two national awards presented at the National Conference of State \nHumanities Councils for the Oscar Michaux Festival'' held in Gregory, \nSD. These and countless other worthy public education programs will \ndisappear in my rural State, and the creativity behind this type of \neducation programming will be thwarted if efforts to gut or eliminate \nthe NEH continue.\n  Although the United States provides far less public support for the \nhumanities than we spend on military bands, the NEH continues to play a \ncritically important role in improving the quality of life in rural \nareas, such as South Dakota. I will continue to support Federal funding \nfor the humanities because of the NEH's very positive assistance to \ncultural and historic organizations and schools throughout America.\n\n\n                   LOW-INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague from \nWashington in a colloquy on the importance of the Low-Income \nWeatherization Assistance Program and the State Energy Conservation \nProgram to the people of New York, as well as the entire country.\n  Mr. President, I would first like to acknowledge the fact that \nChairman Gorton has crafted a good bill under difficult circumstances. \nThis bill combines a number of different agencies and functions within \na tight budget cap, and I appreciate his effort to balance these \ndifferent needs.\n  Mr. President, the Weatherization Program upgrades the energy \nefficiency of the homes of the poor, elderly, and disabled in this \nNation. This is important in warm and cold climates alike, providing \npeople with long-term solutions to housing affordability. This program \nis highly effective with low administrative costs. The State Energy \nConservation Program permits States to target energy programs in all \nsectors of the economy, from making schools and hospitals more energy \nefficient to promoting alternative motor\n\n[[Page S9626]]\n\nfuels and renewable energy. This program is highly leveraged with large \namounts of State, local, and private funding. As the country moves \nforward to restructure the electric industry, these two programs will \nbe all the more important to meet the needs of low-income families.\n  Mr. President, the committee's bill provides $5 million more than the \nHouse-passed bill for weatherization and $1.1 million more than the \nHouse for the State Energy Conservation Program. I would like to urge \nSenator Gorton to stand firm in support of the Senate numbers in \nconference with the House.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I appreciate the kind remarks of my \ncolleague from New York. I would like to assure him that I will seek to \nuphold the Senate position on the weatherization program and the State \nEnergy Conservation Program in conference. I appreciate the help and \ninterest of the Senator from New York in these two important programs.\n  Mr. D'AMATO. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think we are ready now for final passage \non the Interior appropriations bill. I thank all the Senators for their \ncooperation. I'm sorry it took so long to get to this point.\n  Senator Daschle and I have been working on a unanimous-consent \nagreement that would allow us to pass this bill and to get an \nunderstanding of how we will proceed on the FDA reform.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Agreement--S. 830\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nfiling of the cloture motion on the FDA bill tonight, Senator Kennedy \nbe recognized for debate only for up to 1 hour, and the pending Harkin \namendment be temporarily laid aside until Tuesday, September 23.\n  I further ask that when the Senate reconvenes on Friday, all time \nfrom adjournment on Thursday and reconvening on Friday count against \nthe 30-hour cap postcloture.\n  I further ask that the Durbin amendments Nos. 1139 and 1140 be in \norder on Friday and limited to 30 minutes each, equally divided, and \nthe votes occur in a stacked sequence at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, \nSeptember 23, with 2 minutes for debate between each vote.\n  Further, I ask unanimous consent that the time between 9:30 a.m. and \n10:30 a.m. on Friday be under the control of Senator Kennedy for debate \nonly, and when the Senate resumes consideration of FDA on Tuesday, \nSeptember 23, that 5 hours remain postcloture to be equally divided, \nand following the stacked votes, Senator Reed of Rhode Island be \nrecognized to offer his amendment No. 1177 and all other provisions of \nrule XXII remain in status quo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. Therefore, in light of this agreement, the next vote \ntonight will be the last vote this week. The next votes will occur at \n9:30 a.m., Tuesday, September 23.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which the \nbill was passed.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I move that the Senate insist on its \namendments, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses, and that the President be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The motion was agreed to, and the Presiding Officer [Mr. Hagel] \nappointed Mr. Gorton, Mr. Stevens, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Domenici, Mr. \nBurns, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \nBumpers, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Reid, Mr. Dorgan, and Mrs. Boxer conferees \non the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. GORTON. As the Presiding Officer is well aware, this has been a \nhighly complex bill with a large number of amendments, colloquies, \ninquiries, extensive debate and the like, and it almost, but not quite, \ngoes without saying that it would have been impossible to reach this \npoint without the service of large numbers of dedicated staff, many of \nthose for individual Senators with whom my staff and committee staff \nhave worked. But I want particularly to thank Ginny James, Anne \nMcInerney, Martin Delgado, Hank Kashdan, and Kevin Johnson of the \nmajority staff of the Interior subcommittee for countless hours in \npreparing the bill and helping me in debate; Sue Masica, Lisa Mendelson \nand Carole Geagley, of Senator Byrd's staff, for similar and equally \nimportant work. The two staff directors of the overall Appropriations \nCommittee in the minority, Steve Cortese and Jim English; from my own \npersonal staff, Chuck Berwick and Nina Nguyen, who also have worked \ncountless hours. But most of all, the young man sitting beside me, \nBruce Evans, who is the new staff director for the Interior \nsubcommittee, who has gone through this for the first time with flying \ncolors; who seems to be able to write some of my remarks in exactly the \nsame way I would phrase them myself and who has been vital to our \nsuccess. I hope this praise spurs them on to ever more successful work \nas we deal with the House, and the many differences between the two \nbills.\n\n  Finally, I want to say, Mr. President, even though he is absent, how \ngreatly I appreciated the guidance and support of Senator Byrd, the \nmost senior Member of the Democratic Party, the ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee, and of course the ranking member of this \nsubcommittee. From the moment I took the chairmanship of the \nsubcommittee, he has been helpful and cooperative. He has pointed out \nmany pitfalls into which I otherwise would have fallen, and has been a \ntrue friend and colleague, in a bill I think it is safe to say that is \nhighly bipartisan in nature. In spite of the many amendments with great \ncontests, most of\n\n[[Page S9627]]\n\nthem have involved votes that have crossed party lines. And Senator \nByrd has been a wonderful ally and friend in that connection.\n  With that, I am ready to go to conference on this bill and allow the \nSenate to move onto another subject.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9601-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  (During today's session of the Senate, the following morning business \nwas transacted.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9627-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9627-S9630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FAST TRACK NEGOTIATING AUTHORITY ON TRADE AGREEMENTS\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, The President this week submitted to the \nCongress the ``Export Expansion and Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of \n1997'', designed to renew so-called ``fast track'' procedures for trade \nagreements. There are many issues associated with this proposal, \nevidenced by the reports that the White House has essentially \nestablished a ``war room'' to marshall the votes in the Congress to \nsupport its proposal. We all know the United States needs to be \ncompetitive in foreign markets, and we all know the administration \nneeds to strike the best deals it can with foreign nations on behalf of \nAmerican business and consumers. There is no dispute over these goals. \nMy concern today is over the procedure which the administration wishes \nto incorporate in considering this proposal which is driven by the \ninsistence by the Clinton Administration that it can only be effective \nin promoting U.S. trade and negotiating such agreements if the \nlegislative vehicle we consider is subject to one up-and-down vote, \nafter a period of limited debate.\n  The administration has elevated its desire to eliminate the \nopportunity for the Congress to amend such enacting legislation to the \nstature or degree of a religious mantra. The administration seems to \nthink that any agreement it submits to the Congress will, in fact, be \namended, forcing it to renegotiate agreements it has reached with \nforeign nations and thereby shredding its stature as a negotiator The \nargument goes that fast-track authority is critical because it sends to \nour negotiating partners a necessary promise of good faith, that is, \nthey will know that the deals hammered out at the negotiating table \nwon't be dismembered by amendments in the Congress. The proposition is \nnow being stated and restated by the administration's legions ad \nnauseam that without fast track all is lost, American leadership is \ngone, nations won't negotiate with us, our strategy on trade as a \nnation will fail, the sky will go dark, all life forms will perish, and \non and on. These assertions are repeated at every opportunity, as if \nrepetition really makes them valid. I say they are wild exaggerations, \nwild exaggerations, wild exaggerations, which underestimate both the \ncapabilities of our negotiators and the sound judgment of the Congress \nof the United States.\n  Mr. President, the insistence on the no-amendment strategy reveals a \nstaggering lack of confidence on the part of the administration in its \nown negotiating prowess. It suggests that, heaven forbid, possible \nweaknesses in the agreements that are reached will be discovered and \nacted upon by the Congress. It shows no sense of confidence--no sense \nof confidence--on the part of the administration that it can prevail in \narguing the merits of a particular agreement to the Congress, thereby \nforcing the administration to return to the negotiating table to change \nan agreement. From what I understand, for instance, the relative tariff \nbarriers between the U.S. and Chile are such that an agreement reducing \nthe Chilean barriers is desirable. Why would the Congress not want to \nsupport an agreement that is in our interest in penetrating the Chilean \nmarket, to even out the playing field on trade matters between the U.S. \nand Chile?\n  There is no inconsistency between supporting free trade, or freer \ntrade, as negotiated by the administration around the world, and \npreserving the right of the Congress not only to scrutinize the \nagreements reached for their worthiness, but also to question, if \nnecessary, parts of the agreement that might appear not to be in our \noverall interest. If the administration does its job and negotiates \nsound agreements, they should be approved by the Congress as such, \nintact, regardless if there is ``fast-track'' procedure or not. The \nSenate is not unresponsive to arguments made by the administration that \nan international agreement that it has negotiated is in the national \ninterest and that amendments could unravel it. That is not to say that \nif there is a flaw in the agreement that is serious enough for \nrenegotiation, it may just be in the American national interest for the \nnegotiators to be forced to go back to the table by the people's \nelected representatives and get it right. If they do the job right in \nthe first place, renegotiation should not be necessary.\n  Mr. President, one could just as easily make the case that, if the \nSenate retained amending authority, our negotiators might just come up \nwith a somewhat better product, knowing that the entire agreement will \nbe scrutinized by the elected representatives of the American people. \nAfter all, the agreements that are negotiated are presumably on the \nbehalf of the American people, the same constituency that is \nrepresented by this Senate. On the other hand, the Senate has a \nresponsibility to turn back amendments that might be offered \nrepresenting special interests, but not the overall American interest. \nThat is the ``American Way.'' Would such amendments be offered? \nPossibly. Would they be approved by a majority of Senate? Not if the \nAmerican interest in the overall agreement would be hurt. This body has \nthe capability of exerting leadership on trade, just as on any other \nmatter. It can do what is in the best interests of the nation and yet \nnot kill trade agreements through special interest amendments.\n  The administration, in its insistence on a no-amendment treaty on \ntrade indicates either a lack of confidence in the integrity of this \nbody, or a lack of confidence on the part of its own negotiators, or \njust simply a desire to have its way and not have to do the hard work \nof convincing the Senate of the value of the agreement that it has just \nnegotiated.\n  It wants to have it the easy way, no questions asked, just present \nthe agreement to the Senate and the House of Representatives and both \nbodies just roll over and sleep, sleep, sleep; not have to do the hard \nwork of convincing the Senate of the value of the agreement that it has \njust negotiated.\n  None of these reasons seems to justify eliminating through a special \nprocedure the power of this body to amend if a majority of this body, \nor the other body, finds it necessary to do so. None of this justifies \nCongress' handing off its exclusive power under Article I Section 8, of \nthe Constitution, to ``regulate Commerce with foreign nations''. The \namending potential is a healthy check on sloppy work. The amending \npotential can prevent a lazy presentation of the issues, or just plain \nbad negotiating results.\n  Here is what one pundit says about the need for fast-track \nnegotiating authority. According to David Rothkopf, in an article \nappearing in the current issue of ``The New Democrat'': ``If the United \nStates doesn't have fast-track authority it cannot negotiate \nagreements.''\n  Piffle! That is sheer nonsense, ``If the United States doesn't have \nfast-track authority it cannot negotiate agreements.''\n  It goes on to say that this is supposedly a crucial tool that the \n``administration needs,'' according to Mr. Rothkopf ``to ensure that \nU.S. businesses and workers are treated fairly in the global economy.'' \nI contend that this is all a non sequitur--it just does not follow that \npreserving the power of the Senate over legislation is inconsistent \nwith America's ability to negotiate agreements. If the Congress does \nnot want the trading environment supposedly created by particular \nagreements, it can vote the whole thing down. Fast track authority does \nnot, somehow by itself, produce an immediate supporting of freer trade \nin the Congress.\n\n  The administration has expended a huge amount of energy in an \nexercise to convince the Congress to foreswear its normal ability to \namend legislation. And there will be some in here who will fall for \nthat. The administration might be better served to put those tremendous \nenergies into negotiating sound agreements with our negotiating \npartners and then selling the\n\n[[Page S9628]]\n\nvalue of those agreements to the Congress on the merits of the \nagreements themselves.\n  Mr. President, the highly respected head of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative's office, Ambassador Charlene Barshefsky, who did such \nan excellent job in negotiating an intellectual property agreement with \nChina, made a presentation before the Senate Finance committee on \nyesterday, Wednesday, in support of the administration's fast track \nproposal to the Senate. She asserted that fast track is ``critical to \nincrease access to foreign markets.'' I would think, rather, that good \nsolid provisions in a trade agreement, resulting from negotiations that \nfocus on what is in our national interest, will increase America's \naccess to foreign markets. Fast track consideration of poorly \nnegotiated, badly constructed provisions would not necessarily give us \nincreased access. Fast track of the Intellectual Property agreement \nwith the Chinese did not make the negotiating process with the Chinese, \nalways excruciatingly difficult, any easier. There is no substitute for \ntough implementation and policing of solid provisions, as Ambassador \nBarshefsky well knows. She is a fine negotiator, but had to negotiate \nthat agreement twice, and it still is not clear that we have free \naccess to the Chinese market and that the provisions safeguarding U.S. \nintellectual property are yet in place in the Chinese market. This has \nnothing whatever to do with fast track, slow track or any other track \non the Senate floor. It has to do with the implementation of agreements \nto gain access to those markets, a very serious problem in the Pacific \nwhere the deficits we are running on our merchandise account are so \nhuge, and growing, that they themselves are the single major factor \njeopardizing the administration's so-called ``free trade'' philosophy.\n  Mrs. Barshefsky stated in her testimony that, under fast track, the \n``Congress and the President work together.'' We can, and do, certainly \nwork together, day in and day out on legislation of all kinds and all \nsubjects without, however, crippling our authority to amend those \nvehicles. Can one really say that we in the Senate are less serious \nabout trade when we wish to scrutinize and carefully assess all parts \nof a trade agreement? Nonsense!\n  Mrs. Barshefsky echoes the administration's line--here it is: ``if we \ndo not renew fast track, . . . our trading partners are not willing to \nwait for us to pass another bill.'' Who believes that? Who will believe \nthat? In other words they won't negotiate with us if we in the Congress \ndon't grant the administration nonamendable rules and limited debate \nconcessions. This is absurd! Absurd. If our trading partners believe \nthat trade agreements with us are in their own national interest, it \nstrains my credulity to hear that they will not negotiate trade \nagreements with us in the absence of fast track. From 1934 to 1974, \nthere was no fast track, and Mrs. Barshefsky testified that in those 40 \nyears, ``Congress gave the president authority to negotiate mutual \ntariff reductions with our trading partners. Congress renewed that \nauthority repeatedly over the years and successive Presidents used that \nauthority to dramatically reduce tariff barriers around the world.'' \nSo, apparently over that 40-year period, our trading partners were \nwilling to negotiate with us with no mention of truncated legislative \nrules. Everything was fine.\n  Mrs. Barshefsky goes on to testify that to complete the negotiating \nagenda of the World Trade Organization, in government procurement, \nintellectual property rights, agriculture and services, where we seek \nenhanced global access to markets, ``we must have fast track authority \nto enter these various talks or countries will not put meaningful \noffers on the table.'' Now, who is so gullible as to believe that? I \njust do not believe this assertion, provided the agreements to be \nreached are in the interests of the negotiating countries. And we have \nto assume that that will be their goal, to reach agreements that are in \ntheir own interests. Countries seek to promote their self-interests, \nfast track or slow track, or whatever track, and it is the job of our \nnegotiators to get the best deal possible. It is just a typical \nbargaining situation.\n  Mr. President, Senators might well consider the impact of fast track-\nno amendment authority on the basic leverage available to U.S. \nnegotiators. I believe the proposition that fast track enhances U.S. \nnegotiators' capabilities is open to very serious question. It would be \na matter of enhanced leverage for U.S. negotiators that a certain \nmatter should be included in an agreement because it is a matter of \nstrong concern to the Senate. The threat that a provision would not be \nsupported by the Senate is a threat that I as a negotiator, if I were a \nnegotiator, might like to have as additional leverage in a negotiation. \nFast track eliminates this form of leverage. There is nobody watching \nover your shoulder. The administration maintains that fast track \nauthority prohibiting amendments ``tells U.S. trading partners that the \nUnited States speaks at the bargaining table with one voice and that \nthe Congress will not seek to reopen trade agreements after they are \nnegotiated'', according to the documents accompanying the President's \nproposal delivered to the Senate yesterday. I think that, on the \ncontrary, this basically weakens the leverage available to our \nnegotiators in dealing with tough issues at the table vis-a-vis the \nrepresentatives of other nations.\n  It is our apparent inability to implement agreements which promise \naccess abroad that is the central trouble in our trading situation, and \nthe continued inability of the administration to address and begin to \nsolve it will be the key problem--not fast track--over the next decade \nregarding the so-called global market. Indeed, the administration would \ndo well to worry about congressional reaction over the next couple of \nyears to this situation. It would do well to spend less time trying to \nmanipulate protective devices around its agreements when they are \nconsidered by the Congress.\n  Does the frenzied attempt by the administration to wrap a protective \ncover around the agreements it negotiates have anything to do with what \nhas been generally acknowledged to be an overselling of the NAFTA--the \nNorth American Free Trade Agreement--a few years ago? That was \noversold. The overpromising of the benefits of that agreement should \ninstruct us that the administration needs to be more careful in \nevaluating what it has actually accomplished. A dose of reality and \ncaution in marketing the prowess of our negotiators would be well \nadvised. If the Senate provided the President the authority to \nnegotiate trade agreements, but failed to give him protection against \namendments, it would not be the end of the world. The skies would not \nfall, the mountains would not crumble, the waters in the oceans would \nnot rise. It would not be the end. My bet is that a good agreement with \nChile, for example, could be reached which would sail through the \nCongress. At the same time, one would hope that the era of the oversell \nwould be ended. And we have had that oversell for many, many years. \nEvery administration that comes in, Republican and Democrat, wants to \nhave it all their way. They don't want Congress to have a say when it \ncomes to amending a trade treaty.\n  This extensive marketing job for fast track is a transparent attempt, \nusing the most exaggerated series of assertions I have heard on any \nmatter in a long time, to stampede the Senate into abandoning its \nconstitutional right, its constitutional power, its constitutional \nprerogatives over fundamental legislation affecting the people of the \nUnited States in the market and at the mall. Now we hear a drumbeat \nthat if you are for unlimited debate, if you are for amendable \ntreatment of trade agreements and implementing legislation, like \nvirtually all other kinds of legislation, you are a protectionist--you \nare a protectionist.\n  What a bad word. That's what you are. If you want to uphold the \npowers of the Constitution vested in the Senate and House, if you want \nto uphold those powers when it comes to trade, you are a protectionist. \nFie on you--a protectionist!\n  If you are for shortchanging the legislative process, you are for \nfree trade. That makes no sense whatever to me, for I am for free trade \nif it is fair to all parties, but I am for protecting Senate powers and \nresponsibilities in the handling of legislation which is, after all, \nour constitutional duty. And what do we mean when we say, ``I am for \nprotecting the Senate's power''? It means\n\n[[Page S9629]]\n\nI am for protecting the rights of the people, because those rights are \ngiven life here in this forum of the States. That is our constitutional \nduty, as I say. We should think long and hard before we concede this \nauthority. Senators need to read the fine print of the legislative \nproposal to understand just what broad powers are being relinquished \nand they need to go back and read the Constitution again. The \nadministration, I think, has it exactly backwards: instead of \nconcentrating its energies on accumulating as much leverage as it can \nvis-a-vis our trading partners, it is marshaling these energies in the \nopposite direction--wrong way Corrigan--inward, to convince the \nCongress to reduce its leverage, and by extension, the nation's vital \nleverage abroad.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I commend the distinguished leader, the \nSenator from West Virginia. He has really brought us a sobering \nreminder of the constitutional function of the National Congress. \nArticle I, section 8 of the Constitution doesn't say the Supreme Court \nnor the Executive, but rather the Congress shall regulate foreign \ncommerce.\n  As Senator Byrd mentions protectionists, I remember the second \ninauguration of President Reagan in the Rotunda due to inclement \nweather. The distinguished President, taking that oath, pledged with \nhand raised and the other hand on the Bible, to preserve, protect and \ndefend. Then we came back down and somehow got into a debate relative \nto trade and well, we were all protectionists.\n  We have the Army to protect us from enemies without; the FBI to \nprotect us from enemies within; we have Social Security to protect us \nfrom old age; Medicare to protect us from ill health. The very function \nof Government is to protect.\n  What is really at issue here, not just fast track on Mercosur or \nChile, but really the fact is that we as politicians, Republican and \nDemocrat both, come in and say, before you open up Gregg manufacturing, \nyou first must have clean air, clean water, minimum wage, Social \nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid, plant closing notice, parental leave, \nsafe machinery, safe working place. Oh, we all go around jumping up and \ndown to make sure that we have safe and healthy remunerative employment \nin America. Then we come around, and when the industry in my backyard \nmoves down to Mexico because labor costs just 58 cents an hour and \nindustry has none of those requirements, they say, ``Free trade, free \ntrade, free, free, free.'' There is nothing free.\n  Cordell Hull said reciprocal free trade, competitive free trade. That \nhas to be understood. We have to understand more particularly that the \nsecurity and success of this Republic stands like on a three-legged \nstool. We have the one leg of the values we have as a Nation. That is \nunquestioned. For instance, we commit ourselves to try and bring about \npeace in the Mideast. Our Secretary of State continued to try just this \npast week.\n  We commit our troops in Bosnia for peacekeeping. We have an ongoing \nambassador there in Northern Ireland. Our values for freedom and the \nindividual rights are unquestioned, and our second leg of military \nstrength and power is unquestioned.\n  That third leg, though, the economic leg, is somewhat fractured, \nintentionally --for the simple reason that we sacrificed our economy to \nkeep the alliance together in the cold war.\n  I was here in those days when we just sort of gave away unfettered \naccess to American markets back in the 1950's, 1960's, right on up here \nuntil now. Today, however, there is a sobering of the American people. \nAn overwhelming majority of the American people, according to the \nBusiness Week that has just come out, oppose fast track because they \nhave had enough of this nonsense going on and on and on. Ten years ago \nwe had 26 percent of our work force in manufacturing and we are down to \n13 percent. We are not making things.\n  Look at the business page of the Wall Street Journal, this morning. \nThere is an article entitled--``Remember When Companies Actually \nCreated Products.'' Now they don't make things.\n  I can see Akio Morita, the former chairman of the board of Sony at a \nseminar in Chicago, IL, in the early 1980's, talking of Third World \nemerging nations, how they could become nation-states. He counseled, in \norder to become a nation-state, they had to have a strong manufacturing \ncapacity. He finally pointed over toward me, and he said: ``And that \nworld power that loses its manufacturing power will cease to be a world \npower.''\n  That is the global competition that this Congress has to wake up and \nlisten to. It is competitive free trade. It is not just the \nenvironment. It is not just the labor rights. It is the overall picture \nof making agreements for the public good.\n  Let me get right to just one point, one comment made by my \ndistinguished leader from West Virginia reminds me now of the arrogance \nof power.\n  As a young Governor back in 1961, I had negotiated a sort of policy \nwith respect to textiles. In order to permit the President to \npromulgate a sort of textile trade policy, the law required that you \nhad to find the item in question important to our national security.\n  We coordinated five Secretaries--Labor, Commerce, State, Defense, and \nAgriculture. And after hearings, we found that textiles was, next to \nsteel, the second most important. You could not send the troops to war \nin a Japanese uniform.\n  I came over to the White House. There had been leaders in the \nCongress advocating the same kind of policy. For the first time I got \nan inkling of the White House staff. They do not look upon Congress as \na friend. They look upon Congress as the adversary. They are always \nplanning daily for their President to get around Congress or forget \nabout Congress or thwart Congress. It is just a mindset.\n  This was confirmed later. As a freshman Senator I was allowed to be \non the policy committee. I was listening to the distinguished senior \nSenator from Arkansas, Senator Fulbright, then chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, talking about the arrogance of power, not just \nthat we were trying to impose the American way the world around, but \nhow we became involved in the war in Vietnam.\n  Our wonderful friend, my hero of long time, Senator Dick Russell of \nGeorgia, spoke up and said, ``Well, these Presidents and Vice \nPresidents travel the world around and make all kinds of commitments, \nand then come back here and give us the bill, and Congress is not even \nin on it, and we don't even know what it is, and we have to put the \nmoney up for it.''\n  He said, ``The Vice President has just gone around and promised a \ncamel driver something.'' I remember it was when President Johnson was \nthe President. Senator Mansfield, the majority leader, turned to \nSenator Russell and said, ``Write that up as a resolution, sort of a \ncommitments resolution.'' And Senator Russell had emphysema, and he \nsaid, ``No. That's really for Senator Fulbright.'' Senator Fulbright \ndid it. It did not get far because the stance taken by Senator \nFulbright in those days was not popular. Later it was taken up by \nSenator Javits. We passed it. The President vetoed the commitments \nresolution, and we overrode the veto. The arrogance of power over at \nthe White House.\n\n  Now comes trade. We know you need not have any kind of fast track for \ncomplicated treaties and agreements. The Salt I treaty--I was here in \nthat particular debate. We did not have fast track for that. The \nintermediate missile debate, more recently the Chemical Warfare Treaty, \nnobody said, fast track. But the business community is superimposed. \nThey are the multinational policy of money, money, money. They do not \nhave the responsibility of the economy. They have the responsibility of \nmaking money. They do not have to look out for that third leg that I \nspoke of.\n  So having been up here with NAFTA, with an undemocratic agreement, \nthat certainly has not worked. They said, ``We're going to add jobs.'' \nWe have minus jobs. They said, ``We're going to have a surplus in the \nbalance of trade,'' We went from plus $5 billion balance to minus $16 \nbillion balance.\n  They said NAFTA would solve other problems. Immigration has gotten \nworse. I can talk at length on these\n\n[[Page S9630]]\n\nthings. It was going to solve the drug problem. The drug problem got \nworse.\n  But they are still trying, they put up the white tent and they got \nthe country's rich to lobby. I have heard from constituents that the \nBusiness Roundtable has now written their members and said: $100,000 is \nyour pledge to come up with. We have already got 60 percent \nperformance. We are getting up a multimillion dollar kitty to bamboozle \nthat Congress. Put up the white tent and go ahead and make another \nagreement.\n  What really nettles the Senator from South Carolina is that while we \ncannot amend, they do. I will never forget, when I was first in the \nState legislature back in the 1940s, they had a Representative Keenan \nfrom Aiken County who kept running around: ``Big you and little me; big \nyou and little me.'' Well, here I am almost 50 years later--``Big you \nand little me''--and what we have is just that, the President coming \nalong and saying, ``Here is the agreement. Take it or leave it. And by \nthe way, I will amend it in order to get sufficient votes.''\n  In NAFTA, let us have a little quick rollcall here. We had the orange \njuice commitment to get the Florida vote. I was talking to that crowd \nand had some votes, I thought, at one time because Castro was selling \nhis citrus to Mexico and Mexico was selling their citrus to us. I was \ngoing to use that, but they made a commitment that it would not occur, \nin order to get the Florida vote.\n  Textiles and apparel. I will never forget, I was amazed at one in my \ndelegation--a few textile Senators were voting for it for the simple \nreason they promised more customs agents to cut out the over $5 billion \nof transshipments illegally coming into this country. Thousands of \njobs; $1 billion is for 20,000 jobs; $5 billion is 100,000 jobs. So \nthey gave in.\n  The Canadian transportation subsidy of durum wheat. That got the \nNorthwest and some fellows up there. And then the administration, the \nexecutive branch, worked on high fructose sugar. They picked up the \nLouisiana vote on that one. Then the snap back for winter vegetables. \nThat was a California vote. Peanut butter for Georgia and wine for more \nCalifornians.\n  Oh, they just went around. By the time I went around and tried to \ntalk sense, the Congressman or the Senator was put in a position, \n``Well, I'm against this fast track and I'm against this agreement, and \nordinarily I would vote against the agreement, but I got this, and this \nhappens to particularly pertain to my State, so I've got to go along.''\n  There were stricter rules of origin for beef imports, domestic \nappliances for Iowa.\n  Mr. President, if you did not get in on this, I am giving a rollcall \nhere so you can hurry up and get in on the deal.\n  Additional purchases of C-17 military cargo. That was down in Texas. \nWe had that vote that said, ``Oh, no, we're going to get more C-17's.'' \nSo we lost that Congressman. And the Cross Border Development Bank--\nthere was a Congressman from California that got the Cross Border \nDevelopment Bank. Worker retraining, urban development, a bridge in \nHouston, the Center for the Study of Trade. My friend Jake Pickle, he \nwas gone. He got the Center for Trade. That was gone. They gathered \nsome votes by scaling back a proposal regarding grazing fees on public \nlands.\n  They even considered lowering the proposed increase in cigarette \ntaxes to pick up some North Carolina votes. Flat glass for Michigan, \nhelium, asparagus, pipe.\n  Well, what you have, Mr. President, is just that, the use of patience \nin article I, section 8, of the Constitution. I will never forget \nGeorge Washington's Farewell Address. He said: If in the opinion of the \npeople, the distribution or modification of the powers under the \nConstitution be in any particular wrong, let it be changed in the way \nthat the Constitution designates. For while you are so patient you may \nin the one instance be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed.\n  What we are finding is the Executive with the arrogance of power \ncoming in and superimposing the Business Roundtable, the white tent and \nthe minions running around swapping off, wheeling and dealing, so that \nthe people generally cannot be heard. It is a disgrace. It is the use \nof patience. And it is an endangerment to our country.\n  Fast track. Chile. I said at the time of NAFTA I would agree with a \nfree trade agreement with Chile. Chile had the entities of a free \nmarket--labor rights, due process, property rights. They had a concern \nfor the environment, a respected judiciary. They had convicted the \nmurderers of Letelier. Mexico had none of that.\n  Our distinguished colleague from New York was saying, just bringing \nit into focus, saying ``how can you have free trade when you do not \neven have a free election?'' That is the difference between Chile and \nMexico. Chile is the one country they have in mind, not the other \nmembers of the WTO. They do not need fast track to negotiate with \nChile.\n  But this is just their way of doing business so that they will not \nhave to fool with the Congress. They make it a take it or leave it \ndeal. And giving out the amendments--yes, the Executive can amend, but \nthe Congress cannot.\n  I say, bring on the treaty and let us vote it up or down. There could \nbe an amendment on Chile for wine. We have to take care of that \nindustry out on the west coast, some other things of that kind. But \nthat isn't the way now of doing business here.\n  What we come to do, which is outrageous in and of itself, is actually \nstart back from the lowering of the deficits. Fiscal responsibility is \ngone. I will go over that because that is even more important--We \npassed the so-called spending increases and revenue decreases, spending \nincreases and tax cuts, and running around all over the Halls of \nCongress calling ``Balance, balance, balance.''\n  In less than 2 weeks' time, on September 30, this particular fiscal \nyear will terminate and the Congressional Budget Office, on page 35 of \ntheir recent report, says we will have a deficit not of $36 or $37 \nbillion as they are trying to write about in the media but a deficit of \n$177 billion.\n  Five years out, my distinguished friend, 5 years out, instead of a \nbalanced budget agreement and a balanced budget law or reconciliation \nbill, we will have a deficit of $161 billion. During that 5-year \nperiod, add it up, those deficits, and the Government of the United \nStates will spend an additional $1 trillion more than we take in. And \nall the time we are talking about balance. How can you spend $1 \ntrillion more than you take in, and get to balance? Or how can you \nincrease your spending and cut your revenues, at the same time, and say \n``We are going to reduce the deficit and have balance?'' Obviously, you \ncannot.\n  It is time we talk sense to the American people. As Adlai Stevenson \nused to say, ``Let's get the facts on top of the table.''\n  This fast track is a disgrace. It is in total disregard of the needs \nof the American people. They are out there competing. The productivity \nof the industrial work of the United States is at its highest. What is \nnot competing is the Government here in Washington.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9627-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9630-S9631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, yesterday, President Clinton held a press \nconference in which he outlined his reasons for refusing to sign onto \nthe Oslo Land Mine Treaty. As my colleagues know, this treaty is \nintended to eliminate the horrible and very real carnage thrust on \npeople of war torn countries by abandoned and old-fashioned land mines. \nThe President said that the refusal of the signatories to consider our \nNation's security requirements with regard to our use of self-\ndeactivating, so-called smart mines, and our obligations to the defense \nof our loyal South Korean allies, represented a line which he simply \ncould not cross for the good of the Nation.\n  Honesty compels me to speak out when I disagree. It also demands that \nI recognize a person when he is right without regard to which side of \nthe aisle he may occupy. I rise today to commend the President's act of \ncourage in refusing to sign the Oslo Treaty, and for being willing to \nstand up and say we need to protect our soldiers when they have to be \nin the field. As we all know, the pressure on him to sign--especially \nduring the last several weeks--has been worldwide, relentless, and most \nintense--even from his own party.\n  Thankfully for our troops, the President understands the danger of \ntaking this defensive weapon away from them. Thankfully for our troops, \nthe President understands the importance of land mines to the defense \nof the hottest spot on the globe today--the Korean Peninsula. \nThankfully for our troops, the President understands that taking smart \nmines away will not help one person in any mine-infested country in the \nworld. Thankfully for our troops, the President understands that you \nsimply cannot legislate the horror out of war.\n  I commend President Clinton for his exercise of good judgment in the \nface of overwhelming public pressure to do otherwise. I also commend \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff and all the many generals and admirals, both \nretired and active duty, including Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who have \nmade their opposition to this treaty known. I commend so many of my \ncolleagues who, during recent meetings with Canadian lawmakers, \nexpressed their support for the President's efforts. Finally, I command \nSecretary of Defense Cohen, for his wise counsel.\n  Regrettably, the effort to take this necessary defensive weapon away \nfrom our troops is still active. There is still legislation proposed \nthat would do exactly that. But yesterday a battle was won in that \nstruggle, and every American soldier, current and future, who might \never have to go into harm's way, and each mother, father, son, and \ndaughter owes our President a debt of gratitude. He did the right thing \nfor our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9631-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9631-S9632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ABUSIVE AND EXPLOITATIVE CHILD LABOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an important \nissue, child labor. Over the years, I have come to this floor many \ntimes to speak about abusive and exploitative child labor and have \nintroduced legislation to combat it.\n  But today I am here to specifically raise awareness about child \nservitude and to speak out against this horrific practice. Several \nyears ago, the South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude (SAACS) based \nin New Delhi, India, began to devote this day, September 18, to raising \nawareness about children forced to work. I would like to take a moment \nto talk about SAACS and their endeavors under the leadership of my good \nfriend, Kailash Satiyarti. In April of this year, I visited Mukti \nAshram or liberation retreat established by SAACS which is located \noutside of New Delhi. This is a place where bonded child laborers are \nfreed from the shackles of slavery and are able to attend school, learn \na trade and most importantly to regain their self-worth. I was deeply \nmoved by these children and impressed by their progress in overcoming \ntheir previous circumstances.\n  Mr. President, I want to be clear. I am not talking about children \nwho work part-time after school or on weekends. There's nothing wrong \nwith that. I worked in my youth--perhaps so did you. That is not the \nissue.\n  The issue is children who are forced to work in hazardous \nenvironments--many under slave-like conditions who sweat long hours for \nlittle or no pay and are thus denied education or the opportunity to \ngrow and develop. It's the kind of work that endangers a child's \nphysical and emotional well-being.\n  And let there be no mistake: When the growth of children is stopped \nso is the growth of a nation.\n  I would also like to take a moment to remember a former child laborer \nwhose life was ended but whose message still resonates throughout the \nworld. His name was Iqbal Masih. He was sold into slavery at age of 4. \nHe was shackled to the carpet looms to slave 14 hours a day, 6 days a \nweek for 6 long years. Until, he broke free.\n  But instead of turning away from the hell that was his life, Iqbal \ndid the opposite. He brought his world to us. He showed us things we \ndidn't want to see. He told us things we didn't want to hear. And he \nchallenged us, when he said ``the world's enslaved children are your \nresponsibility.'' Iqbal Masih was a leader and a crusader, sadly, he \nwas assassinated on April 16, 1995. At the age of 13, his voice was \nsilenced. We remember him today and the hundreds of millions of \nchildren who toil away and remember them in the best way possible--by \nkeeping his message alive and his crusade going strong.\n  As I mentioned earlier, I traveled to South Asia in April and laid a \nwreath at Iqbal's grave in Pakistan. I also visited the school in Kasur \nthat was built in Iqbal's memory with the support of students from the \nBroad Meadows School in Quincy, MA and donations from children \nthroughout the United States.\n  Throughout my visit to South Asia, I carried the same message \neverywhere I went and to anyone who would listen: child labor is a big \nconcern in the United States and that concern is not going to go away. \nI am going to continue to work hard to make sure that it's on the \nagenda in Congress, at the United Nations next month, and at the ILO.\n  The definition of child labor is not an American standard--it is an \ninternational one. ILO Convention 138 is clear. The minimum age for \nemployment is 15 years--developing countries may invoke a transitional \nage of 14--and 18 years is the minimum for hazardous work.\n  Virtually every nation on Earth has similar laws on its books today. \nSo let me put to rest the notion that somehow this is the ``West'' \nimposing its will on others. These are not the West's standards. These \nare the world's standards.\n  And the fact is, some of the most powerful calls for the elmination \nof child labor have been sounded from the governments of the developing \nworld. The Delhi Declaration, adopted in 1995, includes a strongly \nworded resolution on child labor. As does a resolution adopted at last \nyear's ministerial conference of the South Asian Association of \nRegional Cooperation held in Pakistan.\n  I believe that it is our job to work together to transform the \nresolutions we adopt from words to deeds--from intentions to actions. \nAnd that is what I have committed much of my time and energy to doing.\n  In 1992, I introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act, the most \ncomprehensive legislative initiative in the United States to end \nabusive and exploitative child labor. Some called it revolutionary \nlegislation but, in truth, it is rooted in the most conservative of \nnotions: International trade cannot ignore international values.\n  It is true that the vast majority of child laborers do not work in \nthe export sector. And of course, the exploitation of children is \ndeplorable under any circumstances. But, the reason I have focused on \nchild labor in industries that export to the United States is that we \nneed to begin somewhere. The export sector is an area where we have \nleverage and where we can try and effect some change now.\n  Since the time I began my effort, support has grown tremendously. As \nI have traveled around the United States and spoken with people about \nthe issue of child labor, I have found that consumers want to get \ninvolved. They want information.\n  They want to know if products on the shelves are made by children. \nAnd they don't want to buy it if it is. A recent\n\n[[Page S9632]]\n\nsurvey by Marymount University of Virginia found that more than three \nout of four Americans said they would avoid shopping at stores if they \nwere aware that the goods sold there were made by child labor.\n  Consumers also said that they would be willing to pay more for a \ngarment if it were guaranteed to be made under humane conditions. So, \nMr. President, American consumers have spoken. They don't want to \nreward companies with their hard earned dollars by buying products made \nwith child labor.\n  And the Senate too has spoken. In 1993, this body appropriately put \nitself on record in opposition to the exploitation of children for \ncommercial gain. In my view this was the first step toward ending child \nlabor.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced a bill, the Child Labor Free Consumer \nInformation Act, to inform and empower American consumers by \nestablishing a voluntary labeling system for wearing apparel and \nsporting goods made without child labor. I support labeling for three \nfundamental reasons. First, it takes a comprehensive approach. It says \nlegislative assemblies--such as the U.S. Congress--can't do it alone \nthrough legislation. The U.S. Department of Labor--can't do it alone \nthrough enforcement. It takes all of us from the private sector to \nlabor groups to human rights organizations--to take responsibility and \nwork together. We must attack the scourge of child labor from all \nfronts.\n  Second, labeling is based on choice. Companies can choose whether to \nuse the label to keep consumers fully informed and consumers can choose \nto vote against child labor with their pocketbook.\n  Third, I support labeling because it is practical. It is working. \nEarlier this year, I traveled to India to visit Kailash Satyarthi, the \nfounder of South Asian Coalition on Child Servitude, and the RUGMARK \nheadquarters. RUGMARK is a label placed on hand-knotted carpets to \nassure consumers that they were made without child labor. In Europe, \nabout 700,000 carpets have been imported from India bearing the RUGMARK \nlabel. And here in the United States, where the RUGMARK campaign just \nbegan, several thousand rugs have already been imported.\n  So, Mr. President, I would conclude by saying this. We have made some \nprogress. Five years ago, I introduced the Child Labor Deterrence Act.\n  Four years ago, the U.S. Senate unanimously approved a resolution, \nwhich I sponsored, prohibiting the importation of products made by \nchild labor.\n  Three years ago, the U.S. Department of Labor began a series of \nreports on child labor that represents the most thorough documentation \never assembled by the American Government on this issue.\n  Two years ago, a historic memorandum of understanding was signed in \nBangladesh to move children from garment factories to schools.\n  Last year, a similar effort began in Pakistan in the soccer ball \nindustry.\n  Mr. President, in the coming weeks we will be debating the fast track \nlegislation which gives the President the authority to negotiate trade \nagreements. I have been a supporter of such legislation in the past. \nDuring these past weeks, I have had several meetings with members of \nthe administration and have raised my concerns about children making \ngoods or picking agricultural products in Mexico that end up in the \nUnited States.\n  So, Mr. President, I have to ask are the NAFTA side agreements on \nlabor standards adequately preventing the exploitation of children for \ncommercial gain?\n  According to the September 1 issue of the U.S. News and World Report, \nas many as 4 million children work in Mexico. These children can be \nfound gluing shoes in workshops, lifting two or three times their body \nweight in produce and cleaning up toxic oil residues, despite the laws \nin their country outlawing child labor.\n  Mr. President, the administration is fond of saying that trade \nagreements are necessary to level the playing field for American \nworkers, but for the life of me I can't understand how an American \nworker can compete with a child working 7 days a week, 14 hours a day \nfor 14 cents. The United States must not lower its standards rather we \nshould insist on countries raising their standards to ours.\n  It seems to me that the challenge before us is how to stop this \nexploitation. The global market is now the local market. Today our \nneighbors are no longer around the block, they are around the world. \nAnd we all have a responsibility to help our neighbors.\n  Now is the time to learn from our past trade agreements and insist on \na basic fundamental premise of protecting children. While, I don't \nclaim to have all the answers on eradicating child labor. I will \ncontinue my efforts to end the scourge of child labor. I am always \nlooking for new suggestions, ideas and approaches. But I do say the \nprogress that's been made on eradicating child labor is irreversible. \nWe must keep looking forward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9631-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION MODERNIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF \n                                  1977\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. 1198, introduced earlier today by \nSenator Abraham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1198) to amend the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act to provide permanent authority for entry into the United \n     States of certain religious workers.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide permanent authority for 5,000 visas per year for religious \ngroups to use to sponsor for permanent residency people who come to \nthis country to do God's work.\n  Mr. President, the Immigration Act of 1990 took a significant step in \nrecognizing the needs of America's religious institutions by creating \nthese religious worker visas. At that time the Act only provided \ntemporary authority for this program in order to see how it would work. \nI think we have now had enough experience with it to know that it works \nvery well. The time has come to place religious institutions on an \nequal footing with businesses and universities with regards to \nsponsoring needed workers by giving these visas the same status as all \nour other immigrant visas.\n  Prior to 1990, churches, synagogues, mosques, and their affiliated \norganizations experienced significant difficulties in trying to gain \nadmission for a much needed minister or other individual necessary to \nprovide religious services to their communities. The 1990 Act changed \nthat. It set aside 10,000 visas per year for ``special immigrants.'' Up \nto 5,000 of these visas annually can be used for ministers of a \nreligious denomination.\n  In addition, a related provision of the law provides 5,000 visas per \nyear to individuals working for religious organizations in ``a \nreligious vocation or occupation'' or in a ``professional capacity in a \nreligious vocation or occupation.'' This has allowed nuns, brothers, \ncantors, lay preachers, religious instructors, religious counselors, \nmissionaries, and other persons to work at their vocations or \noccupations for religious organizations or their affiliates. The \nsponsoring organization must be a bona fide religious organization or \nan affiliate of one, and must be certified or eligible to be certified \nunder Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. Religious workers \nmust have two years work experience to qualify for an immigrant visa. \nThe authority for these visas is what expires this year.\n  Mr. President, we often hear the charge that immigrants are somehow \ntaking from our communities, when, as I heard at a recent subcommittee \nhearing on this subject, the opposite is much more often the case. As \nBishop John Cummins of Oakland has written: ``Religious workers provide \na very important pastoral function to the American communities in which \nthey work and live, performing activities in furtherance of a vocation \nor religious occupation often possessing characteristics unique from \nthose found in the general labor market. Historically, religious \nworkers have staffed hospitals, orphanages, senior care homes and other \ncharitable institutions that provide benefits to society without public \nfunding.''\n  Bishop Cummins notes that ``The steady decline in native-born \nAmericans entering religious vocations and occupations, coupled with \nthe dramatically increasing need for charitable services in \nimpoverished communities makes the extension of this special immigrant \nprovision a necessity for numerous religious denominations in the \nUnited States.''\n  Mr. President, I and I am sure most Americans share Bishop Cummins' \nviews. Indeed the special immigrant program has won universal praise in \nreligious communities across the nation. Our office has received \nletters from religious orders and organizations throughout the nation. \nA recent letter signed jointly by Jewish, Catholic, Baptist, Lutheran \nand Evangelical organizations states: ``Failure to extend the [special \nimmigrant visa categories] would substantially undermine the services \nthat religious denominations and organizations in the United States \nprovide to their members, parishioners, and communities.\n  Mr. President, our nation was founded by people who came to these \nshores in search of a place where they and their children could worship \nfreely. It is only fitting that our country welcome those who wish to \nhelp our religious organizations provide pastoral and other relief to \npeople in need.\n  That is why I am introducing ``The Religious Workers Act of 1997.'' \nThis bill will eliminate the sunset provisions and extend permanently \nthe religious workers provisions of the Immigration and Nationality \nAct. I believe religious organizations' ability to sponsor individuals \nwho provide service to their local communities should be a permanent \nfixture of our immigration law, just as it is for those petitioning for \nclose family members and skilled workers. No longer should religious \ninstitutions have to worry about whether Congress will act in time to \nrenew the religious workers provisions. I am pleased that the entire \nleadership of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its Immigration \nSubcommittee--Senators Kennedy, Hatch, Leahy and I--\n\n[[Page S9634]]\n\nare cosponsoring this legislation, along with a large number of other \ncolleagues.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to close with a letter that was \nsent to me recently. It's a letter that helped convince me that we \nshould move without further delay toward permanent extension of the \nreligious workers provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act. \nThe letter reads as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Abraham:\n       I am writing to ask you to help us in solving a very urgent \n     problem. My Sisters in New York have told me that the law \n     which allows the Sisters to apply for permanent residence in \n     the United States expires on September 30, 1997. Please, will \n     you do all that you can to have that law extended so that all \n     Religious will continue to have the opportunity to be \n     permanent residents and serve the people of your great \n     country.\n       It means so much to our poor people to have Sisters who \n     understand them and their culture. It takes a long time for a \n     Sister to understand the people and a culture, so now our \n     Society wants to keep our Sisters in their mission countries \n     on a more long term basis. Please help us and our poor by \n     extending this law.\n       I am praying for you and the people of Michigan. My Sisters \n     serve the poor in Detroit where we have a soup kitchen and \n     night shelter for women. Let us all thank God for this chance \n     to serve His poor.\n       Signed: Mother Teresa.\n\n  My office received this letter, a copy of which I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record, only a few weeks before Mother \nTeresa's death.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. I believe that all of us who have been inspired by \nMother Teresa's life have asked ourselves what we might do to honor her \nmemory. For me, at least, moving this legislation forward is something \nI would like to do to remember her great and noble works in the name of \nGod and on behalf of humanity.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the crucial faith-based institutions \nthat have so enriched all our lives by supporting this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                      Missionaries of Charity,\n\n                                   Calcutta, India, July 20, 1997.\n     Hon. Spencer Abraham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Abraham: This brings you my prayers, greetings \n     and gratitude for all that you have done to help my Sisters \n     and all Religious serve the poor in the United States.\n       I am writing to ask you to help us in solving a very urgent \n     problem. My Sisters in New York have told me that the law \n     which allows the Sisters to apply for permanent residence in \n     the United States expires on September 30, 1997.

Mr. President, I am honored to join with Senator \nAbraham, Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy and my other colleagues in \nsponsoring legislation to reauthorize provisions of our laws permitting \nimmigrants to come to this country to serve communities in churches and \nother religious institutions across the United States.\n  One of the most significant achievements of the Immigration Act of \n1990, which I sponsored in the Senate, was the creation of this \nimportant visa category. Religious institutions perform extraordinary \nservices for families and communities. In doing so, they often find it \nworthwhile to bring in religious workers from other lands as \nimmigrants, to help them carry out their activities in the United \nStates.\n  One of the best known supporters of this practice was Mother Teresa. \nMissionaries in her Order come to the United States frequently to work \nwith the poor in our country. She and the members of her Order have \ndirectly touched the lives of millions of Americans. Much of the recent \nwork by her Missionaries of Charity in this country would not have been \npossible without this important provision in our immigration laws.\n  Unfortunately, this visa category expires on September 30, just two \nweeks from today. We cannot allow this to happen.\n  As His Eminence Cardinal Maida of Detroit testified before the \nImmigration Subcommittee last week, ``Should the program be permitted \nto expire, the impact would be far reaching. Not only would religious \norganizations and denominations lose access to the much needed \ncontributions of these religious workers, but so, too, would the many \ncommunities in which these individuals work.''\n  The legislation we are sponsoring would make this visa a permanent \npart of our immigration laws. Renewal of this visa would be a small, \nbut enduring memorial to Mother Teresa and her work in America. It will \nenable the members of her Order to continue their charitable and \ncompassionate work in this country long into the future.\n  I have been honored to see her good work in America and around the \nworld. I recall meeting her when I visited India in 1971 and viewed \nfirsthand the extraordinary compassion of this remarkable woman. And I \nwas impressed also by the tremendous difference that she and her \nMissionaries of Charity made in the lives of hundreds of thousands of \nstarving families during the famine in Ethiopia and Sudan in 1984 and \n1985. My family and I visited the area during the Christmas season in \n1984, and was deeply moved by Mother Teresa's extraordinary healing \npresence amid that great tragedy.\n  Since this visa category was established in 1990, over 20,000 \nreligious workers have entered the United States to serve in our \ncommunities. These men and women have brought their skills and \ncompassion to churches, synagogues, mosques, and other places of \nworship across America. They teach in our parochial schools. They serve \nas health care workers, cantors, and catechists. They provide religious \ntraining to youths and after-school programs that keep young people off \nthe streets and give them hope for a better future.\n  I have been deeply moved by the ways in which this special visa has \nbenefitted Massachusetts. Maria Alvarez came to Boston at the \ninvitation of the African Mission Fathers, and has devoted her life to \nhelping city youth deal with gang violence, depression, and other \nproblems that plague inner cities. She has also extended her helping \nhand to refugees in the Boston area, helping them build new lives in \nour state.\n  Sister Vitolia came to Lawrence, Massachusetts on a religious worker \nvisa through the Society of Mary. She works with unemployed and \nhomeless Spanish speakers there. She helps them find jobs and helps \nkeep their families together.\n  Once again, I commend Senator Abraham for his leadership on this \nissue, and I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1247\n\n (Purpose: To provide for waiver of fees for nonimmigrants engaged in \n                     certain charitable activities)\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, Senator Hatch has an amendment at the \ndesk. I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Jeffords] for Mr. Hatch, for \n     himself and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an amendment numbered 1247.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SECTION 3. WAIVER OF NONIMMIGRANT VISA FEES FOR CERTAIN \n                   CHARITABLE PURPOSES.\n\n       Section 281 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1351) is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new sentence: ``Subject to such criteria as the Secretary of \n     State may prescribe, including the duration of stay of the \n     alien and the financial burden upon the charitable \n     organization, the Secretary of State shall waive or reduce \n     the fee for application and issuance of a nonimmigrant visa \n     for any alien coming to the United States primarily for, or \n     in activities related to, a charitable purpose involving \n     health or nursing care, the provision of food or housing, job \n     training, or any other similar direct service or assistance \n     to poor or otherwise needy individuals in the United \n     States.''.\n\n\n[[Page S9635]]\n\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator Hatch \nin sponsoring legislation requested by Mother Teresa to waive visa \napplication fees for religious workers coming to the United States to \nperform charitable work for temporary periods.\n  During her visits to the United States, Mother Teresa asked President \nClinton to take this step to waive visa fees for her missionaries \ncoming to work in this country. Her Missionaries of Charity come to \nAmerica to help the poor in our communities and to minister to the sick \nand the elderly. Each time they travel here, they are required to pay a \n$120 visa fee to the United States Government.\n  It makes no sense to require these religious workers to pay a fee to \nthe federal government in order to come here to help our communities. \nThe legislation we introduce today would waive the fee in these \ninstances.\n  This past weekend, while attending Mother Teresa's funeral in India, \nthe First Lady met with Sister Nirmala, Mother Teresa's successor at \nthe Missionaries of Charity Order in Calcutta. Sister Nirmala asked \nonce again for a waiver of the visa fee and was delighted to learn that \nthe United States Senate would be considering legislation this week to \naccomplish this goal as Mother Teresa had requested.\n  This is an important step that Congress can take to honor the memory \nof Mother Theresa and the compassionate work that her Order brings to \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be agreed to, the bill be considered read a third time and \npassed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand finally, any statements relating to the bill be placed at this \npoint in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1247) was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 1198), as amended, was considered as read the third time \nand passed, as follows:\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n             THE SENATE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, in seeking recognition, I am putting \nforward legislation on campaign finance reform which builds upon the \nexperience of the Governmental Affairs Committee hearings, which are \nnow in progress, on illegalities and improprieties of campaign finance \nreform. I have served on that committee for the past 8 months while we \nhave conducted the investigation and the 6 weeks of hearings which we \nhave had. The legislation which I am about to introduce builds on those \nhearings.\n  At the outset, I compliment my colleagues, Senator John McCain and \nSenator Russ Feingold, for the work which they have done with the \nleadership. I have stated publicly that I applaud their efforts, but I \ndisagree with a key provision of their bill, S. 25, which would give \ncandidates free television advertising time. I have been advised that \nthe McCain-Feingold bill may be modified as to that aspect.\n  I have talked to my colleague, Senator McCain, today and had \npreviously circulated my bill. Senator McCain advises he is interested \nin bringing the matter to the floor next week. We discussed the \npossibility of integrating the legislation or my adding amendments to \nhis proposed bill.\n  I have circulated this proposed legislation among a number of my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle. I think there is an excellent \nchance we will have a number of cosponsors to this legislation. But I \nwant to proceed now to make this brief statement on the substance of my \nlegislation and to put the bill in so that our colleagues could \nconsider this bill during the course of the next week before the matter \ncomes to the Senate floor.\n  My bill does six things.\n  First, it eliminates ``soft money.'' We have seen an avalanche of \nsoft money, into the hundreds of millions of dollars, influencing the \n1996 election.\n  My bill, second, defines ``express advocacy'' to enforce the intent \nof the Federal election laws to prevent coordinated campaigns.\n  What we have seen on both sides of the aisle from both Democrats and \nRepublicans are advertisements in the 1996 election, by the Republicans \nextolling the virtues of Senator Dole and criticizing President \nClinton, and vice versa for the Democrats, praising President Clinton \nand criticizing Senator Dole. But for some reason those advertisements \nhave not been defined to be ``express advocacy.''\n  The third provision of my bill would make ``independent \nexpenditures'' truly independent by requiring affidavits from those who \nare involved in the process.\n  My proposal would say that if someone is to make an independent \nexpenditure, that person will have to file with the Federal Election \nCommission, swearing under oath under the penalties of perjury that the \nexpenditure is truly independent.\n  Then after that affidavit is filed with the FEC, the FEC will notify \nthe candidate and the committee on behalf of whom the independent \nexpenditure was made and require from that candidate and that committee \nan affidavit subject to the penalties of perjury that there is no \ncoordination. My experience as prosecuting attorney has been that when \npeople are compelled to take affidavits, they pay a lot more attention \nto what they are doing than some provision of the law which they might \nnot know about, might not understand, or think has been disregarded. My \nsense is that as a general matter, not in all cases, but in many cases, \nthese so-called independent expenditures are not independent at all.\n  The fourth provision that I am proposing would be to try to deal with \nthe Buckley versus Valeo decision that anyone may spend as much of his \nor her own money that he or she chooses.\n  My bill incorporates the so-called Maine Standby Public Financing \nprovision where, illustratively, if candidate A spends $10 million of \nhis/her own money, then there would be public financing for the amount \nby which such expenditure exceeds the relevant spending cap.\n  I am opposed to public financing generally, and opposed S. 2 which \nwas introduced in this body years ago on that subject, because I think \nthere ought not be public financing. But this ``standby'' provision I \nthink would act principally to deter somebody from spending $10 million \nof their own money. The Government would put up money equal to the \namount of the excess. I think that would deter somebody from spending \nthe money knowing that their financial advantage would be matched. And \nto the extent that the expenditures would have to be made, I think that \nis worthwhile. It would stop people from buying seats in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  The fifth provision would eliminate foreign transactions which funnel \nmoney into U.S. campaigns.\n  Our Governmental Affairs investigation has shown what happened in the \nso-called Young brothers' transaction which went through the Republican \nNational Committee and ended up placing foreign money in a political \ncommittee. This legislation would preclude that from happening again.\n\n  The sixth and final provision would impose limitations and require \nreporting of contributions to the legal defense funds for Federal \nofficeholders and candidates.\n  The Governmental Affairs hearings have again shown, with the actions \nof Mr. Charlie Trie, hundreds of thousands of dollars came into the \nClinton campaign for the legal defense fund. They were not reported. \nThey were not identified. They were kept secret until after the \nelection had occurred. And they are first cousins to campaign \ncontributions. And this legislation would impose limitations and \nrequired reporting.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is being introduced a little earlier \nthan I had intended because I believe that we will have a number of \ncosponsors, Senators who are now considering the bill. But I thought it \nimportant to make this brief statement and to put the provisions of the \nbill into the Congressional Record so that Senators may have an \nopportunity to consider this proposal between now and next week when \nthere may be an opportunity in one form or another to discuss campaign \nfinance reform.\n  As I say, with the modification that Senator McCain has apparently \nmade taking out the provision requiring free television time, it may be \npossible to integrate these two bills or piecemeal amendments from my \nlegislation into the McCain-Feingold bill. I had been unwilling to \ncosponsor that legislation because I think that constitutes a taking in \nviolation of the provision against due process against taking without \ncompensation.\n  Six months of investigation and 5 weeks of hearings by the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee have confirmed my conclusion and the \nview of most Americans that campaign finance reform is necessary. \nPolitics is awash in money--corrupting some, appearing to corrupt \nothers, and making almost everyone in or out of the system uneasy about \nthe way political campaigns are financed.\n  I believe my colleagues Senator John McCain and Senator Russ Feingold \nhave done an excellent job in providing leadership for campaign finance \nreform even though I disagree with the key provisions of their bill (S. \n25) which would give candidates free television advertising time. In my \njudgment, taking such property without compensation is confiscatory and \nunconstitutional.\n  Our Government Affairs hearings have highlighted issues not covered \nby\n\n[[Page S9638]]\n\nthe McCain-Feingold legislation and those hearings have suggested the \nneed for other legislative reforms.\n  My proposed legislation would: First, end ``soft money''; second, \ndefine ``express advocacy'' to enforce the intent of the Federal \nelection laws to prevent coordinated campaigns; third, require \naffidavits to make ``independent expenditures'' truly independent; \nfourth, eliminate foreign transactions which funnel money into U.S. \ncampaigns; fifth, deter massive spending of personal wealth by adapting \na new ``standby public financing'' framework similar to one recently \nenacted by Maine; and sixth, impose limitations and require reporting \nof contributions to legal defense funds for federal office- holders and \ncandidates.\n\n\n                               soft money\n\n  The factual need for reform of the soft-money rules has been well \ndocumented. Public funding of Presidential campaigns was intended to \neliminate collateral contributions. But soft money for so-called issue \nadvocacy has created a gaping loophole that permits spending without \nlimit. An estimated $223 million of soft money was raised by both \nparties in 1996. According to Congressional Quarterly, that figure \nrepresents almost 3 times what was raised as soft money in 1992 and \nmore than 11 times that raised in 1980.\n  While many have focused on the allegedly corrupting influence of \npolitical action committees, PAC's pale in comparison to soft money. \nFor example, Congressional Quarterly has also reported that Enron Corp. \ngave $44,000 less through its political action committee in 1996 than \nit did in 1994, but the firm quintupled its soft money contributions to \n$627,400.\n  Soft money flows not only from individuals, but also from \ncorporations and labor unions, which are expressly prohibited from \ngiving directly to candidates. Archer Daniels Midland donated a total \nof $380,000 to the Democratic and Republican National Committees during \nthe recent election cycle. Phillip Morris, the Nation's leading tobacco \ncompany, donated a total of more than $2.7 million to the two parties \nin 1995 and 1996, with $2.1 million going to the Republican Party.\n  In the first half of 1997, Common Cause reports that the tobacco \ncompanies gave $1.9 million to Republican and Democratic committees, at \na time when Congress and the President have begun consideration of the \ntobacco litigation settlement. In 1996, telecommunications companies \nreportedly donated $14.5 million in soft money; twice as much as they \ndid in 1992. In short, both parties have emerged as the vehicles for \nevading post-Watergate contribution limits, and neither will disarm \nunilaterally.\n  Currently, there is a $20,000 cap on the amount that any individual \ncan give to the national committee of a political party in any 1 year. \nIn order to circumvent this limit, some individuals contribute to the \nnon-Federal accounts of political parties which are not subject to any \ncaps. These funds are then often spent on behalf of the party's \ncandidate in a Federal election.\n  To close this loophole the bill:\n  Maintains the $20,000 a year cap which would apply to the total \namount individuals can contribute to political parties, whether at the \nnational, State or local level, for use in Federal elections.\n  Prohibits the national committees of political parties from \nsoliciting or receiving any contributions not subject to the provisions \nand caps of the Federal Election Campaign Act.\n  Provides that State party committee expenditures that may influence \nthe outcome of a Federal election may be made only from funds subject \nto the limitations and prohibitions imposed by Federal law.\n  Expands the reporting requirements so that all national committees, \nincluding all congressional and Senate campaign committees, must report \nall receipts and disbursements, whether or not in connection with a \nFederal election.\n  These restrictions on soft money contributions to parties are \nconstitutional and consistent with the reasoning applied by the Supreme \nCourt in Buckley. The logic of Buckley and its progeny permits Congress \nto cap campaign contributions when necessary to avoid the impropriety \nand the appearance of impropriety caused by large gifts. In Buckley the \nSupreme Court struck down certain caps on campaign expenditures that \nwere originally included in the Federal Election Campaign Act [FECA]. \nAt the same time, however, Buckley upheld a number of FECA's caps on \ncampaign contributions, including the $1,000 cap in the amount that \nindividuals can contribute to candidates, the $5,000 cap on the amount \nthat individuals can contribute to political action committees, and the \n$20,000 cap on the amount that individuals can contribute to national \ncommittees of political parties. Buckley also upheld FECA's $25,000 cap \non the total amount an individual can contribute to campaigns, PAC's \nand national committees in any 1 year. This bill extends the scope of \nthese permitted caps to cover contributions to the State and local \ncommittees of political parties for use in Federal campaigns.\n  The concept of proposing further caps on contributions to political \nparties was endorsed by the Supreme Court in its decision in Colorado \nRepublican Federal Campaign Committee versus Federal Election \nCommission. In that case, the Court ruled that the sections of FECA \nthat limited the amount of independent expenditures that could be made \nby a political party were unconstitutional. In reaching this \nconclusion, however, the Court approved limiting individual \ncontributions to political parties:\n\n       The greatest danger of corruption . . . appears to be from \n     the ability of donors to give sums up to $20,000 to a party \n     which may be used for independent party expenditures for the \n     benefit of a particular candidate. We could understand how \n     Congress, were it to conclude that the potential for evasion \n     of the individual contribution limits was a serious matter, \n     might decide to change the statute's limitations on \n     contributions to political parties. [Emphasis added]\n\n  The potential for evasion of the contribution limits clearly does \nexist, and the fact of evasion of these limits clearly does exist. It \nis indeed time that Congress changes FECA's limitations on \ncontributions to political parties.\n\n\n                       express and issue advocacy\n\n  In the 1996 Presidential elections, the line was blurred beyond \nrecognition between party and candidate activities. There is \nsubstantial evidence that soft money was spent illegally during the \n1996 campaign by both parties. According to a November 18, 1996, \narticle in Time magazine, President Clinton's media strategists \ncollaborated in the creation of a DNC television commercials. The \narticle describes a cadre of Clinton-Gore advisors, including Dick \nMorris, working side by side with DNC operatives to craft the DNC \nadvertisement which extolled the President's accomplishments and \ncriticized Republican policies. Republicans did the same.\n  Such cooperation constitutes violation of the Federal Election \nCampaign Act [FECA] which provides:\n\n       Expenditures made by any person in cooperation, \n     consultation, or concert, with, or at the request or \n     suggestion of, a candidate, his authorized political \n     committees, or their agents, shall be considered to be a \n     contribution to such candidate. 2 U.S.C. 441a(a)(7)(B)(1)\n\n  Thus, if the alleged cooperation between the Clinton/Gore campaign \nand the DNC took place, then all of the money spent on those DNC \nadvertisements constituted contributions to the Clinton campaign. Under \nFECA, such contributions would have to be reported upon receipt and \nwould have to be included when calculating the campaign's compliance \nwith FECA's strict contribution and expenditure limits. The failure to \ntreat the expenditures as contributions would be a violation of FECA, \nand the knowing and willful failure to treat the expenditures as \ncontributions would be a criminal violation of FECA.\n  There are indications that the Clinton/Gore campaign advisors did \nrealize they were violating the law at the time. The Time article \nquotes one as saying, ``If the Republicans keep the Senate, they're \ngoing to subpoena us.''\n  The content of the DNC and RNC advertisements appears to have \nviolated Federal election law. When an entity engages in issues \nadvocacy to promote a particular policy, it is exempt from the \nlimitation of FECA and can fund these activities from any source. When \nan entity engages in express advocacy on behalf of a particular \ncandidate, it is subject to the limitations of FECA and is not \npermitted to fund such activities with soft money. Where the\n\n[[Page S9639]]\n\nDNC and RNC advertisements did contain express advocacy, and funded \nthese advertisements with soft money, then these committees violated \nFECA.\n  The FEC defines ``express advocacy'' as follows:\n\n       Communications using phrases such as ``vote for \n     President,'' ``reelect your Congressman,'' ``Smith for \n     Congress,'' or language which, when taken as a whole and with \n     limited reference to external events, can have no other \n     reasonable meaning than to urge the election or defeat of a \n     clearly identified federal candidate. 11 CFR 100.22\n\n  In my judgment, both the DNC and RNC television advertisement crossed \nthe line from issues advocacy to express advocacy. While the DNC and \nRNC ads did not use the words ``Vote for Clinton'' or ``Dole for \nPresident,'' these advertisements certainly urged the election of one \ncandidate and the defeat of another. For example, the following is the \nscript of a widely broadcast DNC television commercial:\n\n       American values. Do our duty to our parents. President \n     Clinton protects Medicare. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to \n     cut Medicare $270 billion. Protect families. President \n     Clinton cut taxes for millions of working families. The Dole/\n     Gingrich budget tried to raise taxes on eight million of \n     them. Opportunity. President Clinton proposes tax breaks for \n     tuition. The Dole/Gingrich budget tried to slash college \n     scholarships. Only President Clinton's plan meets our \n     challenges, protects our values.\n\n  Does this advertisement convey any core message other than urging us \nto vote for President Clinton?\n  The RNC ads similarly crossed the line into express advocacy. The \nfollowing is the script of a widely broadcast RNC television \ncommercial:\n\n       (Announcer) Compare the Clinton rhetoric with the Clinton \n     record.\n       (Clinton) ``We need to end welfare as we know it.''\n       (Announcer) But he vetoed welfare reform not once, but \n     twice. He vetoed work requirements for the able-bodied. He \n     vetoed putting time limits on welfare. And Clinton still \n     supports giving welfare benefits to illegal immigrants. The \n     Clinton rhetoric hasn't matched the Clinton record.\n       (Clinton) ``Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, \n     shame on me.''\n       (Announcer) Tell President Clinton you won't be fooled \n     again.\n\n  Similarly, the Democrats, through their shared use of campaign \nconsultants such as Dick Morris for Clinton-Gore 1996 and the \nDemocratic National Committee, crossed the line into illegal \ncontributions on television advertisements.\n  There has been substantial information in the public domain about the \nPresident's personal activities in preparing television commercials for \nthe 1996 campaign. The activity of the President has been documented in \na book by Dick Morris and in public statements by former Chief of \nStaff, Leon Panetta. There is no doubt--and the Attorney General \nconceded this in oversight hearings by the Judiciary Committee on April \n30, 1997--that there would be a violation of the Federal election law \nif, and when the President prepared campaign commercials that were \nexpress advocacy commercials contrasted with issue advocacy \ncommercials.\n  This bill will end the charade by providing a clear-cut statutory \ndefinition of express advocacy wherever the name or likeness of a \ncandidate appears with language which praises or criticizes that \ncandidate.\n\n\n                        independent expenditures\n\n  This bill would put teeth into the law to make independent \nexpenditures truly independent. Current law requires political \ncommittees or individuals to file reports quarterly until the end of a \ncampaign and to report expenditures of more than $1,000 within 24 hours \nduring the final 20 days of the campaign. This legislation would \nrequire reporting for independent expenditures of $10,000 or more \nwithin 24 hours during the last 3 months of a campaign. This bill would \nrequire the individual making the independent expenditure or the \ntreasurer of the committee making the independent expenditure to take \nand file an affidavit with the FEC that the expenditures were not \ncoordinated with the candidate or his-her committee. Then, the Federal \nElection Commission would notify within 48 hours the candidate, \ncampaign treasurer, and campaign manager of that independent \nexpenditure. Those individuals would then have 48 hours to take and \nfile affidavits with the FEC that the expenditures were not coordinated \nwith the candidate or his/her committees.\n  Taking such affidavits coupled with the penalty for perjury would be \nsignificant steps to preclude illegal coordination.\n\n\n                 clamping down on foreign contributions\n\n  Anyone who has watched the Governmental Affairs hearings knows the \nalarming role of illegal foreign contributions in our 1996 campaigns. \nThis legislation would strengthen the existing law to better prevent \ntransactions which effectively fund domestic political campaigns with \nforeign financing schemes.\n  Under current law, it is illegal for a foreign national to contribute \nmoney or anything of value, including loan guarantees, either directly \nor indirectly through another person, in connection with an election to \nany political office. Knowing and willful violations can result in \ncriminal penalties against the offending parties.\n  Mr. Haley Barbour's recent testimony before the Governmental Affairs \nCommittee highlights the need to strengthen and more actively enforce \nthe foreign money statute to ensure that foreign nationals do not \ncircumvent this intended prohibition on foreign political \ncontributions. This bill would clarify the law to cover all \narrangements from foreign entities through third parties where funds \nfrom these transactions ultimately reach a U.S. political party or \ncandidate.\n  In his testimony, Mr. Barbour acknowledged that the National Policy \nForum [NPF], which he headed, received a $2.1 million loan guarantee in \nOctober 1994, from Young Brothers Development, the U.S. subsidiary of a \nHong Kong company which provided the money. The loan guarantee served \nas collateral for a loan NPF received from a U.S. bank. Shortly \nthereafter, NPF sent two checks totaling $1.6 million to the Republican \nNational Committee [RNC]. NPF ultimately defaulted on its loan with the \nU.S. bank and Young Brothers eventually ended up paying approximately \n$700,000 to cover the default.\n\n  The weak link in the existing law is that many people, including \nAttorney General Reno, have argued that the Federal campaign finance \nlaw does not apply to soft money. Accordingly, there are those who \nwould argue that the NPF transaction described above would be legal so \nlong as only soft money was involved. We need to make it 100 percent \nclear that foreign nationals cannot contribute to U.S. political \nparties or candidates under any circumstances. My bill closes this \npotential loophole by explicitly stating that the foreign money \nprovisions of the bill apply to all foreign contributions and \ndonations, both soft and hard money.\n\n\n                    LIMITING INDIVIDUAL EXPENDITURES\n\n  The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Buckley \nversus Valeo prohibits legislation limiting the amount of money an \nindividual may spend on his-her campaign. Maine recently enacted a \nstatute designed to deal with this issue which provides a model for \nFederal legislation.\n  Under the Maine legislation, a voluntary cap is placed on the total \namount that candidates can spend during their campaigns for public \noffice. The law further provides that if one candidate exceeds the \nspending limit, an opponent who has complied with the limit will be \ngiven public matching funds in an amount equal to the amount by which \nthe offending candidate exceeded the spending limit. With such matching \nfunds available, it would be a real deterrent to prevent a candidate \nfrom exceeding the expenditure cap since that candidate would no longer \nreceive an advantage from his or her additional expenditure. This \nprovision would probably not result in significant public expenditures; \nand to the extent it did, it would be worth it.\n\n\n                           LEGAL DEFENSE FUND\n\n  This bill would subject contributions for legal defense funds to \nlimits and mandatory disclosure for all Federal office holders and \ncandidates. Testimony before the Governmental Affairs Committee \ndisclosed that Mr. Yah Lin ``Charlie'' Trie brought in $639,000 for \nPresident Clinton's legal defense fund. While those funds were \nultimately returned, there was never any identification of the donors \nand the fact of those contributions was delayed until after the 1996 \nelection.\n  Contributions to legal defense funds pose a public policy issue \nsimilar to campaign contributions.\n  This bill would impose the same limits on contributions to legal \ndefense\n\n[[Page S9640]]\n\nfunds which are currently required for political contributions with \njurisdiction for such reporting being vested in the Federal Election \nCommission.\n  So at this time, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to take a look \nat the legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1191\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to limit the size of vessels permitted to fish for \nAtlantic mackerel or herring, to the size permitted under the \nappropriate fishery\n\n[[Page S9644]]\n\nmanagement plan; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n\n         THE NORTH ATLANTIC FISHERIES RESOURCE CONSERVATION ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in keeping with the old adage that those \nwho do not know history are doomed to repeat it, I am introducing a \nbill today with Senator Kerry which is designed to avoid repeating the \nmistakes of the past in fisheries management.\n  Most of the major commercial fisheries in both the United States and \nthe world are either fully exploited or overexploited. In many \ninstances, these fisheries have approached or reached an overfished \ncondition because the fishing fleets which targeted them became \novercapitalized before the management system in place could respond \neffectively to this excess fishing capacity. As a result, we find \nourselves today faced with case after case of having to make wrenching \nmanagement decisions to reduce fishing effort that have substantial \nsocioeconomic impacts on coastal communities that depend on fishing for \ntheir livelihoods.\n  In the cases of Atlantic herring and Atlantic mackerel, however, we \nstill have time. Through torturous but ultimately fortunate historical \ncircumstances, the offshore stocks of these fisheries remain, at least \naccording to the best information presently available, fairly abundant. \nAnd because of their relative abundance, these fisheries have attracted \nincreasing attention from fishermen in the Northeast and the mid-\nAtlantic, many of whom have been displaced from the now-depleted New \nEngland groundfish fishery.\n  Earlier this year, however, a dramatic new proposal came to light \nwhich could alter the planned course of sustainable development for \nthese fisheries. A United States-Dutch group intends to bring a 369 \nfoot factory trawler into the Atlantic herring and mackerel fisheries \nby the spring of 1998. This vessel is more than twice the size of any \nother vessel currently fishing in New England, and it intends to \nharvest 50,000 tons of fish annually. Many concerns have been raised \nfrom Maine to New Jersey about the potential impacts that this enormous \nvessel will have on the herring and mackerel stocks, and on the \ncomposition of the fisheries that have been developing in recent years \nthrough the hard work of many people in the region. To take one example \nof these concerns, while the National Marine Fisheries Service \nindicates that herring is, according to the best information, fairly \nabundant off Georges Bank and southern New England, there are \nlegitimate concerns about the health of the Gulf of Maine stocks which \nform the major source of supply for the sardine and lobster bait \nindustries, and which do appear to interact and aggregate with the \noffshore stocks at certain times of the year. Unfortunately, today's \nscience cannot tell us with a high degree of precision what impacts the \nincreased fishing of offshore stocks would have on all of the key Gulf \nof Maine stocks.\n  The uncertainties surrounding the Atlantic Star proposal are the \nkinds of things that must be carefully reviewed, and the most \nappropriate forums for reviewing these questions are the regional \nfishery management councils established to manage our fisheries under \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act. Unfortunately, neither of the councils with \njurisdiction over herring and mackerel had addressed the issues raised \nby the Atlantic Star before the vessel's owners were able to get it \npermitted. The Atlantic herring fishery does not have a federal fishery \nmanagement plan, meaning that it is largely unregulated. And the \nexisting management plan for mackerel was developed before it was known \nthat the Atlantic Star would seek to operate in that fishery.\n  To ensure that the Atlantic Star and other vessels of its class \nreceive the thorough consideration intended in the Magnuson-Stevens \nAct, the bill introduced by Senator Kerry and I calls a temporary \ntimeout on the entry of very large vessels into the herring and \nmackerel fisheries until the councils have time to act. Our bill states \nthat no vessel over 165 feet or with greater than 3,000 horsepower can \nharvest these species unless the appropriate council specifically \nauthorizes it in a fishery management plan or plan amendment. But \nunlike other bills that have been introduced on this issue, our bill \nensures that this matter is addressed in a reasonable timeframe. It \nestablishes deadlines for action on the Atlantic Star by the councils \nand the Commerce Department of September 30, 1998, whether the decision \nis favorable or unfavorable.\n  Mr. President, this bill simply ensures that the analytical and \ndeliberative process outlined in the Magnuson-Stevens Act has a chance \nto work as it was intended. And when the issue is the introduction of a \ndramatically different new fishing technology into two relatively \nhealthy fisheries of substantial importance to many people who live in \nthe region, the integrity of this process could not be more important. \nIt is unfortunate that this issue was not resolved by the councils and \nthe Commerce Department sooner, but the fact is that it was not, and \nCongress, if it is to ensure that our fisheries are managed \nresponsibly, must intervene in a responsible manner. The remedy that we \nhave proposed is responsible, temporary, and reasonable.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend and \ncolleague, the distinguished Senator from Maine, in introducing \nlegislation on a topic of growing importance to coastal communities \nthroughout the Northeast--conservation of North Atlantic fisheries \nresources.\n  Since I arrived in the Senate over 12 years ago, I have worked to \naddress the many challenges confronting our ocean and coastal \nresources. After all, few States draw as much of their national and \nregional identity from their coasts as does Massachusetts. My efforts \nhave been principally through my participation as a member on the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and particularly as \nranking member of the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee and as co-chair \nof its predecessor, the National Ocean Policy Study.\n  During my tenure, I have worked with my colleagues to develop \ninnovative policy solutions to achieve the long-term protection and \nsustainable use of vulnerable marine resources. Our goal has been to \nensure strong coastal economies and a clean, healthy ocean environment \nfrom the Gulf of Maine to the Gulf of Alaska.\n  One of our recent successes was last year's bill to reauthorize and \nstrengthen the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act \n(Magnuson-Stevens Act). That legislation, the Sustainable Fisheries \nAct, ultimately should provide the framework for rebuilding depleted \nfish stocks and developing management schemes to prevent overfishing. \nUnfortunately, many of the ideas and safeguards the new law contains \nrepresent difficult lessons learned from the devastating collapse of \nthe New England groundfish fishery. In other regional fisheries, we \nhave been too late to stop the depletion.\n  This brings us to the issue at hand: How can we prevent repetition of \nthe groundfish experience, maintain the current health of Atlantic \nherring and mackerel stocks, and encourage their sustainable use? The \nfirst step, of course, is through development of conservative and \ncomprehensive fishery management plans. Toward that end, on June 17, \n1997, I wrote the National Marine Fisheries Service, asking it to work \nwith the New England Fishery Management Council to ensure the immediate \ndevelopment and implementation of a fishery management plan for \nAtlantic herring. Such a plan is essential to protect herring stocks \nand traditional fishery participants as proposals move forward to \nexpand the herring fishery in Federal waters.\n  Atlantic herring is an important part of New England's fishing \ntradition. For generations, we have harvested herring for use as canned \nsardines, as bait in lobster pots, and for other products. Fishermen \nusing small boats form the base of the fishery, and it is those \nfishermen, more than any others, who seek an intelligent plan for \nmanaging the fishery and protecting against overharvest. In addition, \nAtlantic herring play a key role in the marine ecosystem off New \nEngland coasts by providing a primary food source for whales, seabirds, \nand other fish including groundfish, tuna, striped bass, and bluefish.\n\n  The challenge now is to prevent a flood of new or displaced boats \nfrom entering the herring fishery and overwhelming the harvesting \ncapacity of the resource. The National Marine Fisheries Service \nestimates that herring stocks are now at levels that\n\n[[Page S9645]]\n\nwould support an expanded harvest level. However, New England's past \nhas taught us that in an unregulated environment, this current healthy \ncondition could rapidly be reversed. Given the present lack of a \nFederal fishery management plan for herring and questionable scientific \ninformation on the status of the stocks, the uncontrolled expansion of \nthis fishery could have devastating consequences.\n  We need to slow down the increase in fishing power entering the \nherring fishery, and we need to give the New England Council the time \nto develop a thoughtful Federal management plan for herring that \nresponds to local interests and needs. While I had hoped that the \ncouncil and the Secretary of Commerce would be able to accomplish these \ngoals through the process established by the Magnuson-Stevens Act and \nother fishery laws, it has become clear in recent weeks that we must \nimpose temporary legislative safeguards until that process is complete.\n  The bill which Senators Snowe, Kennedy, and I are introducing today, \nthe North Atlantic Fisheries Resource Conservation Act, provides those \nsafeguards. First, by September 30, 1998, the New England and Mid-\nAtlantic Councils and the Secretary of Commerce are required to develop \nand implement both a fishery management plan for herring and a plan \namendment for Atlantic mackerel. Second, a fishing vessel that is \nlonger than 165 feet or has engines that exceed 3,000 horsepower is \nprohibited from harvesting either herring or mackerel until the \ncouncils and the Secretary have addressed the potential impact of such \nvessels in the management plan.\n  While the provisions of the North Atlantic Fisheries Resource \nConservation Act are specific to two Northeast fisheries, the issues \nwhich they address should become part of a broader national policy \ndebate about our vision for the American fishing industry in the 21st \ncentury. For over two decades, our fishery policies have focused on two \ngoals: conservation and management of U.S. fishery resources and \ndevelopment of the domestic fishing industry. We have succeeded beyond \nour expectations in achieving the second goal of developing the U.S. \nfishing industry. I am optimistic that the Sustainable Fisheries Act \nwill move us toward achieving the first goal of improving conservation \nand management. With the achievement of those goals, however, come new \nquestions. What do we want our fishing industry to look like in the \nyears to come? What should we as a nation do to preserve traditional \ncoastal communities centered on small-boat fishermen? What restrictions \nif any should be placed on enormous factory trawlers? In New England, \nthese large ships conjure up memories of foreign factory trawlers \nvacuuming up and destroying U.S. fishery resources in the days before \nthe Magnuson-Stevens Act. Are such ships an appropriate element in \nother U.S. fisheries?\n  The legislation before us today focuses on the actions needed to \nsafeguard the Atlantic herring and mackerel fisheries. However, I look \nforward to the broader debate. By the prompt enactment of this \nlegislation I hope we can contribute to that debate and begin to shift \nthe national example set by New England fisheries from one of \noverfishing and painful rebuilding toward one of conservative \nmanagement that is successful in preserving both the fishermen and the \nfish.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Coats, Mr. Bond, Ms. Landrieu, and \n        Mr. Levin):\n\n  S. 1195. A bill to promote the adoption of children in foster care, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n THE PROMOTION OF ADOPTION SAFETY AND SUPPORT FOR ABUSED AND NEGLECTED \n                              CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Promotion of \nAdoption, Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected Children Act, the \nso-called PASS Act. This legislation will make critical reforms to the \nNation's child welfare and foster care system and will go a long way \ntoward improving the lives of the hundreds of thousands of abused and \nneglected children across America. These are children without a safe \nfamily setting. They are children who face abuse and neglect every day \nof their lives. They are America's forgotten children. And, all too \noften, they are children without hope.\n\n  This chilling picture has brought the sponsors of this bill together \nto take immediate action. The goals of the PASS Act are twofold: to \nensure that abused and neglected children are in safe settings, and to \nmove children more rapidly out of the foster care system and into \npermanent placements.\n  While the goal of reunifying children with their biological families \nis laudable, we should not be encouraging States to return abused or \nneglected children to homes that are clearly unsafe. Regrettably, this \nis occurring under current law.\n  About 500,000--half a million--abused or neglected children currently \nlive outside their homes, either in foster care or with relatives. In \nRhode Island alone, there are nearly 1,500 children who have been \nremoved from their homes and are in foster care. The Rhode Island \nDepartment of Children and Families has an active case load of about \n7,700 children who have been abused or neglected.\n  Many of these children will be able to return to their parents, but \nmany will not. Too often, children who cannot return to their parents \nwait for years in foster care before they are adopted. In today's child \nwelfare system, it has become a lonely and tragic wait with no end. To \nus, that is an unacceptable way of life for any child to have to \nendure.\n  The PASS Act seeks to shorten the time a child must wait to be \nadopted, all the while ensuring that wherever a child is placed, his or \nher safety and health will be the first concern.\n  The PASS Act also contains important new financial incentives to help \nthese children find adoptive homes. State agencies will receive bonuses \nfor each child that is adopted, and families who open their hearts and \ntheir homes to these children will be eligible for Federal financial \nassistance and Medicaid coverage for the child.\n  I believe the PASS Act is a good bipartisan, compromise package. The \nsponsors of this bill have worked hard to come together in support of a \nchild welfare reform bill. And we expect this new, revised legislation \nto move quickly through the Senate, as the Majority Leader has \nindicated that adoption legislation is one of a select few priorities \nto be dealt with before expected adjournment in early November.\n\n  But the real reason we need to move this bill is not because of \nlegislative haste. It is because each passing day we do not act to \nbring hope and relief to abused and neglected children is a dark day \nfor Congress and the Nation.\n  Finally let me thank my friend Jay Rockefeller, who has worked so \ntirelessly on these issues and whose leadership was key to this bill. I \nalso want to pay special tribute to Larry Craig--without his commitment \nto these children this agreement would not have been possible. I am \nproud of this bipartisan effort, and I hope all of my colleagues will \nsupport this measure. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1195\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my distinguished \ncolleagues in introducing PASS, the Promotion of Adoption, Safety and \nSupport for Abused and Neglected Children Act.\n  Foster care was never intended to be anything more than a temporary \nrefuge for children from troubled families. Yet all too often, \n``temporary'' becomes ``permanent,'' and decisions made for children in \nthe system are driven by considerations other than the child's own \nwell-being. Tragically, it's the children who ultimately pay for the \nflaws in the system--sometimes with their very lives.\n  The problem does not lie with the vast majority of foster parents, \nrelatives, and caseworkers who work valiantly to provide the care \nneeded by these children. Rather, the problem is the system itself, and \nincentives built into it, that frustrate the goal of moving children to \npermanent, safe, loving homes.\n  PASS will fundamentally shift the foster care paradigm, without \ndestroying what is good and necessary in the system. For the first \ntime, a child's health and safety will have to be the paramount \nconcerns in any decisions made by the State. for the first time, \nefforts to find an adoptive or other permanent home will not only be \nrequired but documented and rewarded. For the first time, steps will \nhave to be taken to free a child for adoption or other permanent \nplacement if the child has been languishing in foster care for a year \nor more.\n  These are only some of the many critical reforms in Pass, designed to \npromote adoption, ensure the safety of abused and neglected children, \naccelerate permanent placement, and fix flaws in the system. The \npackage, taken as a whole, will make an enormous difference in the \nlives of thousands of children.\n  This comprehensive bill is the product of extensive discussion and \nnegotiation among Senators representing a veritable universe of \nviewpoints on adoption and foster care reform. Although we may have \ncome to the table from different perspectives, we agreed on a \nfundamental principle: that reforms are needed to ensure that a child's \nhealth, safety and permanency are paramount concerns of the foster care \nsystem. In the end, on behalf of the children, we came together and \nresolved our differences. PASS is the result, and I commend it to all \nour colleagues.\n  Change is needed now; every day of delay is an eternity to a child \nunfairly bearing the burdens of the current system. I hope every \nSenator will take a careful look at PASS, and work with us to achieve \ntrue reforms in this area.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, abused and neglected children are \namong the most vulnerable and poorly protected members of American \nsociety. Too many of these children are left to wander aimlessly \nthrough the foster care system--a system which, from the outset, was \nnever designed or intended to be a permanent home. We can no longer \ncontinue to sentence these foster children to endless waits--a legal \nlimbo in which they no longer feel welcome in their biological families \nbut are unable to be adopted into new and loving homes. Despite the \nthousands of dedicated foster parents and child welfare workers who \nstrive daily to effectively address the many needs of abused and \nneglected children in an overloaded system, we know that nothing can \nreplace a permanent and loving home made by adults who can be counted \non without condition or limitation.\n  Acknowledging our collective obligation to allow no child to fall \nbetween the cracks, I am proud to join together with Senator John \nChafee and my other colleagues in a truly extraordinary bipartisan \neffort to introduce the Promotion of Adoption Safety and Support for \nAbused and Neglected Children Act [PASS]. Under Senator Chafee's \ncommitted leadership on children's issues, this bipartisan group has \nworked extremely hard to forge an effective compromise--a compromise \nwhich offers concrete, practical strategies to provide permanency in \nlives of foster children and to ensure that health and safety are built \ninto every level of America's abuse and neglect system. Central to this \nentire effort was also Senator Larry Craig, who brought focus and \ndetermination to the sometimes difficult bipartisan negotiations. I \nwould like to take this opportunity to extend my most sincere thanks to \nmy other colleagues, Senators Jeffords, DeWine, Coats, Bond, Landrieu, \nand Levin for making possible this outstanding example of bipartisan \nteamwork.\n  The Promotion of Adoption Safety and Support for Abused and Neglected \nChildren Act will fundamentally shift the focus of the foster care \nsystem by insisting that a child's health, safety, and opportunity to \nfind a permanent home should be the paramount concern when a State \nmakes any decision concerning the well-being of abused and neglected \nchildren. As a comprehensive package based on bipartisan consensus, \nPASS will accelerate and improve the response to these concerns, \npromote safe adoptions, and restore safety and permanency to the lives \nof abused and neglected children.\n  The main objective of this bill is to move abused and neglected \nchildren into adoptive or other permanent homes and to do so more \nquickly and more safely than ever before. Right now, many foster care \nchildren are forced to wait years before being adopted--even in cases \nwhere loving families are ready and willing to adopt them. Some \nchildren lose their chance for adoption altogether. While PASS \npreserves the requirement to reunify families where appropriate, it \ndoes not require States to use reasonable efforts to reunify families \nthat have been irreparably broken by abandonment, torture, physical \nabuse, sexual abuse, murder, manslaughter, and sexual assault. The PASS \nAct maintains the delicate balance in protecting the rights of parents \nand families while placing primary focus where it should be: on the \nhealth and safety of child.\n  PASS encourages adoptions by rewarding States financial incentives \nfor facilitating adoption for all foster children--especially those \nwith special needs which, sadly, make them more difficult to place. For \nthose situations where children cannot go home again, PASS requires \nStates to use reasonable efforts to place them into safe adoptive homes \nor into the permanent care of loving relatives. In addition, PASS cuts \nby one-third the time that an abused and neglected child must wait in \norder to be placed in such adoptive homes. In response to a candid and \nfocused look at today's foster care crisis,\n\n[[Page S9653]]\n\nthe bill also seeks to rescue children from the legal limbo of the \ncurrent system by requiring States to take the necessary legal steps to \nfree for adoption those children who have been forced to linger in the \nsystem for a year or more. PASS also prevents further abuse of children \nin the foster care system by requiring criminal records checks for all \nfoster and adoptive parents. PASS is about helping the individual child \nbut, equally as importantly, fixing the system.\n  It is always the right time to focus on the needs of children--\nespecially those unfortunate enough to find themselves in the sometimes \ndysfunctional labyrinth of the abuse and neglect system. Unfortunately, \nhowever, reform has never been more necessary. President Clinton's \n``Adoption 2002 Report'' found that there are currently half a million \nchildren in temporary foster care placements. One hundred thousand of \nthose children should be adopted, but less than half of that number are \nlegally eligible to become part of an adoptive family. In my home State \nof West Virginia alone, referrals to Child Protective Services are \nexpected to rise to an all-time high of 17,000 this year. Foster care \nplacements have jumped from 2,900 children in January 1996 to 3,113 \nchildren in January 1997. These staggering figures reveal a foster care \ncrisis of unprecedented proportions.\n  PASS is the first step in a vital, ongoing effort to put children at \nthe very top of our national agenda. It is time that we provide all \nchildren with their most profound wish: to live in a safe and loving \nhome with caretakers who treat them with respect and dignity. If we are \nunable to address this most fundamental need, these children will not \nbe able to grow, learn, and provide a secure place for their own \nfamilies. It is unthinkable to deny abused and neglected children such \nvital opportunities.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, there may not be many things in life on \nwhich there is a consensus but I think we all can agree on the vital \nimportance of ensuring the safety of abused and neglected children and \nmoving them out of the foster care system more rapidly and into \npermanent homes. I am proud to join with my colleagues in this \nbipartisan effort to develop the new, consensus legislation called the \nPromotion of Adoption, Safety, and Support for Abused and Neglected \nChildren [PASS] Act.\n  The reality is that all too often children simply languish in the \nfoster care system. Nationwide, there are more than 500,000 children in \nfoster care. In Missouri, there are 10,361 children in the foster care \nsystem. Since 1975, the number of reported incidents of abuse and \nneglect has increased from less than 10,000 to 52,964 in 1995, an all-\ntime high and frightening statistic.\n  Federal law has hindered State child welfare agencies from moving \nmore quickly to place children who are in foster care because of abuse \nand neglect into permanent homes.\n  The PASS Act will provide incentives to increase adoptions and reduce \nby one third the amount of time a child lingers in foster care waiting \nfor a permanency plan, with a review required every six months so that \nfoster care is truly viewed as a temporary care system for our most \nvulnerable children.\n  The bill clarifies ``reasonable efforts'' and establishes a federal \nstandard so that the health and safety of the child is the primary \nconcern, above family reunification interest. There are some parents \nfor whom reunification with their children is not reasonable--certainly \nsustained abuse or neglect or danger of physical harm would fit that \ncategory. In those cases, we need to move swiftly to get the children \nout of harm's way and then quickly to get them into permanent homes.\n  Just count the number of cases of child abuse and neglect that has \nbeen reported over the past few months. One too many! A little, five-\nyear old Kansas City girl named Angel Hart was beaten and drowned to \ndeath by her mother's boyfriend because she could not recite the \nalphabet.\n  Under the PASS Act, States are encouraged to enact laws that would \nmake it easier to terminate parental rights in abusive cases and \nprevent abused and neglected children from returning to homes in which \ntheir health and safety are at risk. In addition, this legislation \npromotes adoption of all special needs children and ensures health \ncoverage for special needs children who are adopted.\n  I am very optimistic that Congress will move this bill forward this \nyear. There are far too many innocent lives at stake and no child \nshould be denied a loving home. Unfortunately, for thousands of kids \nnow caught in permanent limbo in the foster care system, that is \nexactly what is happening. The PASS Act will improve child safety and \npermanency, enabling some children to return home safely and others to \nmove to adoptive families more quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Gorton, Mr. Hollings, and Mr. \n        Ford):\n\n  S. 1196. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to require the \nNational Transportation Safety Board and individual foreign air \ncarriers to address the needs of families of passengers involved in \naircraft accidents involving foreign air carriers; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n               THE FOREIGN AIR CARRIER FAMILY SUPPORT ACT\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenator Gorton, Senator Hollings and Senator Ford, to introduce the \nForeign Air Carrier Family Support Act. This bill would require foreign \nair carriers to implement disaster family assistance plans should an \naccident involving their carriers occur on American soil. I would like \nto recognize my colleagues in the House, especially Representative \nUnderwood from Guam, who introduced the companion bill in the House of \nRepresentatives earlier this week.\n\n  The legislation, if enacted, would build on the family assistance \nprovisions that we enacted last year as part of the Federal Aviation \nReauthorization Act of 1996. Let me be clear about one point. Domestic \nair carriers are already operating under the same legislative \nrequirements set out in the legislation before us today.\n  The need for extending the requirements to foreign air carriers came \ninto a clear focus with the tragic crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in \nGuam. I do not intend to single out Korean Air for blame. An accident \nof this magnitude, involving the loss of more than 200 lives, in rough \nand isolated terrain, is bound to create mass confusion and hysteria. \nEven so, coverage of the accident made us all acutely aware of the \ncriticisms made by the family members, and the pain they suffered in \nrelation to the search and rescue efforts, as well as the media \ninvolvement following the accident.\n  The U.S. civil, military and Federal personnel at the scene should be \ncommended for their contributions toward the search and rescue efforts. \nI also praise their attempts to console and assist family members on \nGuam, as well as those who traveled to the accident site from South \nKorea and the continental United States. Without a doubt, though, their \nefforts would have been more productive had there been a prearranged \nplan in effect. Greater coordination would have made things easier not \nonly for the victims' family members, but also for the National \nTransportation Safety Board [NTSB] officials and military personnel who \nwere on-site and who had to respond immediately in an emotional and \npotentially hazardous situation.\n  The Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act would require a foreign \nair carrier to provide the Secretary of Transportation and the Chairman \nof the NTSB with a plan for addressing the needs of the families of \npassengers involved in an aircraft accident that involves an aircraft \nunder the control of that foreign air carrier, and that involves a \nsignificant loss of life. The Secretary of Transportation could not \ngrant permission for the foreign air carrier to operate in the United \nStates unless the Secretary had received a sufficient family assistance \nplan.\n  The family assistance plan required of the foreign air carrier would \ninclude a reliable, staffed toll-free number for the passengers' \nfamilies, and a process for expedient family notification prior to \npublic notice of the passengers' identities. An NTSB employee would \nserve as director of family support services, with the assistance of an \nindependent nonprofit organization with experience in disasters and \npost-trauma communication with families. The foreign air\n\n[[Page S9654]]\n\ncarrier would provide these family liaisons with updated passenger \nlists following the crash. The legislation would require that the \ncarrier consult and coordinate with the families on the disposition of \nremains and personal effects.\n  This is important legislation. It is critical, given the increasing \nglobal nature of aviation. As we work to promote and implement open \nskies agreements with foreign countries, these countries' carriers will \nhave increasing freedom to operate in the United States and its \nterritories.\n  I plan to bring this legislation before the Commerce Committee for \nmarkup as early as next week. Unfortunate but true, we have already \nseen the positive effects of the congressionally mandated family \nassistance provisions, as they relate to domestic air carriers. I urge \nmy colleagues to support extending these assistance provisions to \nforeign carriers operating in the United States.\n  Mr. GORTON. Mr. President, I rise to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, and Senator Ford to \nintroduce the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. This act will \nprovide assistance to the families of aviation accident victims who \nwere flying on foreign airlines operating in the United States, \nassistance that is now provided in the event of the crash of a domestic \nairline. I would also take this opportunity to recognize Representative \nUnderwood of Guam who recently introduced the companion bill in the \nHouse with Representative Duncan and Representative Lipinski.\n  The recent tragic crash of Korean Air Flight 801 in Guam, which took \nthe lives of more than 200 people, clearly shows the need for this \nlegislation. As we all know, the news of an air disaster spreads \nquickly around the world, with pictures and reports about the crash. \nThe media is often at the sight of crash as soon as, if not before, the \nrescue teams.\n  You can imagine how devastating it was for the family members of \nthose flying on Flight 801, as it would be for any family members, to \nreceive media reports about a crash just after it happened. Anyone in \nsuch a situation wants to know as quickly as possible what has happened \nto their loved ones. That is why the Congress passed the Aviation \nDisaster Family Assistance Act of 1996, which obligates domestic air \ncarriers to have disaster support plans in place. It is why we now need \nto extend this type of plan to foreign air carriers in the event that \nthey have an accident on American soil.\n  Despite the best efforts of rescue personnel and National \nTransportation Safety Board personnel, it is clear that family members \nwould have been better served if an accident plan had been in effect \nfollowing the crash of flight 801. Coverage of the accident made us \naware that family members suffered a great deal of pain in relation to \nthe search and rescue efforts. We have, sadly enough, already seen the \npositive effects of family assistance plans for the accidents of \ndomestic air carriers.\n  Simply stated, the bill would require that following an accident \nresulting in a significant loss of life, the foreign airline would have \na plan in place to publicize a toll-free number, have staff available \nto take calls, have an up-to-date list of passengers, and have a \nprocess to notify families--in person if possible--before any public \nnotification that a family member was onboard the crashed aircraft. A \nNational Transportation Safety Board employee would serve as the \ndirector of family support services, with the assistance of an \nindependent nonprofit organization with experience in disasters and \npost-trauma communication with families. The legislation also requires \nthe Secretary of Transportation to refuse a foreign air carrier a \npermit to operate in the U.S. if the carrier does not have a plan in \nplace.\n  As Senator McCain indicated, he plans to bring this legislation \nbefore the Commerce Committee for markup as early as next week. I will \nwork with Senator McCain to see that we move this legislation as \nexpeditiously as possible.\n  I hope that it will never be necessary for the plans required under \nthis legislation to be used. However, should a foreign air carrier have \nan accident in the United States, we should extend to the family \nmembers of victims the consideration and compassion that this \nlegislation provides. I would urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting this bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues, Senators \nMcCain, Gorton, and Ford in introducing the Foreign Air Carrier Family \nSupport Act, which will assign to foreign air carriers the statutory \nduty to provide support to the families of victims of aircraft \naccidents.\n  Last month, 228 people died in the crash of Korean Air flight 801 in \nGuam. The United States, as a policy matter, has decided that our air \ncarriers must be prepared to work with the families of victims. In \nfact, we require our carriers to file plans covering items like toll-\nfree phone lines, notification of families of the accident, \nconsultation on the disposition of the remains, and the return of \nfamily possessions.\n  These changes came about following the crash of TWA flight 800 last \nJuly. It was clear, following the crash, that the families of the \nvictims needed assistance, and in a coordinated way. The National \nTransportation Safety Board representatives worked night and day to let \nthe families know what was going on, but the carriers, too, have a \nresponsibility and those responsibilities, for U.S. carriers, were \nstatutorily imposed. The bill today will make sure that foreign \ncarriers like Korean Air will have similar responsibilities for crashes \nthat occur in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, I want to join my colleagues in sponsoring \nthe Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act. The bill, which I hope will \nbe considered shortly by the Commerce Committee, is intended to close a \nloophole in law. Last year, we passed legislation requiring U.S. air \ncarriers to file plans with the Secretary and NTSB outlining how they \nwould address the needs of the families of victims of aviation \ndisasters. The bill today will require foreign airlines that serve the \nUnited States. In light of the tragic crash in Guam, this bill will \nmake sure that carriers like Korean Air are prepared to deal with the \nfamilies of victims when a crash occurs on U.S. soil.\n  The bill is supported by the administration and I hope that we can \npass it quickly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 1197. A bill to reform the financing of Federal elections; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n\n\n                THE CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \non campaign spending reform.\n  I recognize that this is not the first bill introduced in Congress on \nthis issue. In fact, at last count, there were 85 bills introduced in \neither the House or the Senate on campaign finance reform--17 of them \nin the Senate alone.\n  Frankly, I would be quite satisfied if the bill I am introducing \ntoday was tabled in favor of a floor vote on the McCain-Feingold bill, \nof which I am a cosponsor.\n  Last week, all 45 Democrats in the Senate pledged to vote for McCain-\nFeingold if given the opportunity. Combined with the three Republican \ncosponsors of the bill, this legislation needs only three more votes \nfor passage. Surely there are three more Republicans who will support \nthis bill.\n  But we are not there yet, and I believe strongly that action must be \ntaken on this subject now. Today. This Congress. This session.\n   This Congress has spent $10 million in taxpayer funds \ninvestigating wrongdoing in the last election cycle.\n   Eighty-four Members of this Congress have called for special \nprosecutors.\n   We've spent 6 months in public hearings decrying how bad the \nsystem is, how bad soft money is, and how badly we need reform.\n  There is nothing to hide behind if this Congress does not act on \nreform.\n  I do not believe Members of this body can or should be able to take a \npass on reform based on disagreements with McCain-Feingold, or based on \nan all-or-nothing attitude. Therefore, I offer my legislation as a bill \nthat contains the common denominators--the basic elements--of reform \nthat many of us profess to agree on.\n  Let me state clearly; I am a cosponsor of McCain-Feingold and will \nvote\n\n[[Page S9655]]\n\nfor McCain-Feingold if it comes to the floor for approval, as I believe \nit should.\n  My legislation is an alternative, focussed on what I, and what most \nof my colleagues, have said are the most pressing areas in need of \nreform: the elimination of soft money, greater disclosure on \ncontributions, and regulation of dollars now unregulated.\n  The cornerstone of any campaign reform bill must address the issue of \nsoft money. After all the charges and disclosures about the abuse of \nsoft money in federal campaigns, we would be hard-pressed to explain to \nthe public why we did not take action at least on this issue.\n  However, just banning soft money--for which there appears to be \nsufficient support in both Houses--cannot be our only action. A simple \nban on soft money will force the shifting of these dollars into \nunregulated independent expenditure campaigns where huge amounts of \nanonymous money is used to influence campaigns and--most commonly--to \nattack candidates.\n  Between $135 and $150 million was spent on so-called issue ads in \n1996--about 35 percent of the $400 million spent on all campaign \nadvertising in 1996, according to a new study released yesterday by the \nAnnenberg Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The study--the most \ncomprehensive on this issue to date--showed that, compared with other \nforms of political advertising and coverage, the content of issue ads \nwere the highest in ``pure attack.''\n  To this end, I have prepared this small package of measures--many of \nwhich appear in other bills--which, taken together, is a step on the \nroad to spending reform, and would be a solid step forward in the \nbattle to decrease the flood of unregulated money in campaigns.\n  Specifically, this bill would:\n  Ban soft money to national parties. During the last election, both \nparties spent a combined total of over $270 million in soft money. \nDemocrats spent $122 million and Republicans spent almost $150 million. \nOver the first 6 months of this year, both parties have raised $34 \nmillion in soft money, with Republicans out-pacing Democrats $23 to $11 \nmillion.\n  Change the definition of ``express advocacy'' to include any \ncommunication that uses a candidate's name or picture within 60 days of \nan election as ``express advocacy''. Only ``hard'' dollars--limited in \namount and fully disclosed--could be used to fund independent campaigns \nof a candidate's name or image is used in express advocacy for or \nagainst a candidate.\n  Change the personal contribution limit from $1,000 per election to \n$2,000 per election and index those contribution limits for inflation \nin the future. The $1,000 per election limits have not been changed \nsince 1974. That was 23 years ago and, as every candidate knows, the \ncost of printing postage and buying media has more than quadrupled in \nthat time.\n  Increase the disclosure requirements so that any group or individual \nspending more than $10,000 up to 20 days prior to an election would \nhave to report that to the FEC within 48 hours. This threshold drops to \n$1,000 within 20 days of an election.\n  Implement a policy whereby if a person is not eligible to vote in \nU.S. elections, he or she would not be permitted to contribute to \ncandidates or parties.\n  Lower the threshold for reporting contributions to candidates from \n$200 to $50. This increases disclosure.\n  Allow the FEC to seek an injunction in U.S. District Court if it has \nevidence that a violation of campaign laws is about to occur.\n  Permit the FEC to refer matters to the Attorney General for \nprosecution if any significant evidence of criminal wrongdoing exists.\n  I believe a bill containing these elements is doable this year and I \noffer it as a package for the consideration of this body.\n  In closing, it is my sincere hope we will move to enact meaningful \ncampaign finance reform this year. If we can't act now, after all that \nhas been said and done this year, I'm afraid we never will. The \nAmerican people deserve more than lip service on campaign reform.\n  I implore the majority leader to bring the McCain-Feingold bill to \nthe floor and allow us to debate it, amend it, and vote on it. If we \ncan't agree on the McCain-Feingold bill, then let us vote on an \nalternative such as mine. Either way, let us have at it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1197\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, \n     safe, and affordable housing;\n       (2) the inventory of public housing units owned and \n     operated by public housing agencies, an asset in which the \n     Federal Government has invested approximately \n     $90,000,000,000, has traditionally provided\n\n[[Page S9665]]\n\n     rental housing that is affordable to low-income persons;\n       (3) despite serving this critical function, the public \n     housing system is plagued by a series of problems, including \n     the concentration of very poor people in very poor \n     neighborhoods and disincentives for economic self-\n     sufficiency;\n       (4) the Federal method of overseeing every aspect of public \n     housing by detailed and complex statutes and regulations \n     aggravates the problem and places excessive administrative \n     burdens on public housing agencies;\n       (5) the interests of low-income persons, and the public \n     interest, will best be served by a reformed public housing \n     program that--\n       (A) consolidates many public housing programs into programs \n     for the operation and capital needs of public housing;\n       (B) streamlines program requirements;\n       (C) vests in public housing agencies that perform well the \n     maximum feasible authority, discretion, and control with \n     appropriate accountability to both public housing residents \n     and localities; and\n       (D) rewards employment and economic self-sufficiency of \n     public housing residents; and\n       (6) voucher and certificate programs under section 8 of the \n     United States Housing Act of 1937 are successful for \n     approximately 80 percent of applicants, and a consolidation \n     of the voucher and certificate programs into a single, \n     market-driven program will assist in making section 8 tenant-\n     based assistance more successful in assisting low-income \n     families in obtaining affordable housing and will increase \n     housing choice for low-income families.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to consolidate the various programs and activities \n     under the public housing programs administered by the \n     Secretary in a manner designed to reduce Federal \n     overregulation;\n       (2) to redirect the responsibility for a consolidated \n     program to States, localities, public housing agencies, and \n     public housing residents;\n       (3) to require Federal action to overcome problems of \n     public housing agencies with severe management deficiencies; \n     and\n       (4) to consolidate and streamline tenant-based assistance \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Public housing agency.--The term ``public housing \n     agency'' has the same meaning as in section 3 of the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937.\n       (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Housing and Urban Development.\n\n     SEC. 4.

ELIMINATION OF OBSOLETE DOCUMENTS.\n\n       Effective 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, \n     no rule, regulation, or order (including all handbooks, \n     notices, and related requirements) pertaining to public \n     housing or section 8 tenant-based programs issued or \n     promulgated under the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     before the date of enactment of this Act may be enforced by \n     the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 7. ANNUAL REPORTS.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, and annually thereafter, the Secretary shall submit a \n     report to Congress on--\n       (1) the impact of the amendments made by this Act on--\n       (A) the demographics of public housing residents and \n     families receiving tenant-based assistance under the United \n     States Housing Act of 1937; and\n       (B) the economic viability of public housing agencies; and\n       (2) the effectiveness of the rent policies established by \n     this Act and the amendments made by this Act on the \n     employment status and earned income of public housing \n     residents.\n                        TITLE I--PUBLIC HOUSING\n\n     SEC. 101.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor one of the \nNation's most vibrant communities: Hispanic-Americans, and join in \ncelebrating September 15 through October 15, 1997, as Hispanic Heritage \nMonth.\n  America is blessed with a wide variety of peoples and cultures. The \nHispanic community, comprising cultures from Central and South America \nas well as Europe, has had an especially far-reaching impact on our \nNation. From the arts and literature, to the sciences and business, the \nHispanic community has helped shape America into a vibrant, dynamic \nsociety envied by the world.\n  It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge Hispanic Americans and \ntheir immigrant ancestors for their many significant and positive \ncontributions to America. This country was built by immigrants--a great \nmany of whom were of Hispanic descent. Hispanic individuals came to \nthis country to seek opportunity, flee oppression, or find a better \nplace to raise their families.\n  Many of these immigrants became successful in many disciplines, \nincluding business, education, entertainment, politics, and medicine. \nWe know them, or their children or grandchildren, as pillars of our \ncommunities. And many immigrants went beyond the call of duty to serve \ntheir adopted homeland.\n  One such immigrant was Alfred Rascone, who immigrated to the United \nStates from Mexico. At age 20, as a lawful permanent American resident, \nMr. Rascone volunteered for military service in Vietnam as a \nparatrooper combat medic. On one fateful mission Mr. Rascone twice used \nhis own body to shield wounded comrades from enemy guns. Severely \nwounded, he refused to be evacuated until all the wounded were safe. He \nkept tending the wounded until he collapsed, so hurt that a priest at \nthe scene gave him last rites.\n  Mr. Rascone's comrades are to this day pursuing his proper \nrecognition: the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  Our Nation is much richer for having Alfred Rascone in it. He has the \nkind of character any American would do well to emulate. We can only \ngain by attracting more Alfred Rascones to our shores.\n  Across the Nation and in my home State of Michigan, events are taking \nplace which demonstrate the rich Hispanic heritage in our country. \nThese festivities will give every American the chance to participate in \nHispanic culture. These events will educate, inform, and entertain, all \nwith a distinctive cultural flair. Hispanic Heritage Month recognizes \nhow important this community is to the United States, and I join my \ncolleagues in looking forward to the many opportunities this month will \nprovide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9690-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HALF THE WORLD'S POPULATION LIVES WITHOUT BASIC SANITATION\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator McConnell and I have worked \nthis year to bring more attention and resources to combat infectious \ndiseases, which afflict many millions of people around the world and \npose a serious public health threat to Americans both here and abroad. \nThe scope of this problem was illustrated in a July 23 article in the \nNew York Times, about the UNICEF 1997 ``Progress of Nations'' report \nwhich revealed that nearly half of the world population does not have \naccess to basic sanitation.\n  For most Americans, it is hard to fathom living without something as \nbasic as a clean toilet. Yet over 2 million children die each year from \ndiseases and diarrhea directly related to a lack of basic sanitation. \nSome of the countries with populations suffering from the worst \nsanitation problems, including Haiti and Cambodia, have received \nmillions of dollars in United States and international aid. Addressing \nthese basic needs should be a priority of our assistance programs in \nthese countries.\n  Mr. President, the United States cannot fund the infrastructure to \nprovide clean water and sanitary sewer systems for the 3 billion people \nin the world who currently lack such basic necessities. That is beyond \nour means or responsibilities. However, we should do all we can. The \ndeveloping countries themselves are investing approximately $200 \nbillion a year on new infrastructure. The Agency for International \nDevelopment is currently spending about $44 million on urban \ninfrastructure projects in parts of Africa, Asia, Latin America, and \nEastern Europe, among other regions. This has shrunk from the $150 \nmillion in loan guarantees that were available in 1993 for similar \nprojects.\n  Epidemics that spread in unsanitary living conditions can and will \nbecome threats in the United States. Both the Senate and House fiscal \nyear 1998 Foreign Operations appropriations bills provide additional \nmoney to combat infectious diseases. I am hopeful that with these \nadditional resources, AID, the World Health Organization, the Center \nfor Disease Control, and other government and international agencies \nand private organizations involved in this effort, will be able to \ndevelop a coherent plan to expand research, provide training and \nmedicines to public health officials, and help establish the global \nsurveillance and response system necessary to combat these \ndiseases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9690-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9690-S9691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUMMIT\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, for many rural communities in my \nhome State of New Mexico, the wonders and advantages of the \ntelecommunications explosion--Internet, telecommuting, wireless \ncommunications--remain an unfulfilled promise. Yet, my recent 2-week \ntrip throughout rural New Mexico showed me signs that the \ntelecommunications revolution has begun to take hold in our State. As I \ncontinue to make rural economic development in New Mexico my top \neconomic priority, through an innovative program that we call rural \npayday, full use of telecommunications will play a key role.\n  Highlighting the relationship between the telecommunications \nrevolution and rural economic development was a full-day \nTelecommunications Summit we organized in Albuquerque last month. \nOrganized under the auspices of the Small Business Advocacy Council of \nNew Mexico, which I established 3 years ago, this summit brought \ntogether more than 200 telecommunications professionals, businessmen, \nand scientists from throughout our State. Key to this summit was the \nhelp provided by personnel from Sandia National Laboratory, who \ngenerously gave of their time, immense talent, and expertise throughout \nthe planning period of the summit and during the daylong event.\n  What all of us learned from this summit can be summarized easily:\n  First, for rural small business owners, intelligent and creative use \nof telecommunications can mean the difference between survival and \nfailure;\n  Second, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 will continue to play an \nunpredictable and major role as rural communities try to use \ntelecommunications to solidify their economic futures;\n  Third, the large telecommunications, Internet and wireless providers \nmust do more to help rural communities try to use telecommunications to \nsolidify their economic futures;\n  Fourth, basic telecommunications infrastructure remains a serious \nobstacle to rural economic development in many areas;\n  Fifth, potential for economic development using telecommunications is \nlimited only by the users' imaginations;\n  Sixth, the unique expertise of the national laboratories in New \nMexico hold the potential to help spread economic development \nthroughout our State and, by example, beyond the borders of our State.\n  During my trip in August, I saw many examples of how \ntelecommunications helps small businesses thrive. Let me give you two \nexamples.\n\n[[Page S9691]]\n\n  In Socorro, NM, Don Tripp of Tripp's Incorporated has expanded his \noperations by establishing a virtual call center for his sales \nassociates. By capitalizing on advances in telecommunications, Tripp \nwas able to provide many of his employees with the option of \ntelecommuting. This approach has worked well and Tripp's Inc. has moved \nforward with a happier, more productive and flexible work force.\n  An example of using the talents of the national laboratories to help \nfoster rural economic development is the recently-developed New Mexico \nArts Database in Santa Fe, NM. With the aid of Los Alamos National \nLaboratory, many New Mexico artists and artisans will soon be able to \nsell their art over the Internet. No longer will these artists be \nlimited to traditional, and very expensive, outlets or by location. \nTheir art will become accessible via the Internet to potential \ncustomers throughout the world.\n  We hope to coordinate these and other innovative approaches to rural \neconomic development through the Rural Payday, Inc., organization I \nmentioned earlier. This initiative will focus on attracting and \nencouraging telecommunications-related businesses, and businesses that \ncan use telecommunications tools more innovatively, to New Mexico. Such \nbusinesses as 1-800 call centers, automatic data processing satellite \noffices, more traditional businesses that can expand into rural New \nMexico using new communications tools, and telemedicine firms, to name \na few, can become realities for small and rural New Mexico. If we get \nthe cooperation of the major telecommunications firm in infrastructure \nand basic communications services, a serious problem that rural America \nmust face, we can revive smalltown America. I was glad to see that the \nmajor telecommunications providers in our State were at least willing \nto meet with potential customers from rural areas and try to work out \nnew approaches. More on this front needs to be done, and I pledge that \nI will push these major firms at every opportunity.\n  The New Mexico Telecommunications Summit, the first of its kind in \nour State, opened a little window on the future. With more cooperation \nbetween users and providers of telecommunications services, and with \nthe continued good work of our small business community and our \nnational laboratories, New Mexico has the chance to create a thriving \nrural economy that will expand in the 21st century.\n  I would like to recognize the many companies and individuals who made \nthis event such a tremendous success. I would like to also thank every \nSmall Business Advocacy Council member who took the time to attend and \norganize this conference. In addition, I thank especially Angela \nAtterbury and Paul Silverman for their tireless efforts in coordinating \nthis event on behalf of the SBAC. And, Sandia and Los Alamos National \nLaboratories deserve credit for all their work at the Summit and the \naccompanying Business Applications Fair. Finally, thanks to the \nInternet, wireless and telecommunications providers who participated in \nthis event. We need their help greatly in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9690-3", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9691-S9693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A VICTORY FOR AMERICANS\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in the House of Representatives \nyesterday an amendment that would have allowed foreign governments to \nexport to the United States for commercial sale millions of lethal \nmilitary weapons the U.S. previously made available to them was dropped \nfrom the Treasury Appropriations bill. I have vigorously opposed this \namendment in the Senate, and have worked to keep it out of Senate \nAppropriations bills. I congratulate Representatives McCarthy, Lowey, \nKennedy, Shays, and Maloney for successfully working to delete the \nprovision from the House bill.\n  As my colleagues may know, the amendment was originally adopted \nduring the House Appropriations Committee markup of the Treasury, \nPostal Service, and General Government Appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 1998 without discussion or debate. Last year a similar amendment \nwas slipped into the Senate version of the Commerce, Justice, State and \nthe Judiciary Appropriations bill, but it was not included in the final \nversion of the spending law.\n  It has been the policy of the Reagan, Bush, and Clinton \nAdministration's not to permit these American made military weapons to \nbe exported for commercial sale in the U.S. market. The Administration \nstrongly opposed the amendment to allow foreign governments to export \nthem for commercial sale. So did a coalition of fifty organizations, \nincluding the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, Handgun Control, Inc., \nand the Violence Policy Center. I ask that a copy of a letter from \nthese organizations be printed in the record. I also ask that copies of \neditorials from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and the Times \nof Trenton, be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The weapons that would have flooded our streets had this amendment \nbeen approved were granted or sold to foreign governments, often at a \ndiscount, through military assistance programs, and some are even \n``spoils of war.'' Their market value exceeds $1 billion. The State \nDepartment estimates that 2.5 million such weapons have been granted or \nsold to foreign governments since 1950. About 1.2 million are M-1 \ncarbines, which are semiautomatic weapons that can easily be converted \nto illegal, fully automatic weapons. The weapons at issue are called \n``curios or relics'' because they are considered to have historic value \nor are more than 50 years old. But they are not innocuous antiques. \nThese military weapons may be old, but they are lethal. Ten American \npolice officers have recently been killed with these dangerous weapons. \nAnd in just two years the weapons were traced to more than 1800 crimes \nnationwide.\n  Allowing the importation of large numbers of these lethal weapons \nwould have undermined efforts to reduce gun violence in this country. \nIt would have reduced the cost of the weapons, making them more \naccessible to criminals.\n  Enactment of the provision could also have provided a windfall for \nforeign governments at the expense of the U.S. taxpayer. Under the \nproposal, our government's ability to require foreign governments which \nreceived American manufactured weapons to return proceeds of the sales \nto the United States Treasury would have been severely limited. \nConsequently, countries that the U.S. assisted in times of need, such \nas South Korea and the Philippines, could have made a handsome profit \noff of our weapons. Even countries like Iran and Vietnam could have \nprofited.\n  Allowing more than two million U.S.-origin military weapons to enter \nthe United States would profit a limited number of arms importers but \nwould not be in the overall interest of the American people. These \nweapons are not designed for hunting or for shooting competitions; they \nare designed for war. Our own Department of Defense does not sell these \nweapons on the commercial market for profit in the United States. \nForeign countries should not be permitted to do so either.\n  I'm delighted that this provision has been dropped from the House \nversion of the bill. I have introduced legislation, S. 723, to repeal a \nloophole in the Arms Export Control Act that could enable these weapons \nto enter the country under a future Administration. I hope the Congress \nwill approve this bill.\n  In the meantime, Mr. President, this is a huge victory for the \nAmerican taxpayer and a victory for all concerned about safety.\n  The material follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Sept. 9, 1997]\n\n                        The Surplus Gun Invasion\n\n       Gun dealers, with the enthusiastic support of the National \n     Rifle Association, are once again trying to sneak through \n     Congress a measure that could put 2.5 million more rifles and \n     pistols onto American streets and provide a handsome subsidy \n     for weapons importers and a few foreign governments. This \n     bill, introduced with disgraceful stealth, should be pounced \n     on by the Clinton Administration and all in Congress who are \n     concerned about crime.\n       The bill is an amendment to the Treasury Department's \n     appropriation, which may come to a vote in the House this \n     week. It would allow countries that received American \n     military surplus M-1 rifles, M-1 carbines and M1911 pistols \n     to sell them to weapons dealers in the United States. The \n     countries--allies and former allies such as the Philippines, \n     South Korea, Iran and Turkey--got the guns free or at a \n     discount or simply kept them after World War II, or the \n     Korean and Vietnam wars. Current law requires them to pay the \n     Pentagon if they sell the guns and bars Americans from \n     importing\n\n[[Page S9692]]\n\n     them. The new bill would change both provisions.\n       The N.R.A. argues that the guns are merely relics. But they \n     are not too old to kill. In 1995 and 1996 the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms traced these models to more \n     than 1,800 crime sits. Senator Frank Lautenberg, the bill's \n     main opponent, says these guns have killed at least 10 police \n     officers since 1990. M-1 carbines can be converted to \n     automatic firing, and all the M-1's are easily converted into \n     illegal assault weapons.\n       Republicans attached a similar bill to an emergency \n     spending measure last year but took it out under pressure \n     from the White House. President Clinton should threaten to \n     veto the Treasury appropriation if the measure remains.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 4, 1997]\n\n                    Surplus Weapons, Surplus Danger\n\n       Gun sales are flat, so the nation's gun importers are \n     looking to shake up the market. Once again they want \n     permission to bring into the country an arsenal of as many as \n     2.5 million U.S. Army surplus weapons that were given or sold \n     to foreign governments decades ago.\n       The industry classifies the guns as obsolete ``curios and \n     relics'' of interest mostly to collectors and sports \n     shooters. But they're not talking about a gentleman officer's \n     pearl-handled revolvers. These are soldiers' M1 Garand \n     rifles, M1 carbines and .45-caliber M1911 pistols; some can \n     be converted to automatic or illegal assault weapons with \n     parts that cost as little as $100. For public safety reasons, \n     the Pentagon declines to transfer such surplus to commercial \n     gun vendors, which is why the Clinton, Bush and Reagan \n     administrations have enforced a policy of keeping the \n     overseas weapons out.\n       This week, the gun importers, cheered on by the National \n     Rifle Association, quietly persuaded a House appropriations \n     panel to approve language to prevent the State, Justice and \n     Treasury departments from denying the importers' \n     applications. It's a slap at the country's efforts to reduce \n     gun violence.\n       To introduce a flood of these historical weapons is to risk \n     driving down the price of firearms and putting more within \n     the reach of street criminals. It isn't simply gun-control \n     groups but the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms that \n     warns of an increased use of these kinds of weapons against \n     police around the country. In 1995-96 alone, 304 U.S. \n     military surplus M1 rifles and 99 surplus pistols were traced \n     to crime scenes. At least nine law enforcement officers have \n     been killed by M1 rifles or M1911 pistols since 1990, \n     according to Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), who has \n     introduced legislation to cement the import ban in law by \n     reconciling some contradictory statutes.\n       The State Department says that weapons transfers--even for \n     outdated guns--should remain an executive branch prerogative \n     to be handled country by country. Why should the governments \n     of Turkey, Italy or Pakistan collect a windfall from U.S. gun \n     importers when the products they are trading originally were \n     supplied by the U.S. government? Why should Vietnam and Iran \n     be allowed to earn currency from U.S.-made weaponry they took \n     as ``spoils of war.'' President Clinton last year headed off \n     a similar effort to allow in the surplus weapons and should \n     be counted on to do so again.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  Stealth Amendment Sneaks In Weapons\n\n\n                   lautenberg tries to stop provision\n\n       Lobbyists for the National Rifle Association scored a big \n     victory in August when they sneaked in a little clause in the \n     House Appropriations bill allowing about 2.5 million guns to \n     be imported into the United States.\n       This bill, which sets aside money for the Treasury, Postal \n     Service and general government appropriations, is about to be \n     up for a House vote and, unless this provision is changed, \n     the U.S. market soon will be flooded with these dangerous \n     weapons.\n       The guns are military weapons that were given or sold to \n     friendly foreign governments, such as South Korea, Turkey, \n     Iran and South Vietnam. They are called ``curios and relics'' \n     since they were used in international battles or are at least \n     50 years old.\n       The NRA claims these weapons, M-1 Garand, M-1 carbine \n     rifles and .45-caliber M1911 pistols, are collectibles for \n     military-history buffs and do no damage.\n       Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., who is leading the charge to \n     remove the gun provision, thinks otherwise. He says they are \n     dangerous weapons and cities 1995 and 1996 Bureau of Alcohol, \n     Tobacco and Firearms statistics linking these particular \n     models to 1,800 crimes, including the killing of at least 10 \n     police officers in the past seven years. Those same \n     statistics show New Jersey ranked seventh in the nation for \n     crime scenes involving M-1 rifles and M1911 pistols.\n       Lautenberg says about 1.2 million of the weapons are M-1 \n     carbines, semiautomatic weapons which easily are converted \n     into fully automatic weapons.\n       The State Department, starting in the Reagan era, has \n     forbidden foreign governments from exporting these guns into \n     the United States for sale. It is inconceivable that under \n     the Clinton administration, known for its anti-gun policies, \n     this wise prohibition would be reversed.\n       Lautenberg, who successfully stopped a similar proposal in \n     the Senate, says no one is paying attention to the provisions \n     in the House bill. The sounds of silence soon may be overcome \n     by the sounds of more needless weapons being fired in this \n     country.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From the Times, Sept. 14, 1997]\n\n                         Stop the Gun Invasion\n\n       Congress does its dirtiest work in the dark, with little or \n     no debate. An outstanding example of this propensity was the \n     $50 billion giveaway to the tobacco industry that Senate \n     Majority Leader Trent Lott and House Speaker Newt Gingrich \n     smuggled into the balanced-budget package at the last minute. \n     The huge public protest that followed belated disclosure of \n     that outrage was heard in Washington, and last week the \n     Senate voted 95-3 to repeal the provision. Even Sen. Lott \n     voted yes. Let's hope the lopsidedness of the Senate tally \n     will help persuade the House to go along with the repealer.\n       Now a similar effort is needed to undo some major mischief \n     committed in the House Appropriations Committee in the days \n     before the August recess. An amendment to the Treasury \n     Department funding bill, hurriedly approved with almost no \n     discussion, would allow some 2.5 million surplus U.S. \n     military rifles and pistols to enter this country. They would \n     come from U.S. allies and former allies, such as the \n     Philippines, South Korea, Turkey and even Iran and Vietnam, \n     which got the guns free or at cost, during the various wars \n     of this century. Present law requires these countries to pay \n     the U.S. government if they sell the guns and prohibits \n     Americans from importing them, but the stealth amendment to \n     the appropriations bill would nullify those provisions. These \n     foreign countries have no right to rake in a windfall from \n     munitions originally supplied by the U.S. government--\n     munitions that our own Department of Defense doesn't sell on \n     the commercial market for profit in the U.S.\n       The amendment was pushed by--who else?--the National Rifle \n     Association, along with gun wholesalers, who envision making \n     significant profits importing M-1 Garand and M-1 carbine \n     rifles and .45-caliber M1911 pistols. The NRA argues that the \n     guns are ``curios or relics'' that veterans want to own as \n     mementos. But as weapons made for the battlefield they also \n     happen to be very lethal, and, if imported in quantity, they \n     would be cheap--two attributes that would make them catnip to \n     criminals. In 1995 and 1996 the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \n     and Firearms traced these models to more than 1,800 crime \n     sites. Such guns have killed at least 10 police officers \n     since 1990, including Franklin Township Sgt. Ippolito ``Lee'' \n     Gonzalez, shot down two years ago with a M1911 wielded by the \n     notorious parolee Robert ``Mudman'' Simon. The semiautomatic \n     M-1 carbines are light, easy to carry, and easily convertible \n     to illegal automatic weapons.\n       Last year a similar amendment was slipped into the Senate \n     version of a departmental appropriations bill, but at the \n     insistence of the White House the provision was removed. This \n     year, Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J., one of the strongest \n     advocates in Congress of a sensible national gun policy, was \n     able to block similar legislation in the Senate, and he's \n     leading the fight to keep the provision out of the final \n     version of the Treasury appropriations bill that's sent to \n     the White House. President Clinton, for his part, should make \n     it clear that he's as opposed as ever to this terrible idea, \n     and will veto any spending bill that includes it.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                September 8, 1997.\n       Dear Representative: In late-July, during mark-up of the \n     Fiscal Year 1998 Treasury-Postal Service-General Government \n     Appropriations bill, the Appropriations Committee accepted an \n     amendment that would allow foreign governments to export to \n     the United States for commercial sale, millions, of military \n     weapons the United States previously made available to \n     foreign countries through military assistance programs.\n       For a range of public health and safety national security, \n     and taxpayer reasons, we strongly urge you vote to delete the \n     provision from the Fiscal Year 1998 Treasry-Postal Service-\n     General Government Appropriations bill.\n       Supporters of this amendment describe it as an innocuous \n     measure which simply allows the importation of some obsolete \n     ``curios and relics.'' In reality, the amendment would allow \n     the import of an estimated 2.5 million weapons of war, \n     including 1.2 million M1 carbines. The M1 carbine is a semi-\n     automatic weapon that can be easily converted into automatic \n     fire and comes equipped with a 15-30 round detachable \n     magazine.\n\n\n                     this is a public safety issue\n\n       Although the backers of the provision claim that these \n     World War II era weapons are now harmless ``curios and \n     relics'', in reality they remain deadly assault weapons. \n     According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, \n     the M1 Carbine can easily be converted into a fully-automatic \n     assault rifle. For this reason, the Department of Defense has \n     refused to sell its surplus stocks of these weapons to \n     civilian gun dealers and collectors in the United States.\n       According to Raymond W. Kelley, the Treasury Department's \n     Under-Secretary for Enforcement, the inflow of these weapons \n     will drive down the price of similar weapons, making them \n     more accessible to criminals. Already, during 1995-1996, ATF \n     has traced 1,172 M1911 pistols and 639 M1 rifles to crimes \n     committed in the United States.\n\n\n                 this is a government oversight concern\n\n       Nearly 2.5 million of these weapons were given or sold as \n     ``security assistance'' to allied governments. Under United \n     States law, recipients of American arms and military\n\n[[Page S9693]]\n\n     aid must obtain permission from the United States government \n     before re-transferring those arms to third parties. Setting a \n     dangerous precedent, this amendment fundamentally undercuts \n     the ability of the United States government to exercise its \n     right of refusal on retransfer of United States arms.\n       The Reagan, Bush, and Clinton Administrations have all \n     barred imports of these military weapons by the American \n     public. The Appropriations bill explicitly overrides this \n     policy, prohibiting the government from denying applications \n     for the importation of ``U.S. origin ammunition and curio or \n     relic firearms and parts.'' In effect, the provision would \n     force the Administration to allow thousands of M1 assault \n     rifles and M1911 pistols into circulation with the civilian \n     population, thereby not only threatening public safety but \n     also undermining governmental oversight and taxpayer \n     accountability.\n\n\n                    this is also a taxpayer concern\n\n       The amendment also presents a windfall of millions of \n     dollars to foreign governments and United States gun dealers. \n     The amendment effectively terminates a requirement that \n     allies reimburse the United States treasury if they sell \n     United States-supplied weapons. According to ATF, each M1 \n     Carbine, M1 Garand rifle, and M1911 pistol currently sells \n     for about $300-500 in the United States market. The South \n     Korean, Turkish, and Pakistani governments and militaries \n     stand to make millions from the resale of these weapons. \n     South Korea has 1.3 million M1 Garands and Carbines, while \n     the Turkish military and police have 136,000 M1 Garands and \n     50,000 M1911 pistols. These weapons were originally given \n     free, or sold at highly subsidized rates, or retrieved as \n     ``spoils of war.'' The United States Department of Defense \n     does not sell these lethal weapons on the commercial market \n     for profit. Why should we allow foreign governments to do so?\n       Again, we strongly urge you vote to delete this provision \n     from the Fiscal Year 1998 Treasury-Postal Service-General \n     Government Appropriations bill.\n       Thank you.\n\n         American College of Physicians; American Friends Service \n           Committee, James Matlack, Director, Washington Office; \n           American Jewish Congress, David A.

Much of this success has been thanks, in part, \nto the chamber's work in promoting local businesses. The community of \nWestland is grateful for the tremendous support the chamber has given, \nand on behalf of the U.S. Senate, thanks is due to the chamber for \nmaking Michigan a better place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9693-1", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9693-S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, this week, from September 14-20, \nhas been designated National Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities Week, and I am pleased to take this opportunity to \nrecognize the achievements of these fine institutions of higher \neducation.\n  For more than 150 years, the 116 historically black colleges and \nuniversities [HBCU's] throughout our Nation have played a vital role in \nproviding students with an exceptional education. These institutions \nhave significantly increased educational access for thousands of \neconomically and socially disadvantaged Americans, particularly young \nAfrican-Americans. In turn, armed with this educational opportunity, \nthese young people have risen to the challenges of our time and have \nbecome leaders not only of their own communities, but of our Nation as \nwell.\n  While constituting only 3 percent of the Nation's colleges, HBCU's \nenroll 16 percent of all African-Americans students in higher \neducation. Each year they award approximately 28 percent of all \nbaccalaureate degrees earned by African-Americans nationwide and they \ncontinue to graduate the majority of African-Americans who go on to \nearn advanced degrees, including 75 percent of all African-American \nPhD's, 50 percent of all African-American attorneys, and 75 percent of \nall African-American military officers. The success of these \ninstitutions in providing educational opportunities for African-\nAmericans in unparalleled.\n  My own State of Maryland is privileged to be served by four \noutstanding historically black colleges and universities: Bowie State \nUniversity, Coppin State College, Morgan State University, and the \nUniversity of Maryland Eastern Shore. These four institutions, all of \nwhich have undergone dramatic growth in recent years, have contributed \nsignificantly to the higher education system in Maryland.\n  Bowie State, one of the oldest black universities in the United \nStates, is the Nation's first historically African-American institution \nto offer graduate programs in Europe. While providing high quality \neducation to thousands of African-Americans, Coppin State has uniquely \nfocused on serving the residents of inner-city Baltimore for almost 100 \nyears. Morgan State annually ranks among the top 10 public campuses \nnationally in the number of baccalaureate recipients who pursue \ndoctorate degrees. The University of\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\nMaryland Eastern Shore, which celebrates its 111th anniversary this \nweek, commits itself to combining an excellent education with an \nemphasis on meeting the needs of the region by providing a doctorate in \nmarine-estuarine-environmental science and toxicology. These are just a \nfew examples of the strong commitment HBCU's have demonstrated \nthroughout the years in preparing our young people for the increasingly \ntechnological and global economy.\n  The extraordinary contributions of historically black colleges and \nuniversities in educating African-American students cannot be \noverstated. They are a valuable national resource which are being \nrightly honored for their exemplary tradition in the area of higher \neducation.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nsixth anniversary of the Republic of Armenia. Through the devastating \ngenocide committed by the Ottoman Turks to the search for independence, \nthe people of Armenia have been steadfast in purpose and spirit. Today, \nwe celebrate the event which happened on September 23, 1991, when \nArmenia declared its independence from the U.S.S.R. With its new-found \nindependence, the Republic created radical free-market economic \nreforms, held the first free Presidential election, and is the only \nformer Soviet Republic that is governed by a democratically elected \nleader with no ties to the Communist Party. Despite the hardships that \nthe people of Armenia have endured, they continue to hold strong to the \nbelief that independence and security are essential for the country to \nprosper. Oliver Wendell Holmes once said ``the great thing in this \nworld is not so much where we stand, as in what direction we are \nmoving.'' Although the Republic of Armenia continues to face an ongoing \nblockade by Turkey and Azerbaijan, I am convinced it is not where \nArmenia stands now but rather the perseverance which exists, that will \nlead Armenia into the future. Let it be known, that I encourage the \ncitizens and Government of the Republic to remain faithful to the \nideals of democracy and to continue to strengthen the relationship \nbetween Armenia and the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9694-2", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 19, 1997\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.

Mr. President, as I understand the agreement, we have an \nhour for the discussion of S. 830, which is the FDA reauthorization \nbill. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct, Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I will say this evening what I have \nsaid before, and that is to commend the chairman of our committee, \nSenator Jeffords, and the other members of our committee for working \nout, by and large, a commendable piece of legislation to bring \npharmaceuticals onto the market safely and rapidly, and to assure that \nAmericans would be able to have the benefits of advances in the areas \nof medical devices.\n  There is a very important provision which has been included in the \nbill and which I think poses a very significant threat to the health \nand safety of the American people. I want to take some time this \nevening to discuss the reasons why this particular provision should be \neliminated from the bill or modified to retain existing protections \navailable under the Food and Drug Act.\n  I will use the time that I have this evening to try to spell out for \nthe Senate and for those who are watching these proceedings the dangers \nof this provision so that, hopefully, when the Senate has the \nopportunity to change this particular provision on Tuesday next it will \ndo so. It is time to make the changes that will protect the American \npeople, and it is important that we do so.\n  Mr. President, this is not just a provision that I have reservations \nabout. We have put in the Record, and I will mention at this time once \nagain, that the President of the United States has indicated that this \nis one of four major concerns that he has in this legislation because \nof its potential to adversely effect the public health.\n  It isn't only the President of the United States who has identified \nthis particular provision as being a danger to the health of the \nAmerican people, but it is the Patients' Coalition, which is made up of \npatients from all over this country, who review various pieces of \nlegislation to ensure that the patients of this country are adequately \nprotected: the Consumer Federation of America, the National Women's \nHealth Network, the National Organization of Rare Disorders, the \nAmerican Public Health Association, Consumers Union, Center for Women's \nPolicy Studies, the National Parent Network on Disabilities, the \nNational Association of Social Workers, and the list goes on and on and \non.\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\n  That is why, Mr. President, this particular provision should be \nrevised to protect the health of the American people. It does not do so \nnow, and it has not since it has been reported out of the committee.\n  If this provision becomes law, it would force the Food and Drug \nAdministration to approve unsafe or ineffective medical devices in \ncases where a manufacturer submits false or misleading information \nabout the product. This issue goes to the heart of the role of the FDA, \nand it is an unconscionable provision. The result is that patients who \nrely on medical devices may well be exposed to dangerous products that \ncould maim or kill.\n  Ninety-five percent of all devices approved by the FDA involve \nupgrades of existing devices. The upgrades are reviewed in what is \ncalled the 510(k) procedure under the statute. Under this procedure, \nthe manufacturer of the device asks for an FDA approval based on the \nfact that the new device is substantially equivalent to an existing \ndevice that is already on the market and that has already been approved \nas safe and effective.\n  On this basis, the FDA usually quickly approves the new device. If \nthe new device has significant technological changes, the manufacturer \nmust submit the data to the FDA to show that the new device is as safe \nand as effective as the older device to which it is being compared. \nThat is the current law.\n  In making these determinations under the current law, the FDA looks \nat the use of the earlier device and the claims that the manufacturer \nof the new device makes on the label for the new product. Sometimes, \nhowever, the new device has technological characteristics that make it \nclear that the device is intended to be used for a new purpose, a \ndifferent purpose than the one the manufacturer claims on the proposed \nlabel.\n  All we are asking is that the FDA be able to act in these \ncircumstances to assure that the device is safe. We want to prohibit \nfalse and misleading labels.\n  Mr. President, this is not a hypothetical case. A recent case \ndemonstrates the basic problem.\n  A new biopsy needle for diagnosing breast cancer in women was \nsubmitted for approval to the FDA by the U.S. Surgical Corporation, a \nwell-known manufacturer of medical devices. Compared to the existing \nbiopsy needle, the new needle was huge, far larger than would normally \nbe used in a biopsy. In fact, the tissue removed by the device was 50 \ntimes as large as the standard instrument would remove.\n  It was obvious to the FDA that the new needle would be used to remove \nsmall tumors, not just to perform a biopsy. In fact, the company \nmarketed the device for that purpose in Canada. Yet, the corporation \nproposed to market the device with the old biopsy label, which gave no \nhint of the obvious new use of removing cancer cells. Under current \nlaw, the FDA has the authority in such cases to require the \nmanufacturer to submit data on the safety and effectiveness of the \nneedle for the new use, to be sure that it is capable of removing \ntumors without leaving some cancer cells in place.\n  Under this legislation, if the FDA said, ``Well, let us examine \nwhether this particular medical device provides safety and protection \nfor American women when that device is used to remove tumors,'' the FDA \nwould not be permitted to do so. Under the old law, it would. Under the \nnew law, it would not.\n  In this particular case the tissue removed by the device was 50 times \nas large as the standard instrument would remove. It was obvious to the \nFDA the new needle would be used to remove small tumors, not just to \nperform biopsies. In fact, videos were distributed in Canada \ndemonstrating how to use the device to remove breast tumors. Yet, the \ncorporation proposed to market the device with the old biopsy label \nwhich gave no hint of the obvious new use for removing tumors.\n  Under the current law, the FDA has the authority in such cases to \nrequire the manufacturer to submit the data on safety and effectiveness \nof the needle for the new use to be sure that it is capable of removing \ntumors without leaving some cancer cells in place. But not under the \nlaw that is before the U.S. Senate.\n  No woman would want to have a breast cancer removed by a medical \ndevice that cannot do the job safely and effectively. No Member of the \nSenate would want their wife or mother or sister or daughter put at \nrisk by such a device. That is precisely what this bill does in \nchanging the existing law that would permit the FDA to look behind the \nlabel to examine the safety and efficacy of a use clearly intended by \nthe technological characteristics of the device.\n  The proponents of this legislation say no to an amendment when we \nhave tried to ask that the FDA be able to look at the primary use of \nmedical devices to make sure that when a company, such as the U.S. \nSurgical Corporation, is going to say that this is really just the old \nsmall needle, to permit the FDA to look behind it. They say, ``No. \nWe've got the votes. Public be dammed.''\n  Unless the American people are going to pay attention to this issue, \nthey will have the votes when we vote on this next Tuesday. But they \nshould not have the votes on it. They should not have the votes on it \nif we are interested in protecting the American consumer, not only on \nthis particular measure, this particular device, but on others as well.\n  The justification offered by the proponents of this provision is that \nthe FDA, in its zeal to protect the public, has sometimes required \nmanufacturers to offer data on safety and effectiveness on purely \nhypothetical, possible uses of the new device, uses never intended by \nthe manufacturer.\n  If that is the goal of the provision, it goes too far because it puts \npublic health at risk. No American should die or suffer serious injury \nbecause the FDA is forced to ignore false or misleading claims. That is \nwhat Senator Reed's amendment next week will be, just prohibiting false \nand misleading claims. People will have a chance to vote on that up or \ndown.\n  No American should die or suffer serious injury because the FDA is \nforced to ignore false or misleading claims. That is what this is \nabout.\n  As I mentioned, the administration has singled out this proposal as \none of the four in this legislation that merit a veto. It is \nstrenuously opposed by a broad coalition of health and consumer groups. \nAn obvious compromise can correct this defect so it achieves what the \nsponsors say is its legitimate purpose, without undermining health and \nsafety. Under the compromise, the FDA will have the authority to look \nbehind the label only in cases where the label is false or misleading.\n  This is a bare minimum requirement to protect public health. What \npossible justification can there be for the FDA to approve a device \nbased on false or misleading labels? No ethical manufacturer would \nsubmit a device with a false or misleading label. No unethical \nmanufacturer should get away with submitting one. And no Senator should \nvote to protect a false and misleading label.\n  The protection is already in the bill for the 5 percent of the \ndevices that go through the traditional approval process. But for the \n95 percent of the devices that go through the 510(k) procedures, the \nbill gives a license to lie to the FDA and harm the public.\n  Mr. President, a few days ago the public was made aware of \nthe tragedy that resulted from the use of diet drugs in ways that had \nnot been approved by the FDA as safe and effective. This so-called \n``off-label'' use of fen/phen may well have caused serious and \nirreversible heart damage in tens of thousands of women who thought the \ndrugs were safe. The legislation before us would actually encourage the \nuse of off-label, unapproved uses of medical devices. We have seen in \nevery newspaper in the country, we have heard on every radio station, \nevery television, the dangers that the off-label use of fen/phen has \nposed for the American people. Now, just at the time that the country \nis looking at that, we are inviting the same kind of disaster for off-\nlabel use of medical devices.\n\n  It is shocking that this shameful provision has been so cavalierly \nincluded in the bill. It is incomprehensible that reputable device \nmanufacturers are not prepared to support a compromise that allows the \nFDA to look behind the labels that are false and misleading.\n  Medical devices can heal, but they can also maim and kill. The \nhistory of medical devices is full of medical stories of unnecessary \ndeath and suffering.\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\n But thanks to the authority the FDA now has, there are also many \nstories of lives saved by the vigilance of the FDA. What is \nincomprehensible about the bill before us is that it would take us \nbackward in the direction of less protection of public health rather \nthan more.\n  That isn't just Senator Kennedy saying that, Mr. President. Those are \nthe findings of our Secretary of HHS, the Patients' Coalition, Consumer \nFederation of America, National Women's Health Network, National \nOrganization for Rare Disorders, the American Public Health \nAssociation, Consumers Union--the list goes on and on. They have \nreached the same kind of conclusion, Mr. President, that we are going \nbackwards instead of advancing the interests of the public health.\n  The whole story of device regulation has been to provide the public \ngreater protections since the mid-1970s.\n  Mr. President, let me just take a few moments and talk about what has \nhappened previously in terms of medical devices that posed very \nimportant health threats, injury and death to American people when we \nwere not attentive to the public health interests of the people of this \ncountry.\n  Two decades ago, the Dalkon Shield disaster led to the passage of a \nlaw giving the FDA greater authority over medical devices. At the time, \nthis birth control device went on the market, the FDA had no authority \nto require manufacturers to show that devices are safe and effective \nbefore they are sold. In 1974, an FDA advisory committee recommended \nthat the Dalkon Shield be taken off the market--after almost 3 million \nwomen had used it. The device was found to cause septic abortions and \npelvic inflammatory disease. Hundreds of women had become sterile, and \nmany required hysterectomies. According to the manufacturer's own \nestimates, 90,000 women in the United States alone were injured. The \nmanufacturer, A.H. Robins, refused to halt distribution of the device, \neven though the FDA requested it, while the issue was reviewed by the \nadvisory committee.\n  The Shiley heart valve disaster was so serious that it led to the \nenactment of further legislation. This mechanical heart valve was \napproved in 1979. It was developed by the Shiley Company. The Shiley \nCompany was subsequently sold to Pfizer, which continued marketing the \nvalve. It was taken off the market in 1986 because of its high breakage \nrate. By that time, as many as 30,000 of these devices had been \nimplanted in heart patients in the United States. One hundred and \nninety-five valves broke and 130 patients died. Thousands of other \npatients who had the defective valves in their hearts had to make an \nimpossible choice--between undergoing a new operation to remove the \ndevice, or living with the knowledge that they had a dangerous device \nin their heart that could rupture and kill them at any moment. \nDepositions taken from company employees indicated that cracks in \ndefective valves may have been concealed from customers.\n  Before the defective valve was withdrawn, the manufacturer had tried \nto introduce a new version with a 70 degree tilt instead of the 60 \ndegree tilt approved by the FDA. The increased tilt was intended to \nimprove blood flow and reduce the risk of clotting. The FDA's review \nfound that the greater tilt increased the likelihood of metal fatigue \nand valve breakage, and the new version was not approved for use in the \nUnited States. Four thousand of the new devices were implanted in \nEurope. The failure rate was six times higher than for the earlier \nvalve--causing at least 150 deaths.\n  In another example of a human and public health tragedy involving a \nmedical device, the firm Telectronics marketed a pacemaker wire for use \nin the heart. Twenty-five thousand of these pacemakers were marketed, \nbeginning in 1994, before it was discovered that the wire could break, \ncause damage to the wall of the heart, or even destroy the aorta.\n  The case of artificial jaw joints--referred to as TMJ devices--are \nanother tragedy that devastated tens of thousands of patients, mostly \nwomen. These devices were implanted to assist patients with arthritic \ndegeneration of the jaw joint, most with relatively mild discomfort. \nBut the impact of the new joints, sold by a company called Vitek, was \ncatastrophic. The new joints often disintegrated, leaving the victims \ndisfigured and in constant, severe pain. To make matters worse, Vitek \nrefused to notify surgeons of the problems with the joints, and FDA had \nto get a court order to stop distribution of the product. Similar \nproblems were experienced with Dow Corning silicone jaw implants.\n  You see with this chart these dramatic, tragic, human disasters \ncaused by unsafe, inadequately tested medical devices. Do we want less \nsafety? Do we want less protection when we have seen these kinds of \nhuman tragedies take place, when there have been these instances?\n  Mr. President, another device disaster is the toxic shock syndrome \nfrom super absorbent materials in tampons. Most women would not think \nthat a tampon could kill them, but they would be wrong. About 5 percent \nof toxic shock syndrome cases are fatal. What seemed like minor design \nchanges, the absorbency of the material, resulted in enormous human \ntragedy. Women and their families deserve protections from unsafe \nmedical devices. FDA should be strengthened, not crippled.\n  In yet another example, the FDA was able to block a device that \ninvolved a plastic lens implanted in the eye to treat near-sightedness. \nThe device was widely marketed in France, but the FDA refused to \napprove it for use in the United States. Long-term use of the device \nwas later shown to cause damage to the cornea, with possible blindness.\n  The angioplasty catheter marketed by the Bard Corporation turned out \nto be a dangerous device that the company sold with a reckless \ndisregard for both the law and public health. The device was modified \nseveral times by the corporation without telling the FDA in advance, as \nrequired by the law. The company was prosecuted and pleaded guilty to \n391 counts in the indictment, including mail fraud and lying to the \ngovernment. Thirty-three cases of breakage occurred in a two-month \nperiod, leading to serious cardiac damage, emergency coronary bypass \nsurgery, and even death.\n  Now, Mr. President, these tragedies resulted in expanded powers for \nthe FDA to protect the public against dangerous devices and greater \nvigilance on the part of the agency. But this bill steps back by \nforcing the FDA to protect the public with one hand tied behind its \nback. This bill actually forces FDA to approve devices based on false \nand misleading labels.\n  I have already discussed the dangers of a breast cancer biopsy needle \nthat would have been used to treat breast cancer without adequate \nevidence that it was effective. There are many other examples of the \nkind of dangerous devices that could be foisted on the American public, \nif the provision of the bill allowing false and misleading labels is \nallowed to stand. Under the provision, the FDA cannot look behind the \nmanufacturer's proposed use to demand appropriate safety and \neffectiveness data, even if it is obvious that the device has been \ndesigned for an altogether different use than the manufacturer claims.\n  Surgical lasers are increasingly used for general cutting, in place \nof traditional instruments such as scalpels. In a recent case, a \nmanufacturer called Trimedyne adapted the laser in a way that indicated \nit was clearly intended for prostate surgery. But it submitted an \napplication to the FDA saying that the laser was only intended for \ngeneral cutting. The label was clearly false, and the FDA was able to \nrequire adequate safety data before the product was allowed on the \nmarket. But under this bill, the FDA would be forced to approve the \nproduct, without requiring evidence that the device is safe and \neffective for prostate surgery.\n  Prostate surgery is a very common procedure affecting tens of \nthousands, if not hundreds of thousands of older men. Failed surgery \ncan result in permanent incontinence and other devastating side \neffects. Do we really want surgical tools to be used to treat this \ncommon illness that may not be safe and effective? If this legislation \npasses unchanged, that is exactly the risk that large numbers of \npatients needing prostate surgery could face.\n  A further example involves digital mammography, an imaging technology \nthat is becoming an alternative to conventional film mammography. The \nnew\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\ndevice is being tested for better diagnostic imaging of a potentially \ncancerous lump in the breast that has already been detected and shows \ngreat promise. But it is not known whether the new machine can be used \neffectively in screening for breast cancer when there are no symptoms. \nUnder this bill, if a manufacturer seeks approval for a digital \nmammography machine that is clearly designed for breast cancer \nscreening, not just for diagnosis, the FDA would be prohibited from \nrequiring data to show that the machine is effective for screening. \nDoes the Senate really want to support legislation that could result in \nwomen dying needlessly from undetected breast cancer? That is what this \ndevice provision could cause.\n  We know that there is more money that is going to be made by those \nparticular companies that can get on the market faster than their \ncompetitor through this loophole. Is that what we are about in terms of \ntrying to protect the public? The FDA is the principal agency of the \ngovernment to protect the health and safety.\n  The various professionals in consumer organizations and patient \norganizations that spend every day trying to protect the public health \nunderstand the dangers that are involved in this provision. They are \nall saying why doesn't the Senate build in these protections?\n  But no. There is that majority in the United States Senate that would \ngo ahead and accept this, and pass this legislation as it is without \nthe adequate protections. And, unless the public is going to understand \nthat this is something which is important and let their representatives \nunderstand that by Tuesday next, that is what will happen.\n  The President of the United States has had the courage to say no to \nthis particular provision, because he understands, as the Secretary of \nHealth and Education understands, and as the public health community \nunderstands the dangers to the American consumer if we let this \nprovision continue.\n  Mr. President, I want to review as clearly as I can exactly what the \nbill that is before us, S. 830, does. It prohibits the FDA from \nreviewing the safety of a device for uses not listed by the \nmanufacturer.\n  Senator Reed's amendment will prohibit the FDA from reviewing the \nsafety of a device for uses not listed by the manufacturer unless the \nlabel is ``false or misleading.'' You would think we would get 100 \nvotes on that. Is the Senate going to say, ``OK, it is going to be all \nright for device manufacturers to have false and misleading labels?''\n  Other examples in the way that this provision could allow unsafe and \nineffective devices abound. A stent designed to open the bile duct for \ngallstones could be modified in a way that clearly was designed to make \nit a treatment for blockages of the carotid artery. Without adequate \ntesting, it could put patients at risk of stroke or death. But under \nthis bill, the FDA would be prohibited from looking behind the label to \nthe actual intended use of the device.\n  Mr. President, the vast majority of medical device manufacturers meet \nhigh ethical standards. Most devices are fully tested and evaluated by \nthe FDA before they are marketed. But as many examples make clear, if \nthe FDA does not have adequate authority to protect innocent patients, \nthe result can be unnecessary death and injury to patients across the \ncountry. There is no justification--none whatever--for Congress to \nforce the FDA to approve devices with false or misleading labels.\n  Each and every time amendments to medical device and pharmaceutical \nprovisions have been approved by the Congress, Republican and Democrat, \nthe public health and safety of the American people has been enhanced. \nThere are provisions in this legislation that will do so. But not this \nprovision. This provision, if left to stand, poses significant health \nrisks to American consumers.\n  We ought to be making sure that when the FDA gives their stamp of \napproval, that devices are going to be safe and efficacious, and that \nevery doctor in this country and every patient knows they are going to \nmeet the highest safety standards. That ought to be our commitment to \nthe American people.\n  But this particular provision does not do it. Rather than being a \nstep forward, it is a significant and dangerous step backward. \nUnscrupulous manufacturers do not deserve a free ride at the expense of \npublic health.\n  We have good legislation that is going to extend the PDUFA which is \ngoing to mean that we will have many excellent additional professional \npeople to help to move various pharmaceutical products onto the market \nsooner.\n  The public health organizations know what is happening out there, and \nthey have pleaded with all of us in the Senate and said, My God, for \nonce put the profits of this handful of industries that is trying to \ncircumvent the health and safety protections of the American people, \nput that aside and make sure, when you act next week, the roll will be \ncalled, act to protect the public here in the United States.\n  That is what this debate is about. That is what we will have a chance \nto vote on next week.\n  Mr. President, I believe my time is just about up. I thank the Chair. \nWe will have an opportunity to go back to this tomorrow morning at 9:30 \nto add additional information. We hope we will hear from the American \npeople if they care about assuring that their children are going to \nhave safe medical devices, that their parents are going to have safe \nmedical devices, that their daughters and their husbands, their \ngrandparents are going to have safe medical devices. There is only one \nway to do it, and that is on next Tuesday when the rollcall comes, \nSenators will support the Reed amendment, which I welcome the \nopportunity to cosponsor, which will be the most important action we \ncan take in the Senate on this legislation to protect the health and \nsafety of the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/09/18/senate-section/article/S9694-6", "month": "09", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "18", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
