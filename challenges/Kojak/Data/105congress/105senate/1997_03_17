Mr. President, I have a couple of things I wanted to \nvisit about this morning. The first one of the priorities that I and a \nnumber of people have for the 105th Congress is S. 314, the Freedom \nFrom Government Competition Act.\n  This is an effort, along with many other things, to seek to reduce \nthe size of the central Government, which most people agree we should \ndo. It is one of the reasons we try to have a balanced budget \namendment, so that we can control the size of the growth of the Federal \nGovernment by our willingness to pay for it.\n  One of the other areas, of course, that we have been very interested \nin, and continue to be, is the idea of ``devolution''--kind of a new \nword. It means move some of the functions down to State and local \ngovernments so that we do, in keeping with the Founding Fathers, keep \nthe size of central Government relatively limited and do those things \nthat are essential to be done on the national level, and there are \nmany, and yet not do the things that could better be done either at the \nlocal level in government or, indeed, in the private sector. The \nprivate sector is what I want to talk about a little today.\n  In general, from the title, we are simply saying that we want to \nremove the\n\n[[Page S2338]]\n\ncompetition of the Federal Government in those things that could as \nwell or, indeed, better be done in the private sector. So S. 314 is \ncalled the Freedom From Government Competition Act. This bill is \nsupported by a broad cross-section of business groups, and I have a \nlist of those.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the list printed in the Record, along \nwith several letters of endorsement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Groups Supporting the Freedom From Government Competition Act\n\n     National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB).\n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n     Associated General Contractors of America (AGC).\n     National Association of Women Business Owners.\n     American Consulting Engineers Council (ACEC).\n     ACIL (Formerly the American Council of Independent \n         Laboratories).\n     Business Coalition for Fair Competition (BCFC).\n     Business Executives for National Security (BENS).\n     Contract Services Association.\n     Design Professionals Coalition.\n     Management Association for Private Photogrammetric Surveyors \n         (MAPPS).\n     Procurement Roundtable.\n     Professional Services Council (PSC).\n     Small Business Legislative Council.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 1997.\n     Hon. Craig Thomas,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thomas: On behalf of the 600,000 members of \n     the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I \n     commend you for introducing the Freedom From Government \n     Competition Act of 1997.\n       Today government agencies are competing against small \n     businesses in an increasing number of areas. Virtually all \n     goods and services offered by government agencies are \n     available from the private sector, which provides them more \n     efficiently. Small business owners who face government \n     competition spend thousands of dollars to develop their \n     businesses, while their federally funded competitors are tax \n     exempt.\n       NFIB opposes the government's commercial activities that \n     compete directly with small firms in the private sector. In \n     fact, in a recent survey, 70 percent of small business owners \n     expressed their opposition to government agencies being \n     allowed to compete against private businesses. Additionally, \n     unfair government competition was one of the top \n     recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small \n     Business.\n       Your legislation would allow small businesses to compete \n     fairly, and allow small business to do what they do best, \n     create new jobs and grow the economy, while still providing a \n     quality product in an efficient manner.\n       NFIB strongly supports your legislation and stands ready to \n     assist you to stop the practice of unfair government \n     competition against our nation's small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Dan Danner,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Federal Governmental Relations.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                            The Associated General\n\n\n                                       Contractors of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Craig Thomas,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thomas: The Associated General Contractors of \n     America (AGC) thanks you for your leadership on the Freedom \n     from Government Competition Act of 1997, S. 314. AGC strongly \n     supports the concept that the government should not compete \n     with its citizenry. Full and open, fair competition provides \n     low cost, highly qualified contractors for government work.\n       Contracting out government procurement more effectively and \n     efficiently utilizes taxpayer dollars. This bill will \n     encourage the growth of small business and further the \n     competitiveness of large business. In determining commercial \n     areas in which the government unfairly competes with the \n     private sector, common sense outsourcing decisions will be \n     made using the process outlined in the bill.\n       Sound public policy, however, dictates that the government \n     must maintain its stewardship role to safeguard fairness of \n     competition. Oversight of the outsourcing program, ensures \n     that the end result is fair competition. Successful examples \n     of this type of oversight can be seen in the contracting \n     actions of the General Services Administration's Federal \n     Building Fund, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Naval \n     Engineering Facilities Command.\n       AGC stands ready to assist as you to continue your efforts \n     to establish free market competition. Your invaluable \n     leadership on this issue will be needed as Federal Government \n     allows the entrepreneurial spirit to flourish.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Stephen E. Sandherr,\n     Executive Vice President.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Women Business Owners,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 27, 1997.\n     Hon. Craig Thomas,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Thomas: Today government agencies are \n     competing against small businesses in an increasing number of \n     areas. Virtually all goods and services offered by government \n     agencies are available from the private sector, which \n     provides them more efficiently. Small business owners who \n     face government competition spend thousands of dollars to \n     develop their businesses, while their federally funded \n     competitors are tax exempt.\n       Your legislation would allow small businesses to compete \n     fairly, and allow small business to do what they do best, \n     create new jobs and grow the economy, while still providing a \n     quality product in an efficient manner.\n       On behalf of the members of the National Association of \n     Women Business Owners (NAWBO), I commend you for introducing \n     the Freedom From Government Competition Act of 1997.\n       NAWBO opposes the government's commercial activities that \n     compete directly with small firms in the private sector. In \n     fact, in a recent survey, 70 percent of small business owners \n     expressed their opposition to government agencies being \n     allowed to compete against private businesses. Additionally, \n     unfair government competition was one of the top \n     recommendations of the 1995 White House Conference on Small \n     Business.\n       NAWBO strongly supports your legislation and stands ready \n     to assist you to stop the practice of unfair government \n     competition against our nation's small businesses.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Terry Neese,\n                             Corporate and Public Affairs Liaison.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Let me just go over some of these folks who do support \nit: National Federation of Independent Businesses, U.S. Chamber, \nAssociated General Contractors of America, National Association of \nWomen Business Owners, Consulting Engineers Council, Business Coalition \nfor Fair Competition, Design Professionals Coalition, and many others.\n  So it is designed to say basically that in those areas of Government \nactivities and Government operations, for those things that are done \nthat are basically commercial, there ought to at least be an \nopportunity for the private sector to compete. It is designed to open \nthe potential market of $30 billion nationally for businesses, for the \nprivate sector, both large and small. And as a matter of fact, most of \nthe contracts would go to small business.\n  It is designed to level the playing field--those are words we use a \nlot, but they have meaning--for thousands of businesses in the whole \neconomy of this country from the very ordinary kinds of things to high-\ntechnology things--janitorial services, hospitality and recreation \nservice businesses, engineering services, laboratory and testing \nservices.\n  As a matter of fact, I really became involved in this in the \nlegislature in the State of Wyoming where we had government competing \nfor laboratory services, where the private sector was available there \nto do that with the same kind of quality or even better and at less \ncost. So that is what we decided to do.\n  It will provide for better value to taxpayers because it capitalizes \non talent and expertise available in the competitive private sector. It \nhas been Federal policy for a very long time--as a matter of fact, some \n40 years--that contracting out to the private sector would be, indeed, \na function of the Federal Government, but the fact is that it has not \nreally worked out that way. So we need a legislative solution. We say \nwe are going to do it, but we do not do it. And I understand that. Part \nof the reason, of course, is that in an agency you have your own \noperation and your own staff and would prefer to do it.\n  The other is often when there has been some effort to try to \ndetermine the efficiency of it, we find that testing is really not very \nfair and so you end up saying, well, Government can do it cheaper, but \nyou have not really analyzed it in a very fair way.\n  We have a lot of things that the Federal Government should be doing, \nand they take too much time and money on goods and services, in my \nview, that could better be delivered by the private sector.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated in the past that 1.4 \nmillion Federal employees do work that is basically commercial in \nnature. This competition, of course, is tougher on the private sector. \nIt kills small business, stifles economic growth, and lowers the tax \nbase, particularly in States such as mine where 50 percent of the\n\n[[Page S2339]]\n\nState belongs to the Federal Government, and it is difficult to keep \nthe private sector and the tax base going. It hurts small business. So \nit has been a concern of small business.\n  We have had White House small business conferences in 1980, 1986, and \n1994, and in all three of these conferences this has been the major \nconcern.\n  Let me just briefly explain the bill. I indicated that for some \ntime--like 40 years--we have had a policy to do contracting, to bring \nthe private sector in to do things, but they really have not done that. \nSo we are now saying statutorily there is a system for giving small \nbusiness that opportunity. It does not say that it has to do that. It \nsays that when there is a commercial activity, the private sector \nshould be given an even chance to see if they can do it more \nefficiently than the Government. And there are exceptions to that, of \ncourse. There are legitimate, inherent activities of Government, and \nthose will be the exceptions--national security, where the Federal \nGovernment can provide a better value, and we recognize that that can \nbe. We are not asking that it be given to the private sector if, \nindeed, the Federal Government agency can do it more efficiently, or in \nthe case, of course, where the private sector cannot provide the goods \nand services.\n  So this bill establishes a system and a process where the Office of \nManagement and Budget in the executive branch will identify those \nGovernment functions that are ``inherently and basically commercial in \nnature.''\n  It also establishes an Office of Commercial Activities within OMB to \nimplement the bill. So now you do not have the agency that is going to \ndo the contracting making the decision as to whether they do it or not.\n  There will be an outside effort made to identify the functions that \ncould best be done that way and to establish provisions for the \ntransition of Federal employees if there should be some reduction \nthere.\n  The climate, I think, is right for action of this kind. Almost \neverybody agrees we ought to direct the money, if we can save money by \nbetter Government--there are lots of underlying issues, whether it be \ndefense, whether it be health care, whether it be Medicare--to where we \ncan better use those dollars rather than doing the things that someone \nelse could do more efficiently.\n  The Senate was in support of the concept of this bill; last year, the \nSenate voted 59 to 39 in favor of a Treasury-Postal appropriations \namendment that would have prevented unfair Government competition. It \nwas dropped, unfortunately, from the omnibus appropriations bill.\n  If we are going to balance the budget, we are going to have to make \nsome fundamental changes. The Federal Government operating commercial \nneeds is one that we can change and eliminate and reduce. Various \nstudies indicate that we could save up to $30 billion by utilizing \nprivate sector resources. The Heritage Foundation estimates we could \nsave $9 billion annually. The Defense Science Board concluded the \nDefense Department alone could save $30 billion annually.\n  So, the Freedom From Government Competition Act will help to create \njobs in the private sector, help open up markets to private business, \nsave billions of dollars and make Government more efficient. I \ncertainly commend this bill to my associates here in the Senate, to see \nif we could not make a way to increase and strengthen the private \nsector as well as save money to be used on these things that are \nfundamentally Governmental in nature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/17/senate-section/article/S2337-7", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2339-S2340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FINIS MITCHELL\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I join \nWyoming's Gov. Jim Geringer, and the people of the State of Wyoming, in \npaying tribute to Finis Mitchell, a man whose legacy commemorates the \nvery pioneer spirit on which our great country was founded.\n  In remembrance of Mr. Mitchell's innumerable contributions to our \nState, Governor Geringer has issued a proclamation to designate \nFebruary 15, 1997, as ``Finis Mitchell Day.''\n  I ask unanimous consent that the State of Wyoming's proclamation be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  [See exhibit 1]\n  Mr. THOMAS. Finis Mitchell was in the vanguard of mountain climbing \nat the beginning of this century, and continued his exploration of the \nWind River Mountain Range until 1985 when, at the age of 84, he \nsuffered a debilitating knee injury. He documented his climbing \nexperiences through extensive mapping and photography, and eventually \namassed a collection of slides numbering in excess of 126,000. This \nintimate knowledge of the area served as a reference for the U.S. \nGeological Survey in drawing official maps of the Wind Rivers, and \ninspired Mr. Mitchell to share his love of the mountains by penning a \nguidebook and giving educational lectures nationwide.\n  After marrying Emma Nelson in 1923, together they stocked over 300 of \nthe region's lakes with fish and started the Wind Rivers' first \nrecreational fishing camp. To this day, those lakes are being fished by \nthe public. In recognition of his life-long dedication to environmental \nconservation, Finis Mitchell received an honorary doctorate from the \nUniversity of Wyoming, in addition to other State and National awards. \nHe also found the time to serve as a State legislator.\n  Throughout his life, Mr. Mitchell demonstrated strength in his rugged \nindividualism. Starting from a humble beginning with his wife at their \npost-Depression fishing camp, this spirit of determination provided Mr. \nMitchell with the foundation for a lifetime of success. Finis Mitchell \nrose to the challenges of exploring social, educational, and political \nfrontiers just as he made his innumerable treks into the untamed \nwilderness, one step at a time.\n  It can be said that Mr. Mitchell's achievements were a byproduct of \nrespect he had for the lands he called his own backyard, and those \nwhich he helped transform into a sportsman's paradise. The following \npassage in Finis Mitchell's own words surely echoes the sentiment of \nall who have had the privilege of knowing his Winds:\n\n       Evening alone in the mountains. No one to talk to. No one \n     speaking out . . . Only the comfort of a murmuring breeze, \n     the goodnight chirp of the snowbird . . . the glistening of \n     the moon on a distant glacier, the faint music of waterfalls \n     scurrying down. Where else can a man be so close to heaven \n     and still have his feet on the ground?\n\n  Mr. Mitchell's extensive mapping of the Wind River region and his \nnationally recognized wildlife conservation efforts will be appreciated \nby folks from Wyoming, and others drawn to the area from all over the \nglobe, for generations to come. We will continue to share his love of \nnature through the beauty of the majestic vistas and abundant wildlife \nthat make our State like no place on Earth.\n  Mr. President, I would like to close with a quote from ``The \nPioneer'' by James Fenimore Cooper, which seems to epitomize the life \nof Finis Mitchell:\n\n       None know how often the hand of God is seen in the \n     wilderness but them that rove it for a man's life . . .\n\n  Such a man was Finis Mitchell.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Governor's Proclamation\n       Finis Mitchell was born on November 14, 1901 in Ethel, \n     Missouri, the son of the late Henry Reece and Faye Troutman \n     Mitchell. He traveled with his parents from Missouri to \n     Wyoming's Wind River Range, arriving on April 26, 1906.\n       Finis Mitchell started mountain climbing back in October, \n     1909. He continued solo climbing until 1975 when at the age \n     of 73, he suffered a debilitating fall that left him with a \n     bad knee.\n       Finis Mitchell began taking pictures as a hobby with his \n     climbing, so that he could show people where he had been and \n     what was in our national forests. By the time he stopped \n     climbing he had accumulated a collection of 35mm slides in \n     excess of 126,000. Finis spent most of his free time \n     exploring the Wind Rivers, capturing their beauty on film, \n     naming lakes, and mapping the terrain.\n       Finis Mitchell and Emma Nelson were married in Rock Springs \n     at the Congregational Church on June 4, 1925. The two \n     pioneers, in 1930, started Mitchell's Fishing Camp at the Big \n     Sandy Openings, which was to become the first recreation area \n     on the Pacific side of the Wind River Range. Due to the lack \n     of fish, Finis and Emma transported fish in five gallon milk \n     cans, twelve at a time using six pack horses. In the seven \n     years that they operated their fishing camp, they stocked \n     over 300 lakes with over 2.5 million little trout, all free \n     for the public to enjoy.\n       Finis Mitchell had been the recipient of many awards and \n     honors for his conservation\n\n[[Page S2340]]\n\n     efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the \n     National Forest Service and several presidents. He served in \n     the Wyoming House of Representatives from 1955-1958. In 1975 \n     Finis published a guidebook to the Wind Rivers, Wind River \n     Trails. In 1977 he received an honorary doctorate from the \n     University of Wyoming. The Congress of the United States \n     named Finis' favorite mountain after him. Mitchell Peak at \n     12,482 feet, is one of a very few land forms in the country \n     that was named after a living American.\n       Finis Mitchell passed away November 13, 1995, the day \n     before his 94th birthday.\n       Now Therefore, I Jim Geringer, Governor of the State of \n     Wyoming, do hereby proclaim February 15, 1997, to be ``Finis \n     Mitchell Day'' in Wyoming. Known by many as ``Lord of the \n     Wind Rivers,'' Finis Mitchell hiked or backpacked over 15,000 \n     miles and climbed 220 peaks since 1909. He shared his \n     knowledge and experiences with anyone and everyone. He spent \n     a lifetime exploring and learning about the Wind River Range \n     and passing the information on to others.\n       In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused \n     the Great Seal of the State of Wyoming to be affixed this \n     12th day of February, 1997.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to commend the Senator from South \nCarolina, Senator Hollings, for his many years of effort to reform our \ncampaign system. His commitment to this endeavor is principled and \nlongstanding.\n  I have supported the Senator's efforts in the past, cosponsoring and \nvoting for his legislation that would amend the first amendment of the \nConstitution to allow Congress and the States to limit the amount of \nmoney spent on political campaigns.\n  Mr. President, with all due respect to his efforts and my past \nefforts, however, I rise today to speak in opposition to the Senator's \nproposed constitutional amendment.\n  I have supported the Senator from South Carolina's effort in the past \nbecause I believed then, as I do now, that we need to improve our \ncurrent campaign system. But, in my zeal for reform, I ignored what was \nreally at stake.\n  Over the past weeks, however, after much thought and consideration--\nafter many discussions with constituents and reviewing the writings of \nmany constitutional scholars, all of who support campaign finance \nreform--I have come to the conclusion that amending the first amendment \nwould be far worse than the current situation.\n  Indeed, if we passed a constitutional amendment to amend the first \namendment to solve our current campaign finance problems, the cure \nwould be worse than the disease.\n  Mr. President, the proposed constitutional amendment simply takes \naway too much--the cost is too high and the risks too great.\n  The first amendment is properly viewed as one of the most sacrosanct \nbundle of rights protected under the U.S. Constitution and this \nproposed resolution would strike at the heart of the first amendment--\ncore political speech.\n  Mr. President, to support such a repeal, is to threaten the very \nbreath of every other right protected under the Constitution--and then \nnothing is sacred, nothing is sure, nothing is protected.\n  Without free speech, liberty has no meaning.\n  And this amendment would seek to do what the Supreme Court has said \ncannot be done under the first amendment of our Constitution.\n  In 1974, in the seminal case of Buckley versus Valeo, the Supreme \nCourt as the Presiding Officer knows, struck down the Federal Election \nCampaign Act's expenditure limits on candidates, individuals, and \ngroups on first amendment grounds--finding that the Government's \ninterest in, among other things, reducing the appearance of corruption \nwas insufficient to justify restricting core political speech and \nexpression.\n  Mr. President, the question facing the Supreme Court was, at bottom: \n``whether a person can be prohibited from spending money to communicate \nan idea, belief, or call to action''? The Court's answer was ``no.''\n  Since Buckley, the Court has consistently found that the first \namendment protects political speech and expression rights from \nintrusive government restrictions such as campaign spending limits.\n  In FEC versus National Conservative Political Action Committee the \nCourt again struck down spending limits. This time, reaffirming that \nrestrictions on independent expenditures by political committees on \npublicly funded presidential general election campaigns violate the \ncore of the first amendment's protections.\n  More recently, in Colorado Republican Federal Campaign Committee \nversus FEC, the Court found that political party expenditures made \nwithout coordination of a candidate were entitled to first amendment \nprotection as independent expenditures.\n  The Court rejected the argument that independent expenditures \nthreaten corruption or give the appearance of corruption.\n  Mr. President, this amendment is about more than just overturning one \nSupreme Court case, it is about overruling a whole line of first \namendment case law.\n  Over the years, the Court has made it clear that the Buckley decision \nwas not some fluke. In fact, Buckley has been reaffirmed many times \nover. The answer should not be to undo the first amendment because it \nis viewed as an impediment to reform.\n  There are better, perhaps more realistic and more effective ways of \naddressing the problems in our campaign finance system.\n  Mr. President, I believe that changes can be made to improve our \ncurrent system and I intend to support efforts to reform our current \ncampaign finance system.\n  But first, we need to start by enforcing current law, especially in \nregard to foreign contributions. No foreign contributions should be \nallowed to influence our political process.\n  It is important to remember that adopting this amendment won't do \nanything to address the abuses that have recently come to light \nregarding the White House, DNC fundraisers and foreign influence. \nExisting laws were broken in accepting foreign contributions.\n  However, we all know that our current laws are not sufficient. We \nneed to target abusive practices which both parties agree should be \neliminated.\n  And, Mr. President, I believe that one of the most far reaching and \nimportant changes we can make in the system we have today is to demand \nfull disclosure of all campaign contributions and expenditures. The \npublic has a right to know where all funds in the political system come \nfrom and where they go.\n\n  I also remain fully opposed to any form of public financing of \npolitical campaigns and intend to fight efforts to shift the cost and \neffort of running for public office from political candidates to the \ntaxpayer of America.\n  I find it offensive that some would argue that the only way we can \npurify the political process and eliminate the appearance of corruption \nis to launder campaign funding through the U.S. Treasury.\n  American taxpayers should not be forced to pay for political \ncampaigns. We have public financing of Presidential campaigns now, and \nyou can see how effective that was in reducing corruption or the \nappearance of corruption in the last election.\n  Mr. President, reform cannot and should not come at the expense of \nthe public, and yet the reform proposals now being put forth would \nfirst rob American citizens of their first amendment rights under the \nConstitution and then require them to pay for the cost of political \ncampaigns.\n  What a deal. Reform could not be easier--for the political \nestablishment.\n  This amendment has serious ramifications beyond the immediate \nrestrictions placed on an individual's rights to free speech and \nexpression. This amendment also threatens the power of the American \npeople over their Government.\n  By restricting the right to speak freely and to participate in the \npolitical process, we restrict our rights to political debate and \nreduce our ability to control and check our Government. In fact, we \ngive up even the pretense of self-government.\n\n  I would rather be criticized for changing a position than forever \nlimiting the rights of Americans to speak,\n\n[[Page S2341]]\n\nto argue, and to participate in the world's oldest constitutional \ndemocracy.\n  Again, I sincerely commend my friend and colleague, Senator Hollings, \nfor his effort and commitment to campaign finance reform, but I wish he \nwould reconsider, as I have, his commitment to change the first \namendment. I think it would be a mistake now. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, my home State of Oregon has long been known \nfor being innovative in a variety of important public policy areas. The \nOregon Health Plan, for example, is a pioneering effort. We were the \nfirst State to protect our beaches, to go forward with recycling, to \nlook at innovative ways to protect our land, air and water, and we are \nclearly out in front in terms of welfare reform, a key issue to our \ncitizens at this time.\n  Today, I take the floor to talk about how Oregon would like to lead \nthe country once more, this time in the critical area of juvenile \njustice. It is very appropriate that this matter be pursued at this \ntime because, according to the National Center on Juvenile Justice, 47 \nout of 50 States have legislation in their State legislatures that \nwould literally wipe out the State juvenile court system. It is not \nhard to be surprised about why these kinds of things are happening, \nbecause we know that our citizens are angry about the juvenile justice \nsystem in our country.\n  For example, there are many who come to my townhall meetings and say, \n``Ron, 20 years ago we left our car doors unlocked, we left our windows \nopen, and we were safe. But today, it's not that way any longer. I'm an \nolder person, and I'm concerned about going out after 4 o'clock in the \nafternoon. I'm frightened. I'm frightened by what the thugs in my \nneighborhood might do to me.''\n  These citizens are not going to sit around and have debates about \ndiversion programs, which is one approach for juvenile justice, or \nprobation programs. They just want to make sure that they are \nprotected, that they and their families are secure in their homes, and \nthat their right to be free, their civil right, if you will, to be free \nfrom crime in their neighborhood is protected. It is not hard to see \nwhy State legislatures around this country are proposing bills to get \nrid of the juvenile justice system altogether.\n  So I come to the floor today to talk about an effort that is underway \nin Oregon to literally turn the juvenile justice system on its head and \nmake it vibrant again. What we are seeking to do--and it is an effort \nthat is being pioneered in central Oregon and Deschutes County, \nspecifically--is to turn the juvenile justice system on its head and \nmove from a model that was based on prevention and treatment to one \nthat is based on accountability. We call this model community justice.\n  It is community justice because we feel that when a crime is \ncommitted, our community loses something. A person is harmed \neconomically, physically, or emotionally, but also the community is \nharmed. Our community loses a sense of security. It loses funds that \nare needed for police work, and funds that are involved in \nincarceration and in probation. All our community suffers.\n  We believe it is first the responsibility of the system to avoid \ncrimes being committed in the first place, but it also is critically \nimportant that if a crime is committed, the offender must be held \naccountable for making the community whole--the offender must earn \ntheir way back into the community. Prosecutors and police, and others, \nin Deschutes County, OR, have begun a new system built around \naccountability so that if, for example, you have a first-time offender, \na nonviolent first-time offender, who has robbed the home of a senior \ncitizen, what you are going to see is that this young offender is going \nto be required to pay back the community. My sense is that this notion \nof accountability, accountability for juvenile offenders so that there \nare consequences every time a juvenile offender commits a crime, is the \ndirection that we ought to be going.\n\n  In Deschutes County, we look at this as part of what we have come to \ncall the Oregon option. The Oregon option has been an approach that we \npioneered with the Federal Government which stipulates that when local \ngovernment is freed from some of the bureaucratic redtape, in return, \nwe will make sure there are actual results; in other words, that we can \nprove that in return for relief from some of the bureaucratic \nconstraints, we can meet the requirements of a particular community \nservice program.\n  What we are saying in Oregon is that when there are dollars that are \nnow earmarked for, say, prison beds for young offenders, we will \ncommit, under the community justice kind of approach, to making sure \nthose young offenders are held accountable and repay the community. And \nif, in fact, we can't do it, then the community is going to make sure, \nwith community resources, that the goals of the juvenile justice \nsystem, and holding youthful offenders accountable, is met through \nbuying back the prison beds.\n  My view is that this model of community justice is the kind of \napproach that the Congress should look at this year when we consider \nthe juvenile justice statute, which is up again for reauthorization. We \nought to say, as part of that law, that any juvenile justice system \nshould require young offenders to complete accountability contracts to \nensure that they make amends for their offense. We ought to make sure \nthat, as part of the reauthorization of the juvenile justice system, \nlocal programs receive high marks from victims--and here the Chair has \ndone yeoman work, in my view--that victims become the central customer \nof the criminal justice system.\n  I believe that using these kinds of principles, principles of \naccountability, principles of community involvement, principles of \nensuring that victims become the customer of the system, we can build a \nnew system.\n  Not long ago, I went to Deschutes County to learn about their \ncommunity justice program. What I saw was a coalition of police \nofficers, district attorneys, those who work in the juvenile justice \nsystem, Democrats, Republicans, all at a table saying, ``We believe \nthat this new approach for community justice is the kind of approach \nthat the Federal Government should support as part of the Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention Act reauthorization.''\n  Mr. President, I would say that if we can hold youthful offenders \naccountable, if we can ensure that there are consequences each time an \noffense is committed, if the Congress and local communities redesign \nthese programs so as to work with families, we can have a new set of \nprinciples that would define juvenile justice for the 21st century--a \nset of principles that puts the community's needs first and makes the \nvictim the principal customer.\n  I submit, Mr. President, that as the Congress goes forward with \nhearings on the juvenile justice system and the consideration of the \njuvenile justice statute, eyes should focus on what is being done with \ncommunity justice in Deschutes County, OR, because I believe those \nkinds of principles, the principles that represent our community \nvalues, is what we should build the juvenile justice system around for \nthe 21st century.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is a most felicitous time. The ides of\n\n[[Page S2342]]\n\nMarch, so dark with shadows of Caesar's doom some 2,041 years ago, is \nsafely past, and that welcome harbinger of the season's turn, the \nvernal equinox, is close at hand. On March 15, 44 B.C., Julius Caesar \nwas slain in the Senate of Rome by a group of conspirators led by \nMarcus Junius Brutus. On the following day, March 16, 2,041 years ago, \nBrutus went to the Forum to speak to the people of Rome, but he was \nforced to retire to the Capitol after threats were made against the \nconspirators. On March 17, today, 2,041 years ago, Antony, after \nnegotiating with the conspirators, convened the Senate in the temple of \nTellus. In that meeting, a decree was passed that no inquiry would be \nmade into the murder of Caesar, and that all of his enactments and \ndispositions should remain valid for the welfare of the Republic. And \nthat is what the Senate of Rome was occupied with on this day.\n  But today in 1997, the daffodils are blooming, the grass is greening, \nthe crocuses are peeping from the soil, and it is a time to celebrate \nthe birth of a new season. On March 16, seven decades ago, 1,971 years \nafter Brutus spoke to the people of Rome, one of our most sage and \nrespected Senators was born in Tulsa, Oklahoma. And today, March 17, \ninstead of meeting to speak on the death of Caesar, I am here in the \nSenate to honor the life of my colleague from Pindars Corners. Pindar, \nas I am sure my learned friend, the distinguished Senator from New \nYork, knows well, was a Greek poet who lived from circa 522 to circa \n438 B.C. Young Daniel Patrick Moynihan soon moved to New York with his \nfamily, and, after a wartime tour aboard the U.S.S. Quirinus, he, \nPatrick Moynihan, launched his own illustrious academic and public \nservice career.\n  Now, the U.S.S. Quirinus was named after the Sabine God of War and \nwas identified with the deity of Romulus.\n  Senator Moynihan brings a wide-ranging background to his duties as \nthe senior Senator from New York. He has served in the cabinets of four \nPresidents--Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford. He has served as \nambassador to Indian, and U.S. Permanent Representative to the United \nNations. He has received 60 honorary degrees from colleges and \nuniversities--60! His talents have enhanced organizations from the \nNational Commission to Reform Social Security to the President's \nScience Advisory Committee.\n\n  As an academic and as a public servant, Senator Moynihan has turned \nhis inquisitive and incisive intellect to some of the most pressing and \nenduring problems of our society. His thorough and humane understanding \nof poverty in America and of the Social Security system enlightens and \ninforms our discourse. The books that he has published over the years \non these and other subjects are remarkable for their prescience. I know \nthat his statements on the floor are followed closely by Members, \nstaff, and the public, and that they never fail to bring into sharp \nfocus the difficult core of the current debate. To hearken back to the \npoet Pindar, I note that he observed in his ``Olympian Odes,'' ``Vocal \nto the wise; but for the crowd they need interpreters.'' Senator \nMoynihan is the Senate's interpreter on many of the important issues \nfacing the country today.\n  And so, Mr. President, as a septuagenarian and one who is soon to \nbecome an octogenarian, I welcome Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to \nthe club of septuagenarians.\n  The Psalmist says, ``The days of our years are threescore years and \nten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their \nstrength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.''\n  The Lord has blessed Senator Moynihan with the gift of having reached \nthat seventieth year. I was 10 years old when Pat Moynihan was born in \nTulsa, Oklahoma, in that year of 1927. That was the year in which \nCharles Lindbergh took off on the morning of May 20, in his plane, The \nSpirit of St. Louis, and flew from New York City to Paris, with five \nsandwiches--he ate half of one. At times, he flew ten feet above the \nwater and, at times, 10,000 feet above the water. I remember the \nnewspaper headlines speaking of Lindbergh's flight, saying that he flew \nover Newfoundland at the ``great speed'' of 100 miles an hour. And then \nthat was the year when, on September 22, Dempsey fought Gene Tunney. \nJack Dempsey was a former coal miner from Logan County, West Virginia. \nOf course, the coal miners were rooting for Dempsey. And as a boy 10 \nyears of age, I was rooting for Dempsey, also. My coal miner dad told \nme that we would listen to the fight on the radio, which was that \nmarvelous invention that everybody was talking about. That was the \nfirst radio I ever saw when we gathered in the community recreation \nfacility in that coal mining community 70 years ago. I was disappointed \nthat evening because Dempsey did not regain the title, nor did I get to \nhear the fight, because there was only one set of earphones. And then a \nfew days later, on September 30, Babe Ruth batted his 60th home run and \nexceeded his own record of 59 home runs. It was also in that year that \nHenry Ford brought out his new Model A Ford. Hundreds of thousands of \npeople tried to get into Ford headquarters in New York to see it in \nDecember 1927.\n  So, Mr. President, I offer my best wishes to Senator Moynihan on the \noccasion of his birthday. I thank him for all that he has contributed \nto his country and to the Senate. I hope that he and his charming wife \nLiz--and my wife Erma joins me in this--will share his day of \ncelebration with their children, knowing that the respect of his fellow \nSenators and his fellow countrymen are theirs. James I said, ``I can \nmake a lord, but only God Almighty can make a gentleman.''\n  Only God Almighty could make a Daniel Patrick Moynihan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Frist). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/17/senate-section/article/S2341-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2342-S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DAILY DIGEST TURNS FIFTY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today, we reach another milestone in the \nSenate's continually unfolding history. Let us pause for a minute to \nreflect on a fiftieth anniversary of great institutional significance.\n  On March 17, 1947, for the first time, the Congressional Record \ncarried a section under the modest heading ``Daily Digest.''\n  Fiftieth anniversary? Has not the Congressional Record been in \nexistence since March 4, 1873? By my reckoning, that adds up to 124 \nyears, not fifty! Is it possible that there was ever a Congressional \nRecord without a Daily Digest? Those of us who pick up the Record each \nmorning and instinctively turn to the Daily Digest might find that \ndifficult to believe. No one who regularly consults the Congressional \nRecord could reasonably doubt the Daily Digest's value as the \nindispensable point of entry for a bulky compendium that often runs to \nhundreds and hundreds of closely printed, three-columned pages.\n  By the mid-1940's the Record had become so thick that without some \nsort of daily finding aid, it was becoming practically unusable. \nSeveral commercial firms sought to remedy the situation. In 1943 the \nU.S. Chamber of Commerce hired Dr. Floyd Riddick, a highly regarded \nspecialist in congressional procedure, to edit a new publication \nentitled Legislative Daily. The Daily's instant popularity caught the \nattention of congressional reformers in the final months of World War \nII. Desiring to expand public access to the record of Senate and House \ndeliberations, they included in the Legislative Reorganization Act of \n1946 a provision for a Congressional Record Daily Digest. This new \nsection would outline chamber and committee activities for the previous \nday and present a schedule of the current day's legislative program, \nincluding a list of committee meetings and hearings. The statute \ndirected the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the House to oversee \nDigest preparation for their respective chambers.\n  Fortunately for the Senate, Dr. Riddick agreed to serve as Senate \nDigest editor. Starting the Digest was no easy task. Overburdened \ncommittee clerks initially resisted taking the additional notes for \nDigest citations. Getting accurate information at the committee level \nwas particularly important, for in those distant days, once a\n\n[[Page S2343]]\n\nmeasure cleared a committee it was pretty much in shape for final \npassage. Times have changed! Thanks to Dr. Riddick's persistence and \nexpertise, the Digest that he established remains virtually intact a \nhalf-century later.\n  Floyd Riddick served as Senate editor from 1947 to 1952, when he \nmoved to the newly created post of Assistant Senate Parliamentarian. He \nsubsequently served as Senate Parliamentarian from 1964 until his \nformal retirement a decade later. I say ``formal,'' because Dr. Riddick \nremained with the Senate on an unsalaried basis to prepare a history of \nthe Committee on Rules and Administration and, most importantly, to \nrevise the indispensable volume that now bears the title Riddick's \nSenate Procedure.

Mr. President, on March 17, 1937, Amelia Earhart took to \nthe skies in her Lockheed 10E to fulfill her dream to be the first \npilot ever to circumnavigate the globe at its longest point--the \nEquator. Today, she stands as one of our greatest American heroes. \nThrough her vision and spirit, she demonstrated to the world that \nlimits are more often perceived than real.\n  This morning, 60 years after Ms. Earhart began her journey, Linda \nFinch took off from Oakland, CA, to re-create and complete Earhart's \nheroic expedition. Spanning 5 continents and making more than 30 stops \nin 20 countries, Linda will closely replicate Earhart's route. The \nflight is expected to take 2\\1/2\\ months, and is the first to re-create \nEarhart's flight using the same make and model aircraft, a Lockheed \nElectra 10E, with only a pilot and navigator at the controls. Indeed, \nthe aircraft has been meticulously and accurately restored to replicate \nEarhart's Electra right down to its rivets.\n  Linda hopes that her journey, called World Flight 1997, will inspire \nmillions of American children with Earhart's belief that with faith in \nyourself, anything is possible. As she notes, ``World Flight was \ncreated to share Amelia Earhart's vision with young people. The heart \nof the World Flight project is its outreach to inner city and at-risk \nyouth with her message about reaching above and beyond perceived \nlimitations.'' To spread this message, she has developed an interactive \neducational program for students, including an Internet web page that \nwill allow students to track her flight in real time and read messages \nfrom Linda and her navigator. Like her, it is my hope that children all \nover the world will follow her travels, and from them gain the \nconfidence to follow dreams of their own.\n  As Linda begins her flight, I wish her a safe journey. Like her hero \nAmelia Earhart, she is an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/17/senate-section/article/S2343-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2343]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CAPT. BILLY LEWIS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a truly \noutstanding Naval officer, Capt. Billy Lewis who has served with \ndistinction for the past 23 months as Director of the Navy's Senate \nLegislative Liaison Office. It is a privilege for me to recognize his \nmany outstanding achievements and commend him for the superb service he \nhas provided to the U.S. Senate and to our great Nation as a whole.\n  A native of Pensacola, FL, and a 1969 graduate of the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, Captain Lewis began his naval career as the damage control \nassistant aboard U.S.S. Dehaven (DD 727). His follow-on tours of duty \nincluded Naval Headquarters, Saigon, engineer and weapons officer \naboard U.S.S. Talbot (FFG 4), and he was second in command when U.S.S. \nJack Williams (FFG 24) was commissioned in 1983. Capt. Billy Lewis has \nhad three tours of duty in command at sea--U.S.S. Takelma (ATF 113) \nfrom 1977 to 1979, U.S.S. Robert G. Bradley (FFG 49) from 1986 to 1988, \nand U.S.S. Thomas S. Gates (CG 51) from 1993 to 1995. As Commanding \nOfficer, U.S.S. Thomas S. Gates, Capt. Lewis served as Anti-Air Warfare \nCommander for Joint Task Group George Washington.\n  Captain Lewis' duty ashore has included the Naval Postgraduate School \nwhere he earned a master of science degree in management in 1980, and \ntwo tours of duty on the Navy staff in Washington, DC. From 1983 to \n1985, he served as a program analyst in the Office of General Planning \nand Programming, and from 1989 to 1991, he served as head of the \nProgram and Budget Development Coordination Branch for the Deputy Chief \nof Naval Operations. Additionally, he attended National Defense \nUniversity and graduated from the National War College in 1992.\n  During his tenure as the Navy's Director of Legislative Liaison for \nthe Senate which began in April 1995, Captain Lewis has provided \nmembers of the Senate Armed Services Committee, our personal staffs, as \nwell as many of you seated here today, with timely support regarding \nNavy plans and programs. His valuable contributions have enabled \nCongress and the Department of the Navy to work closely together to \npreserve the modern, well-trained and well-equipped naval forces upon \nwhich our country has come to depend.\n  Mr. President, Billy Lewis and his family have made many sacrifices \nduring a 28-year Naval career and made a significant contribution to \nthe outstanding naval forces upon which our country relies so heavily. \nDuring his illustrious career, Captain Lewis has been the recipient of \nmany awards and commendations including the Legion of Merit with one \ngold star. He is a great credit to both the Navy and the country he so \nproudly serves. As he now departs to take command of Regional Support \nGroup in Mayport, FL, I call upon my colleagues to wish him fair winds, \nand following seas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/17/senate-section/article/S2343-2", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2343-S2344]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ST. PATRICK'S DAY STATEMENT BY THE FRIENDS OF IRELAND\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Friends of Ireland is a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators and Representatives opposed to violence and terrorism \nin Northern Ireland and dedicated to maintaining a United States policy \nthat promotes a just, lasting, and peaceful settlement of the conflict.\n  Each year, the Friends of Ireland issues an annual statement of the \ncurrent situation in Northern Ireland. We believe our colleagues in \nCongress will find this year's statement of particular interest because \nof the events of the past year and potential for progress this year. I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n      Statement by the Friends of Ireland, St. Patrick's Day, 1997\n\n       On this St. Patrick's Day, we the Friends of Ireland renew \n     our call for the IRA to restore its cease-fire, which should \n     be followed by Sinn Fein's immediate entry into the Northern \n     Ireland all-party peace talks when they resume in June.\n       The Friends of Ireland commend our former colleague, \n     Senator George Mitchell, for his outstanding service as \n     chairman of the talks. The talks offer an historic \n     opportunity to address the three key relationships which must \n     underpin any settlement--those within Northern Ireland, \n     between North and South, and between Ireland and Britain. We \n     fully support this process, and recognize that there is much \n     greater likelihood for success if all parties with an \n     electoral mandate, including Sinn Fein, participate in the \n     talks. Sinn Fein's participation in the talks, however, is \n     properly conditional on the unequivocal restoration of the \n     cease-fire by the IRA.\n       We also recognize that the IRA maintained a cease-fire for \n     17 months, from September 1994 to February 1996. It is of \n     deepest concern that, during that long and hopeful period, \n     additional obstacles were laid in the way of bringing all \n     parties to the table. We hope that a renewed IRA cease-fire \n     will on this occasion be met with an appropriate response by \n     the British Government, including the taking of necessary \n     confidence-building measures.\n       Basic issues of equal justice and human rights are at the \n     heart of the conflict in Northern Ireland and they must be \n     central to any realistic resolution of the conflict. Peace \n     without justice is not sustainable. It is only likely to \n     flourish when all sides feel that their basic rights are \n     respected and protected. Accordingly, we urge prompt action \n     to remedy outstanding miscarriages of justice such as the \n     Casement and Latimer\n\n[[Page S2344]]\n\n     cases. In light of the compelling new evidence surrounding \n     Bloody Sunday, we add our voice to the calls for a new \n     inquiry into this tragedy.\n       We are also concerned by the deteriorating conditions under \n     which Republican prisoners are being held in Britain and in \n     particular the treatment of Roisin McAliskey. It is \n     essential, in negotiating a new political framework for \n     Northern Ireland, that respect for human rights be \n     guaranteed. The creation of a Bill of Rights, and a police \n     service with the confidence of the whole community, are \n     essential to ensure the protection of the rights of all \n     and to lay a solid foundation for a lasting peace.\n       We strongly oppose the continued and increased punishment \n     beatings by paramilitaries in both communities. Such \n     atrocities have no place in society, and we call for an \n     immediate end to these attacks.\n       It is essential that there be no repeat of the deplorable \n     events during last year's marching season. The RUC behavior \n     at Drumcree further eroded the confidence of the Catholic \n     community in fairness of the police force. As the State \n     Department's Country Reports on Human Rights Practices \n     recently noted: ``Many observers on both sides of the \n     community perceived the Government's reversal in the face of \n     unlawful Unionist protests as a victory of might over the \n     rule of law, and the incident damaged the RUC's reputation as \n     an impartial police force.''\n       We therefore strongly endorse the recommendations in the \n     North Report that an independent parades commission be given \n     full decision-making powers to deal effectively with \n     controversial parades. We are concerned at the British \n     Government's decision to delay implementation of significant \n     sections of the report, which in our view must be in place in \n     advance of this year's marching season.\n       The Friends of Ireland welcome the strong commitment of \n     President Clinton and the Congress to the success of the \n     peace process in Northern Ireland, and the transformation in \n     the situation which all have helped bring about. We are \n     confident that the United States will continue to play a \n     constructive role in encouraging an early and peaceful \n     resolution of the conflict for the benefit of all the people \n     of Northern Ireland.\n\n\n                 friends of ireland executive committee\n\n                                 Senate\n\n       Edward M.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of Senate Joint Resolution 22, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (S.J. Res. 22) to express the sense of \n     the Congress concerning the application by the Attorney \n     General for the appointment of an independent counsel to \n     investigate allegations of illegal fundraising in the 1996 \n     Presidential election campaign.\n\n  The Senate resumed consideration of the joint resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, last week there was an attempt made, I \nthink, on the part of some--not all, but on the part of some--a serious \nattempt made in the Judiciary Committee to put together a bipartisan \nletter to the Attorney General regarding what should be done on the \nquestion of an independent counsel and some of the campaign fundraising \nissues. Unfortunately, it ended up being a partisan matter and the \nRepublican majority, as is their right, sent a highly partisan letter \nasking immediately for an independent counsel.\n  Most of us on the other side sent a letter, which I signed as ranking \nmember, along with other Democratic members, asking basically that we \nfollow the law and we go through the various steps required on the \nissue of independent counsel: That we do not bring political pressure \non the Attorney General to act one way or the other, recognizing that \nthe reason for the independent counsel law was to shield the process \nand the Attorney General from political pressure or posturing.\n  In this regard, I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to \nthe lead editorial in yesterday's Washington Post. The Post has been in \nthe forefront of those investigative journalists who have been working \non stories about many aspects of fundraising that has been taking \nplace, and is taking place, to finance Federal elections--both \nfundraising by the Republican Party and by the Democratic Party. \nCertainly, the Post has not been shy about criticizing Republicans or \nDemocrats, in the Congress or out, with regard to campaign fundraising.\n  It is interesting to read their editorial because, basically, they \ntake the same position as we had taken on the Democratic side of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. They speak of all the reasons to wait and \nfollow the law itself, as she is now doing, and to have the Attorney \nGeneral make her own determination. It ends by saying this:\n\n       There is one other major factor that argues for waiting \n     awhile before deciding whether to seek an independent counsel \n     in the campaign finance case. It has to do with what we \n     believe to be the integrity and, if you will, independence of \n     this attorney general herself. She is an uncommon figure in \n     this town, and this administration, as even many who are \n     banging on the table for an independent prosecutor will \n     agree. We do not think it would be an inducement to sleeping \n     well at night to know she was on your case if you had \n     violated the law and were trying to hide it--especially with \n     her honor being publicly challenged over and over again on \n     this matter.\n       You balance risks in a decision like this. The risk of \n     leaving the case in her hands at this stage, while Justice \n     Department, congressional and other investigators continue to \n     try to flesh it out, seems pretty slim. Events could change \n     that. But right now the matter seems to us to be proceeding \n     well enough without an independent counsel.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the entire editorial be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 16, 1997]\n\n                     The Independent Counsel Issue\n\n       Attorney general Janet Reno says the conditions that would \n     require the naming of an independent counsel in the case of \n     the fund-raising for the president's reelection campaign have \n     yet to be met. She's taking a lot of heat for that. Critics \n     accuse her of trying to protect the president. Congressional \n     Republicans, some Democrats and all manner of other \n     commentators say if ever a case carried out for an \n     independent prosecutor, it is this one. We aren't so sure. \n     Anything could turn up tomorrow. But on the basis of what is \n     known today, an argument can be made that Ms. Reno is right.\n       We say that as strong supporters of the independent counsel \n     statute, though in some instances we have thought past \n     counsels carried on too long or went too far. We say it also \n     as a frequent critic of both the administration and the \n     rotten system of campaign finance, whose corrupting qualities \n     the president did so much to confirm last year. The fund-\n     raising practices, some of them, in which he, the vice \n     president and their adherents indulged were shabby, heavy-\n     handed, demeaning, unseemly, questionable, destructive of \n     public confidence and pretty close to the edge. But it isn't \n     clear they were illegal. That, in fact, is the problem. The \n     law is at least elliptical; not enough of what ought to be \n     illegal is.\n       The virtue of the independent counsel act is that it \n     reduces the conflict of interest that inevitably arises when \n     an administration is called upon to investigate its own \n     behavior. But it is not meant to avert mere awkwardness; it \n     comes into play in only certain instances. The attorney \n     general must seek appointment of an independent counsel (by \n     the special court created to do so) when confronted with \n     specific, credible evidence of criminal wrongdoing by the \n     president, vice president, Cabinet officials and certain \n     others in the executive branch, including a limited number of \n     senior White House aides. She also may seek appointment of a \n     counsel when confronted with evidence of such conduct by a \n     lesser official where she feels there is a conflict.\n       The evidence of such conduct in this case thus far is a lot \n     more limited than the churning surrounding the case would \n     suggest. A lot of pretty squalid stuff was done. But so far \n     as we know, no specific, credible evidence exists that, say, \n     an official covered by the act sold a particular piece of \n     policy for a campaign contribution, or knowingly accepted \n     money from a forbidden source. You could make the generic \n     charge against both presidential campaigns that they violated \n     and pretty well trashed the campaign finance laws, including \n     their criminal provisions, by raising so much so-called soft \n     money in excess of federal limits. They pretended it wasn't \n     campaign money when it\n\n[[Page S2345]]\n\n     clearly was. But no one is talking about that in this case, \n     least of all the congressional Republicans who want an \n     independent counsel but oppose most regulation of campaign \n     finance. There are charges that funds were illegally \n     raised (by the vice president, for one) and received \n     inside a federal building--the very White House itself--\n     instead of in some other building down the street, but you \n     can find any number of lawyers who will say on one basis \n     or another that what was done was not illegal, and does \n     anyone really want to name an independent counsel to \n     conduct a criminal prosecution of the vice president for \n     making a phone call from the wrong room? That isn't what \n     this is about, either.\n       More serious charges have been leveled against some lesser \n     figures in the drama--that they laundered money from foreign \n     sources, sought favors in return for contributions, etc. Ms. \n     Reno has set up a task force to investigate these. As a \n     practical matter, what the task force appears to have been \n     conducting is precisely the kind of preliminary inquiry, \n     though by another name, that would be required if the \n     independent counsel statute were invoked, the question being, \n     what evidence is there that criminal conduct occurred? If \n     such conduct is found, and found to be of a kind that \n     requires the naming of an independent counsel, Ms. Reno may \n     yet ask for one. In a sense, what's going on is what the \n     critics claim to want, but without the label.\n       Meanwhile, the independent counsel already investigating \n     the president in the Whitewater case, Kenneth Starr, is also \n     looking into what you might call one of the most advanced \n     aspects of the campaign finance case, which is whether \n     political donors were somehow called upon to hire Clinton \n     family friend and former associate attorney general Webster \n     Hubbell before he went to prison several years ago, the \n     question being whether the large amounts of money paid him as \n     Mr. Starr was seeking information from him were meant to hush \n     him up.\n       There is one other major factor that argues for waiting \n     awhile before deciding whether to seek an independent counsel \n     in the campaign finance case. It has to do with what we \n     believe to be the integrity and, if you will, independence of \n     this attorney general herself. She is an uncommon figure in \n     this town, and this administration, as even many who are \n     banging on the table for an independent prosecutor will \n     agree. We do not think it would be an inducement to sleeping \n     well at night to know she was on your case if you had \n     violated the law and were trying to hide it--especially with \n     her honor being publicly challenged over and over again on \n     this matter.\n       You balance risks on a decision like this. The risk of \n     leaving the case in her hands at this stage, while Justice \n     Department, congressional and other investigators continue to \n     try to flesh it out, seems pretty slim. Events could change \n     that. But right now the matter seems to us to be proceeding \n     well enough without an independent counsel.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I sometimes think that those who are \nscheming for an independent counsel for this and an independent counsel \nfor that, counsel that often cost $20 or $30 million of the taxpayers' \nmoney, and millions of dollars more of individuals' money, have not \nbothered to stop and think what they are asking for. It may be good for \nthe evening news and may make a Member of the House or Member of the \nSenate feel good because his or her name gets in the paper, but does it \nreally help this country?\n  In fact, some might ask about this rush to come on the floor Friday, \nthe steady stream of my friends on the Republican side of the aisle who \nblast the President and tear after the President. I am surprised they \ndid not say, ``Why don't we double-check with Bethesda as to what time \nhe will actually be in surgery so maybe we could go on recess or go to \nour own fundraisers at that time and then come back and make sure he \nsees just how we are tearing him apart.''\n  I suggested half joking on Friday that they would set aside another \n$1 million that we could appropriate of the taxpayers' money to send a \ndelegation of Members up to Bethesda to make sure, indeed, he was being \noperated on. It was about that ridiculous.\n  I first came to the Senate at a time when Democrats and Republicans \nshowed some respect for whoever was holding the office of President of \nthe United States and had some realization that the person serving as \nPresident, like the rest of us, is a human being and an individual. \nYet, I have heard Members on this floor pillory the President, pillory \nhis wife, his child, even at times his mother and others, as though \nsomehow they don't have feelings. I have heard things said about him \nthat, if we said them about each other, we could be censured by the \nSenate--even though some of the things said may be more applicable to \nsome in this body.\n  I remember a time, a time when the Democrats were in the majority, \nsince I have been here, when an issue was coming up, for example, about \nPresident Ford on personal issues. We held off--maybe he was taking a \ntrip abroad--and we held off on issues.\n  The same with President Reagan. Again, when the Democrats were in the \nmajority in the Senate, we would hold off issues of criticism of the \nPresident as he was about to leave to go abroad.\n  The same with President Bush.\n  Yet, here we have the President of the United States, who has just \nundergone what I have to imagine is extremely painful surgery--the \nPresiding Officer would be able to understand that better than I \nbecause of his own distinguished medical background. I think by all \naccounts it was a very painful situation. They tell me tearing a tendon \nis more painful than breaking your leg. I know, from some of my \ncolleagues here who have torn Achilles tendons, or others, have told me \nthat is so.\n  Here he is, the President of the United States, undergoing very \npainful surgery. But notwithstanding the pain he must be in, because of \nthe importance of the relationship between the United States and the \nworld's other major nuclear power, Russia, he is going forward with his \nsummit meeting with President Yeltsin. The President, who is going to \nbe traveling very painfully to Helsinki--whether it is Air Force One or \nnot. I have ridden enough times on Air Force One with various \nPresidents to know Air Force One can hit turbulence, too, and bounce \nyou all around. It will be a painful trip.\n  None of this seems to make any difference. They still proceed on the \nfloor, Friday and today, blasting the President with resolutions and \nstatements. This timing ensures, of course, that all this will be in \nthe world's press, in Helsinki and elsewhere, just in time to be \ndelivered to all those in the Russian party when he arrives.\n  Mr. President, I don't know if the Senate is just spinning out of \ncontrol without any sense of propriety or decorum. Perhaps, at the age \nof 56, I have become the old-fashioned Member of the Senate. But I have \nbeen here for 22 years, and whether it was in my first year as a 34-\nyear-old former prosecutor or now as a 56-year-old senior Member of the \nSenate, I do know that we have followed a tradition of some propriety \nin this body.\n  We have done that time and time again. We have withheld resolutions, \nquestions or disapproval of a President when he was leaving to go \nabroad or was abroad so we could at least present a united face to the \nrest of the world.\n  Yet, I have heard Members come on the floor and make highly critical \nstatements of President Clinton when he has been at summit meetings \noverseas, statements that had to be read by all the people with him \nfrom around the world. That, I think, was unseemly. Just as I believe \nhaving this resolution at this time at the beginning of the Helsinki \nsummit is highly insulting, shows no sense on the part of the U.S. \nSenate and, frankly, of those who brought it forward at this time, of \nthe kind of image we should give the rest of the world.\n  I am not suggesting by any means that we cannot question the \nPresident of the United States. I have done it, other Members have done \nit, both this President and other Presidents. That is perfectly \nappropriate under our separation of powers and under our duties as \nMembers of the Senate.\n  But I suggest that there are certain times when, by tradition--and a \ntradition that has served this country very well--that we at least back \noff and show some unity. One such time, just out of a sense of common \ndecency and perhaps upbringing, would be when the President is in the \nhospital recuperating from a fairly painful and serious injury. One \nwould think that we would not see this happening in the U.S. Senate. I \nquestion what we are coming to.\n  But by tradition, by a sense of propriety, and by a sense of Senators \nputting their country ahead of their political partisan posturing, we \nhave at least held off at the beginning of a foreign trip by a \nPresident or at the beginning of a summit.\n  Mr. President, I was thinking of this matter this morning as I was \ncoming to work. Comments were made to me over the weekend while I was \nhome in Vermont by a number of people who are not Democrats, who \nthought that it was unseemly. I have not talked with anyone at the \nWhite House about this\n\n[[Page S2346]]\n\nor anybody in my leadership or anybody in my office. This is simply \nsomething I started thinking about. It bothers me that we have reached \nthe point where we are not showing the sense of history in this body \nthat has served the Senate very well in the past, and has also served \nthe country well.\n  I urge those who determine the timing of issues before the Senate to \ntake some time during the Senate recess and read a history of the \nSenate and read a history of the actions of the great leaders of the \nSenate, Republican and Democrat alike--and we have had great leaders in \nboth parties. Read about the number of times when they have put the \nUnited States ahead of their own partisan fortunes, when they have put \nthe United States ahead of their own ability to be in the news, and, \nfrankly, when they realized that the U.S. Senate can be and should be \nthe conscience of the Nation. We should uphold that conscience of the \nSenate so that the Senate can be the conscience of the Nation.\n  With some in this body, it will be a rereading of the history of the \nSenate. Frankly, Mr. President, one has to assume that for some, it \nwill be a reading of the history of the Senate, and that perhaps in all \ntheir efforts to get here, the time-consuming and difficult chore that \nis, they did not have a chance to read the history of the U.S. Senate \nbefore they arrived. But now is as good a time as any. There is going \nto be a 2-week recess, and that should allow some time to read it. \nSenators cannot be at fundraisers all of the time during that recess. \nRead over the history.\n  I urge the leaders, those who determine the schedule of this place, \nthat in the future, when the President is about to embark on a major \nsummit, in this case with the other major nuclear power of the world, \nthat they not bring up resolutions designed to embarrass him, designed \nactually to be voted on the day that he would arrive. As it turns out, \nit won't be, because he is delayed by a day because of his injury.\n  We are not playing school-board politics here. We are not some small-\ntown board. This is the U.S. Senate. There are only 100 of us who get \nthe opportunity to serve at any one time, but we represent a quarter of \na billion people in the greatest, most powerful democracy history has \never known. I think we all know that. It doesn't matter whether we are \nRepublican, Democrat; conservative, liberal, moderate; no matter what \npart of this country we are from; we know, instinctively, that we \nrepresent the greatest democracy history has shown.\n\n  But instinctively knowing and diligently upholding the responsibility \nof U.S. Senators to represent that Nation are two different things. If \nMembers want to criticize the President, that is their right. If they \nwant to embark on another investigation, like the rather pointless one \nthe Senate already has, Whitewater--pointless, except for the fact it \ncost the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars--fine, they have a \nright to do that. But at least let's make an effort to present a united \nface when the President of the United States goes abroad on a major \nsummit. At least give the President of the United States as much \nbacking as possible when he is representing all the United States--not \nDemocrats, not Republicans--all the United States.\n  I am reminded of a story my father had told me many times about my \nState, which for many years was the most Republican State in this \ncountry. In fact, after 22 years as a U.S. Senator from Vermont, I am \nstill the only member of my party ever to represent Vermont in the U.S. \nSenate. In fact, we are the only State in the Union that has only \nelected one Democratic Senator, and I am it. Sorry about that, Mr. \nPresident, but it happens.\n  My father told me how the National Life Insurance Co. in the thirties \nand forties, basically ran the Republican Party in Vermont. They \ndetermined every 2 years who was going to be Governor. You had to be \nvery much a Republican.\n  In the late thirties--I believe it was 1937--Franklin Roosevelt came \nto Vermont to look at some flood control projects. He was driving down \nState Street in Montpelier, past our statehouse and past the National \nLife Insurance building--they were two separate buildings, although it \nwas sometimes hard to tell which was which--in an open car. My father, \nthe lone Democrat in Montpelier, was standing there, as chance would \nhave it, next to the president of National Life who was then the de \nfacto chairman of the Vermont Republican Party. As the open car went by \nwith Franklin Roosevelt in it, the men all stood at attention and the \npresident of National Life, like all the other men, took his hat off--\nthey all wore hats then--and held it over his heart as President \nRoosevelt drove by. My father could not resist the temptation to chide \nhim a little bit then, and he said, ``I can't believe you took your hat \noff for Franklin Roosevelt.'' The president of National Life replied, \n``Howard, I didn't take my hat off for Franklin Roosevelt. I took my \nhat off for the President of the United States.''\n\n  What he did was show respect. Respect does not have to be blind. It \ndoes not mean we do not question things here. We have great respect on \nthe Democratic side of the aisle for the Republican leadership, just as \nI would hope they would for the Democratic leadership. But it does not \nmean we vote with them all the time, by any means. There is a \ndifference.\n  We show respect in this body, just following Jefferson's Manual, by \nthe way we address each other. It does not mean we agree. We might be \nfighting hammer and tong, but we say ``my distinguished colleague,'' \nand so on and so forth.\n  We should show respect to the President of the United States when he \nis going abroad to represent every single American. We are the only \ncountry left on Earth that still does have the ability to destroy the \nworld overnight with nuclear power.\n  Every one of us on this floor, especially every Democrat on this \nfloor, always showed that respect for President Reagan when he was in \nsimilar situations, and for President Bush.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Massachusetts on the \nfloor. He has served here longer than all but a couple of Members. I \nthink the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is one who would \nwell remember both Republican and Democratic members of the Senate and \nthe House showed some restraint and unity with them.\n  This resolution could easily be brought up after the President came \nback, or any other time. There is absolutely no urgency to bring it up \nnow. But it is brought up on the eve of his trip to Helsinki to have a \nsummit meeting with the President of Russia.\n  Mr. President, frankly, in my estimation, this is a new low for the \nU.S. Senate. In my estimation, this is something I have never seen \nhappen here before. In my estimation, those who determined to bring \nthis resolution up at the beginning of the Helsinki summit ought to be \nashamed of themselves. They ought to admit they are ashamed of \nthemselves and put it off for another time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support the \nDemocratic alternative, and to reject this one-sided, partisan, and \nunseemly attempt to force the Attorney General to act.\n  On the issue of the independent counsel, last week, the Senate voted \nunanimously to give the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee a broad \nmandate to investigate campaign violations in all Federal elections, \nwhether by Democrats or Republicans.\n  Our able and trusted Attorney General, Janet Reno, already has a task \nforce in full operation investigating these issues. More than 30 \nspecial agents from the FBI serve on this task force. The task force \nhas already issued subpoenas and presented testimony before a grand \njury.\n  Last Thursday, Republican members of the Judiciary Committee wrote to \nthe Attorney General urging her to seek an independent counsel. That \nletter requires the Attorney General to examine whether an independent \ncounsel should be appointed and to report to the Judiciary Committee on \nthe actions that she takes.\n  The Republican resolution now before us proves that Republicans are \nnot\n\n[[Page S2347]]\n\nserious about conducting an evenhanded inquiry into campaign finance \nviolations. It focuses only on the Presidential campaign and ignores \nthe many allegations of serious abuse in Republican congressional \nraces.\n  We faced similar partisan tactics in the debate last week on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee's investigation. Democrats called for a \nbroad inquiry covering both illegal and improper activities and \nincluding both Presidential and congressional campaigns. But the Senate \nRepublican leadership resisted. They were only interested in putting \nthe spotlight on the White House and diverting attention from abuses by \nRepublicans in Congress.\n  In the end, their efforts to suppress a responsible inquiry could not \nstand the light of day. Republicans joined Democrats in voting \nunanimously in favor of the Democratic position that the Governmental \nAffairs Committee should investigate all campaign abuses--Presidential \nand congressional, Republican and Democrat.\n  Why don't we hear Republicans calling for an inquiry into the role of \nmoney in last year's fight to raise the minimum wage? The majority of \nAmericans supported an increase in the minimum wage to enable American \nworkers to support their families. But money from special business \ninterests was rolling into Republican campaigns as corporations tried \nto block this long-overdue raise for working Americans. When an \nincrease in the minimum wage became inevitable, Republicans added \nprovisions giving huge tax breaks to business as a consolation prize.\n  Why don't we hear Republicans demanding an investigation of the role \nof money in last year's fight over medical savings accounts? The MSA \nproposal threatened to block the whole Kassebaum-Kennedy health care \nbill. The Golden Rule Insurance Co., was the driving force behind \nmedical savings accounts. Golden Rule made more than $1 million in \ncampaign contributions. In October 1994 alone, just before the midterm \nelection, it delivered $416,000 in soft money to the GOP. Only two \nother companies gave more to the Republicans in that election cycle.\n  Golden Rule contributed lavishly to Newt Gingrich's GOPAC political \naction fund. Without Golden Rule and its huge contributions to \nRepublicans, medical savings accounts would never have been an issue. \nRepublicans were willing to jeopardize health care for working families \nin order to channel higher profits to insurance companies.\n  But what about the Republican regulatory reform proposals in the last \nCongress? Utility lawyers in a Richmond, VA, law firm are reported to \nhave drafted the Dole bill in the last Congress--the same law firm in \nwhich Senator Dole's counsel and chief aide on that bill had been \nemployed only weeks before. That firm represented utility companies, \nchemical companies, and tobacco companies all seeking to increase their \nprofits by weakening regulations requiring companies to keep our food \nsafe and our environment and water clean.\n  In fact, when the time came to inform Democrats about the Republican \nbill, the briefing was not conducted by Republican staff, but by three \nlawyers from the law firm.\n  So if Republicans are serious, these offensive actions that \njeopardized the health and well-being of millions of Americans would be \non the list for investigation, too.\n  Surely, if there is to be an investigation by an independent counsel, \nthese abuses should be within the scope of the investigation, too.\n  President Clinton and Democrats in Congress are talking about better \neducation and health care for children, good jobs for working \nAmericans, protections for the environment, saving Social Security and \nMedicare while balancing the budget, preventing crime, and reforming \nthe current shameful system of campaign financing. Our Republican \nfriends are interested in none of the above. They are shamefully \nabdicating their responsibility to prepare a congressional budget \nresolution. They are stonewalling any campaign finance reform. They are \nmore interested in investigating who slept in the Lincoln Bedroom than \naddressing the issues that keep working families sleepless at night.\n  Attorney General Reno doesn't need this kind of partisan advice to do \nher job and decide whether to appoint an independent counsel. Our \nDemocratic alternative calls on the Attorney General, in determining \nwhether an independent counsel is necessary, to ``exercise her best \nprofessional judgment, without regard to political pressures and in \naccordance with the standards of the law.'' It is the responsible thing \nto do.\n  Attorney General Reno has earned broad bipartisan respect for her \nhonesty and integrity. Congress should not pressure her to suspend the \ncurrent Justice Department investigation and turn it over to an \nindependent counsel. We certainly should not pressure her to seek an \nindependent counsel whose mandate would conveniently ignore the obvious \nabuses of Republican congressional campaign financing.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Democratic alternative and to \noppose the Republican resolution.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I said earlier that I have never seen a \ntime in my 22 years here when those who control the majority of the \nSenate would schedule a resolution of this nature as a President was \nleaving for a summit meeting--even some of the less significant \nsummits, and certainly not for a summit with the leader of a nation \nthat is, militarily, a nuclear superpower.\n  I can think of a number of times when there were issues that were as \ntroublesome to Democrats, who had controlled the majority of the \nSenate, as this is to Republicans, or as they say it is--so long as it \nis limited just to investigate the Democratic President and not \nthemselves. There were times when I was here in the majority with \nRepublican Presidents, including President Ford, President Reagan, and \nPresident Bush, and time and time again we held off matters that we \nwere thinking of bringing to the floor, even legislation, that might be \na matter of some contention while the President was abroad at a summit \nmeeting. At no time would even the most junior member of the Democratic \nParty, when the Democrats were in the majority, consider bringing up \nsomething like this while a Republican President was abroad.\n  I think it shows one of the most egregious breakdowns of any \nbipartisan comity in this body, to see this come up as the President is \nabout to go to Helsinki. I think certainly in my 22 years of \nexperience, it is completely unprecedented. I think it is outrageous. I \nthink it is inexcusable. It does not mean that this whole issue could \nnot be debated when the President came back. It might mean that we \nwould have to delay our 2-week vacation by a couple of days to do it. \nBut we might present a better face to the rest of the world.\n  It has become so partisan around here that we look first to partisan \nadvantage and not for the advantage of the country. Some in Congress \nsimply cannot avoid the temptation to jump the gun and demand another \ncostly, time-consuming, largely unaccountable, potentially destructive \nindependent counsel--provided it is only to investigate a Democratic \nPresident. Certainly, there is no effort to go and look at any \nactivities of the Republican Party.\n  Senate Joint Resolution 22 does not advance the administration of \njustice. It was drafted and introduced before the Republican and \nDemocrat members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and those of the \nHouse Judiciary Committee sent letters to the Attorney General. Those \nletters are congressional actions contemplated by the independent \ncounsel law. This resolution is not and does not take those actions \ninto account. We have begun a process that will yield the reports from \nthe Attorney General that are allowed by the statute. We ought to give \nthat process a chance to work.\n  This resolution, if it was a law, would probably be found \nunconstitutional. It certainly is not authorized by the independent \ncounsel law. In my view, it is\n\n[[Page S2348]]\n\nan inappropriate effort to pressure the Attorney General and to \nprejudge these matters. One of the main reasons this kind of a \nresolution is not contemplated in the law is to keep political and \npartisan pressure off the Attorney General. It perverts the independent \ncounsel process.\n  The independent counsel law was passed to ensure that investigative \nand prosecutorial decisions are made without regard to political \npressures. This resolution would subvert that purpose by subjecting the \ncritical initial decisions about invoking the law to such political \npressures.\n\n  It is not Congress' place to determine when to bring criminal \ncharges. This body is ill-suited to that purpose. The administration of \njustice is ill-served by efforts to intimidate a prosecutor to begin a \ncase.\n  The resolution of the distinguished Republican leader will serve only \nto undermine the investigation that the Attorney General now has \nunderway and will undercut the independent counsel law. It will further \nerode public confidence in the Government's ability to do its job.\n  We ought to do our job up here and let the Attorney General do hers. \nWe are having a hard enough time doing our own job. We have yet to see \n1 minute of debate on the budget resolution which has to be passed by \nmid-April. We have not seen one single judge get confirmed. We have \nbeen voting them out of the committee at the rate of three-quarters of \na judge a month, and none has come to the floor, not in 6, 7, or 8 \nmonths, and there are 100 vacancies in our Federal judiciary. The Chief \nJustice calls it a crisis. Yet, even though we are paid and elected to \ndo that, to consider and confirm judges, we have not confirmed a single \njudge. We have not brought up the budget. We have a chemical weapons \ntreaty which is languishing.\n  But we can break all precedent and bring up a resolution attacking \nthe President as he leaves on a summit with the President of Russia, \nthe other nuclear superpower, something that has never been done \nbefore, something that any Democrat, when we have been in the majority \nand leading this body, would have been ashamed to do to a Republican \nPresident because we know it was so much against the best interests of \nthe United States. Even though it might further our own short-term \npolitical gains, we would not want to damage the United States, the \nPresident's credibility or the President's ability to represent the \nUnited States abroad, so we would not have done it and did not do it.\n  There are a lot of issues the Senate could be considering that are \nwithin our responsibilities, do reflect our duties in this Government \nand do reflect what is in the best interests of the country. This is \nnot one of them. It is an affront to the constitutional separation of \npowers established by the Founders. Investigation and prosecution of \ncrimes is left to those experienced in the use of that awesome power, \nnot matters for a political body.\n  When I was a prosecutor, I knew as a prosecutor I had the power to \nbring or to withhold prosecution. It was not anything I was willing to \nshare with any legislative body. I hoped I would resist that temptation \nif I were ever a legislator and not a prosecutor.\n  It makes as little sense as the call by some in the Republican Party \nfor the Congress to be able to overturn any judicial decision of any \nFederal court by just a majority vote. This concept would have been \nlaughed down by the Founders of our country. They wanted three \nindependent branches of Government: The executive branch, the \nlegislative branch, and the judicial branch. Government 101--in most \nschools, you learn it in the first or second grade.\n  What they are now saying, even though part of the strength of our \ndemocracy and the protection of our democracy is an independent Federal \njudiciary, even though we have a Federal judiciary that is the envy of \nall other countries because of the quality of the men and women in it \nand their integrity and their independence, we now have some who say, \n``Well, cut out the independence, we will have the Congress stand up \nand vote to decide whether a decision is right or wrong in a court. We \nwill just overturn it. We will become a super court of appeals.''\n\n  As though we don't have enough to do. We can't bring up a budget. The \nchemical weapons treaty isn't before us either to be voted up or down. \nWe haven't even found time to vote to confirm 1 single judge when there \nare 100 vacancies in the Federal courts. But somehow we are going to \nhave time to start reading judicial opinions and decide whether to vote \nto overturn them? I wonder how many judicial opinions most Members of \nthis body have read since they have been here. I wonder how many are \nprepared to sit down and read the thousands delivered every year. This \nis balderdash of the first order.\n  Then, yes, the other thing they are going to do, there are now \nMembers in the other body who suggest that if we don't like a decision, \nimpeach the judge. Now, some who were saying that, I will grant you, \nhave read--I have suggested that some don't read enough in this body--\nbut some of those who say ``just impeach the judge'' when we disagree, \nthey have at least read something. Unfortunately, they read Lewis \nCarroll's ``Alice in Wonderland'' and got stuck in the part where the \nqueen says, ``Off with their heads.'' Every time the queen disagrees \nwith something, ``Off with their heads.''\n  Well, we are a gentler and kinder nation, so some say, ``I disagree, \nimpeach him, impeach him.'' My goodness, it sounds like the chipmunk \nchorus, like we hear in some of the songs at Christmas time.\n  This country was made by giants. Let us not have it torn down by \npygmies. Let us respect our three branches of Government. Let us \nrespect the independence of our judiciary. Mr. President, I have tried \na lot of cases. Some I won; some I lost. But if I lost them and felt \nthe case wrongly decided, I would appeal them. If somebody on the other \nside lost, they could appeal. That is what you do. I can imagine the \nhoots if somebody in one of these cases who lost, immediately said that \nwe have to impeach the judge. We have appellate courts--appeal it. What \nare you going to do if you disagree with the appellate courts? Are you \ngoing to impeach them? Suppose they are upheld by the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. I can see a delegation of us going right out that door, Mr. \nPresident, straight across the street with our torches held high, our \npitchforks brandished, our tumbrels ``tumbreling''--the reporter of \ndebates will have fun with that one--saying, ``We are here to impeach \nthe Supreme Court, you naughty boys and girls. You voted differently \nthan we think you should have.''\n  You know, I was reminded today of the first time that I saw a \nbillboard to impeach the Supreme Court was when I was 18. I made my \nfirst trip down here. Some were upset that the Supreme Court didn't \nwant to uphold segregation, so ``impeach the Supreme Court'' was their \nslogan. How laughable, in hindsight. How acceptable is the repeal of \nour segregation laws today. How laughable, in retrospect, were those \nbillboards of that time. But at the time they were popular with a \ngroup. They were popular with a segment of the political society, and \nso that was why the billboards were there.\n  Well, I have no question in my mind that it may be popular today for \nsome to say ``impeach judges'' when we disagree with them--but not for \nthe high crimes and misdemeanors the Constitution speaks of, not for \nthe only ground the Constitution allows for impeachment, but simply \nbecause we disagree with their decision. It may be popular with some.\n  In retrospect, it will be seen as laughable.\n  But at the moment it is dangerous. It is dangerous, Mr. President, \nbecause a democracy exists only if we have respect for the institutions \nof a democracy. A democracy exists only if we follow our traditions and \nour laws and our best instincts. This does none of that. It doesn't \nfollow tradition, and it doesn't follow any laws or our best instincts. \nMost importantly, it does not follow the Constitution, the remarkable \ninstrument that has maintained this Nation for over 200 years. It has \nturned us into the most respected, most powerful democracy known to \nhistory.\n\n  I urge all Senators, all House Members, all of us who have the \nresponsibility, who have taken the oath to uphold the Constitution, to \nstep back a moment, stop the foolishness of these calls for \nimpeachment, stop the irresponsibility of refusing to fill judicial\n\n[[Page S2349]]\n\nvacancies, stop the attacks on the President as he moves from his \nhospital bed to one of the most important summits he will have of his \nPresidency.\n  This does not mean we cannot criticize. Everybody is free to vote for \nor against any proposal of the President. Any one of us is free to vote \nfor or against any amendment of mine or anybody else's.\n  But what we are not free to do is, for short-term political gain, is \ntear down the best things that make this country run. We are not free \nto tear down the Constitution on issues of judicial appointments or \nindependence just because it may sound good in a speech back home or to \na fundraising group. We are not free to try to design the timing of \nresolutions to embarrass a President when he is about to go into a \nmajor summit.\n  Frankly, I will put my money on the President handling that summit \nwith all of the issues involved, from the democracy movements within \nthe former Soviet Union to our own nuclear security. Maybe the \nPresident is better off to have some in this body distracted by voting \non this, rather than thinking of other things they could do to try to \nmeddle into the foreign policy leadership of the President.\n  Mr. President, I suggest that this extreme partisanship--and that is \nwhat it is--is something I have never seen in my time in the Senate, \nand it is time that we back off. It does not help the Senate. If \nsomebody wants to state a selfish reason, it won't help any one of us \neither. Most importantly, it doesn't help the country. I have always \nbelieved that all the men and women in here are true patriots who have, \nor should have, the interests of the country first and foremost above \ntheir own political well-being or the political well-being of any \nspecial interest group on the left or the right.\n  Maybe they want to back off. Maybe it might be good that some would \nacknowledge that they picked a poor time to bring this up, that it \nreally does jump the gun. I am willing to give the benefit of the doubt \nthat it might even have been a mistake to bring it up now. I realize \nthe possibility is very, very slim but I will even accept the \npossibility that it might not even have been brought up with the \nintention of embarrassing the President. I assume it was. But I will \naccept even the possibility.\n  I ask the same question that so many others have asked me: Why in \nHeaven's name? What have we come to that we try to send the President \nto a summit to represent everyone of us but knowing all the headlines \nwill be ``Senate Debating Resolution to Investigate the President of \nthe United States?'' We know that for some this is being done for \nshort-term political gain for upcoming fundraising or fundraising \nletters. But the people who read the headlines in the newspapers around \nthe world do not, and certainly those who will be at the summit do not.\n  So I think it is a mistake. We ought to get on to other things.\n\n\n                        antipersonnel landmines\n\n  In fact, I could suggest one thing that we could go to, something on \nwhich Democrats and Republicans could join is the question of \nantipersonnel landmines. Today there are over 100 million antipersonnel \nlandmines buried in the ground in around 70 countries. Some of them are \nas small as a can of shoe polish.\n  Every few minutes somebody is killed, maimed, or injured from these \nantipersonnel landmines. Invariably the person killed, maimed, or \ninjured is a civilian. The injuries tend to go almost in an inverse \nratio to the age of the person. Some are children who are killed, or \nhopelessly crippled for life. In one country, I was told by their \nleaders that they cleared their landmines ``an arm and a leg at a \ntime.''\n  This Senate has supported legislation on antipersonnel landmines that \nI have written, the Leahy ban on the export of landmines. That was \nsomething, in a rare show of unity, where Republicans and Democrats \nacross the political spectrum came together and the United States has \nbeen able to take the high road of banning the export of landmines as a \nresult. In this body, Republicans and Democrats across the political \nspectrum, including at that time the two leaders, Senator Dole and \nSenator Daschle, came together and supported legislation of mine to ban \nfor 1 year the use of these antipersonnel landmines by the United \nStates, the first time we have ever unilaterally banned such a weapon. \nOur hope was that when we demonstrated that it was possible for us to \ndo it for 1 year, we could certainly do it for every year thereafter \nand again give us a leadership position with the world.\n  I urge the administration now to consider making that a permanent ban \nand to consider joining with Canada and others who want to seek such a \nban throughout the world.\n  My legislative efforts have been very simple. It would ban production \nof antipersonnel landmines, ban the export of antipersonnel landmines, \nand ban the use of antipersonnel landmines. Country after country after \ncountry has now adopted similar steps. Country after country after \ncountry has notified me through their prime ministers, or through their \npresidents, or the head of their parliaments, and said, ``We have \nadopted this legislation.''\n  I must admit to a growing sense of satisfaction of seeing this done, \nbut at the same time a sense of apprehension that not enough are doing \nit, and it is not being done quickly enough because every year more--\nsometimes millions more--landmines are put into the ground, and every \nyear thousands and thousands more children and civilian men and women \nare injured. More and more years in vast parts of countries they can't \nraise their crops, they can't graze their animals, and their children \ncan't go to school because of the landmines, Mr. President.\n  I have visited critical sites all over the world where the Leahy War \nVictims Fund is used where we buy prosthetics, provide wheelchairs, and \ngive training and rehabilitation to people who have lost arms or legs \nfrom landmines.\n\n  My wife is a registered nurse, and she has gone with me when she was \nable to get away from her own duties at the hospital. She has gone with \nme to these various sites. She has helped people with the fitting of \nprosthetics. She has helped with the care of those in the hospitals.\n  I remember one time, especially, in the country of Uganda, after we \nhad visited this site. We had American volunteers and others at one of \nthe first sites at which the Leahy War Victims Fund was used. She came \nto me because there was a little boy horribly malformed and terribly \ncrippled. She and the other nurses there had helped to bathe and clothe \nthe child. She asked what was wrong with him. He was crippled by polio. \nShe had hardly ever seen in her years as a nurse a polio victim, unless \nit was somebody who had polio decades ago. She asked how could this be \nbecause, as the distinguished Presiding Officer who is a physician \nknows, polio is one of the easiest things protected against. For \neveryone of us who has children, they automatically get their polio \nvaccination. We don't think of it anymore. She said, ``Wasn't a polio \nvaccination available for this young boy?'' And there was. The country \nhad a polio vaccination program. But they could not get to his village \nwith it because of all the landmines around.\n  So this young boy was never injured by a landmine, but he is crippled \nfor life in a country where he is unable to work and grow his food, and \nin all probability will not live long because of the presence of \nlandmines. So if the landmine doesn't get you, the landmine still gets \nyou.\n  That is why, Mr. President, the only way you get rid of landmines is \nto get rid of them. Every single country has to ban them. And those of \nus who have the resources, the power and the technology should join \ntogether and start removing mines. This is true whether it is in \nBosnia, where the mines are the one major threat to American \npeacekeepers, or throughout Africa, Central America, every place that \nlandmines exist.\n  They serve no real military benefit--clearly not for our Nation, the \nmost powerful nation that history has ever known. They serve as a \nterrible, terrible weapon to the children who pick up the little piece \nof metal thinking that it is a toy and have their face torn off, or are \nleft with other terrible problems. They pose a terrible threat to a \nwoman who goes to the well to get water for her family and has her legs \nblown off. They pose a terrible problem to the man who is out trying to \nharvest\n\n[[Page S2350]]\n\nhis crops to feed his family, and he touches a landmine and his family \nno longer has a father.\n  That is why we should ban them.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as if in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to continue my observations \nabout major problems in the FBI's crime lab, and about the Bureau's \nfailed leadership. This is my fourth such statement.\n  My colleagues are no doubt curious about the harshness of my \ncriticisms of the Bureau's leadership. But my critique directly matches \nthe level of the Bureau's misleading of the public.\n  I have not been unfair or unmeasured in my comments. I dare say, I \nhave been softer on the FBI than others in Congress. Yet the ranks of \nthose of us who are perturbed are growing swiftly.\n  I have raised these issues for two reasons: First, to use the Justice \nDepartment's and FBI's own documents to show where the Bureau is \nmisleading the public; and second, to contribute an understanding of \nwhy it is happening.\n  I will briefly remind my colleagues of what I already revealed before \nthis body. Many of the allegations of the lab's whistleblower--Dr. \nFrederic Whitehurst--are being substantiated. FBI documents are showing \nthat. In previous statements, I have referenced three problem cases, \nexamined by the Justice Department's Inspector General, that were \nuncovered by the press. The three cases are those of Alcee L. Hastings, \nGeorge Trepal, and Walter Leroy Moody. The conduct of specific FBI \nagents in each of these cases is in question.\n  Second, the FBI tried to explain Dr. Whitehurst away by questioning \nhis credibility, and saying no one else backs up his allegations. But \nnow we know that is false. At least two other scientists have backed \nhim up. One has been made public. The other is fixing to.\n  Third, we now know that the FBI investigated these same allegations, \nknew about the problems, and covered them up. They did not fix them. \nThey covered them up. The IG, then, took an independent look and \nflushed out the problems. The Bureau is now doing a mad scramble to \ncontrol the damage. At the heart of its damage control operation is an \neffort to mislead. And that effort comes right from the top of the FBI. \nRight from the Director himself--Louis Freeh.\n  But their scheme is unraveling, Mr. President. I rise today, to \nassist in the unraveling process. The public has a right to know what \nthe FBI is covering up. And I am here to help them know.\n  The latest case of misleading by the FBI involves the public \ntestimony of Mr. Freeh approximately 2 weeks ago. On March 5, Mr. Freeh \ntestified before the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, \nJustice, State. The chairman is Representative Harold Rogers of \nKentucky.\n  During the hearing, Mr. Freeh was asked why the FBI placed Dr. \nWhitehurst on administrative leave. In response, Mr. Freeh stated:\n\n       [T]he action that was taken against Mr. Whitehurst was \n     taken solely and directly on the basis of the recommendation \n     by the Inspector General and their findings with respect to \n     Mr. Whitehurst....\n\n  Mr. Freeh also said the IG, Mr. Michael Bromwich, was notified about \nthe action and had not objected. Mr. Freeh concludes by saying:\n\n       The only reason that action was taken was because of what \n     the Inspector General wrote and recommended to the FBI.\n\n  When the IG found out what Director Freeh had stated, he fired off a \nletter the very next day. He demanded that Mr. Freeh correct the record \nin three specific areas.\n  First, the FBI has consistently maintained that it was not just the \nIG report that factored into action against Dr. Whitehurst. I know \nthis, Mr. President, because the Deputy Director, Weldon Kennedy, told \nme the same thing. The other reason involves the FBI's belief that Dr. \nWhitehurst would not answer questions in an administrative inquiry. It \nseems the FBI Director is using the IG report to hide behind. In my \nview, he wants the public to think he was forced by the IG to take \naction against a whistleblower.\n  Second, the IG says it is inaccurate for Mr. Freeh to say the IG did \nnot object to action against Dr. Whitehurst. In fact, the IG spent over \na year objecting to such treatment of Dr. Whitehurst. I had not known \nthis before, Mr. President. According to the IG, representatives of the \nFBI had an active campaign--for more than a year--to take action \nagainst the whistleblower. The IG spells this out in detail in his \nletter.\n  That sounds suspiciously like retaliation against a whistleblower. \nAnd as you know, Congress has passed statutes prohibiting retaliation \nagainst whitleblowers. But it would certainly explain why the FBI is \nover-reacting to the IG's report, with respect to Dr. Whitehurst. I \nsuspect that the IG would have had nothing but praise for Dr. \nWhitehurst, and the Bureau's response would still be, ``See? The IG \nrecommends that we fire Whitehurst!''\n  I met on January 28 with then-Deputy Director Kennedy. I asked him \nwhat it was in the IG report that he thought gave the FBI grounds to \ntake action against Dr. Whitehurst. I am bound to maintain the \nconfidence of what is contained in the report that Mr. Kennedy cited. \nBut let me assure you, Mr. President. When you see the report, you will \nbe scratching your head in bewilderment. I was.\n  Third, the IG says no such recommendation pertaining to Dr. \nWhitehurst is in his report.\n  These were the three specific points about which the IG took issue \nwith Mr. Freeh. If I could offer a translation, I will bet Mr. Bromwich \nthought Mr. Freeh misled the subcommittee. If Mr. Bromwich indeed \nreached that conclusion, the facts would be on his side.\n  The IG's request that Mr. Freeh correct the record was responded to \non March 11. In letters to both Mr. Bromwich and Mr. Rogers, Mr. Freeh \nappears to do what some of his agents have been accused of doing in a \ncourt room--cutting corners to get a conviction.\n  I ask unanimous consent that those three letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Office of the Inspector General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Louis J. Freeh,\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of \n         Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Freeh: I am writing to urge you to correct \n     testimony you gave during your appearance yesterday before \n     the House Subcommittee on Appropriations. I have reviewed the \n     videotape of your testimony and believe that your response to \n     a question regarding Dr. Whitehurst is incorrect in three \n     respects.\n       Your testimony was as follows:\n       Q. (By Chairman Rogers) Now why was Mr. Whitehurst \n     suspended?\n       A. What I can say in the open session, sir, is that the \n     action that was taken against Mr. Whitehurst was taken solely \n     and directly on the basis of the recommendation by the \n     Inspector General and their findings with respect to Mr. \n     Whitehurst, which they furnished us in writing. We notified \n     the Inspector General and the Deputy Attorney General's \n     office that we were going to take administrative action. They \n     did not object to it. The only reason that action was taken \n     was because of what the Inspector General wrote and \n     recommended to the FBI. And when that is public, I think you \n     will be satisfied.\n       First, we have consistently been informed that the FBI did \n     not take administrative action against Dr. Whitehurst \n     ``solely and directly on the basis of the recommendation by \n     the Inspector General and their findings with respect to Mr. \n     Whitehurst,'' as you testified. Rather, Deputy Counsel James \n     Maddock has informed us (and others) on several occasions \n     that the FBI's action was also taken because of Dr. \n     Whitehurst's refusal--after being administratively \n     compelled--to testify in 1996 in the matter regarding leaks \n     of information about the laboratory. Indeed, that dual \n     rationale was contained in the memo from Weldon Kennedy to \n     the Deputy Attorney General, a copy of which was sent to \n     me, on January 24, 1997, notifying her of the FBI's \n     intention to place Whitehurst on administrative leave that \n     afternoon.\n\n[[Page S2351]]\n\n       Second, it was inaccurate to say that I ``did not object'' \n     when the FBI notified my office that it intended to place Dr. \n     Whitehurst on administrative leave. In fact, at a meeting \n     held on January 21, I expressed my opposition when Mr. \n     Maddock informed us that the FBI intended to take such action \n     against Dr. Whitehurst. This was consistent with the position \n     that I had taken over the course of more than a year when FBI \n     representatives had repeatedly proposed firing Whitehurst or \n     placing him on some sort of administrative leave. Although it \n     is correct that I did not specifically respond to Mr. \n     Kennedy's January 24 memorandum informing the Deputy Attorney \n     General of the FBI's decision to place Dr. Whitehurst on \n     leave that same afternoon--or formally reiterate my objection \n     to taking any action against Dr. Whitehurst--it was because I \n     had already made my views known rather than because I agreed \n     with the FBI's proposed action.\n       Third, your testimony implies that we specifically \n     recommended that Dr. Whitehurst be placed on administrative \n     leave based on the draft report. The draft report in fact \n     contains no such recommendation, nor can it be fairly \n     construed to imply that such action should be taken while the \n     draft was being reviewed.\n       Because I believe the inaccuracies in your testimony should \n     be corrected as promptly as possible, I urge you to write to \n     Chairman Rogers and Congressman Mollohan to correct the \n     record. Should sharing this letter with the Appropriations \n     Subcommittee assist in correcting the record, please feel \n     free to include it with your correction.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                              Michael R. Bromwich,\n     Inspector General.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                        U.S. Department of Justice\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1997.\n     Mr. Michael R. Bromwich,\n     Inspector General, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Bromwich: In your letter of March 6, 1997, you \n     state that it is your understanding that the FBI did not \n     place Frederic Whitehurst on administrative leave solely on \n     the basis of the recommendations set forth in your draft \n     report. Your understanding is correct and I am writing to \n     clarify my prior statement in that regard.\n       In a memorandum to Deputy Director Kennedy dated January \n     23, 1997, I recused myself from any Whitehurst-related \n     disciplinary or administrative matters contained in the OIG \n     report regarding the FBI Laboratory. Instead, I designated \n     the Deputy Director to make or review all such decisions. It \n     is my understanding that Deputy Director Kennedy based the \n     decision to place Mr. Whitehurst on administrative leave on \n     the following two grounds: (1) the FBI's receipt of notice in \n     your draft findings that you intend to recommend that the FBI \n     consider whether Mr. Whitehurst can continue to usefully \n     serve the FBI in any capacity; and, (2) Mr. Whitehurst's \n     refusal to answer questions, in direct contravention of an \n     order to cooperate by an FBI Acting Assistant Director, with \n     regard to an investigation into allegations that Mr. \n     Whitehurst, without authorization, disclosed official \n     information to the media.\n       We maintain that either of these grounds, standing alone, \n     suffices to justify the temporary personnel action with \n     respect to Mr. Whitehurst. However, as you know, the \n     Department of Justice advised against taking any action \n     concerning Mr. Whitehurst's refusal to cooperate with the \n     leak investigation until you issued your draft report on the \n     Laboratory investigation. Therefore, upon review of your \n     draft findings with respect to Mr. Whitehurst, we notified \n     your office that the FBI would be placing Mr. Whitehurst on \n     administrative leave. As we advised Mr. Whitehurst in a \n     letter dated January 24, 1997, this action did not constitute \n     an adverse action, did not indicate inappropriate conduct on \n     his part, and did not involve any loss of  pay. However, \n     because your draft findings put the FBI on notice of \n     potentially serious problems with respect to Mr. \n     Whitehurst and other Laboratory employees, the FBI would \n     have been remiss had it failed to take temporary actions \n     with respect to these individuals.\n       We received your draft report on the FBI Laboratory on \n     January 21, 1997. On January 24, 1997, after reviewing your \n     findings and recommendations, the FBI temporarily reassigned \n     two Laboratory employees to positions outside the Laboratory, \n     temporarily reassigned one employee within the Laboratory, \n     and placed one employee, Mr. Whitehurst, on administrative \n     leave with pay. You indicate in your letter that, at a \n     meeting on January 21, 1997, you expressed opposition to the \n     decision to place Mr. Whitehurst on administrative leave. I \n     understand this topic was only briefly addressed and that the \n     discussion moved on to other topics, which may account for \n     why both Mr. Maddock and Mr. Collingwood do not recall your \n     comments on this issue. Furthermore, as you concede in your \n     letter, you did not respond to the Deputy Director's \n     memorandum dated January 24, 1997, in which he informed the \n     Deputy Attorney General that Mr. Whitehurst would be placed \n     on administrative leave that afternoon.\n       Finally, you are correct that the draft report does not \n     specifically recommend that Mr. Whitehurst be placed on \n     administrative leave. I did not intend to imply that to the \n     Subcommittee. However, it is significant that, after a 17-\n     month investigation of the Laboratory, Mr. Whitehurst is the \n     only FBI employee whose suitability for continued employment \n     you question. Your findings also make clear that the majority \n     of Mr. Whitehurst's allegations are unfounded and that he is \n     often unable to distinguish fact from conjecture. I believe \n     that the Subcommittee would have considered your draft \n     findings with regard to Mr. Whitehurst helpful in balancing \n     your testimony before them on February 26, 1997, that ``[w]e \n     have found substantial problems based on the allegations that \n     Dr. Whitehurst made to us.''\n       In order to clarify the entire record, I recommend that we \n     provide the Subcommittee Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     with your draft findings concerning Mr. Whitehurst in \n     executive session and request that the findings be treated \n     confidentially. I believe a fair reading of these findings \n     supports Deputy Director Kennedy's decision to place Mr. \n     Whitehurst on administrative leave with pay pending the \n     finalization of your report on the FBI Laboratory and our \n     review of that report to the extent it concerns Mr. \n     Whitehurst's employment.\n       I appreciate your having provided me with an opportunity to \n     address your concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Louis J. Freeh,\n     Director.\n                                                                    ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                              Federal Bureau of Investigation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 11, 1997.\n     Hon. Harold Rogers,\n     U.S. House of Representatives, Chairman, Subcommittee on \n         Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary of the Committee \n         on Appropriations, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Enclosed please find a letter to me from \n     Michael R. Bromwich, Inspector General, Department of \n     Justice, dated March 6, 1997, as well as my response to that \n     letter.\n       As indicated by Mr. Bromwich, my testimony before the \n     Subcommittee on March 5, 1997 was incomplete with regard to \n     the decision to place Frederic Whitehurst on administrative \n     leave. Although I recused myself from any Whitehurst-related \n     disciplinary or administrative matters, I understand from \n     former Deputy Director Kennedy that he based the decision to \n     place Mr. Whitehurst on administrative leave on two grounds: \n     (1) the FBI's receipt of notice in Mr. Bromwich's draft \n     findings that he intends to recommend that the FBI consider \n     whether Mr. Whitehurst can continue to usefully serve the FBI \n     in any capacity; and, (2) Mr. Whitehurst's refusal to answer \n     questions, in direct contravention of an order to cooperate \n     by an FBI Acting Assistant Director, with regard to an \n     investigation into allegations that Mr. Whitehurst, without \n     authorization, disclosed official information to the media. \n     In response to Subcommittee questioning, I failed to include \n     the second basis for Deputy Director Kennedy's decision. I \n     have submitted an amendment to the record in this regard.\n       In light of the Subcommittee's concerns regarding the \n     decision to place Mr. Whitehurst on administrative leave, I \n     believe that Mr. Bromwich's draft findings with respect to \n     Mr. Whitehurst should be provided to you in full. As you can \n     see from the enclosed correspondence, I have urged Mr. \n     Bromwich to share his draft findings with you in executive \n     session in order to clarify the record and explain one of the \n     underlying bases for the FBI's temporary action with regard \n     to Mr. Whitehurst. Mr. Bromwich objects to providing you with \n     these draft findings and has directed that I not quote from \n     them in testimony or correspondence with the Subcommittees.\n       I appreciate the opportunity to clarify my prior testimony \n     and look forward to providing you and the Subcommittee \n     members a thorough briefing following the release of Mr. \n     Bromwich's final report on the FBI Laboratory.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Louis J. Freeh,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, to begin with, Mr. Freeh, in his letter \nto the IG--just as Mr. Kennedy did with me--believes that he can \ninterpret the IG's report better than the IG can. He is saying to the \nIG, in effect, ``I don't care what you meant to say about Dr. \nWhitehurst. I care about what you said.'' He then plays a game of \nsemantics and interprets the IG report as he wishes, not as the IG \nintended.\n  Then, elsewhere in the letters, Mr. Freeh takes a few pot shots at \nDr. Whitehurst and at the IG. I understand why he would take pot shots \nat the IG. After all, the IG did an independent investigation of the \ncrime lab. He apparently, according to news accounts, found credibility \nin many of Dr. Whitehurst's allegations. And that contradicts the FBI's \nown findings, which were nothing more than a whitewash of the exact \nsame allegations. And the whitewash was done under this current \ndirector, Director Freeh. And Director Freeh personally signed off on \nthe review. So, yes, I understand what would motivate the FBI Director \nto go after the IG.\n  But it is less clear why Mr. Freeh, before a subcommittee of Congress \nand later under his own signature, would go after Dr. Whitehurst. Why \nwould the\n\n[[Page S2352]]\n\nFBI Director involve himself, by misleading the public and the \nsubcommittee, in an attack on Dr. Whitehurst? After all, Mr. Freeh \nrecused himself from matters dealing with Dr. Whitehurst. Last week, I \nreleased the document showing the recusal.\n  What kind of recusal is this? Is this part of a Kafka novel? Now, \neveryone in the entire Justice Department, including the FBI, knows how \nthe FBI Director feels about Dr. Whitehurst. When decision-time comes \nto fire or retain Dr. Whitehurst, everyone has the message, directly \nfrom the FBI Director, regarding what he thinks about Dr. Whitehurst.\n  Finally, Mr. President, since I am on the subject of misleading. On \nMarch 5, the same day Mr. Freeh misled the Nation and the subcommittee \non the IG report, he misled the public in another way. He announced in \na press release the enhancement of a more independent Office of \nProfessional Responsibility, or OPR. The new head of OPR would report \ndirectly to Mr. Freeh and his deputy.\n  But how can it be independent? It reports directly to Mr. Freeh and \nhis deputy. Am I again reading one of Kafka's novels? Think of how \nreassuring the new, independent OPR is for Dr. Whitehurst, given what \nthe Director said about him this past week.\n  The one truism that I have uncovered in all this, Mr. President, is \nthis: The FBI has shown, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that it cannot \npolice itself. This institution--the U.S. Congress--has bent over \nbackward over the years to give the FBI what it says it needs. We have \ndone it in good faith. We have done it without performing the necessary \noversight. We put too much trust in the FBI. The FBI has squandered our \ntrust.\n  In the coming weeks and months, I will attempt to show that, at the \nexpense of fighting crime effectively, the FBI has engaged in a \ncolossal campaign to build its empire. They have done it right under \nthe noses of our oversight committees, the Judiciary Committees--of \nwhich I have been a member since I came to the Senate.\n  What the FBI needs is a good dose of oversight. They need to be \nreined in. There needs to be more independent oversight of their \nmanagement. There needs to be more accountability of their budget, \nwhich has grown too large too quickly.\n  The FBI's leadership has come under fire because of its response to \nproblems that have surfaced. It has chosen to mislead rather than \nacknowledge. That tells me, the Bureau is more worried about its image \nthan its product.\n  Until the FBI acknowledges it cannot police itself, and works with \nCongress to establish more and better oversight, the FBI's leaders will \nkeep taking heavy criticism from Capitol Hill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of a letter from Dr. Whitehurst's attorneys to Director Freeh, \ndated today, taking the Director to task for his testimony and \ncorrespondence. I believe this letter will provide the necessary \ncontext for the public to judge whether Mr. Freeh's pot shots were \nfair.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                     Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, P.C.,\n\n\n                                             Attorneys at Law,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 1997.\n     Hon. Louis J. Freeh,\n     Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of \n         Justice, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Director Freeh: We have read with great interest your \n     letters dated March 11, 1997 sent to Mr. Michael R. Bromwich, \n     the Inspector General (``IG'') of the U.S. Department of \n     Justice (``DOJ'') and the Honorable Harold Rogers, Chairman, \n     U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Commerce, \n     Justice, State, and Judiciary of the Committee on \n     Appropriations, respectively. These two letters directly \n     concern our client, Dr. Frederic Whitehurst, Supervisory \n     Special Agent, Federal Bureau of Investigation (``FBI''), and \n     relate to testimony you provided to the Subcommittee on March \n     5, 1997.\n       As a threshold matter, we understood that you had recused \n     yourself from involvement with any administrative action \n     concerning Dr. Whitehurst's employment with the FBI or his \n     whistleblower allegations that have been investigated as part \n     of the DOJ IG ``Whitehurst Review.'' Nonetheless, by \n     publishing your opinions concerning Dr. Whitehurst to a wide \n     national audience, by providing testimony about his \n     employment status and by requesting an executive session with \n     a committee of the U.S. Congress to discuss matters related \n     to Dr. Whitehurst, you clearly have not recused yourself from \n     these matters. Furthermore, we were informed by a member of \n     the news media prior to your testimony that you intended to \n     answer questions concerning the actions the FBI took \n     regarding Dr. Whitehurst. Thus, your comments about Dr. \n     Whitehurst do not appear to have been spontaneous or \n     accidental.\n       By widely publishing your very negative opinions about Dr. \n     Whitehurst you have called into question the effectiveness of \n     any purported ``recusal'' in matters related to the FBI crime \n     lab or Dr. Whitehurst's employment.\n       In your letter to Mr. Bromwich you have deliberately \n     distorted and published selected ``draft'' findings of the \n     Inspector General in a manner clearly intended to discredit \n     Dr. Whitehurst. You have alleged that the IG has concluded \n     that ``the majority of Mr. Whitehurst's allegations are \n     unfounded and that he is often unable to distinguished \n     fact from conjecture.''\n       We highly doubt that the IG reached such conclusions or \n     whether such conclusions will be contained in any final \n     report issued by that office. Our review of more than 10,000 \n     pages of documents released by the FBI pursuant to a court \n     order and other publicly available materials related to the \n     IG report, demonstrate that the vast majority of Dr. \n     Whitehurst's major allegations have been fully substantiated. \n     These include, but are not limited to, the allegation about \n     misconduct in the Judge Hastings matter, major problems in \n     the handling of evidence in the Oklahoma City Bombing matter, \n     major problems in the FBI lab work and testimony in the World \n     Trade Center Bombing matter, confirmation that Dr. \n     Whitehurst's reports have been illegally altered and that \n     illegally altered lab documents have been used as evidence in \n     courts of law, confirmation that in a case you prosecuted the \n     FBI Crime Lab did not follow proper protocols or properly \n     evaluate the evidence, the withholding of exculpatory \n     evidence in the case of the bombing of an airliner, \n     confirmation that the contamination of the FBI Lab with the \n     explosive residue PETN was not properly addressed, \n     confirmation that your subordinates took adverse action \n     against Dr. Whitehurst based on his lawful testimony in the \n     World Trade Center case and his lawful actions of filing \n     allegations of misconduct with the Department of Justice and \n     confirmation that you were fully aware that the FBI crime lab \n     could not meet the minimum standards of accreditation one \n     year before the Oklahoma City Bombing tragedy occurred.\n       In regard to your statement that Dr. Whitehurst could not \n     ``distinguish fact from conjecture,'' the fact that many of \n     his most important allegations have been fully validated \n     belies this point.\\1\\\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\1\\ As I am sure you are aware, Mr. James Maddock, FBI Deputy \n     General Counsel, and the individual appointed to serve as the \n     FBI's ``point man'' concerning matters related to Dr. \n     Whitehurst, personally informed us on several occasions in \n     late 1996 that the FBI knew the IG had validated many of Dr. \n     Whitehurst's allegations and that the FBI either had or would \n     take corrective action. Mr. Maddock's statements are at odds \n     with your characterization of the IG's findings.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       We are very distressed at your apparent ignorance of the \n     controlling FBI regulations and Executive Orders which govern \n     Dr. Whitehurst's whistleblowing activities. As you should be \n     well aware, in order to encourage employee whistleblowing, \n     these regulations actually provide for and require the \n     reporting of ``conjecture.''\n       We had assumed you were fully aware of Executive Order \n     12731 signed by President George Bush on October 17, 1990. \n     This Executive Order, along with the published \n     ``supplementary Information'' interpreting this Order, were \n     directly provided to every employee of the U.S. Department of \n     Justice, including Dr. Frederic Whitehurst. In being provided \n     a copy of this packet of information Dr. Whitehurst was \n     informed that ``These standards apply to all Department of \n     Justice employees. Please read and retain them for future \n     reference.'' Exhibit 1, U.S. Department of Justice, ``This \n     Package Contains Important Ethics Materials, The Executive \n     Order On Conduct and the Standards of Conduct'' (undated), \n     attached hereto. As a loyal and dedicated public servant and \n     federal law enforcement officer, Dr. Whitehurst read this \n     packet of information. The Executive Order contained in the \n     packet states as follows: ``Employees shall disclose waste, \n     fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities.'' \n     Ex. 1, quoting from Executive Order 12731, Part I Section \n     101(k) (emphasis added).\n       As you can see, under this Executive Order, Dr. Whitehurst \n     was under a mandatory duty to report certain allegations to \n     the ``appropriate authorities.'' Pursuant to this obligation \n     he in fact informed you and others within the FBI of very \n     serious problems in the FBI crime lab. After the FBI failed \n     to take action on these allegations Dr. Whitehurst fully \n     informed the Inspector General of these allegations.\n       In regard to your purported concern over ``conjecture,'' \n     the DOJ packet also contained the explanatory notes \n     concerning Executive Order 12731, Part I Section 101(k) which \n     were written by the Office of Government Ethics (``OGE'') and \n     included as part of the final rule making governing the \n     Executive Order. These comments make explicit what is \n     implicit in the Executive Order, i.e., that federal employees \n     had a duty to ``overreport'' indications of misconduct and \n     that the appropriate authorities would determine whether \n     allegations were ``spurious.'' The OGE explained this \n     reasoning as follows:\n\n[[Page S2353]]\n\n       ``Five agencies suggested changes to Sec. 2635.101(b)(11) \n     [the OGE Code of Federal Regulations provision which \n     incorporated the requirements of Executive Order 12731, Part \n     I Section 101(k)], the principle requiring disclosure of \n     fraud, waste, abuse and corruption. The recommendation by two \n     agencies to change ``shall'' to ``should'' was not adopted. \n     Section 2635.101(b)(11) is a verbatim restatement of the \n     principle enunciated in the Executive order and the \n     recommended substitution of precatory for mandatory \n     language would change the principle. The Office of \n     Government Ethics does not share those agencies' concern \n     that the principle will elicit frivolous reporting. The \n     Government's interest in curbing waste, fraud, abuse and \n     corruption is better served by overreporting than by \n     underreporting, and the authorities to whom such \n     disclosure are to be made can best determine the merits of \n     allegations and ensure that harm does not result from any \n     that are spurious.''\n       Exhibit 1, quoting from Federal Register p. 35007 (emphasis \n     added).\n       In addition, the OGE warned that agencies could not require \n     employees to apply ``complex legal principles'' when \n     determining whether to report potential ``improprieties.'' \n     Id. Thus Dr. Whitehurst, who read these regulations prior to \n     filing any allegations with the Office of Inspector General, \n     or the FBI for that matter, acted pursuant to mandatory \n     authority when he reported potential violations of complex \n     legal matters such as improper withholding of Brady \n     information by the FBI and DOJ, potential perjury, the use of \n     improper scientific procedures and the lack of scientific \n     integrity at the FBI lab.\n       Thus, it is incumbent upon the Director of the FBI to \n     insure that all FBI employees report any allegations of \n     misconduct, and to err on the side of ``overreporting'' these \n     kinds of concerns. We are very troubled that your office has \n     not enforced the requirement that employees are under a \n     mandatory duty to disclose indications of misconduct. Instead \n     of strictly enforcing the law, you have publicly attacked Dr. \n     Whitehurst for doing exactly what he was require to do under \n     federal law.\n       Not only was Dr. Whitehurst required to report his concerns \n     pursuant to Executive Order, the OGE regulations and the \n     Department of Justice employee handout, the FBI's own \n     internal procedures regarding employee conduct required that \n     Dr. Whitehurst report ``any indication'' of ``possible'' \n     misconduct, whether proven or not, to the appropriate \n     authorities. Section 1-22(c) of the FBI Manual of \n     Administrative Operations and Procedures (MAOP) states as \n     follows:\n       ``Each employee has the responsibility to report promptly, \n     any indication of possible exploitation or misuse of Bureau \n     resources; information as to violations of law, rules or \n     regulations; personal misconduct. . . .''\n       Exhibit 2, FBI MAOP Section 1-22 (emphasis added), attached \n     hereto.\n       Once again, it is clear that Dr. Whitehurst had to report \n     unproven and ``possible'' ``indications'' of misconduct to \n     the appropriate authorities. It is fundamentally wrong for \n     you to challenge his right to ``overreport,'' and ridicule \n     his allegations as ``conjecture'' in the face of these legal \n     mandates and in the face of the severe crisis that has gone \n     unaddressed within the crime lab. To make matters even worse, \n     you were fully aware of many of these problems in 1994, yet \n     you failed to approve an independent review of these matters \n     and failed to correct these problems.\n       In your March 11th letter to Mr. Bromwich you also state \n     that Dr. Whitehurst could have been placed on leave as a \n     result of his ``refusal to answer questions, in direct \n     ocntravention of an order to cooperate by an FBI Acting \n     Director, with regard to an investigation into allegations \n     that Mr. Whitehurst, without authorization, disclosed \n     official information to the media.'' Once again, your \n     characterization of events is neither complete nor accurate. \n     Dr. Whitehurst was asked to answer questions concerning an \n     investigation conducted by the Inspector General about an \n     alleged leak of information to a journalist. Dr. Whitehurst \n     was originally informed that his cooperation with this \n     investigation was completely voluntary. Specifically, the \n     Special Investigative Counsel assigned by the IG to conduct \n     the investigation stated that the interview would be \n     ``voluntary'' and that Dr. Whitehurst could ``terminate'' the \n     interview ``at any time.'' Exhibit 3, Hutchison to Kohn, \n     February 13, 1996, attached hereto. The fact that this \n     interview was originally scheduled as a ``voluntary'' \n     interview is consistent with the manner in which the IG \n     conducted its interviews during the course of the IG's \n     ``Whitehurst Review.'' Documents reviewed by Dr. Whitehurst's \n     counsel demonstrate that FBI employees were informed by the \n     IG of their right to refuse to answer questions and the fact \n     that such refusal would not result in any adverse actions.\n       Unfortunately, the FBI issued an instruction that Dr. \n     Whitehurst could not fully communicate with his private \n     attorneys concerning the proposed interview. This instruction \n     was clearly retaliatory, unconstitutional and illegal. The \n     DOJ was informed that as long as this instruction stood, we \n     would instruct our client not to answer any questions and \n     that the government's restriction on Dr. Whitehurst's \n     communications with his private counsel would be challenged \n     in federal court. Exhibit 4, Cochran and Kohn to Reno (March \n     27, 1996) attached hereto.\n       On March 19, 1996, after the FBI was informed of our \n     objections to the improper restrictions on Dr. Whitehurst's \n     communications with counsel, and after Dr. Whitehurst had \n     been informed that the interview would be ``voluntary,'' the \n     FBI Acting Assistant Director ordered Dr. Whitehurst to \n     ``appear'' and answer questions on a mandatory basis. \n     Exhibit 5, Thompson to Whitehurst (March 19, 1996), \n     attached hereto. This order was issued almost three weeks \n     after the FBI was informed of our objections and position \n     regarding the government's interference with Dr. \n     Whitehurst's communications with counsel.\\2\\ See, Ex. 4.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n     \\2\\ Notably, a subsequent attempt by the FBI to force Dr. \n     Whitehurst to answer hostile questioning by arbitrarily \n     switching a voluntary interview to a mandatory one was \n     enjoined by court order. In September, 1996 the FBI once \n     again ordered Dr. Whitehurst to submit to a mandatory \n     interview and provide information to a prosecutor. The \n     retaliatory nature of that instruction was so obvious that a \n     U.S. District Court Judge issued a temporary restraining \n     order and a permanent injunction prohibiting the mandatory \n     interview. Ex. 6, U.S. v. McVeigh, Orders of Judge Matsch \n     (Sept. 12, 1996 and Oct. 29, 1996).\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n       Unfortunately, your letters of March 11th are not the first \n     time you have treated Dr. Whitehurst in a disrespectful \n     fashion. In 1994, after Dr. Whitehurst contacted your Office \n     of General Counsel and, in good faith, attempted to \n     communicate his concerns about the crime lab, the Office of \n     General Counsel, with your specific concurrence, ridiculed \n     him as a ``perfectionist'' who ``refuses to compromise or be \n     realistic about his expectations of the LD [Laboratory \n     Division]''. Memorandum of May 26, 1994, initialed by FBI \n     General Counsel H.M. Shapiro. These types of derogatory \n     characterizations are inconsistent with the regulations \n     governing FBI employee-whistleblowing. It is highly \n     unprofessional for the FBI to personally deride an individual \n     who had the courage to come forward and point out problems \n     within the crime lab. Frankly, we are shocked at the complete \n     disrespect toward Dr. Whitehurst you have repeatedly shown or \n     approved. Given the FBI's record in its dealings with Dr. \n     Whitehurst we are not surprised that you objected to the IG's \n     February 26, 1997 testimony confirming that the IG had \n     ``found substantial problems [at the FBI crime lab] based on \n     the allegations that Dr. Whitehurst made to us.'' Freeh to \n     Bromwich, p. 2 (March 11, 1997). The FBI's pattern of \n     attacking Dr. Whitehurst and ignoring the real problems which \n     exist in the crime lab are not consistent with the goals of \n     law enforcement.\n       In your letter to Mr. Bromwich you suggest that Congress \n     should be briefed in ``executive session'' about undisclosed \n     issues related to Dr. Whitehurst. The inference you clearly \n     intended to leave with any person who read this letter \n     borders on blatant ``McCarthyism''. You suggest that Dr. \n     Whitehurst engaged in misconduct which needed to be ``treated \n     confidentially.'' The facts indicate that the FBI's \n     treatment of Dr. Whitehurst and its indifference in \n     responding to his serious allegations will be recorded as \n     one of the saddest chapters in law enforcement history.\n       In the future, if you intend to provide any member of \n     Congress with a ``confidential'' briefing regarding Dr. \n     Whitehurst, we hereby request that we be notified in advance \n     of this briefing and that you request permission for Dr. \n     Whitehurst's counsel to attend any such briefing and respond \n     to the information you place before Congress.\n       Finally, your letters of March 11th referenced above were \n     filed in violation of the Privacy Act and other applicable \n     federal laws. We hereby request that you take immediate steps \n     to correct the inaccurate information contained in your \n     letters. Pursuant to the Privacy Act we also hereby request \n     that a copy of this letter be sent to all persons to whom you \n     provided a copy of your March 11th letters. In addition, \n     pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 552, the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552a and the \n     February 5, 1997 Order issued by the Honorable Gladys Kessler \n     in Whitehurst v. FBI, et al., C.A. No. 96-572(GK) (D.D.C.) we \n     hereby request immediate access to all documents directly or \n     indirectly related to: (a) the subject matter of this letter; \n     (b) all interactions with the U.S. Congress related to Dr. \n     Whitehurst; (c) all notes concerning any conversations \n     between the FBI and the DOJ IG; (d) all documents related to \n     and a complete accounting of all disclosures of information \n     made about Dr. Whitehurst from any FBI employee to any person \n     outside of the FBI (including, but not limited to, the \n     Director of the FBI, the FBI Deputy Director, Mr. Jim \n     Maddock, Mr. Weldon Kennedy, the office of public affairs, of \n     office of congressional affairs, the Acting Assistant \n     Director, Laboratory Division and Mr. D.W.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senate Joint \nResolution 22, asking that an independent counsel be appointed to \ninvestigate the alleged illegal fundraising activities in the 1996 \nPresidential campaign.\n  It is in the best interest of both the Nation and the Congress that \nan independent counsel be appointed. In light of the continued severity \nof the allegations that arise on a nearly daily basis, this is the only \nway to properly investigate wrongdoing and prosecute where laws were \nbroken. The requests for an independent counsel have been bipartisan. I \nhave twice written Attorney General Janet Reno and asked that an \nindependent counsel be appointed. To date, I have not received a reply.\n  We need an independent counsel to supplement congressional hearings. \nOnly an independent counsel has the power to bring charges against \nthose alleged of breaking the law. Congress will investigate, as we \nshould--that is our responsibility--but we need someone looking into \nthis with the ability to prosecute.\n  I also fear whether Congress will be able to bear the entire \nresponsibility for investigating these alleged campaign finance abuses \nand still act on the important issues awaiting our attention. We were \nelected by the people to address the challenges facing America. We were \nelected to solve problems.\n  As we look forward to the 21st century, America is faced with serious \nchallenges. Domestically, we must come to terms with our Federal \nbudgetary problems, our national debt, the burden of taxes and \nregulations, the threat of crime, the explosive growth projected in \nentitlement programs. Internationally, we need to reshape a foreign \npolicy, a foreign policy that will guide us through the uncharted and \npotentially treacherous waters of the post-cold-war era. This is a time \nof great hope, a time of great promise for the world. The fulfillment \nof this hope and promise will come only if America demonstrates bold, \nimaginative leadership, leadership that seizes the moment.\n  Determining the direction our Nation will take beyond the year 2000 \nis a very critical debate, one that all the Nation should be involved \nwith. The issues involved require and deserve the full attention of \nthis body. We must not be held hostage by partisan bickering over \ncampaign finance investigations and daily allegations of political \nwrongdoing.\n\n  For example, Medicare's slide into bankruptcy will not wait for a \ndetermination of whether campaign finance laws were broken in last \nyear's Presidential campaign. Action needs to be taken now to save \nMedicare, or America's seniors will pay the price.\n  If we allow the poison of political retribution and revenge to \ndominate the Congress, we will never be able to work together on these \nvery important issues. The congressional hearings are important. Surely \nthey are important. Surely they must go forward. But we need to get to \nthe bottom of this mess. At the same time, we cannot allow these \nhearings to overshadow the present challenges facing this body.\n  Political leaders frequently express their dismay at the lack of \nconfidence and trust the American people have in them and in all \npolitical institutions. However, we bring it on ourselves when the \nimage we present to the American people is one of constant partisan \nwrangling and bitter accusations.\n  When we allow our system to become polarized and paralyzed, the \nAmerican people have to wonder who is on the job, who is looking out \nfor their interests, who is governing America.\n  The American people are tired of the lack of civility and the \ninflammatory rhetoric that too frequently dominate the political \ndiscourse in Washington. They are tired of the gridlock that results \nwhen both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue put political considerations \nbefore the Nation's business. The American people want action. They \nwant their elected representatives to give their full attention to the \nchallenges facing this country. They deserve nothing less.\n  The destiny and legacy of our people is that we have always risen to \nmeet the challenges put before us. As we lead America and the world \ninto the 21st century, we must build on this legacy. Big challenges lie \nahead. We fail our children and the children of the world if we allow \nourselves to become bogged down in political intrigue and fail to \naddress these important issues now.\n  Criminal investigations should be taken out of politics. Prosecuting \nwrongdoing should be done without regard to politics. The Attorney \nGeneral needs to appoint an independent counsel now.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

This report is \nsubmitted pursuant to section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c) (IEEPA), section 401(c) of the \nNational Emergencies Act, 50 U.S.C. 1641(c), and section 505(c) of the \nInternational Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985, 22 \nU.S.C. 2349aa-9(c). This report discusses only matters concerning the \nnational emergency with respect to Iran that was declared in Executive \nOrder 12957 and does not deal with those relating to the emergency \ndeclared on November 14, 1979, in connection with the hostage crisis.\n  1. On March 15, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12957 (60 Fed. Reg. \n14615, March 17, 1995) to declare a national emergency with respect to \nIran pursuant to IEEPA, and to prohibit the financing, management, or \nsupervision by United States persons of the development of Iranian \npetroleum resources. This action was in response to actions and \npolicies of the Government of Iran, including support for international \nterrorism, efforts to undermine the Middle East peace process, and the \nacquisition of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. A copy of the order was provided to the Speaker of the House and \nthe President of the Senate by letter dated March 15, 1995.\n  Following the imposition of these restrictions with regard to the \ndevelopment of Iranian petroleum resources, Iran continued to engage in \nactivities that represent a threat to the peace and security of all \nnations, including Iran's continuing support for international \nterrorism, its support for acts that undermine the Middle East peace \nprocess, and its intensified efforts to acquire weapons of mass \ndestruction. On May 6, 1995, I issued Executive Order 12959 to further \nrespond to the\n\n[[Page S2355]]\n\nIranian threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of \nthe United States.\n  Executive Order 12959 (60 Fed. Reg. 24757, May 9, 1995) (1) prohibits \nexportation from the United States to Iran or to the Government of Iran \nof goods, technology, or services; (2) prohibits the reexportation of \ncertain U.S. goods and technology to Iran from third countries; (3) \nprohibits dealings by United States persons in goods and services of \nIranian origin or owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; (4) \nprohibits new investments by United States persons in Iran or in \nproperty owned or controlled by the Government of Iran; (5) prohibits \nU.S. companies and other United States persons from approving, \nfacilitating, or financing performance by a foreign subsidiary or other \nentity owned or controlled by a United States person of certain \nreexport, investment, and trade transactions that a United States \nperson is prohibited from performing; (6) continues the 1987 \nprohibition on the importation into the United States of goods and \nservices of Iranian origin; (7) prohibits any transaction by a United \nStates person or within the United States that evades or avoids or \nattempts to violate any prohibition of the order; and (8) allowed U.S. \ncompanies a 30-day period in which to perform trade transaction \npursuant to contracts predating the Executive order.\n  At the time of signing Executive Order 12959, I directed the \nSecretary of the Treasury to authorize through specific licensing \ncertain transactions, including transactions by United States persons \nrelated to the Iran-United States Claims Tribunal in The Hague, \nestablished pursuant to the Algiers Accords, and related to other \ninternational obligations and United States Government functions, and \ntransactions related to the export of agricultural commodities pursuant \nto preexisting contracts consistent with section 5712(c) of title 7, \nUnited States Code. I also directed the Secretary of the Treasury, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to consider authorizing \nUnited States persons through specific licensing to participate in \nmarket-based swaps of crude oil from the Caspian Sea area for Iranian \ncrude oil in support of energy projects in Azerbaijan, Kazakstan, and \nTurkmenistan.\n\n  Executive Order 12959 revoked sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12613 of October 29, 1987, and sections 1 and 2 of Executive Order \n12957 of march 15, 1995, to the extent they are inconsistent with it. A \ncopy of Executive Order 12959 was transmitted to the Speaker of the \nHouse of Representatives and the President of the Senate by letter \ndated May 6, 1995.\n  2. On March 5, 1997, I renewed for another year the national \nemergency with respect to Iran pursuant to IEEPA. This renewal extended \nthe authority for the current comprehensive trade embargo against Iran \nin effect since May 1995. Under these sanctions, virtually all trade \nwith Iran is prohibited except for information and informational \nmaterials and certain other limited exceptions.\n  3. The Iranian Transactions Regulations (the ``Regulations'' or ITR), \n31 CFR Part 560, were amended on October 21, 1996 (61 Fed. Reg. 54936, \nOctober 23, 1996), to implement section 4 of the Federal Civil \nPenalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended by the Debt \nCollection Improvement Act of 1996, by adjusting for inflation the \namount of the civil monetary penalties that may be assessed under the \nRegulations. The amendment increases the maximum civil monetary penalty \nprovided in the Regulations from $10,000 to $11,000 per violation.\n  The amended Regulations also reflect an amendment to 18 U.S.C. 1001 \ncontained in section 330016(1)(L) of Public Law 103-322, September 13, \n1994; 108 Stat. 2147. The amendment notes the availability of higher \ncriminal fines pursuant to the formulas set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3571. A \ncopy of the amendment is attached.\n  Section 560.603 of the ITR was amended on November 15, 1996 (61 Fed. \nReg. 58480), to clarify rules relating to reporting requirements \nimposed on United States persons with foreign affiliations. Initial \nreporting under the amended Regulation has been deferred until May 30, \n1997, by a January 14, 1997 Federal Register notice (62 Fed. Reg. \n1832). Copies of the amendment and the notice are attached.\n  4. During the current 6-month period, the Department of the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) made numerous \ndecisions with respect to applications for licenses to engage in \ntransactions under the ITR, and issued 13 licenses. The majority of \ndenials were in response to requests to authorize commercial exports to \nIran--particularly of machinery and equipment for the petroleum and \nmanufacturing industries--and the importation of Iranian-origin goods. \nThe licenses issued authorized the export and reexport of goods, \nservices, and technology essential to ensure the safety of civil \naviation and safe operation of certain commercial passenger aircraft in \nIran; certain financial and legal transactions; the importation of \nIranian-origin artwork for public exhibition; and certain diplomatic \ntransactions. Pursuant to sections 3 and 4 of Executive Order 12959 and \nin order to comply with the Iran-Iraq Arms Non-Proliferation Act of \n1992 and other statutory restrictions applicable to certain goods and \ntechnology, including those involved in the air-safety cases, the \nDepartment of the Treasury continues to consult with the Departments of \nState and Commerce on these matters.\n  The U.S. financial community continues to interdict transactions \nassociated with Iran and to consult with OFAC about their appropriate \nhandling. Many of these inquiries have resulted in investigations into \nthe activities of U.S. parties and, where appropriate, the initiation \nof enforcement action.\n  5. The U.S. Customs Service has continued to effect numerous seizures \nof Iranian-origin merchandise, primarily carpets, for violation of the \nimport prohibitions of the ITR. Various enforcement actions carried \nover from previous reporting periods are continuing and new reports of \nviolations are being aggressively pursued. Since my last report, OFAC \nhas collected a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $5,000. The \nviolation underlying this collection involves the unlicensed import of \nIranian-origin goods for transshipment to a third country aboard a \nU.S.-flag vessel. Civil penalty action or review is pending against 21 \ncompanies, financial institutions, and individuals for possible \nviolations of the Regulations.\n\n  6. The expenses incurred by the Federal Government in the 6-month \nperiod from September 15, 1996, through March 14, 1997, that are \ndirectly attributable to the exercise of powers and authorities \nconferred by the declaration of a national emergency with respect to \nIran are approximately $800,000, most of which represent wage and \nsalary costs for Federal personnel. Personnel costs were largely \ncentered in the Department of the Treasury (particularly in the Office \nof Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Customs Service, the Office of the \nUnder Secretary for Enforcement, and the Office of the General \nCounsel), the Department of State (particularly the Bureau of Economic \nand Business Affairs, the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, the Bureau of \nIntelligence and Research, and the Office of the Legal Adviser), and \nthe Department of Commerce (the Bureau of Export Administration and the \nGeneral Counsel's Office).\n  7. The situation reviewed above continues to involve important \ndiplomatic, financial, and legal interests of the United States and its \nnationals and presents an extraordinary and unusual threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. \nThe declaration of the national emergency with respect to Iran \ncontained in Executive Order 12957 and the comprehensive economic \nsanctions imposed by Executive Order 12959 underscore the United States \nGovernment opposition to the actions and policies of the Government of \nIran, particularly its support of international terrorism and its \nefforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver \nthem. The Iranian Transactions Regulations issued pursuant to Executive \nOrders 12957 and 12959 continue to advance important objectives in \npromoting the nonproliferation and antiterrorism policies of the United \nStates. I shall exercise the powers at my disposal to deal with these \nproblems and will report periodically to the Congress on significant \ndevelopments.\n                                                  William J.

A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to authorize \nlocal governments and Governors to restrict receipt of out-of-State \nmunicipal solid waste, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works\n\n\n           the LOCAL GOVERNMENT INTERSTATE WASTE CONTROL ACT\n\n Mr. ROBB. Mr. President, today, I introduce legislation which \nwill protect communities from being inundated with unwanted garbage \ngenerated out-of-State. The essential thrust of the legislation is to \nempower localities to\n\n[[Page S2357]]\n\nprotect themselves from unwanted trash by allowing them to decide \nwhether landfills or incinerators located within their communities \nshould be permitted to accept out-of-State waste. It also seeks to \nstrike the appropriate balance between State and local authority.\n  Those of us who formerly served in State government are keenly aware \nof the divisions of labor among the various levels of government. Due \nto Supreme Court decisions regarding the U.S. Constitution's commerce \nclause, disposing of trash implicates all three levels of government.\n  Under the commerce clause, only Congress is permitted to regulate \ninterstate commerce. Because the Supreme Court has determined that \ngarbage is commerce like any other commodity, States and localities \nhave been powerless to halt the disposal of waste disposed in their \njurisdictions which was generated outside the State. Thus the Federal \nGovernment must determine how best to regulate this article of \ncommerce.\n  The role of the States in regulating the disposal of garbage centers \non its responsibility to protect the State's environment. Based on \nenvironmental criteria, the States determine whether to issue permits \nfor the construction of landfills, and are charged with monitoring the \noperation of landfills and incinerators to guarantee compliance with \nenvironmental laws. My bill will not affect in any way the State's \nright to enforce the States environmental standards.\n  The real responsibility for disposing of trash, however, has rested \nhistorically with local governments. It is their responsibility to pick \nup the trash and to find a place to put it down. Because this is the \nlocality's ultimate responsibility, and because the local community is \nthe one most directly affected by garbage imports, my bill delegates \nprimary authority regarding interstate waste to the local governments.\n  The legislation defines an affected local government as the political \nsubdivision of the State charged with making land use decisions. In my \nview, if an elected body is competent to make decisions regarding the \nuse of land in the community, then it is certainly competent to \ndetermine whether a landfill, already permitted under State law, should \nbe allowed to accept out-of-State waste.\n  Striking the right balance between State and local authority was only \nhalf the battle. The other major issue implicated by placing \nrestrictions on out-of-State waste is how to treat existing facilities. \nIn many cases, existing facilities which accept out-of-State waste do \nso in the face of local opposition. These communities understandably \nwant us to stop the garbage from flowing. It would not be fair, \nhowever, to those who expended millions of dollars to build new \nlandfills in compliance with strict federal regulations to cut off \ntheir commerce completely. Therefore, my measure balances these \ninterests by allowing the Governor of each State to limit the amount of \nout-of-State waste which can be disposed of in an existing facility.\n  To finance new waste disposal facilities that meet stringent State \nand Federal environmental regulations, some local governments are \ncooperating with private developers to build these state-of-the-art \nfacilities. This cooperative relationship, however, can only florish if \nthe locality has some leverage over the developer. Under present law, a \nlocal government is powerless to deny a zoning permit to a landfill \ndeveloper simply because waste from out-of-State will be disposed in \nthe landfill. If the local government is given the power to reject out-\nof-State waste, it also will have the power to accept the waste, with \nconditions. By allowing communities to have leverage at the bargaining \ntable, they can enter into host community agreements which are \nbeneficial to the locality and its neighbors.\n  In many instances, this can be a winning proposition for the local \ncommunity. The new landfill can be built at no cost to the community, \nand the community can charge a host community fee which can be used to \nreduce taxes or pay for other projects, such as building schools.\n  While inviting a landfill developer into a community may not be the \nsolution for every local government, it should remain an option for \nthose who choose to pursue it. And under my legislation, the local \ngovernment would not have to make such a decision alone. The \nlegislation requires the local government to consult with the Governor \nand adjoining local governments before a decision is made.\n  More importantly, however, my legislation absolutely bans out-of-\nState waste from new facilities unless a community affirmatively agrees \nto the imports. This is important to many communities in my State, \nmostly rural, that can fall prey under existing law to unscrupulous \nlandfill developers who, in their search for land, can run roughshod \nover the wishes of the locality. I hope my colleagues will join with me \nin supporting this legislation and protecting our communities from \nunwanted out-of-State trash.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KYL (for himself, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. \n        Hutchinson):\n  S. 449. A bill to prohibit the restriction of certain types of \nmedical communications between a health care provider and a patient; to \nthe Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n                     the patient right to know act\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator Ron \nWyden, to introduce the Patient Right to Know Act. I also want to \ncommend my House colleagues, Representatives Greg Ganske and Ed Markey, \nfor their leadership on this issue.\n\n\n                           procedural history\n\n  The Kyl-Wyden Patient Right to Know Act, originally offered as an \namendment on September 10, 1996 to the fiscal year 1997 Treasury, \nPostal appropriations bill, received 51 bipartisan votes; but 60 votes \nwere required to overcome a procedural obstacle on the Senate floor.\n\n\n                              the problem\n\n  Mr. President, the purpose of this legislation is to return to \npatients their basic right to receive all relevant information from \ntheir doctor, or provider, about costs, benefits, risks, and legal, and \nappropriate treatment options that are important to their health. This \nbill would allow doctors and other providers to comply with their \nethical and legal responsibility to fully inform patients of all their \nreasonable and legal options, regardless of cost or coverage \nlimitations in a particular plan.\n  Some managed care plans forbid doctors and other providers from even \nmentioning all legal and reasonable treatment options to patients, \neither because the managed care plan's benefits will not pay for a \nparticular treatment, or because of the relative cost of different \ntreatments for the same condition offered by the plan.\n  In recent years, there have been media accounts of a few of the \ncountless individuals who have been denied care by physicians and plans \nin an effort to control costs. In April 1994, ABC's ``20-20'' reported \non the case of a woman who was denied information about a bone-marrow \ntransplant to treat her breast cancer. In October 1995, CBS presented a \nstory about a woman who was denied information about and access to \nspecialists, and who was later diagnosed with cancer.\n  The national press has revealed the extent of this problem in \npublications such as the New England Journal of Medicine and the New \nYork Times. For instance, the Times ran an article in September 22, \n1996, entitled, the ``Tricky Business of Keeping Doctors Quiet.''\n  Americans have clearly noticed the deficiencies in some managed care \nplans. In a 1996 poll by the Patient Access to Speciality Care \nCoalition, 92.7 percent responded that it was very important that they \nbe told of all treatment options, and 53 percent believe that they do \nnot now receive enough information about how HMO's or managed care \nplans make treatment decisions.\n\n\n                         attempts at a solution\n\n  Sixteen State legislatures have addressed the existence of gag rules, \nand several more are in the process of doing so.\n  The industry itself has acknowledged this problem, possibly realizing \nthat gag rules make good managed care companies look bad. On December \n18, 1996, the American Association of Health Plans, which represents \nover 1,000 providers and 140 million Americans, announced voluntary \nguidelines\n\n[[Page S2358]]\n\nthat would end the use of gag clauses by member plans.\n  Limited antigag regulations have been promulgated by the Health Care \nFinancing Administration that apply to Medicare and Medicaid managed \ncare insurance contracts.\n  However, this still leaves us without a systematic approach to the \nproblem. I believe we need a single, clear Federal standard, enforced \nby the States, that provides consistent protection of medical \ncommunications, for all health plan beneficiaries, no matter which \nState they live in, or which health plan they buy. This is the only \ncertain way to stop individuals or entities whose goal is to reduce \ncosts--at the expense of health care quality--by restricting medical \ncommunications between providers and patients.\n\n\n                     the congress may and must act\n\n  It is clear that the Congress may act in this area since the offering \nand operation of health plans affects commerce among the States.\n  It is also clear that the Congress must act. With the emphasis that \nhealth care reform places on managed care, it is essential that the \nCongress ensure that managed care techniques and procedures protect \npatients and guarantee the integrity of the provider-patient \nrelationship.\n  Mr. President, gag clauses in health care provider contracts attack \nthe heart of the provider-patient relationship, and undermine the \nfundamental factor in the healing process: trust. The Congress has a \nsubstantial interest in preserving this relationship in the managed \ncare environment it helped to create.\n  This legislation is measured in its approach. It provides for State \nenforcement of a clear, reasonable Federal standard. And, before a \nfloor vote, the legislation will include a conscience clause exception \nfor providers and entities. After months of good-faith, bipartisan \ndiscussion, the precise legislative language to establish a conscience \nclause exception to the gag rule has not yet been crafted.\n  However, all parties agree in principle that the rights and \nprerogatives of health plans and individual providers who, for \nreligious or moral reasons, choose not to discuss certain treatments, \nmust be protected. The question is, how best to accomplish this.\n  I am committed to continuing to work with all interested parties to \nachieve the greatest consensus possible on this critical issue. I will \ncontinue to work to see that all interested parties have been heard on \nthis issue and the greatest amount of consensus possible has been \nreached.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Levin):\n  S. 450.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to permit a waiver of the prohibition of offering nurse aide \ntraining and competency evaluation programs in certain nursing \nfacilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                  THE NURSE AIDE TRAINING ACT OF 1997\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation \nthat will preserve quality care in rural nursing homes by ensuring that \nthey can continue to conduct nurse aide training programs in their \nfacilities.\n\n[[Page S2373]]\n\n  This bill enjoys bipartisan support, and I am joined in introducing \nthis bill by Senators Grassley, Rockefeller, Baucus, Roberts, Harkin, \nFaircloth, Hutchinson, Inouye, and Conrad. The bill, which also has the \nsupport of the Clinton administration, will prevent the termination of \nnurse aide training programs where the reason for the termination is \nunrelated to the quality of the program and where no training \nalternative exists within a reasonable distance.\n  I have long believed that the Federal Government has an important \nrole to play in ensuring against the kinds of abuses that sometimes \noccurred prior to enactment of Federal nursing home standards. I do not \nbelieve that those abuses were the norm in nursing homes. Nursing homes \nin my State of North Dakota have a strong record of providing quality \ncare, and I believe that this was the case in most nursing homes.\n  But it is clear that some nursing homes did not meet that high \nstandard, and many States were slow to respond. To address that \ncritical problem, I supported and continue to support minimum Federal \nquality standards. Our first priority in nursing home legislation must \nbe the quality of care provided to residents, and we should not pass \nany laws that would compromise that goal.\n  However, I believe that some of our efforts to regulate nursing homes \nhave not resulted in greater quality of care for residents. In some \ncases, by imposing unnecessary burdens and severe penalties that are \nnot focused on quality, some laws and regulations can actually hinder \nthe delivery of quality care. The legislation I am offering today will \naddress one such instance.\n\n  In rural areas all over the country, nursing facilities offer \npotential caretakers an opportunity to learn the basic nursing and \npersonal care skills needed to become a certified nurse aide. In \nreturn, those who participate in a nurse aide training program help \nnursing facilities meet their staffing needs and allow the nursing \nstaff to focus more on administering quality nursing care.\n  Nurse aide training programs are especially important in rural areas \nlike my State of North Dakota, where potential nurse aides might have \nto travel hundreds of miles for training if it is not available at the \nnursing facility in their community. These nurse aide training programs \ncomply with strict guidelines related to the amount of training \nnecessary and determination of competency for certification.\n  Despite these safeguards, current law allows programs to be \nterminated for up to 2 years if a facility has been cited for a \ndeficiency or assessed a civil money penalty for reasons completely \nunrelated to the quality of the nurse aide training program. In North \nDakota, this could result in real hardship not just for the nursing \nfacility and potential nurse aides, but for the nursing home residents \nwho rely on nurse aides for their day-to-day care.\n  Under my bill, rural areas would be exempt from termination of nurse \naide training programs in these specific instances only if: First, no \nother program is offered within a reasonable distance of the facility; \nsecond, the State assures that an adequate environment exists for \noperating the program; and third, the State provides notice of the \ndetermination and assurances to the State long-term care ombudsman.\n  The President has included this proposal in the last two budgets he \nhas presented to Congress.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Byron Dorgan of \nNorth Dakota in introducing legislation aimed at reversing the lack of \nqualified nurse aides in rural America by encouraging local training \nprograms to continue their work. Our goal is to improve the level of \ncare in nursing homes. Increasing the availability of qualified staff \nin rural nursing homes will help older Americans live better lives.\n  Many rural nursing homes rely on their own training programs to \ncertify nurse aides. Current Federal law allows these training programs \nto be terminated due to problems unrelated to the quality of the \ntraining program. In rural areas, terminating a nurse aide training \nprogram can result in a lack of qualified staff at a rural facility. \nTherefore, terminating a nurse training program can actually make \nconditions worse, not better.\n  This bill ensures that nurse aide training programs will be judged on \ntheir own merits, not on outside factors. This is commonsense \nlegislation. Judging people on their actions and programs on their \nresults is the American way. Judging training programs on outside \nfactors doesn't penalize the substandard nursing homes, it penalizes \nolder Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Lautenberg):\n  S. 453.

Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an \nimportant event which took place on January 30 of this year. This day \nmarked the 25th anniversary of Bloody Sunday which left 14 civil rights \nmarchers dead in Northern Ireland.\n  During the late 1960's, peaceful opposition to disenfranchisement, \ninternment and anti-Catholic discrimination in Northern Ireland led to \nlarge protest marches throughout the region. On January 30, 1972, one \nof these peaceful protest marches was indiscriminately fired upon by a \nBritish regiment. Fourteen demonstrators were killed during the \nviolence.\n  The investigation conducted by Lord Widgery, and the subsequent \nWidgery Report, were conclusive. All of the victims were unarmed, and \nmost were shot in the back, leaving the world to conclude that the \nkillings were reckless. However, not a single British soldier was ever \nprosecuted for this crime.\n  The victims sought only to establish the rights of equal citizens, \nbut paid the ultimate price for challenging British authority. However, \nthe perpetrators go unpunished, and the British Government continue to \nignore the seriousness of the crime committed 25 years ago.\n  I urge the British Government to recognize the innocence of the \ndemonstrators who were killed or injured on\n\n[[Page S2376]]\n\nBloody Sunday, and work toward establishing justice for them and their \nfamilies. The struggle for justice continues today in Northern Ireland, \nand the British should work to repair the rift in Protestant-Catholic \nrelations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/17/senate-section/article/S2375-3", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GEORGE PASERO\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, my home State of Oregon \nlost one of its most distinguished citizens last Thursday, with the \npassing of George Pasero.\n  For the past half century, generation after generation of Oregonians \nhave opened up their newspaper and turned to the sports page to read \nwhat George Pasero had to say. As a reporter, columnist, and sports \neditor for the Oregon Journal from 1946 to 1982, and then as a part-\ntime columnist for the Oregonian, George earned a reputation not only \nas a respected and keen observer of the world of sports, but as a \nprofessional, fair, and compassionate person.\n  In these days where it seems that the sports world is full of million \ndollar salaries and million dollar egos, George Pasero liked to focus \non the true joys of sports. Let me share with you some very eloquent \nwords from one of the final columns George wrote before his death:\n  ``Dismiss for one evening the egomania, greed, and disrespect for \nauthority that have so marred the high levels of professionals,'' \nGeorge wrote about a banquet honoring Oregon athletes. ``Think here of \nyour neighbor kid happily going out to soccer practice, all the \nbasketball shooting you see on driveways, all the evenings of Little \nLeague and hamburger dinners, the prep football players with mud-caked \nuniforms on a rainy, cold Friday night.''\n  Mr. President, I am just one of countless Oregonians who will miss \nGeorge's insights and wisdom. Sharon joins with me in sending our \ncondolences to his wife, Jeanne, his daughter, Anne, his sons, John, \nMark, and Jim, and his five grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/03/17/senate-section/article/S2376-1", "month": "03", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "17", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--HOUSE JOINT RESOLUTION 58\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
