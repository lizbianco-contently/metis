Madam President, I rise today as a member of the Senate \nIndian Affairs Committee to express some concerns that I have about the \nnomination of Kevin Gover to be the new Assistant Secretary of Interior \nfor Indian Affairs, the head of the BIA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  I have consistently taken the position that in my experience the BIA \nis an agency that is in dire need of serious reform to make it more \neffective and more responsive to the needs of the tribes that it is \nestablished to serve. I therefore have a certain admiration for anyone \nwho is willing to undertake this task, because it is a tough one. It is \none that is difficult. Additionally, in this particular case, Mr. \nGover's personal qualifications recommend him very highly for this \nposition. He also has a Wyoming connection, which of course I am \ninterested in. Over several years he has represented the Eastern \nShoshone Tribe in several legal and legislative matters.\n  However, it wouldn't come as any surprise to my colleagues on that \ncommittee that given William Safire's recent op-ed piece on the Gover \nnomination in the New York Times, some questions have to be raised and \nare raised with respect to his nomination. According to the Safire \npiece, in private practice and representing the Tesuque Pueblo of New \nMexico, Mr. Gover was present at one of President Clinton's infamous \nWhite House coffees. Soon therefore, the Pueblo made two contributions \nto the Democratic National Committee totaling $50,000. Some time later, \nMr. Gover was nominated for this position.\n  An examination of the nominee's FBI file leads me to conclude that he \ncommitted no illegal acts. I believe at the very least they constitute \nan appearance of impropriety which should make many of us \nuncomfortable. I have no argument, of course, with the right of \nindividuals to make political contributions to the party of their \nchoice. That is provided by law and should be. I personally believe, \nhowever, it is a little unseemly for tribal governments to do so, to \neither party. It is no secret that all but two or three tribes in this \ncountry have little, if any, extra money to throw around. The \noverwhelming majority, even with Federal help, can hardly meet the day-\nto-day needs of their members--needs like shelter, health care, or \neducation. There is a constant press for additional funding for those \nneeds.\n  When a tribal government can't meet the basic needs of its people, \nthen I seriously question the morality of that government making a \npolitical contribution.\n  Another fact that lends itself to the appearance of impropriety in \nthis case is the special relationship between the tribes and the \nFederal Government. This relationship is like the relationship between \na trustee and beneficiary; the United States has a unique fiduciary \nresponsibility to the tribes and their members. Congress has turned \nover responsibility for day-to-day regulation of tribal affairs to the \nexecutive branch. So I can't think of many circumstances where national \ncampaign contributions--especially to the party of a sitting \nPresident--would not carry with them the appearance of impropriety, an \nappearance of unseemly influence--the idea of a beneficiary influencing \nthe trustee in its work.\n  And what about the appearance of a government body representing \nmembers of different political beliefs--in this case a tribal \ngovernment--making a monetary contribution to a national political \nparty on behalf of all of its members, whether or not that's their \npolitical belief. We prohibit Federal agencies from engaging in any \nlobbying efforts with taxpayer funds because it would look unseemly. We \nprohibit unions from making political contributions to one particular \nparty with members' dues. Mr. President, the question might be posed \nthat since it appears that nothing illegal took place in Mr. Gover's \ncase, why all the fuss? My answer, Madam President, is that oftentimes \nthe appearance of impropriety can be just as damning as an actual \nillegality.\n  The news these days is full of examples illustrating this \nconclusion--the subject of Senator Thompson's hearings, which just \nrecently ended with credible allegations against Secretary Babbitt that \ntribal campaign contributions influenced the denial of a gaming license \nto a Midwestern tribe.\n  In order to get answers to some of my concerns, I met with Mr. Gover \nat length on November 4. Our conversation was somewhat reassuring to \nme, and left me feeling that my argument is not with Mr. Gover, who as \nfar as I can tell at this time did nothing illegal, but with a system \nthat allows tribes to make these kinds of donations.\n  So, Madam President, should the Gover nomination come to a vote on \nthe floor, I do not plan to object. The BIA has been without leadership \nfor a long time, something that Bureau can ill afford, and Mr. Gover is \neminently qualified to lead it. But he can be sure while I support him, \nI and other Members will be watching closely to make sure he delivers \non his promises to reform the Bureau, to make it more responsible and \ncost efficient, and to help untangle the present mess in Indian gaming.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to discuss the state visit of \nChinese President Jiang Zemin to the United States last week.\n\n\n                          goals of asia policy\n\n  Let me begin with a reminder of our goals in Asia policy. They are:\n  A peaceful Pacific, open trade, joint work on problems of mutual \nconcern like environmental problems and international crime, and \nprogress toward respect for internationally recognized human rights.\n  This morning I would like to discuss my view of the results.\n\n\n                       accomplishments of summit\n\n  To begin with the positive, I believe this visit will be particularly \nhelpful in the first area--that of ensuring a stable peace in the \nPacific. The major elements of our security policy in the region are \nthe United States alliance with Japan; a permanent troop presence in \nAsia; deterrence of North Korean aggression; a one-China policy coupled \nwith a commitment to help Taiwan ensure its security; and preventing \nproliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  We have had a chance to discuss all of these issues in detail with \nPresident Jiang and China's senior foreign policy officials. And we \nhave emerged without any serious short-term differences, plus an \nimportant agreement on China's part to cease nuclear cooperation with \nIran. This will reduce the chances of a crisis in the region, and make \npeace in the Pacific generally more stable and permanent.\n  I see this renewed strategic dialogue and understanding of our mutual \ninterest in a peaceful region as the major accomplishment of the visit. \nI would also note some important specific agreements on a range of \nissues, including:\n  In return for China's halt of nuclear cooperation with Iran, we will \nopen up sales of civil nuclear power technology to China; China will \nenter the Information Technology Agreement, thus eliminating tariffs on \na range of high-tech products in which American companies are highly \ncompetitive--for example, semiconductors.\n  The United States will increase our assistance to China's efforts to \ncombat pollution; the United States Justice Department will support \nefforts to develop the rule of law in China, and the\n\n[[Page S11907]]\n\nmilitary services of both countries will make their military-to-\nmilitary dialogs more intense and frequent.\n  These are good, constructive agreements that will serve the interest \nof both countries. It is quite clear, however, that a great deal of \nwork lies ahead. Our goal should not only be to avoid crises and find \ncommon ground on areas of concern to both countries, but to solve \nproblems.\n  Here, we saw relatively little advance in two critical areas, and one \nis international trade.\n\n\n                           tasks ahead: trade\n\n  Last month, China passed Japan as the source of our largest trade \ndeficit--and this in a year when our deficit with Japan has risen \nsubstantially over last year's totals. And the main reason for this \ndeficit is the fact United States exports to China have been flat for 3 \nyears: $11.7 billion last year, $11.7 billion last year, on track for \nthe same this year. During this period, of course, China's economy has \ngrown by about 30 percent.\n  Our strategy for change has been to encourage China's membership in \nthe World Trade Organization on commercially acceptable grounds.\n  That is the right strategy. I believe that China should have \npermanent MFN status when it occurs. But the progress on WTO membership \nhas been so slow this year--even with the incentive of the first United \nStates-China summit since President Bush visited China nearly 9 years \nago--that we need to begin thinking about a fall-back option.\n  That is, China may well have concluded that the status quo is \nacceptable for the time being--that the price for entering the WTO in \nterms of trade reform is higher than the price for remaining outside.\n  If so, we need to change that calculus. I suggest as one possibility \nthat the administration begin to think about self-initiating a broad \nsection 301 case, as the Bush administration did in 1991. This would \ntackle some of the main trade problems we are focusing on in the WTO \naccession talks.\n  This is obviously a less attractive, less cooperative approach than \nthe WTO accession. But we have already waited 8 years for China to make \na good WTO offer, and we cannot afford to wait very much longer. We \nremain very much open to imports from China, while China keeps out our \nwheat, our manufactures, our services, and all the rest.\n  It is not fair, and our legitimate complaints about market access \ncannot be held hostage forever to WTO entry.\n\n\n                              human rights\n\n  The second is human rights.\n  Since World War II, we have viewed human rights practices within \nnations as intimately linked to the willingness of governments to use \nforce and coercion outside their borders. We have also seen promotion \nof human rights as a humanitarian, nonpolitical responsibility that all \nof us hold.\n  I agree with both of those considerations. I believe they apply in \nChina as well as in other countries. And I am disappointed by the lack \nof any significant change in Chinese policy, especially on the \npolitical prisoner question, during this summit. As we look to the \nfuture, though, I believe we need to remember three things.\n  First, broad long-term trends in most areas are good. During the past \ndecade, the number of political prisoners in China has fallen from \nabout 5,000 to about 2,500; controls on information in a number of \nonce-sensitive areas like official corruption and workplace abuses have \nrelaxed; and China has taken steps like introducing village elections \nthat have made the political system somewhat more accountable.\n  Second, we should set limited, achievable goals where we do not see a \ngreat deal of progress. These should include freedom for dissidents \nlike Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan; a clear public accounting of the \nnumber of people jailed for strictly political reasons; talks with the \nDalai Lama; and so forth. Short of areas like rule of law or \nparliamentary procedure, in which China is seeking our assistance, \nhuman rights policy should not include very broad, ambitious efforts to \nchange the Chinese political system. Such efforts would be seen not as \nhumanitarian in nature, but either as an effort to overthrow the \nChinese Government, or more likely a rhetorical policy without much \nserious content.\n  And third, human rights is a long-term issue. The keys to success are \npatience and persistence. We will need to continue raising the cases of \nindividuals held in prison with Chinese officials, continue our work in \nareas like the U.N. Human Commission on Human Rights next spring. We \nneed to be persistent and don't give up.\n\n\n                            the road forward\n\n  In the broader sense, with the summit behind us our next steps in \nChina policy are clear.\n  We have set a good foundation in the political and security arena. We \nhave done a good job in identifying other areas of mutual interest, \nfrom environmental protection to nuclear plant sales to the rule of \nlaw. We need to keep at these issues; and we need to work harder in \nareas like market access and human rights, where this summit brought \nless than we would have hoped for. And we should avoid reckless steps \nlike broad new sanctions laws which are likely to make things worse \nrather than better.\n  On the whole, we are on the right course and we should stay there. \nStep by step, issue by issue, we are getting the results we should seek \nin China policy--a stable peace in Asia; fairness in trade; respect for \ninternational standards of human rights; and cooperation in areas of \nmutual interest like the environment. This summit has made a very \nimportant contribution to the effort, and I look for it to continue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins).

Madam President, I thank the Chair for this \nopportunity to recognize the month of November as National Adoption \nMonth and to speak on this very important issue--one that is very close \nto my heart--and is at the very heart of my own family.\n  As legislators, we work to enact laws to improve and protect the \nlives of the American people.\n  However, there are occasions when our policies can hurt the very \npeople we are trying to protect. In this instance, it is our children.\n  Last year, in my State of Oregon, 221 parents adopted children from \nforeign countries, including China, Romania, Korea, India, and \nThailand.\n  During that same year, Congress passed the Immigration and \nNationality Act that included a provision which, until now, seemed \nrather innocuous.\n  But for parents like Gary and Laurie Hunter from Myrtle Creek, OR, \nwho are adopting a daughter from China, it has become a bitter pill in \nthe adoption process.\n  Simply, the provision requires that all incoming immigrants receive \ncertain immunizations before entering the United States.\n  While this may seem like a logical public health law, it raises \nserious concerns about the health and safety of children receiving \nvaccinations under substandard conditions in foreign countries.\n  Many of these countries do not practice the same sanitary health \nconditions as the United States.\n  For example, some countries lack adequate medical records for \nchildren living in orphanages and do not have access to sufficient \nsupplies of sterile needles, creating an even greater risk to the \nhealth of young adoptive children entering the United States.\n  Today, I am proud to be a part of a Senate which has passed \nlegislation, H.R. 2464, to repeal the provision requiring immunizations \nprior to entry into the United States, and protect the children who \nhave yet to become citizens of this country.\n  This bill will exempt internationally adopted children 10 years of \nage or younger from the immunization requirement, and allow parents 30 \ndays to immunize their children.\n  Importantly, immunization will not occur overseas in an orphanage, or \nin\n\n[[Page S11908]]\n\nan immigration office, but upon entering the United States, under the \nsupervision of a family physician in a safe environment.\n  There is a tradition in the Senate, to begin the day with a prayer \nfrom the Senate Chaplain.\n  Today, I would like to take a moment to end my statement with a short \nphrase from the Common Book of Prayer, a phrase that I hope will \nencourage and inspire my colleagues in these last few days of the 105th \nCongress to continue the work which we have been charged to do by the \nAmerican people:\n\n       We have left undone those things which we ought to have \n     done; and we have done those things which we ought not to \n     have done.\n\n  Madam President, I am proud to stand before my colleagues today to \nsay that with the passage of this important legislation, we have done \nthose things which we ought to have done. I thank the Chair, and I \nyield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, William Manchester, writing in the book, \n``The Glory and the Dream,'' would call the year 1932 ``the cruelest \nyear.'' I was in the 10th grade at Mark Twain High School at Stotesbury \nin Raleigh County, southern West Virginia. Living in a coal miner's \nhome, I saw and felt the Great Depression firsthand. Schoolteachers \noften had to reduce their monthly paychecks by several percentage \npoints in order to get the checks cashed. The newspapers frequently \ncarried stories of men who had jumped out of windows or pressed a \ncocked pistol to their temples, taking their lives because they had \nlost their lifetime savings, and their economic world had come crashing \ndown around them.\n  Very few men in and around the coal fields had ever owned an \nautomobile, and those who were fortunate enough to possess an \nautomobile jacked it up off the ground and mounted the axles on \nrailroad crossties to keep the tires from rotting while enough money \ncould be saved to pay for a new license plate. Many children went to \nbed hungry at night, their families destitute.\n  The country had hit rock bottom, and West Virginia was one of the \n``rock bottomest'' of the States. It is hard to imagine that things \ncould have gotten much worse in southern West Virginia. There was \nlittle left but hope, and there was not much of that, hardly enough to \ngo around.\n  President Hoover, against whom I would still be campaigning 20 years \nlater, professed to ignore the crisis as a ``depression,'' he being \nconvinced that a ``balanced budget'' was the most essential factor \nleading to an economic recovery. He still wore a black tie at dinner in \nthe White House, even when the only other person dining with him was \nhis wife, Lou.\n  Creature comforts were rare. Air conditioning was unknown, as were \nautomatic dishwashers, electric toothbrushes, cassette recorders, \ngarbage disposal units, electric can openers, vacuum cleaners, power \nmowers and record players. Phonographs were wound with a crank by hand. \nThe family wash was done by hand on a washboard. Wet clothes were hung \non a clothesline with clothespins to dry in the wind, and a \nrefrigerator was simply an icebox kept filled by a man who knew how \nmany pounds of ice a housewife wanted because she notified him by \nplacing on the kitchen screen door a card with the number ``100,'' \n``75,'' ``50'' or ``25'' turned up. Heavy irons for pressing clothes \nwere heated on the coal-burning kitchen stove. Houseflies were always a \nsummer problem, and the only preventives were spray guns and flypaper.\n  We were not used to much, and if we had never had much to begin with, \nwe did not miss it.\n  Most of the coal miners by the year 1932 had a radio in their homes. \nIt was a Majestic, an Atwater Kent or a Philco. At my house, a small \nPhilco radio sat on a wall shelf, and it was there that we gathered on \nSaturday nights to listen to the Grand Ole Opry that was broadcast from \nNashville, TN. I heard the ``Solemn Old Judge,'' the ``Fruit Jar \nDrinkers,'' DeFord Bailey on his harmonica, the Delmore Brothers, Roy \nAcuff, Minnie Pearl from ``Grinders Switch,'' Sam and Kirk McGree and \nUncle Dave Macon picking the banjo ``clawhammer style.''\n  On some Saturday nights, I would play the fiddle at a small but \nlively square dance held somewhere in a coal camp where I lived or in a \nneighboring community. Times were bad, but life had to go on, and a \nSaturday night frolic helped to keep the spirits up.\n  Madam President, in that year 1932, a writer for the Saturday Evening \nPost asked John Maynard Keynes, the great British economist, whether \nthere had ever been anything like the Depression before. ``Yes,'' he \nreplied. ``It was called the Dark Ages and it lasted four hundred \nyears.'' This was calamity howling on a cosmic scale, but on at least \none point the resemblance seemed valid. In each case the people were \nvictims of forces that they could not understand.\n  Mr. President, in that same year of 1932, there was born a child in \nMassachusetts, and his name was Edward Kennedy. In 1932, of course, I \nknew nothing about Edward Kennedy or Edward Kennedy's birth. But today \nI rise on this Senate floor to salute one of the outstanding Senators \nin the history of this great body. He is a man whose expertise, hard \nwork, and courage have set a lofty example to which every fledgling \nSenator should aspire.\n  On November 6, 1962, Edward Kennedy was elected to the Senate, and so \nhe is celebrating his 35th anniversary and we are celebrating the 35th \nanniversary of his arrival in the Senate.\n  I well remember the arrival of young Edward Kennedy in this Chamber. \nHaving been elected in 1962 at the age of 30, he was one of the \nyoungest Members in Senate history.\n  While Senator Kennedy may not have been the youngest Senator ever, he \nwas certainly one of the youngest. Despite his youth, however, much was \nexpected of this young man and I suspect that some may have wondered \nwhether he was really up to the challenge. After all, Senator Kennedy \nwas representing a State that had provided the Senate with some its \nmost memorable figures, among them Daniel Webster, Rufus Choate, and \nCharles Sumner. In addition, Senator Kennedy was elected to finish the \nterm of the then current President, who was none other than his \nbrother. When one remembers that another Kennedy brother was then \nAttorney General of the United States, one realizes why Senator Kennedy \nwas accorded rather more attention than the average freshman Senator.\n  I am gratified to report that, far from falling short of these grand \nexpectations, Senator Kennedy has exceeded them. He became an \ninnovative and productive legislator. He also embarked on a path from \nwhich he has never varied: championing the interests of the working \npeople, the poor, and the disadvantaged. His tenure as chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Labor and Human Resources during the 100th Congress \nwas remarkable, both in the sheer volume of legislation that he \nsponsored and in the dedication that he displayed to improving the \neducation and health of all Americans.\n\n[[Page S11909]]\n\n  I was the majority leader of the Senate during that 100th Congress. I \nworked closely with Senator Kennedy and he worked closely with me.\n  In just 2 years, Senator Kennedy pushed through more beneficial \nsocial legislation than many Senators produce in a lifetime.\n  Mr. President, this country has seen remarkable changes over the past \n35 years. Not the least of those changes has been a shift in political \nattitudes from the optimism and compassion that characterized the \n1960's to the more hardened and occasionally cynical climate of today. \nBut, throughout those changes, Senator Ted Kennedy has remained \nfaithful to his vision of an America in which the rights of those \nwithout money, jobs, health insurance, or education are protected. \nOthers may bow to the vagaries of public opinion but not Senator \nKennedy. Instead, relying on a political and legislative acumen than \nmay owe something to his well-known expertise as a sailor, Senator \nKennedy uses the winds of popular sentiment to achieve his goals. Many \ntimes where others meekly follow the course of these powerful winds, \nSenator Kennedy calmly lifts a dampened finger aloft to test their \nforce and direction, then he very expertly and patiently tacks back and \nforth until he reaches, his chosen destination. Even the strongest \nheadwind is not enough to dissuade him, for he knows that hard work and \ndedication can conquer the most imposing obstacles.\n  Despite his passionate and unswerving convictions, Senator Kennedy is \nalso one of the most accommodating Members of the Senate. Throughout \nhis career, he has sought out partnerships with Members regardless of \ntheir ideology or party in the interests of passing wise and necessary \nlegislation. Even in these partisan days in which we live, Senator \nKennedy consistently seeks to find common ground with those at all \npoints along the political spectrum. Senator Kennedy has repeatedly put \nthe national interest ahead of petty partisan squabbles.\n  Not that he is above partisanship at all. We are all capable of being \npartisan at times; some of us more than others, perhaps. But this open-\nminded approach to lawmaking, this brave refusal to succumb to the \npartisan animosity that permeates Congress today, may well be one of \nthe Senator's greatest legacies.\n\n  I said at the beginning of my remarks that I believe Senator Kennedy \nto be one of the most outstanding Senators this Chamber has seen. Lest \nI be accused of hyperbole and exaggeration, or of excessive kindness \ntoward a friend, let me make clear that my words are not motivated by \nsimple kindness. Senator Kennedy's legislative dexterity and bipartisan \napproach, are a rare combination indeed. I fear that many of today's \npoliticians will be judged harshly by the historians of tomorrow for \ntheir fickleness, their shallow rhetoric, their willingness to pander \nto popular opinion. But not so my good friend and esteemed colleague \nfrom Massachusetts.\n\n  I have remarked before, and I remark today, that had Ted Kennedy been \nliving in 1789 at the time the first Congress met, he would have been a \npowerful factor in pressing forward with the legislation that was \nenacted in that first Congress. A formidable opponent, a knowledgeable \nand dedicated legislator, Ted Kennedy would have been in the forefront \nof those who were advocating the Judiciary Act, and I have no doubt \nthat he would have left his imprint upon that legislation.\n  Had he been living at the time of the Civil War, serving in the U.S. \nSenate, again, he would have been recognized as a forceful leader.\n  In the days of reconstruction, again, Senator Kennedy would have made \nhis mark in the U.S. Senate.\n  Had he been a Senator during the years of the New Deal, he would have \nallied himself with Franklin D. Roosevelt and would have been a strong \nsupporter of the landmark legislation that was enacted in those \ndifficult years.\n  I think that if Ted Kennedy had been living prior to the Revolution, \nhe would have joined men like Samuel Adams and John Adams and John \nHancock, from his State of Massachusetts, in resisting the edicts of \nGeorge III, the King of England.\n  So, in summation, I say that Ted Kennedy would have been a leader, an \noutstanding Senator, at any period of the Nation's history.\n  Ted Kennedy and I have not always been the best of friends. There was \na time when we were not. That time has long been relegated to the ashes \nof the past. When I was majority leader of the Senate, and also when I \nwas minority leader of the Senate, and when I was majority leader \nagain, as I have already indicated, in the 100th Congress, I leaned \nmuch on Ted Kennedy's knowledge, his expertise, his support. He was one \nof my strongest supporters in the Senate. In caucuses or on the Senate \nfloor, I could always count on Ted Kennedy to be there when I needed \nhim.\n  So, Ted Kennedy and I formed a friendship in the finest sense of that \nword.\n  We share a liking for history, a fondness for poetry, and a love for \nthe U.S. Senate. Ted Kennedy does his work well in the committee. When \nhe comes to the floor, he comes with a batch of papers in his hands and \nwith a head full of knowledge in respect to the legislation which he is \npromoting. I count him as one of the most effective Members of the \nSenate.\n  I admire Ted's steadfast purpose, his tireless work, his easy humor, \nand his kind nature. But, most of all, I admire his courage. He has \nexperienced more personal tragedy and deep sorrow than most of us could \nbear and still retain our sanity. Yet, he goes on. He contributes. He \nendures. He laughs. He leads. He inspires. He triumphs.\n  I have watched him weather and work and grow in wisdom for 35 \nyears. He has an excellent staff. One would have to have an excellent \nstaff to be able to turn out the massive amount of work and to provide \nthe leadership that he has so many times provided in enacting landmark \nlegislation. He is ever on an upward track.\n\n  Herman Melville put it this way:\n\n       . . . and there is a Catskill eagle in some souls that can \n     alike dive down into the blackest gorges, and soar out of \n     them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces. And even \n     if he forever flies within the gorge, that gorge is in the \n     mountains; so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain \n     eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain, even \n     though they soar.\n\n  So here is to my friend and colleague as he celebrates his 35th \nanniversary. May he ever soar.\n  I close with a verse by one of my favorite poets, Edwin Markham, a \nverse that I think typifies Senator Kennedy:\n\n     Give thanks, O heart, for the high souls\n     That point us to the deathless goals--\n     For all the courage of their cry\n     That echoes down from sky to sky;\n     Thanksgiving for the armed seers\n     And heroes called to mortal years--\n     Souls that have built our faith in man,\n     And lit the ages as they ran.\n\n  I again thank my true friend, and he is my friend, has been for all \nthe years that he has been in the Senate, Jesse Helms, for his kindness \nin arranging for me to proceed at this moment.\n  I thank him very much.\n  Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I can assure the able Senator from West \nVirginia--I have always described him as a Senator's Senator--it is \nalways a pleasure to cooperate with him any time, and I enjoy listening \nto him because I learn something every time.\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, in the life of a country, as in the life \nof an individual, there are times when we must choose between moving \nforward and standing still. Our trade policy is at just such a \ncrossroads: We must decide whether to help promote freer trade and more \nopen markets or try to preserve the status quo.\n  As we confront this issue, we must recognize that the world is \nchanging and that even an economic superpower can do no more than \npostpone the inevitable. Our resolution of this issue will determine \nwhether the United States continues to move forward on a wave of \nexport-driven growth or risks permitting other economies to leave us \nbehind. I believe it is time to stand behind our commitment to free \ntrade and work to bring other countries into open trading relationships \nthat will mean jobs and prosperity for our citizens in the century \nahead. That is why, Mr. President, I have decided to support the fast \ntrack legislation.\n  In developing my position on this legislation, I have been guided by \none overriding consideration - will its enactment improve the lives of \nthe people of Maine? Will it mean more customers for Maine businesses? \nWill it mean more opportunities for Maine entrepreneurs? And most \nimportant, will it mean more jobs for Maine workers? While free trade \nis not without problems, I firmly believe that the long-term answer to \nall of these questions is yes.\n  International trade is an increasingly critical part of Maine's \neconomy. In 1996, for example, my State exported more than 1.2 billion \ndollars worth of goods. Considering both the direct and indirect \nimpact, those exports translated into 13,500 Maine jobs.\n  But this export-led growth is just the beginning. I believe the \npeople of Maine have the ingenuity, the drive, and the work ethic to \nflourish in a world of freer trade and more open markets for U.S. \ngoods. From successful retailers like L.L. Bean, to manufacturers like \nPratt & Whitney, to financial service companies like UNUM, to high-\ntechnology companies like Portland's ABB, to paper mills throughout my \nState, Maine enterprises have proven that they can compete in a global \neconomy. These companies recognize that much of their future revenue \nand job growth will come from serving customers beyond our borders.\n  This is well understood in Maine. The United Paperworkers \nInternational Union has pressed the administration to negotiate \nreductions in European tariffs to help open foreign markets to the \nproducts its members make in Maine and elsewhere and to generate more \nexport-related jobs. As Prof. Charles Colgan of the University of \nSouthern Maine, a noted trade expert, stated in a recent letter to me, \n``The . . . vote on Fast Track authority for the President to negotiate \nadditional trade agreements is an important vote for Maine. \nInternational trade is an increasingly vital part of the Maine economy. \n. . .''\n  Perhaps the clearest reason to support fast-track authority was set \nforth in a letter from the State of Maine's director of International \nTrade, who wrote as follows: ``I simply feel that our best hopes for \nlong-term economic prosperity here in Maine lie in creating \ninternational opportunities for our people, and not in limiting our \naccess to new and emerging economies. However, well-intentioned, \nrestricting our ability to trade will never create new jobs for Maine \npeople.''\n  Mr. President, I said earlier that we face the decision of whether to \nmove forward. But in reality, the world will change with or without us, \nand thus, the real question is not whether we move forward, but whether \nwe move forward wisely. That is the standard against which we should \njudge our trade policy, and against which we should judge this \nlegislation. To me, this means that our trade strategy must meet three \ntests.\n  First, since some citizens may be temporarily disadvantaged--through \nno fault of their own--by the changes freer trade can bring, we must \nassist them to adjust to changed conditions. Second, we must ensure \nthat free trade is genuinely free, for that is what ``fair trade'' \nreally means: If we do not insist that other countries open their \nmarkets to fair competition from U.S. goods, the system will collapse. \nThird, as we give the President the authority to negotiate trade \nagreements, we must preserve an appropriate role for Congress in this \nvital area of national policy.\n  After weeks of studying this issue, listening to my constituents, \nand consulting with U.S. trade officials, it has become clear to me \nthat the renewal of fast-track authority meets my three criteria and is \nvery much in the best interests of my country and my State.\n\n  First, while the rising economic tide that comes from free trade \nultimately lifts all boats, it may impose costs upon some of our \ncitizens in the short run. For this reason, I was greatly encouraged by \nthe President's promise to expand Trade Adjustment Assistance \nprograms--and to expand them to include not only workers directly \naffected by trade adjustments but also workers in businesses supplying \naffected companies. This change should prove particularly beneficial to \nsmall businesses in Maine and elsewhere.\n  Second, I am pleased to have received assurances from the office of \nthe U.S. Trade Representative that they share some of the important \nconcerns of Maine's citizens with regard to ensuring that trade is \nreally free. More specifically, Ambassador Barshefsky has made clear to \nme in writing that she regards Canada's bulk easement rules on potato \nimports to be an unfair trade barrier that must be pursued with the \nCanadian Government. Ambassador Barshefsky has committed to me that she \nwill begin bilateral talks with the Canadian Government, beginning no \nlater than March 1998. In addition, Ambassador Barshefsky has assured \nme that she views Canadian potato subsidies as a very serious matter \nthat also must be addressed. Having established open markets as the \nnorm, our trade officials must work--and, I have been assured, are \nworking--to ensure that foreign governments keep their promises.\n  Furthermore, I want to emphasize that passage of this legislation \nwill not in any way hinder the ability of an industry to bring \nchallenges under current trade laws against unfair trade practices, \nsuch as subsidies provided by foreign governments. Members of the \nfarmed salmon industry in Maine have brought such a case. They seek \nrelief from the adverse effects of dumping and subsidization, and of \nunequal conditions of competition, which give their Chilean competitors \nan unfair and illegal advantage.\n  It was only after I became satisfied that fast track would not \nnegatively affect the Maine salmon industry or its ability to pursue \nits legitimate grievances under current law that I decided to support \nthis legislation. As a representative of the salmon industry recently \nadvised me, what is most critical to them is ``the preservation of \neffective remedies under existing law and their vigorous enforcement.'' \nThis legislation not only preserves existing remedies but also has as \none of its objectives the pursuit of illegal activities by other \nnations. Thus, it recognizes that free trade is not achieved by the \nstroke of a pen on an agreement but rather by a commitment to the \nvigorous enforcement of our trade laws.\n  Third, this bill carefully addresses the need to preserve the proper \nbalance of powers and responsibilities within our Government. While it \nrestricts Congress' power to amend the terms of trade agreements, it \nmaintains our right to reject them. Indeed, it goes farther than any \nprior fast-track legislation to protect Congressional prerogatives. For \nexample, it limits the application of the fast track to agreements \nwhich advance specifically enumerated negotiating objectives set out in \nthe bill, which preserves our ultimate authority to set the goals of \nU.S. trade policy.\n\n[[Page S11911]]\n\n  Moreover, the Senate version of the legislation contains more \nelaborate procedures than ever before to ensure that Congress is \nconsulted at every step as the President negotiates trade agreements. \nThe President must consult with or notify the relevant committees--or \nCongress as a whole--on at least five different occasions during the \nprocess, even before Congress begins drafting an agreement's \nimplementing legislation. These requirements guarantee that at all \ntimes we will be fully informed of the progress of ongoing trade talks.\n  Most significantly, unlike past fast-track legislation, S. 1269 \npermits congressional disapproval of a trade agreement long before the \nstage of final ratification. After the President notifies Congress of \nhis intent to negotiate a specific agreement, the Senate Finance \nCommittee and the House Ways and Means Committee may vote to \n``disapprove'' the idea--thus removing it from the fast-track process \nand making it subject to ordinary amendment. Under this legislation, \nwhat Congress gives to the President it may also take away. In short, \nthe bill allows America to move more quickly in a rapidly changing \nworld, while making Congress more of a real partner in the negotiation \nof trade agreements.\n  The United States is one of the principal engines of the world \neconomy in large part because it has long been one of the most open \ntrading economies in the world. Continued progress in global trade \nliberalization--bringing other countries up to our high standards of \nmarket openness--is vital if we are to remain in the global driver's \nseat in the next century.\n  The road to free trade will not be without bumps, but it is a road I \nbelieve we must take, for at the end of that road will be a more \nprosperous Maine, a more prosperous America, and a more prosperous \nworld. For that reason, I intend to vote for the fast-track \nlegislation.\n  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters \nfrom Ambassador Barshefsky, the Maine International Trade Center, Unum \nInsurance Co., Pratt & Whitney, and ABB Environmental Services be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, The United States \n           Trade Representative,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Susan Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for sharing your concerns \n     regarding the need to create a fair and level playing field \n     for potato growers in Maine.\n       I share your concerns regarding the need to address the \n     difficult trade issues facing potato growers in Maine. As a \n     result, I requested that the International Trade Commission \n     conduct a section 332 investigation on fresh and processed \n     potatoes, on an expedited basis, to provide the necessary \n     information to assess the terms of trade between U.S. and \n     Canadian growers and processors. The Commission issued its \n     report on July 18. We are now in the process of working with \n     industry to determine the next steps given the information \n     that was provided in the report.\n       One specific concern you mentioned is Canada's regulations \n     governing interprovincial and import shipments of potatoes \n     for repackaging and processing. It is our understanding that \n     a processor intending to import bulk potatoes must obtain a \n     Ministerial Exemption (Easement) to the Fresh Fruit and \n     Vegetable Regulations under the Canada Agricultural Products \n     Act. Such an easement is only granted for the purposes of \n     importation if a shortage of potatoes exists in Canada. Our \n     exporters object to the apparent discriminatory and arbitrary \n     manner in which this system operates. I agree that this \n     unfair trade barrier should be addressed expeditiously and \n     will engage Canadian officials in bilateral talks on this \n     matter, beginning no later than March 1998. Please be assured \n     that I am committed to pursuing this matter until we reach a \n     fair resolution.\n       The second concern you raised is Canadian subsidies, and in \n     specific, whether Canada is in compliance with its \n     international obligations with respect to certain programs \n     qualifying as ``green box'' support programs. I agree that a \n     review should be conducted to determine whether or not \n     certain Canadian subsidy programs now qualify as green box \n     programs. We, together with USDA, will work with industry to \n     determine which Canadian programs should be reviewed and will \n     pursue any exceptions that are found.\n       It is my hope that this plan to address the trade concerns \n     of Maine's potato growers will indeed level the playing field \n     for Maine's potato growers.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charlene Barshefsky.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Maine International Trade Center,\n\n                                   Portland, ME, November 6, 1997.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senator, Washington, DC.\n\n     Re Fast-Track Negotiating Authority.\n\n       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your inquiry concerning \n     the potential impact of ``fast track'' trade pact negotiating \n     authority on Maine and Maine business. As Maine's Director of \n     International Trade, I am pleased to share my thoughts on \n     this important issue with you.\n       Free trade agreements such as the US-Canada Free Trade \n     Agreement, NAFTA and Mercosur continue to be the subject of \n     considerable debate and, unfortunately, misleading \n     statistical analyses. Proponents and opponents alike are able \n     to point to economic data that supports various aspects of \n     their respective positions. Thus, although I am a strong \n     supporter of free trade, and therefore NAFTA and ``fast \n     track'' authority, it may be most helpful to provide you with \n     a broader analysis of the issue and impact of Maine than to \n     offer you raw data for which there will doubtless be a \n     flipside analysis.\n       It is important to note at the outset, however, some \n     incontrovertible facts. US exports to Canada have grown by \n     118% (from $60.9 billion to $132 billion) since the enactment \n     of the US-Canada Free Trade Agreement. Maine's exports to \n     Canada have grown from $300 million in 1988 to $546 million \n     in 1996, an increase of 82%, in the same period.\n       Maine's export to Mexico in 1993 (pre-NAFTA) were $18 \n     million. In 1994, the first full year of NAFTA, Maine \n     exported $27 million of goods to Mexico. In 1995, following \n     the peso crisis, Maine's exports to Mexico declined to $14 \n     million. In 1996, as Mexico's economy rebounded, Maine's \n     exports to Mexico rallied to $34 million. In short, Maine's \n     exports to Mexico have almost doubled since the passage of \n     NAFTA.\n       Taken together, Maine's exports to Canada and Mexico have \n     grown from $472 million in 1994 to $582 million in 1996, an \n     increase of $110 million in three years. In my view, the \n     current improved condition of Maine's economy is attributable \n     in part not only to the continued strength of the US economy \n     generally but increased international commerce in particular. \n     The US Government estimates that for every $1 billion in \n     exports, 40,000 jobs are created. The message is clear.\n       Opponents of fast track legislation and free trade \n     agreements generally cite the dangers of ``exporting jobs'' \n     to lower wage countries. This is a rational concern, and one \n     not to be dismissed. I believe, however, that market forces \n     will dictate in any case where a business owner will choose \n     to locate her manufacturing facilities, and as things stand \n     today there are already many lower wage environments that can \n     be haven to such activities, if that is a manufacturer's \n     primary consideration.\n       I continue to have ultimate confidence in the \n     competitiveness of Maine's workers, products and services. \n     Our goods and services are highly competitive and desired \n     around the world. We have nothing to fear from enhanced \n     competition--and once the doors to new markets are open to \n     us, we can and do succeed. Our workers are second to none. \n     High quality, premium and value-added goods are being \n     produced in Maine today when many lower-cost markets are \n     available for the purpose. In short, we have nothing to fear \n     from world markets, so long as we recognize that we have to \n     continue to strive to be the very best.\n       Erecting protectionist barriers will not insulate us from \n     the forces of competition that are at work in the world \n     today. We need access to other markets, just as we have been \n     liberal in granting access to our own. History teaches us \n     that the Maginot Line did nothing to prevent the advance of \n     unwelcome intruders. Similarly, creating impediments to \n     market entry will not protect us from larger competitive \n     forces that may have an adverse impact on our economy. We \n     need to embrace the current competitive environment and \n     succeed in it.\n       Fast track authority will enable the President to conclude \n     trade agreements that can create vistas of opportunity for \n     Maine businesses. We need to have enough faith in our \n     leadership, and in the political process, to trust that our \n     concerns over environmental protection and job impact will be \n     represented at the negotiating table. The cold, hard truth is \n     that our competitors from around the globe are aggressively \n     pursuing trading relationships in countries and markets that \n     we cannot yet approach owing to trade barriers or other \n     impediments. If we dither, or if we engage in protracted \n     debate no matter how well-intentioned, we will be far behind \n     the curve--and that will in the short, medium and long-term \n     result in loss of opportunity for Maine businesses, and \n     impact our economic growth.\n       I do not for a moment mean to minimize the potential for \n     adverse short-term impacts owing to the opening of new \n     markets. These are real concerns, although I believe history \n     has shown that our economy can flourish in a free trade \n     environment. I simply feel that our best hopes for long-term \n     economic prosperity here in Maine lie in creating \n     international opportunities for our people, and not in \n     limiting our access to new and emerging economies. However \n     well-intentioned, restricting our ability to trade will never \n     create new jobs for Maine people.\n\n[[Page S11912]]\n\n       I thank you for the opportunity to comment, and wish you \n     the very best in your deliberations.

Collins,\n     Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Susan: Earlier this year, Unum communicated support \n     for passage of fast track trade negotiating legislation. As \n     this issue moves forward in Congress, I wanted to write and \n     reiterate our support for passage of this legislation.\n       Opening foreign markets has been critical for Unum in \n     several of our recent international expansions. Currently, \n     Unum has operations in the United Kingdom, Japan, Argentina, \n     Bermuda, France, and Germany, along with the United States \n     and Canada.\n       We will continue to expand internationally as opportunities \n     present themselves. However, we have found that it is \n     imperative that our government be able to negotiate \n     aggressively with our trading partners in order to get the \n     fair and open access that we need to be competitive. Fast \n     track legislation gives our government the ability to \n     negotiate these kinds of trade agreements. As you weigh the \n     facts on this issue, I think you will see that this \n     legislation is a necessary tool for our government to be \n     successful in negotiating with foreign governments.\n       If you would like any additional information about Unum's \n     international operations, I would be more than happy to \n     provide it. As fast track legislation is considered by the \n     Senate, I urge your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Brian K. Atchinson,\n     2nd Vice President, External Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              Pratt & Whitney,\n\n                              North Berwick, ME, October 31, 1997.\n     Senator Susan M. Collins,\n     Senate Russell Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: The president's authority to \n     negotiate any major trade agreement has lapsed and must be \n     authorized by Congress. I am writing to tell you why it is \n     important to the people at Pratt & Whitney's North Berwick \n     plant, and United Technologies, to pass legislation known as \n     ``fast track'' authority this year.\n       Pratt & Whitney's business success in the U.S. depends to a \n     significant degree on our ability to sell our products in \n     markets abroad. Our government's negotiators need fast track \n     authority to open markets, reduce tariffs and eliminate trade \n     barriers to U.S. products. Negotiators will not be taken \n     seriously if it is perceived that they do not have the \n     authority to conclude an agreement.\n       Fast track is not a new concept, and it does not result in \n     us ``rushing into trade agreements''. It has been a procedure \n     used since 1974 and has been renewed many times by Congress. \n     Fast track does not remove Congress' involvement in trade \n     agreements because the legislation includes specific \n     negotiating objectives and a consultation mechanism whereby \n     the president is obligated to consult with Congress during \n     the negotiating of trade agreements. All fast track ensures \n     is that once an agreement is reached, with congressional \n     permission and consultation, it will not be amended after it \n     is signed.\n       Why is fast track important to our economy? Because trade \n     creates and supports jobs in the U.S. and in Maine. The \n     opponents of fast track would have us halt our participation \n     in the global economy. That approach is the greatest threat \n     to jobs in the U.S., especially for companies like United \n     Technologies that export over $3 billion per year. We need \n     fast track to stay competitive, and maintain a strong \n     economy.\n       I urge you to press for speedy consideration of the fast \n     track legislation in Congress this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    R. E. Ponchak,\n     General Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             ABB Environmental Services, Inc.,\n\n                                    Portland, ME, October 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of ABB Inc., I am writing \n     to urge you to support renewing fast track authority for the \n     President. More than one third of the economic growth and \n     nearly 40 percent of the new jobs created since 1993 are \n     based on exports. Since only 4 percent of the world's \n     consumers reside in the U.S., future growth and job creation \n     will rely heavily on exports and the ability of the U.S. to \n     access global markets. In order for the U.S. to be able to \n     eliminate trade barriers and thus open foreign markets to \n     U.S. goods and services, the President must have the proper \n     authority to negotiate trade agreements from a position of \n     strength, where the U.S. will be able to maintain its place \n     as a world economic leader. Fast track will provide the \n     President with this authority.\n       Fast track authority is especially important to ABB Inc. \n     Our operations in the U.S. are becoming increasingly reliant \n     on exports. So far, ABB's exports in 1997 have grown over 40 \n     percent. The ability to gain greater access to markets all \n     over the world and especially in Latin America and Asia is \n     vital to the well-being of our company and employees. Fast \n     track authority will ensure that ABB's interests abroad, as \n     well as those of other U.S. companies, will be preserved.\n       Every President since 1974 has had fast track trade \n     negotiating authority. Without fast track, the U.S. will be \n     at a competitive disadvantage by permitting other countries \n     to gain preferential market treatment at the expense of the \n     American worker. Since fast track authority expired in 1994, \n     more than twenty trade expansion agreements have been \n     negotiated without the U.S.\n       Once again, I am requesting that you endorse fast track \n     negotiating authority for the President. Please help support \n     a strong American economy and jobs for the future by \n     supporting fast track.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                David P. Csintyan,\n                                                   Office Manager.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROTH.

Mr. President, at this moment I am filing at the desk four \namendments that at the appropriate time I would make efforts to attach \nto S. 1269, the fast-track legislation.\n  The chairman is on the floor and I would provide him with a packet of \ninformation as it relates to these amendments. None of us yet know the \nfate of fast track or if the House will be able to engender the \nnecessary votes to pass this legislation.\n  Clearly, I think the proper refinement of fast track broadens its \nability to be passed and to become law, and it becomes very important \nto all of us, if that is the case, that it does. I have reservations \nabout giving the President this authority, and yet at the same time I \nhave not stood in the way that the process be expedited to get it to \nthe floor for a vote. But the amendments that I am filing this \nafternoon that I think are important are a product of the frustrations \nthat American producers have experienced as a result of the mid-1980's \nNorth American Canadian Free-Trade Agreement and then, of course, \nNAFTA, the North American Free-Trade Agreement in the early 1990's.\n  One of my amendments deals with the commodity problems that we have \nprimarily in agriculture but also in the forest products industry \nbetween Canada and the United States. The flow of commodity interest is \nlargely one way at this moment, from Canada into the United States--\nlive cattle impacting our markets, grain bypassing through the Canadian \nGrain Board, the protocol of the North American Free-Trade Agreement. \nWe have just had disputes with Canada over poultry and dairy products. \nWe now see a flood of potatoes coming out of Canada, potatoes last year \nthat depressed the United States producer price to almost a historic \nlow level, putting farmers in Idaho, Washington, and Maine in jeopardy.\n  As a result of that, one of my amendments would establish a bilateral \njoint commission to identify and recommend means of resolving national \nregional and provincial trading or trade distortions and differences \nbetween the United States and Canada with respect to the production, \nprocessing and sales of agricultural commodities. I have explained the \nreason why, and if we get\n\n[[Page S11913]]\n\nto the appropriate time I hope that the chairman and the full Senate \nwould look upon that kind of amendment in favorable light.\n  Another amendment that I think certainly the chairman and the Senate \nwould look favorably on is an amendment to enforce the S. 1296 ban on \nextraneous provisions. This amendment would provide effective \nenforcement provisions already in the bill.\n  As reported, S. 1269 prohibits extraneous provisions from being \nincluded in trade agreement bills considered under fast track. The bill \nlimits fast-track trade bill provisions to those necessary or related \nto the implementation of a trade agreement, or not necessary to comply \nwith the Budget Act.\n  This is a major improvement, I think, over previous fast-track \nlegislation. However, S. 1269 currently contains no effective \nenforcement of this provision. Let's remember the North American Free-\nTrade Agreement and what we fell into there. We forced small business \npeople to have to go to computerized methods of accounting and \nwithholding. That was a tax increase, in so many words, that was \ninflicted upon us in a ``take it or leave it'' proposition. What my \namendment would do is prohibit that kind of extraneous material, or any \nhidden tax that might come sneaking through, if you will, in a trade \nagreement of the kind the President would be allowed to negotiate under \nfast track.\n  Also, I have offered an amendment that would require domestic tax \nincreases to be amendable, and that adds to the strength of the \namendment I have just offered.\n  Those are the three. The other one is a clarification of the standard \nfor the importation of firearms. This amendment is aimed at clarifying \ncurrent law and preventing the administration from continuing to abuse \nits trade authority to carry out a political agenda against firearms. \nEven for firearm imports, there needs to be a meeting of a standard and \na test. We think the administration has gone well beyond that.\n  That is the essence of the amendments that I have filed. Depending on \nhow we get to the issue of fast track and what the House is able to do \nin the coming hours could determine our ability here in the Senate to \nperfect or to shape the fast-track agreement.\n  With that, I will file those amendments and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11912-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11913-S11915]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IRS RESTRUCTURING ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nimmediately to H.R. 2767, the IRS Restructuring Act of 1997, just \nreceived yesterday from the House, that the bill be read three times \nand passed, and the motion to reconsider laid on the table.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I hope my colleagues understand this \nlegislation is something that will, by all accounts, today improve the \noperational efficiency of the IRS. It does not address many of the \nissues that were raised by the Senate Finance Committee during its 3 \ndays of hearings and the chairman has indicated he is going to take \nthose up next year. But in the 24 hours since I have offered this \nunanimous-consent resolution there have been 135,000 notices sent to \ntaxpayers asking them to pay additional taxes and over 250,000 phone \ncalls made by taxpayers to the IRS, trying to get information. These \nare the two principal points of contact, of irritation, that taxpayers \nhave brought to us over and over and over.\n  The IRS Commissioner under current law simply does not have the \nauthority to manage the agency. He can't hire and fire his top people, \ncan't provide financial incentives, doesn't have the kind of oversight \nthat's needed and doesn't have the requirement to publish his audit \ndata. All that is kept for the moment confidential.\n  This piece of legislation, passed almost unanimously by the House, \nwould certainly get nearly a unanimous vote here in the Senate as well. \nEverything in this legislation--if you look at it you would say, ``My \ngosh, I'm surprised it isn't done already.'' As I said, every single \nday we wait, another 135,000 or so notices are going to go out to \ntaxpayers that they owe additional taxes; a quarter of a million phone \ncalls are going to be coming into the IRS, and they are not going to be \nmanaged nearly as well.\n  In our own survey we did to determine what was going on out there we \nfound that 70 percent of the people who call in say they get good \nservice from the phone calls, but that means that 3 out of 10 do not \nget good service. They are complaining. They are not getting their \nquestions answered, for those who actually get through: A 25 percent \nerror rate in the current environment, the current paper environment; \nless than 1 percent for electronic filing. The law that we propose, \nthat was passed, as I said, nearly unanimously by the House, provides \nnew incentives and powers to move to electronic filing. I hope my \ncolleagues will understand the urgency of doing this. And what will \nhappen, the price the taxpayers will pay, with a delay.\n  In this morning's papers there were stories about the Speaker saying \nhe was going to try, in one of the conference committees, to get an \namendment accepted that would have the IRS doing something that I can't \nimagine that anybody in this body would support. My guess is, if we \ndiscovered the IRS was doing what the Speaker is saying that he would \nlike the IRS to do, most of us would be out here on the floor speaking \nout against it. He is proposing that the IRS conduct a poll, a 14-\nquestion poll. If you look at questions, you know what the answers are \ngoing to be. ``Do you think your taxes are fair or unfair?''\n  Not only a poll, but every single American taxpayer would be mailed \nunder separate cover this poll. Not only would the taxpayer be mailed \nthe poll, but the poll would also go to post offices, it would go to \npreparers, this poll would go to anybody who has contact with the IRS. \nThe taxpayer then would be asked to fill out the questionnaire and mail \nit--not back to the IRS, but back to the General Accounting Office \nwhere they would be compiled and the results then would be published. \nThe estimate of the costs to do that range from about $30 million up to \n$80 million. If somebody came to the floor today and said guess what, \nthe IRS is doing a $30 to $80 million poll to find out whether or not \nthe American taxpayers think their taxes are fair enough, if the level \nof taxes is fair or not, among other questions, I think it would be a \n100-to-nothing vote to say the IRS cannot do this.\n  So I hope those who are on the Appropriations Committee, when they \nare working in these conferences, will make it clear that the Senate \ndoesn't support asking the IRS to do a $30 to $80 million poll which \nwill increase the caseload and work of the IRS itself, which will cause \ntaxpayers to say, ``My gosh what does this mean?'' call the IRS with \nadditional questions, and will cause people to say, ``I don't know \nwhether I want to mail this back. I am afraid this might produce some \nadverse reaction from the IRS itself.''\n  This will increase complexity. Those who are proposing this have said \nthat it is real simple, ``We will just take it out of customer service, \nwe will take the money out of customer service and it won't cost us \nanything at all.'' Again, can you imagine if somebody came to the floor \nand said, ``Guess what the IRS is doing? They are proposing to spend \n$30 million up to $80 million out of customer service to do a 14-\nquestion poll.'' I can't imagine there wouldn't be 100 Senators down \nhere saying we object to the IRS doing it.\n  This is a case where the Speaker of the House says he may ask the \nconference committee to direct the IRS to do this very thing. Mr. \nPresident, I hope Members, if we hang around here for another 4 or 5 \ndays--given the word that I got that the House is going to vote on fast \ntrack, I guess, tomorrow; we could be here for awhile--every single day \nwe wait, another 130,000 notices go out from the IRS to taxpayers that \nthey owe money, another quarter of a million phone calls are going to \ncome into the IRS, asking the IRS questions. The commonsense \nrecommendations in this piece of legislation are so compelling that \nonly four Members of the House of Representatives voted against it.\n  I believe this legislation would pass very quickly here in the \nSenate. It would set up, in fact, a debate over our tax system and put \nus in a position to be able to enact many of the things the\n\n[[Page S11914]]\n\nchairman of the Finance Committee, the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware, wants to pass. I think it is very difficult to explain to \ntaxpayers back home why we didn't give the Commissioner the legal \nauthority needed to manage his agency in a manner that would enable the \nvoluntary compliance to go up and customer satisfaction to improve as \nwell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, I rise to object to the unanimous-consent \nrequest made by my distinguished colleague, Senator Bob Kerrey. In \ndoing so, let me be clear that I applaud Senator Kerrey's tremendous \nwork and leadership, and I am grateful for the groundwork he and the \ncommission he has chaired have laid in the important effort to reform \nthe Internal Revenue Service.\n  What concerns me, Mr. President, is that the legislation which is \nbeing advocated at this time is--as the Washington Post pointed out--a \nmeasure that has not been subject to the kind of scrutiny and debate \nthat must attend such an important issue. The fact is that Congress \nwill get only one good opportunity to pass necessary and meaningful \nreform to the IRS. The work accomplished by the commission chaired by \nSenator Kerrey and Congressman Portman disclosed a number of \nshortcomings within the agency. A near year-long investigation by the \nSenate Finance Committee and hearings that we held in September \ndisclosed even more issues that need to be addressed. And our on-going \ninvestigation continues to turn up others on what has nearly turned \ninto a daily basis.\n  IRS reform must be complete. It must be accomplished thoughtfully, \nmethodically, thoroughly--with Congress, the administration, and the \ntaxpayers working together. Everyone knows that the last great attempt \nat reform, the King Commission in the 1950's, led to a major overhaul \nof what was then known as the Bureau of Internal Revenue. But within \nonly a few years, the agency was once again whacked by abuse and misuse \nof authority.\n  We need complete reform, Mr. President. This time, we must get it \nright.\n  Among those things that we must analyze and address are:\n  Giving the oversight board--called for in this legislation--the \nauthority to look at audit and collection activities;\n  Insuring that all taxpayers have due process and that the IRS does \nnot abusively use its liens and seizures authority;\n  Making the taxpayer advocate within the agency independent and \nresponsible to the oversight board;\n  Establishing an independent inspector general within the IRS, and \nrequiring the IG--like the taxpayer advocate--to report to the \noversight board;\n  Requiring signatures on all correspondence;\n  Banning the use of false identifications;\n  Banning the use of Bureau of Labor Statistics as a mechanism to \ndetermine taxpayers' income; and,\n  Banning the use of statistics and goals in determining performance of \nIRS employees.\n  Mr. President, each of these represents an area where we need to make \nreform. And the truth is, they are only a sampling of the needed \nchanges that emerged from our first series of hearings. I know that \nthere will be others. They, as well as these, will have to be examined, \ndebated and--where and when appropriate--adopted as part of a major \noverhaul.\n  For these reasons, I object to the unanimous-consent request made by \nSenator Kerrey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the comments of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, the senior Senator \nfrom Delaware. Especially his willingness to hold 3 days of hearings, \npenetrating what is called the 6103 veil, which allows us to see \ninformation that typically is held in secret, in confidence, to protect \nthe taxpayer. These hearings enabled the American people to see abuses \nthat most Americans look at and say: This is objectionable and should \nnot be allowed to continue.\n  I would point out, though, that the board question that the chairman \nraised here, giving the board more authority--the Washington Post \neditorial cited one of the reasons they wanted more hearings was they \nthought the legislation that we had given the board too much authority. \nSo my guess is they would write it, if we gave the board more \nauthority--they would write the committee saying: You better give the \nboard more hearings because you still have it wrong.\n  We had 12 days of hearings in the hearings that Congressman Portman \nof Ohio and I conducted. Thousands of interviews with IRS employees, \nformer Commissioner Richardson supports it, former Commissioner Goldman \nsupports the recommendation, former Treasury Secretary Baker, former \nTreasury Secretary Brady and current Treasury Secretary Rubin--all \nsupport the legislation. All have examined it. We have had a full \nmarkup in the Ways and Means Committee. This may not go as far as some \nwould like, but given the fact that we handle 200 million tax returns, \nindividual and corporate, every single year, it seems to me reasonable \nthat we begin with this board somewhat cautiously.\n  It has significant authority in the development of the strategic \nplan. It has authority to make advisory recommendations on the budget \nas well. It can pass judgment on the performance of the Commissioner \nand make recommendations to the President in regard to the \nCommissioner's actions.\n  We do, in fact, in the amendments that have been agreed to now by 14 \nmembers of the Finance Committee, as the chairman indicated, give the \ntaxpayer advocate the independence needed to be a true effective \nadvocate for the taxpayer. Instead of being an employee of the IRS, the \nadvocate would be able to operate more independently than is currently \nthe case, and many of the changes the chairman has indicated that he \nwould like to do I fully support.\n  What seems to me to be the most compelling question of all is, do you \nwant the new Commissioner of the IRS to have the authority to hire and \nfire senior people, to be able to provide positive financial \nincentives, to be required to disclose what the audit requirements are, \nto have incentives to be able to go to electronic filing, to have the \nlegal authority to be able to comment on tax complexity?\n  All these things are fairly straightforward. I can't imagine anybody \nsaying the IRS Commissioner should not have the authority this \nlegislation gives him to be able to manage the agency. The risks are \nhigh, Mr. President, that in this next filing system, given what we \nhave discovered now by penetrating the 6103 veil, there is a good \nchance we are going to get a decrease in voluntary compliance, with \ncitizens saying it may be a small percentage and, indeed, our \ncommission discovered that it is a relatively small percentage of IRS \nemployees who are abusing the authority and the power that they have. \nBut I can tell you that when the odds are only 4, 5 or 6 percent, that \nis still pretty good odds if it is your tax return, if it is your life, \nif it is your future that is at stake.\n  We risk a lot by delaying, and the people who are going to pay a \nprice, again, are those 130,000 people who every single day are going \nto get a letter in the mail saying, you owe additional taxes, and that \nquarter of a million people who are going to call up every single day \nto the IRS trying to get a question answered.\n  I don't disagree at all with the chairman's identifying some \nadditional things that need to be done, but where we have such broad \nconsensus among Republicans and Democrats, with only four dissenting \nvotes in the House, my guess is in the Senate it would pass nearly \nunanimously as well once people look at the details of this legislation \nand see what it would give new Commissioner Rossotti the authority to \nbe able to do.\n  Again, I don't know how long we are going to be around here, but this \npiece of legislation, if it were taken up in the manner I have \ndescribed, I believe would be passed quickly, would be in conference \nquickly, get it to the President, get his signature and would set up \nnot just the debate that the distinguished chairman of the committee \nhas identified, but also a debate on tax simplicity and other things \nthat ought to be taken up by this body as well as the House.\n  This sets up the debate. It doesn't decrease the opportunity for a \ndebate. It\n\n[[Page S11915]]\n\nmakes it more likely we will have a healthy debate about tax \nsimplicity, about our code and about further changes that need to be \nmade in the IRS in order to make certain that we can close this \nbreathtaking gap that exists today between what the IRS is able to do \nand what the private sector is able to do for that 85 to 90 percent of \nthe American people who are voluntarily willing to comply to pay their \ntaxes, if they can just get one answer, which is: How big is the bill? \nHow much do I owe?\n  It is that question that dictates much of the financial planning that \nAmerican families are doing, and it is a very difficult question to get \nanswered in the current environment. That question would be made much \neasier to answer if we would just take this piece of legislation up, \nenact it and get it on to the President for his signature.\n  Mr. NICKLES addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, our colleague from Nebraska, I think, \nmade the same request yesterday, and maybe some of the same comments \nwere made yesterday. If we didn't have additional ideas to make the \nlegislation better, I would agree with him, because I think the House \npassed some good legislation. I think we can make it better. Chairman \nRoth mentioned a couple things we can do.\n  We had good hearings. Actually, the hearings that promulgated a lot \nof the IRS reforms happened in the Senate, not in the House. Our House \ncolleagues, as the Constitution provides, initiates revenue measures. \nSo they have acted and they have acted promptly. I congratulate \nChairman Archer, who I think does an outstanding job as the chairman of \nthe Ways and Means Committee. The House has done good work and passed a \ngood, bipartisan bill.\n  Likewise, we can do good work in the Senate and pass a bipartisan \nbill. We might do better. We might add and build upon what the House \nhas in their legislation. We heard from a lot of things. Mr. Dolan, the \nacting Commissioner of the IRS, had some suggestions, brought out some \npoints. We had witnesses who talked about IRS abuse. I think we can \nbuild upon some of the changes that the House has advocated and make a \nbetter bill, but it may take a little bit of time to do it. I would \nlike to do it and do it right.\n  Again, I appreciate what our colleague from Nebraska is saying, but I \nwould very much like and happen to agree with the chairman, I think we \nwould be better off if we allow the Finance Committee to mark up the \nlegislation, make some improvements, and pass legislation that, again, \nwill, hopefully, receive bipartisan support and the President's \nsignature as well.\n  Mr. KERREY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. KERREY. Mr. President, I appreciate very much what the \ndistinguished Senator from Oklahoma is saying. We have had many \nconversations. He is cosponsoring the legislation, so I know he wants \nto get this reform enacted. I believe that when we know we can get \nsomething done that will improve the operation of the IRS, we ought to \ndo it.\n  Again, I respectfully say, I think this sets up the basis for further \naction, because it gives the IRS Commissioner the kind of authority \nthat the IRS Commissioner needs to manage the agency. It gives the IRS \nCommissioner authority to say this is what we think the Code is doing \nto the taxpayers, this is what it is costing the taxpayers to comply \nwith the Code we have.\n  I favor rather aggressive reform of the Code. I certainly wouldn't \ncome to the floor and say I don't think we ought to do it until we \nreform the Code. There is lots more that can be done with the IRS, no \ndoubt about it. But I don't think we are ever going to have a single \npiece of legislation that does it all.\n\n  For gosh sakes, we just confirmed a new Commissioner and sent him \nover to run an agency of 115,000 people. Look at the law. The law \ndoesn't give him the authority to manage the agency.\n  It doesn't give him the authority to hire and fire senior people.\n  It doesn't give him the authority to provide positive financial \nincentives so the agency can be run in a better fashion.\n  It doesn't give him legal authority to move expeditiously to \nelectronic filing.\n  It doesn't require the basis of the disclosure of audits. There is a \ncumbersome Freedom of Information Act process with the IRS. It is \nespecially slow and difficult for citizens who are trying to get \ninformation.\n  It doesn't require the establishment of some complexity analysis so \nthat we can make a judgment about whether or not what we are doing is \ngoing to make it harder for the taxpayers to comply.\n  It doesn't require the kind of coordinated oversight that is needed \nwith a public board governing the IRS that will enable us to achieve \nconsensus on a strategic plan.\n  All these things are in there. You look at them and say, ``I can't be \nagainst it.'' There likely will be 100 votes for all the things I just \ndescribed. Why not do it now? It doesn't preclude us from coming back \nnext year and taking further action. All these things I listed will \nimprove benefits to American taxpayers, to those 130,000 every single \nday who are going to receive in the mail a notice that they owe \nadditional taxes, to a quarter of a million who are going to pick up a \nphone and make a phone call and try to get an answer to some question \nthey have.\n  If you look at the law that is being proposed that was passed by the \nHouse by all but four Members, I urge my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle to look at the law and see, for gosh sakes, that this \ndoesn't prevent us from taking action next year, this doesn't prevent \nthe Finance Committee or any other committee from holding hearings and \nconsidering legislation to improve it.\n  All this does is it matches with authority the responsibility that \nthe Commissioner has and will enable, unquestionably enable, the \ncustomers, the taxpayers of the United States of America to get better \nservice than they are currently getting. They are going to pay a price \nfor delaying.\n  The congressional restructuring commission had 12 public hearings, \nthousands of interviews with private sector individuals. This \nlegislation, by the way, has the endorsement of every provider out \nthere of services to payers, as well as the endorsement of the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses.\n  This piece of legislation has been examined from stem to stern by an \nawful lot of people who are now embracing and endorsing the legislation \nand saying that on behalf of the American taxpayers, this piece of \nlegislation, this change in the law for the IRS will make the IRS more \nefficient and make the taxpayers themselves more competent; that not \nonly are they going to get a fair shake, but get a right answer to the \nquestion that they ask.\n  I will be down here again tomorrow if we are still around here, and \nthe next day if we are still around here, and however long it takes. We \ncan conference this thing in a day and get it on to the President. I \nhope Members on the other side will look at this law and begin to ask \nthe question, do we want to change the law this time and come back and \naddress all the other things the distinguished Senators from Delaware \nand Oklahoma said we ought to be doing?\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to \nour veterans as we prepare to celebrate Veterans Day on Tuesday. Each \nday as I drive to work to the U.S. Senate, I cannot help but notice all \nthe beautiful\n\n[[Page S11916]]\n\nmonuments of our Nation's Capital. These monuments were built to honor \ngreat people and great events, and each has its own inspirational story \nto tell. What you will find in each of these stories is that the \ngreatness of our country and of its leaders was founded in the \nwillingness of common men and women, our veterans, to risk their lives \ndefending the principles of right and democracy. Serving both at home \nand on foreign soil, their service must always be remembered.\n  Working in Washington in this great institution of the U.S. Senate \nand among these beautiful monuments frequently reminds me of the \nsacrifices of our veterans. Even outside of Washington, in almost every \ntown across America, there are monuments dedicated to our veterans. I \nurge each American to discover their story, not only from a historical \nperspective, but also through the eyes of the veterans living in their \ncommunities where you will find common men and women who simply did the \nright thing when called upon to do so by their country. Because of \nthem, we live in a world where there is more peace than ever before. \nThey deserve our thanks.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for \nSenate bill 1360, Senator Abraham's Border Improvement and Immigration \nAct introduced November 4. This legislation has already numerous \ncosponsors and is bipartisan in nature.\n  This bill clarifies a provision included in the 1996 Illegal \nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act. Section 110 of \nlast year's immigration law requires the establishment of an automated \nentry and exit control system. While the merits of this provision are \nadmirable, unfortunately, the reality is that this is not a feasible \nconcept.\n  The section would require documentation of every alien entering and \nleaving our country. Can you imagine? To document entry and exit of \nevery foreign national, every alien entering the United States would be \nrequired to hold a visa or passport or some sort of border crossing \nidentification card.\n  In my State alone, Mr. President, Canadians are at our border. We are \nseparated from the rest of the United States by Canada. We enjoy \nrelatively free passage between the two countries as Americans. This \nfacilitates trade and strengthens our historical ties of friendship. To \nrequire the documentation of entry and exit of Canadians would result \nin Canada requesting the same type of consideration. Of course, our \nCanadian neighbors would be forced to wait in long lines. Trade would \nbe disrupted. And it would develop a feeling of distrust. This is \nsimply unacceptable.\n  When former Senator Simpson crafted this immigration reform proposal \nlast year, he did not intend to create a new documentation requirement \nfor our northern neighbors. Rather, the issue he wished to address was \nthe illegal overstay rates of foreign nationals.\n  I cannot agree more that the illegal overstays need to be addressed. \nThe Immigration and Naturalization Service currently cannot provide \naccurate data on overstay rates. However, the answer does not lie in \nrequiring documentation of every alien entering through our land points \nof entry.\n  Section 110, if implemented as is, will only create more headaches \nfor our friends and neighbors attempting to enter the United States and \nslow both trade and commerce that crosses our land border each day. It \nwill do little to address my primary concern about overstay rates and \nsubsequent illegal immigration.\n  For these reasons, I am supporting Senator Abraham's efforts to \ncorrect section 110 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 and exempt land entry border points from \ncollecting a record of arrivals and departures. I hope that my other \ncolleagues join me in cosponsoring S. 1360, the Border Improvement and \nImmigration Act of 1997.\n  Mr. President, I would like to make one more statement, if I may, \nwith the indulgence of my friend from Wyoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11916-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11916-S11917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE TREATY\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. There has been an awful lot of concern relative to the \nissue of global warming, greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide emissions, et \ncetera.\n  This December, representatives of 166 nations are going to meet in \nKyoto, Japan, to broker a new international climate treaty. This treaty \nwill set new emissions controls for carbon dioxide and other greenhouse \ngases.\n  Unfortunately, 130 of the 166 nations, including China, Mexico, and \nSouth Korea, are explicitly exempt from the new emissions controls or \nany new commitments whatsoever. As a consequence, it is my opinion that \nsuch a treaty simply cannot work and will not be ratified by the \nSenate.\n  Even if one favors strong action to curb carbon emissions, there are \nthree key reasons to oppose the approach embodied in the draft treaty.\n  The first reason is, selectively applied emissions limits will harm \nlarge sectors of our economy.\n  Analysts expect even the most modest versions of the treaty to cost \nover a million and a half jobs by the year 2005, along with cumulative \nlosses in gross domestic product exceeding $16 trillion from the year \n2005 to the year 2015.\n  While the President claims the new global climate treaty will not \nharm the economy, the administration abandoned its internal analysis \nafter their economic models predicted disaster --even when rosy \nassumptions were factored in. So bad were the results that the \nadministration refused to even appear at a hearing of our Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee to comment on the treaty's economic \nimpacts.\n  Second, the environmental benefits of this treaty are really \nquestionable, Mr. President.\n  Any treaty without new commitments for developing nations will \nencourage the movement of production, capital, jobs, and emissions from \nthe 36 nations subject to emissions controls to the 130 nations that \nare not.\n  Actual global emissions will not decrease. Only their point of origin \nwill change.\n  Ironically, because of our industrial processes, which are more \nenergy efficient than those found in developing nations, global carbon \nemissions per unit of production would, in my opinion, actually \nincrease. In other words, we would endure economic pain for no \nidentifiable environmental gain.\n  Third, selectively applied emissions controls will doom any climate \ntreaty that contains them.\n  By an overwhelming vote of 95 to 0, this body, the U.S. Senate, \npassed a resolution in July demanding any new climate treaty contain \nnew obligations--new obligations--for developing nations. At the same \ntime, Mr. President, developing nations refuse to sign up to such a \ntreaty. Thus, selectively applied emissions controls have become the \nso-called poison pill that is preventing the world from reasonably \naddressing the climate change issue.\n  So I think it is time to be a bit pragmatic. If we want to keep a new \nclimate treaty from becoming an international embarrassment, we should \nreconsider the rush to Kyoto and expand solutions that really work.\n  What can really work, Mr. President?\n  One is nuclear energy. One is hydropower. For instance, nuclear \nenergy produces roughly a third of our electricity without significant \nemissions of carbon dioxide. Yet, President Clinton's global warming \nexplicitly ignores these sources of virtually carbon-free energy.\n  Even worse, Mr. President, the Clinton administration threatens--and \nhas threatened numerously--to veto any nuclear waste legislation and \ncontinues to consider proposals to tear down hydropower dams, policies \nthat endanger the carbon-free solutions that are in place today, and \ncalls into question the administration's commitment to reduce our \ncarbon emissions in a balanced, responsible manner.\n\n[[Page S11917]]\n\n  We even see the Sierra Club come out against wind power claiming that \nthe windmills are some kind of Cuisinart that decimates the bird \npopulation.\n  What does our President propose?\n  It is rather interesting to reflect on where we are now because he \nhas come almost full circle. The President hints at some vague notion \nof meeting our emissions targets through electricity restructuring, but \nhe is very short on specifics. Perhaps the President is playing to the \nheadlines today, but leaving the details to tomorrow or to the next \nadministration.\n  His proposal is that we, by the year 2008 to 2011, reduce our \nemissions to the level of 1990. Well, where is his administration going \nto be by that time? So they are just putting these things off as \nopposed to coming up with the mechanics that will work.\n  There are, in fact, things that we can do in the context of energy \nrestructuring that can help restabilize our carbon emissions. We have \nhad some 13 hearings on this subject in my committee, the Energy \nCommittee, and we have heard from 120 witnesses. Thus, I am prepared to \nsuggest some of the specifics that the President has not suggested.\n  For example, we can provide for stranded cost recovery of the more \nthan 100 nuclear power reactors that together provide some 22 percent \nof our total electric power generation.\n  We can provide incentives to encourage or require regions to employ a \nmix of carbon-free wind, solar, nuclear, or hydropower adequate to \nachieve a specified carbon-free emissions standard.\n  We can offer a means to certify the claims of power producers who \nwish to market their power to consumers as low-carbon or carbon-free.\n  And we can offer assistance for market-led investments in new \nresearch towards carbon-free or low-carbon energy.\n  There is no shortage of policies we can pursue if we really want to \naddress the issue of carbon emissions. We can be encouraged about \nrecent technology breakthroughs in fuel cell technology, wind energy, \nsolar technologies, and advanced nuclear plant designs.\n  In the end, I think, Mr. President, American ingenuity, technological \ninnovation, and common sense will produce the solutions that the U.N. \nnegotiations thus far have been unable to provide.\n  Finally, Mr. President, we need to employ these new technologies to \nincrease energy efficiency, promote conservation, and stabilize our \ncarbon emissions--but we do not need a flawed treaty that cannot get \nthe job done. The climate issue is serious, but so are issues of \nequity, economic prosperity, and pragmatism.\n\n  During the last round of negotiations at Bonn, the draft treaty got \nworse. It got worse, not better. As a consequence, we need to prepare \nourselves and the American people for the prospect that the new treaty \nwill be unworthy of support, even if you are deeply concerned about the \nincrease of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, as I am. In other words, \nit doesn't do us any good to board a fast train, a fast train that is \ngoing in the wrong direction, particularly if all nations of the world \naren't aboard.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11916-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11917]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about the fast-track bill \nthat is before us. I have followed the debate on this legislation very \nclosely. I have listened to my colleagues discuss at length the issues \nof trade flows, foreign direct investment, the delegation of authority, \nand unfair trade agreements. It has been an interesting debate for this \nfreshman Senator.\n  I want to share with my colleagues the feelings that my constituents \nhave expressed to me. Many of them have deep concerns about our \nprogress on trade. Intense import competition makes them feel as if \nthey have been left behind in the pursuit of fair trade.\n  There is an issue here that is far more important to my constituents \nthan trade, however, but it is inextricably linked to their ability to \ncompete. While the administration vows to fight for fair trade with \nforeign countries, people in Wyoming want this administration to fight \nfor fair regulation in this country. For them, fair trade will not \nstimulate economic growth when their growth is halted by unreasonable \nregulations.\n  It seems that there is a real disconnect in our administration's \npolicies on economic health. While one side of the administration is \npromoting job growth in exports, the other side is shutting down our \nenterprises with overly restrictive environmental regulations.\n  There is an inconsistency here that is difficult to explain to people \nin Wyoming. They do not understand why the administration supports \nexport growth, but allows the Environmental Protection Agency to issue \nand adopt regulations such as the new particulate matter and ozone \nstandards for air quality.\n  How does this relate to the fast-track bill we are debating? It \nconnects in two ways. The first issue is jobs. The purpose of the bill \nbefore us is to promote job growth--which is a good purpose and I \nsupport it. Unreasonable regulatory mandates, however, do not create \njobs. Second, like fast track, environmental regulation is a delegated \nauthority. And in my opinion, it is one delegated authority that is out \nof control.\n  Let me first discuss what is wrong with the standards and how they \nwill destroy jobs. They were formulated and adopted with a disturbing \nlack of scientific consensus; with no accountability; and with a \ngenuine disregard for the real effects they will have on working \npeople.\n  The accuracy of scientific information in the formulation of \nscientific rules is critical for a democracy. Democracies cannot \nsurvive without being able to rely on the precision of their scientific \ninformation. Furthermore, democracies cannot survive when bureaucracies \nare able to impose expensive mandates without any accountability. \nDemocracy depends on representation along with taxation. Bureaucrats \nmust consult with elected representatives before imposing massive costs \non our citizens.\n  With the adoption of these unreasonable standards, the EPA and the \nadministration have failed on both of these counts.\n  There are numerous examples that show a lack of scientific consensus \nin the promulgation of these new air quality standards. The EPA's own \nClean Air Science Advisory Committee, stated that at this point, \n``there is no adequately articulated scientific basis for making \nregulatory decisions concerning a particulate matter National Ambient \nAir Quality Standard.''\n  The administration's National Institute of Environmental Health \nSciences dismissed the EPA's claims about the relationship between \nchildhood asthma and air quality. They observed that the asthma rate in \nPhiladelphia has soared even as that city's air pollution levels have \nplummeted. They also noted that some of the highest asthma rates in the \nworld occur in Australia and New Zealand--two countries with excellent \nair quality.\n  Strangely enough, while the EPA is promulgating expensive rules, \nother agencies have been pushing for economic growth. The U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, the Department of Commerce, the Small Business \nadministration, and the Department of Agriculture--have all advocated \nthe importance of fast track for growth.\n  Even the President has emphasized the need for fast track in terms of \njob creation. He stressed that,\n\n       ``In order for us to continue to create jobs and \n     opportunities for our own people, and to maintain our \n     world leadership, we have to continue to expand exports . \n     . . We have to act now to continue [our] progress to make \n     sure our economy will work for all the American people.''\n\n  Well, I stand here to tell you that unreasonably expensive \nregulations will not make our economy work for all American people. \nAchievements in trade expansion will not overcome the excessive costs \nimposed by regulatory mandates.\n  And the costs are excessive. At first, the EPA estimated the cost \nwould be\n\n[[Page S11918]]\n\nless than $2.5 billion. Then, the President's own Council of Economic \nAdvisors put the price at a considerably higher $60 billion. I have \nseen estimates for the cost as high as $150 billion. That was an amount \nquoted in a Senate Small Business Committee hearing we held earlier \nthis year. I think the difference in magnitude between these \nestimates--$2.5 billion and $150 billion--deeply concerns me, and is--\nin and of itself--a good reason to delay the standards.\n  The disagreement continues. The EPA stated in its regulatory impact \nanalysis that the rules will not have a significant effect on small \nbusinesses. But the Small Business Administration refuted that. The SBA \nconfirmed that, ``Considering the large economic impacts suggested by \nEPA's own analysis, [which] will unquestionably fall on tens of \nthousands, if not hundreds of thousands of small businesses--this would \nbe a startling proposition to the small business community.''\n  It will affect hundreds of thousands of small businesses. Just who \nare we trying to help our trade policy, Mr. President?\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture also raised concerns. They \nhighlighted that EPA's air quality standards ``do not contain detailed \ninformation regarding specific effects on agriculture that may be \ncaused by pollution or that may result from pollution controls.''\n  American agriculture is just beginning to see what is coming down the \npike with regard to clean water standards. We are now taking a close \nlook at how the EPA will be able to enforce ``total maximum daily \nload'' guidelines on streams in my State. This is a big concern for \neveryone who uses water in Wyoming. And we all do.\n  The fact is, the unreasonable environmental regulations destroy \nthousands of U.S. jobs by raising input and compliance costs. In a 1996 \nstudy of regulatory costs, Thomas Hopkins of the Center for the Study \nof American Business, estimated that regulatory mandates already cost \nsmall businesses between $3,000 and $5,500 per employee. The new air \nquality standards will impose an enormous new cost on top of that \nwithout any verification of the benefits.\n  The second connection this issue has to the debate of fast track is \nthe issue of delegated authority. Congress has a responsibility to \nregulate commerce with foreign nations that is derived directly from \nthe Constitution. Fast track delegates that authority to the executive \nbranch.\n  Whether one agrees with the practical need for fast track or not, no \nmember can deny that it is a delegation of congressional \nresponsibility. Our senior Senator from West Virginia, Senator Robert \nByrd, is an expert historian on constitutional law and he has spoken \nvery eloquently and persuasively about this issue and against the fast-\ntrack legislation.\n  I have also heard some very convincing arguments about the necessity \nof fast track. The argument is made that we need a strong voice in our \nmultilateral trade negotiations--a voice that has the authority to back \nup its demands. Whether that is to be believed or not, recent \ndevelopments make me very reluctant to delegate that authority. I have \nalready stated my concerns about EPA's expansive interpretations of its \ndelegated authority--now, we face the prospect that the administration \nwill commit to dangerously unfair commitments in the global warming \ntreaty to be discussed in Kyoto this December.\n  The administration's positions on the global climate change treaty \nare a paramount example of politics over science. There has been no \nscientific consensus on this issue. There has been no proven \nrelationship to show that the climate change treaty would have any \neffect on global temperatures. In fact, there isn't any proof that \nhuman intervention will make a difference.\n  For some reason, however, the administration seems ready to embrace \nan agreement that would wage economic war against our own workers. \nAccording to one independent estimate, complying with U.N. reduction \ntargets for greenhouse gas emissions could cost this country as much as \n$350 billion per year. That is nearly $2,000 for every working \nAmerican.\n  The result will be the loss of 5 million American jobs directly \nrelated to energy use and production and the loss of several million \nmore jobs that are indirectly related. The jobs will simply be \ntransferred overseas--not to countries doing a better job, countries \nthat are doing a worse job--something that is becoming easier and \neasier. It will be particularly easy if developing countries like \nChina, India, Brazil, and Mexico do not impose the same air quality \nstandards on themselves. That is what we are talking about in that \ntreaty.\n  This is not consistent with promoting economic growth. Furthermore, \nthere is no scientific consensus. Most importantly it is unfair. \nPersonally, these circumstances make me very hesitant to support fast \ntrack and to restrict my ability to modify agreements entered into by \nthis administration.\n  I cannot rationalize giving the Administration the authority to \nnegotiate agreements with other countries when they refuse to negotiate \ndomestic regulations with Congress.\n  Before I close, I want to stress that I understand the importance of \ntrade agreements. I understand that Americans have much to gain by \nreducing foreign barriers. I do believe fast track is necessary for \npractically negotiating multilateral agreements.\n  I want to point out, however, that many of my constituents in the \nState of Wyoming have grave reservations about expanding NAFTA. Two of \nthe largest sectors of Wyoming's economy, agriculture and energy, are \nin direct competition with Canadian producers. While our Nation as a \nwhole stands to benefit from increased market access in Europe, South \nAmerica, and Asia--my constituents need attention focused on unfair \nimport competition from NAFTA.\n  This problem is most apparent in our northern tier States. The \nSenator from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, has clearly presented the \nunfair practices faced by our wheat and barley growers. United States \nfood manufacturers import over $200 million per year in Canadian \nwheat--nearly all of which is sold by the Canadian state trading board.\n  Cattle imports from Canada have also flooded our market. While \nnational meat import levels have remained fairly stable, live imports \nfrom Canada into the Northern States have increased by over 100 percent \nsince 1994. They have been especially unwelcome in a buyers' market \nthat is saturated by oversupply and restricted by packer concentration. \nThese Canadian imports exacerbated prices that were already down by \nover 40 percent.\n  Most recently, the independent oil producers in my State, who already \nface stringent regulations and substantial Federal taxation, are now \ncompeting with 130,000 barrels per day of Canadian crude that is being \npumped into the region through a new pipeline. Wyoming's posted sour \ncrude prices have plummeted from over $19 per barrel in 1996 to just \n$14 per barrel this year.\n  Needless to say, many of my Wyoming constituents feel they are \ngetting the raw end of free trade. Most of them are people who deeply \nbelieve in fair and open trade, but they have real reservations about \nexpanding agreements they don't feel are fair.\n  I will conclude by stressing that it is good for the administration \nto set its sights on foreign markets, but they must also pay attention \nto what is happening at home. There is no reason to open up foreign \nmarkets while you are closing down your businesses by strangling them \nwith regulations.\n  We need to inject a standard of reasonableness in our environmental \npolicy. The issues of job growth, trade, and domestic regulation are \nlinked. I would like to see more consistency in our policy on economic \ngrowth.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of \nlow-level waste in this country and the issue of Ward Valley. \nCalifornia is the first State to site a low-level waste facility under \nlegislation passed by Congress which granted States with the authority \nand responsibility for low-level waste. Low-level radioactive waste is \nproduced from cancer treatments, medical research, industrial \nactivities, and scientific research. In the\n\n[[Page S11919]]\n\nState of California there are some 800 sites where this medical waste \nis being stored. It is being stored in temporary facilities that were \nnot designed for permanent storage.\n  This waste is stored near homes, schools, it's stored at college \ncampuses, medical facilities, and so forth.\n  This radioactive waste is vulnerable to accidental release from the \nfires and earthquakes, neither of which are uncommon in California.\n  Public health and safety demands that this waste be moved from \nlocations scattered across California to a single, monitored location--\npreferably, in a remote and sparsely populated area.\n  The State of California is the first State to take advantage of the \nFederal process that we authorized for the States to develop their own \nlow-level waste sites. But it is interesting to note how the progress \nhas gone--not because of the lack of commitment by California, but the \nlack of cooperation from the Department of Interior to simply conduct a \nvery simple land exchange.\n  The State of California, in a process which began a decade ago, is \ntrying to get their facility opened. They selected a site known as Ward \nValley in the remote Mojave Desert.\n  The California license was issued in accordance with all State and \nFederal laws, and has withstood all court challenges. The license \ncontains 130 specific conditions designed to protect public health, \nsafety, and the environment.\n  But here comes the villain--the Department of Interior--having \nearlier agreed to sell California the land for the site--changed its \nmind, returned the check, and has refused to transfer the land.\n  Since that time, the Department of the Interior has engaged in \ncontinuous, purposeful delay. They seek more studies, allegedly to \nassure that the site will be safe.\n  We all insist on a safe disposal site, and we expect no less. Thus \nfar, we have had two environmental impact studies and a special \nNational Academy of Science study that all point to the safety of the \nsite.\n  Now, the State of California, in accordance with the guidelines of \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission and all applicable State and Federal \nlaws, has done its job and done it well. But the Interior Department is \nstill not satisfied. They want more studies. For starters, they insist \non an additional water infiltration study and a third impact \nenvironmental statement.\n  The State of California has generously agreed to perform the water \ninfiltration study prior to any land transfer which was a tremendous \nconcession on California's part. However, Interior has not thus far \nallowed California access to the land to conduct the very tests that \nInterior insists upon. Instead of working to resolve the matter, the \nDepartment of the Interior seems to be engaged in a cycle of continuous \nstudy and endless delay. One has to wonder why the Department of the \nInterior is taking such a tack.\n  Are these delays and demands for more tests designed to assure public \nsafety? Or are they merely part of a carefully orchestrated public \nrelations campaign? Well, we can answer that question.\n  Several weeks ago, a memo we uncovered from the Department of the \nInterior shed an extraordinary light on this question. In fact, this \nmemo makes the motivations behind the Interior Department's actions \nabsolutely clear.\n  I have read this memorandum once on the floor of this body. I think \nit needs to be read again. This is a memo from Deputy Secretary John \nGaramendi, to Secretary Bruce Babbitt, Department of the Interior. It \nis short enough to read in its entirety.\n\n  It says:\n\n       February 21, 1996\n       Memorandum\n       To: Bruce Babbitt\n       From: John Garamendi\n       Subject: Ward Valley\n       Attached are the Ward Valley clips. We have taken the high \n     ground. [Governor Pete] Wilson is the venal toady of special \n     interests.\n       I do not think GreenPeace will picket you any longer. I \n     will maintain a heavy PR campaign until the issue is firmly \n     won.\n\n  There you have the words of John Garamendi relative to his \nwillingness to work with California to act in order that the low-level \nwaste at some 800 sites in California can be removed and put in one \narea that will be monitored out in the Mojave Desert.\n  I think this memorandum shows that Ward Valley has become a political \nfootball, a public relations issue. It also suggests that Interior has \nno plans other than to delay the transfer of the land. They just want \nto wage a PR campaign and delay a decision until somebody else's watch. \nThey don't want to make this decision on their watch. They are putting \nit off because they know this administration is a few years from \nbecoming history. They don't want to address it, they don't want the \nresponsibility.\n  But what has Secretary Garamendi told the Senate with regard to Ward \nValley? How do his private statements compare to his public ones?\n  At his confirmation hearing on July 27, 1995, John Garamendi \ntestified under oath to our committee that the Ward Valley issue should \nand would be resolved quickly. Two years later, at a hearing on July \n22, 1997, John Garamendi told the committee that he would work in good \nfaith to resolve the matter in further negotiations with the State of \nCalifornia.\n  Well, we still don't have a resolution. California does not even have \npermission to do the additional testing Interior seems to want to see \nperformed.\n  Instead of moving a process forward and transferring the land, \nInterior seems intent on waging a public relations campaign designed to \nfurther delay rather than enlighten.\n  Now, what have others said about the Interior Department's handling \nof this issue? Let's look at the experts.\n  The General Accounting Office, GAO, contends that the Department of \nthe Interior is attempting to assess the site's suitability--a job that \nbelongs to California by law and that California has already undertaken \nand completed--despite the fact that Interior ``lacks the criteria and \nexpertise'' for the job. That is the opinion of the General Accounting \nOffice--that Interior lacks the criteria and expertise.\n  The GAO report also contends that there is no need for the new \nenvironmental impact statement sought by Interior since the substantive \nissues have already been addressed and that new information uncovered \nsince the last environmental impact statement is generally favorable to \nthe facility.\n  Well, this report is too lengthy to insert into the Record, but for \nthe benefit of my colleagues, I am referring to GAO report RCED-97-184, \ndated July 1997, for anybody who might want to look it up.\n  To again summarize what GAO says, Mr. President, it says: First, \nInterior is trying to do a job that belongs to the State of California. \nThe State of California was given the authority to do it; second, \nInterior is calling for new studies that aren't needed; third, Interior \nlacks the technical expertise to even perform these tasks.\n  GAO isn't alone in their criticism of the Department of Interior's \nhandling of this issue. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, NRC, has \njoined in the process as well.\n  Specifically, the NRC has been critical of the Interior Department \nfor distributing fact sheets which contain errors, misleading \nstatements, and information falsely attributed to the NRC that was \nactually provided by project opponents.\n  That is pretty strong stuff, Mr. President, but that is factual.\n  So not only is Interior waging a PR campaign, they are playing fast \nand loose with the truth in the conduct of that campaign, according to \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the Chairman of the NRC \nto the Secretary of the Interior, dated July 22, 1997, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Nuclear\n\n\n                                        Regulatory Commission,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 1997.\n     Hon. Bruce Babbitt,\n     Secretary, U.S. Department of Interior, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Babbitt: I am writing on behalf of the U.S. \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to share our views \n     related to the Department of Interior's (DOI) actions \n     regarding the proposed Ward Valley low-level radioactive \n     waste (LLW) disposal facility in California. In February \n     1996, DOI announced that it would prepare a second supplement \n     to an environmental impact statement (SEIS) for the transfer \n     of land from the Federal government to the State of \n     California, for the development of the Ward Valley\n\n[[Page S11920]]\n\n     low-level radioactive waste (LLW) disposal facility. We \n     understand that DOI has identified 13 issues that it believes \n     need to be addressed in the SEIS. DOI also stated that it \n     would not make a decision on the land transfer until the SEIS \n     was completed. NRC will actively serve as a ``commenting \n     agency'' on the SEIS in accordance with the Council of \n     Environmental Quality regulations in 40 CFR 1503.2, ``Duty To \n     Comment.'' NRC's interest in the Ward Valley disposal \n     facility is focused on protection of public health and \n     safety, and many of the 13 issues to be addressed in the SEIS \n     are related to our areas of expertise. As a commenting \n     agency, we will review the draft SEIS, and provide comments \n     based on the requirements in federal law and regulations, and \n     our knowledge of policy, technical, and legal issues in LLW \n     management. We would also be available to discuss these \n     issues with DOI, both before and after publication of the \n     draft SEIS.\n       On a related matter, it is our understanding that Deputy \n     Secretary John Garamendi of DOI held a press conference on \n     July 22, 1996, addressing the effect of Ward Valley facility \n     availability on the use of radioisotopes in medicine and \n     medical research. It was recently brought to our attention \n     that DOI distributed a document entitled, ``Medical, \n     Research, and Academic Low Level Radioactive Waste (LLRW) \n     Fact Sheet'' at the press conference. This Fact Sheet \n     contains several errors and statements that may mislead the \n     reader. To assist DOI, we have addressed these errors and \n     statements in the enclosure to this letter. Some of the \n     points contained in the Fact Sheet are useful and contribute \n     to the dialogue on this issue; however, NRC is concerned that \n     some of the subjective information of the document is \n     characterized as factual. We are particularly concerned by \n     the statement that the NRC definition of LLW ``. . . is an \n     unfortunate and misleading catch-all definition  . . .'' In \n     fact, NRC's definition is taken from Federal law, \n     specifically the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of \n     1980, and the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments \n     Act of 1985 (LLRWPAA). Additionally, it is NRC's view that \n     some of the information that was referenced or relied on \n     in the Fact Sheet may not represent a balanced perspective \n     based on facts. For example, a table of the sources and \n     amounts of radioactive waste that is projected to go to \n     the Ward Valley facility is erroneously attributed to NRC, \n     the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), U.S. Ecology, the \n     Southwestern Compact, and the Ward Valley EIS. Raw data \n     from the sources quoted appear to have been interpreted \n     based on uncertain assumptions about future activities of \n     generators to produce the figures in the table. \n     Additionally, NRC noted that the figures in the table are \n     identical to those in a March 1994 Committee to Bridge the \n     Gap report.\n       With respect to the relationship between LLW disposal \n     policy and medicine and medical research, we note that the \n     National Academy of Sciences Board on Radiation Effects \n     Research has prepared a Prospectus for a study entitled, \n     ``The Impact of United States Low-Level Radioactive Waste \n     Management Policy on Biomedical Research.'' The study would, \n     among other things, ``Evaluate the effects of higher disposal \n     costs and on-site storage on the current and future \n     activities of biomedical research, including the effects of \n     state non-compliance [with the LLRWPAA of 1985] on \n     institutions conducting biological and biomedical research \n     and on hospitals where radioisotopes are crucial for the \n     diagnosis and treatment of disease.'' Thus, the issue of \n     medical uses of radioisotopes and how they have been affected \n     by the Ward Valley process is far less clear than the Fact \n     Sheet portrays.\n       Finally, since there are no formal arrangements that permit \n     NRC to review and comment on the technical accuracy of \n     various DOI documents on LLW and Ward Valley, we may not be \n     aware such documents exist, thus the absence of NRC comments \n     does not imply an NRC judgment with respect to the technical \n     accuracy or completeness of such documents.\n       I trust our comments will be helpful in your efforts to \n     address Ward Valley issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Shirley Ann Jackson.\n       Enclosure: As stated.\n\n  NRC Staff Comments on the Department of Interior ``Fact Sheet'' \\1\\\n\n       1. The Fact Sheet contains a projection of LLW to be sent \n     to the Ward Valley disposal facility over its 30-year life, \n     and attributes the table to the Department of Energy, the \n     U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Southwestern Compact, \n     U.S. Ecology, and the Ward Valley environmental impact \n     statement. In fact, the figures in the table are identical to \n     those in a table from a March 1994 Committee to Bridge the \n     Gap report, are substantially different from California \n     projections, and are based on assumptions that are not \n     identified. The actual assumptions used are contained in the \n     Committee to Bridge the Gap report and minimize the amount \n     and importance of the medical waste stream.\n       2. The Fact Sheet is incomplete in that it provides only \n     anecdotal evidence of the impact of not having the Ward \n     Valley disposal facility available to medical generators. \n     Although its arguments about short-lived radionuclides appear \n     to be generally true, the Fact Sheet downplays the effects on \n     generators that use longer-lived radionuclides. According to \n     the Fact Sheet, there are an estimated 53 research hospitals \n     in California, out of some 500 hospitals overall. The Fact \n     Sheet describes the impact at three of these research \n     organizations and concludes that they can manage their waste, \n     either by disposing of it at an out-of-state facility \n     (Barnwell or Envirocare), storing it, or, for sealed sources, \n     sending them back to the manufacturer. The Fact Sheet \n     concludes that there is no health and safety impact from the \n     approach, but does not address broader issues such as the \n     continued availability of existing disposal sites as an \n     option, and the fact that transferring a sealed source to a \n     manufacturer does not eliminate the problem, but simply \n     shifts it from one organization to another.\n       3. The Fact Sheet does not address the more complex issues \n     concerning use of radioisotopes in medicine, such as how \n     medical research in general has been affected by issues such \n     as disposal and storage cost increases, and the need to \n     switch from longer-lived radionuclides to short-lived \n     nuclides or non-radioactive materials. The National Academy \n     of Sciences Board on Radiation Effects Research has prepared \n     a Prospectus for a study entitled ``The Impact of United \n     States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Management Policy on \n     Biomedical Research.'' The study would, among other things, \n     ``Evaluate the effects of higher disposal costs and on-site \n     storage on the current and future activities of biomedical \n     research, including the effects of state noncompliance on \n     institutions conducting biological and biomedical research \n     and on hospitals where radioisotopes are crucial for the \n     diagnosis and treatment of disease.'' Thus, the issue of \n     medical uses of radioisotopes and how they have been affected \n     by the Ward Valley process is far less clear than the Fact \n     Sheet portrays.\n       4. The Fact Sheet characterizes the NRC definition of LLW \n     in 10 CFR Part 61 as ``unfortunate and misleading'' because \n     it includes both long-lived and short-lived radionuclides. It \n     fails to acknowledge that this definition is contained in \n     Federal law (the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of \n     1980 and the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Amendments \n     Act of 1985) and that information on the kinds and amounts of \n     radionuclides contained in LLW for land disposal is widely \n     available in NRC regulations and/or NUREGS, and from DOE. In \n     developing Part 61 in the early 1980s. NRC sought public \n     comment on the proposed rule, and provided extensive \n     information on the assumptions, analyses, and proposed \n     content of the regulation for review. In developing the \n     regulations for LLW, including how different classes are \n     defined, NRC received and considered extensive public input. \n     Four regional workshops were held, and 107 persons commented \n     on the draft rulemaking, for 10 CFR Part 61, which defines \n     LLW. In short, NRC encouraged public involvement in \n     developing the definition of, and defining the risk \n     associated with, LLW.\n       The Fact Sheet focuses on the half-life of radionuclides, \n     but fails to discuss risk to the public from the effects of \n     ionizing radiation and how they are affected by the half-life \n     of radionuclides. Public health and safety is measured in \n     terms of risk, not half-life. Risk is a function of radiation \n     dose, and the determination of risk depends on a variety of \n     factors, including the type of radiation emitted, the \n     concentration of radionuclides in the medium in which they \n     are present, the likelihood that barriers isolating the \n     radionuclides will be effective, and the likelihood of \n     exposure if radioactive materials are not fully contained. \n     The Fact Sheet is misleading when it states that the half-\n     life of I \\123\\ used in medicine is 13 hours, and that of I \n     \\129\\ from nuclear power plants is 16 million years and that \n     it remains hazardous for 160-320 million years. Either \n     isotope can be a risk to the public, depending upon the other \n     factors discussed above, and half-life by itself does not \n     indicate risk.\n       5. In the definition section, the Fact Sheet defines \n     ``radioactive half-life'' as ``The general rule is that the \n     hazardous life of a radioactive substance is 10-20 times its \n     half-life.'' This definition contains a new term (hazardous \n     life) not used by the national or international health \n     physics or radiation protection communities, and not defined \n     in the Fact Sheet.\n     \\1\\ ``Medical, Research, and Academic Low Level Radioactive \n     Waste (LLRW) Fact Sheet.'' U.S. Department of Interior, \n     Office of the Deputy Secretary. Distributed at a press \n     conference of the Deputy Secretary on July 22, 1996.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, you might ask, why would a Senator from \nAlaska even care about a facility in California that is not needed to \ndispose of radioactive waste generated in Alaska? We don't generate \nhardly any.\n  Part of the answer involves my responsibilities as the chairman of \nthe Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, and our oversight \nresponsibilities. Not surprisingly, my position on Ward Valley is the \nsame one taken by my predecessor as chairman, Bennett Johnston of \nLouisiana. He understood, as I do, that Ward Valley is really more than \na debate over the future of a thousand acres of land in the Mojave \nDesert; it is more than a debate over the disposition of low-level \nradioactive waste in California, Arizona, and the Dakotas; it is even \nmore than the debate over the viability or even the future of the Low-\nLevel Radioactive\n\n[[Page S11921]]\n\nWaste Policy Act. I suggest there is much more at stake.\n  I am taking on this battle because there is an intrinsic value in \nopposing the careless disregard of science and the decisionmaking \nprocess. It's important to stand up against those who engage in this \ndangerous manipulation of public fear. It is my job to work against the \noppression of the public good by a vocal few. Because I very much care \nabout human health, safety and the environment, I believe it makes \nsense to store this radioactive low-level waste at a single, monitored \nlocation in the desert, rather than at 800-some locations throughout \nCalifornia, near schools, neighborhoods, hospitals, medical centers, \nand so forth.\n  Finally, I believe it is important to ensure that the Government \nkeeps its promises. It was the intent of Congress, when it passed the \nLow-Level Waste Policy Act of 1980, and further amended it in 1985, \nthat the safe management of low-level radioactive waste would be a \nresponsibility of the States. That is precisely what the Secretary of \nthe Interior, Bruce Babbitt, lobbied for when he was Governor. He \nargued that low-level waste should be a State responsibility. At that \ntime, he was serving with the now President, but then Governor, Bill \nClinton in the National Governors' Association. Well, he has changed \nhis position.\n  I know the view from the top floor of the Department of the Interior \nchanges one's perspective from time to time, but it's difficult to \nappreciate, much less justify, the actions of the Department in this \nregard.\n  Are the continuing delays at Ward Valley the good-faith actions of \npublic officials purporting to act in the public interest? I think not.\n  To answer those questions, I am announcing today that we are going to \nexplore, in great detail on the committee, the Ward Valley issue in the \nnext session, with a series of investigatory oversight hearings. What \nwe are attempting to obtain, obviously, are the facts on why this \nadministrative bungling seems to continue. I would like all who have an \ninterest in this issue to be aware that these hearings will commence \nearly in the next session.\n  In the interim, we will be seeking relevant documentation from the \nDepartment of the Interior and the White House. With that notice given, \nI thank you, Mr. President, and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to share with my \ncolleagues a little oversight on an issue that will be coming before \nthis body again, and it covers the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine \nacquisitions taking place in both California and Montana. I have the \nobligation as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to \ninitiate authorization of these matters. I have had an active interest \nin the decisions of the Clinton administration to acquire the \nHeadwaters Forest in northern California, and the New World Mine Site \nin Montana.\n  These decisions were made by the administration with little \ncongressional involvement and the administration has now gone out of \nits way to, in my opinion, limit the role of Congress in how these \nproperties actually are acquired.\n  Originally, the administration proposed acquiring both of these \nproperties through land exchanges. When that proved to be very \ndifficult and impossible to do without going through Congress, the idea \nof land exchanges was abandoned. So clearly the objective was to \ncircumvent Congress.\n  The Clinton administration then proposed using $315 million from the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund to purchase both of these properties.\n  The administration then insisted, contrary to the provisions of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund Act, that such money could be spent \nwithout specific congressional authorization, clearly intending to go \naround Congress.\n  Ultimately, that argument failed. While I would have preferred to \nenact separate authorizing legislation, authorizations were contained \nwithin the 1998 Interior Appropriations bill.\n  However, the authorizations do not take effect and the money cannot \nbe spent until a minimum of 180 days after enactment, and then only if \nno separate authorizing legislation is enacted.\n  During the 180-day review period, as chairman of the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, I intend to conduct a series of oversight \nhearings to examine the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine \nacquisitions. One focus of these oversight hearings will be the \nappraised value of the properties. To date the Clinton administration \nhas refused to conduct appraisals to determine fair market values. This \nfailure is in direct contradiction of existing law, which requires the \nappraisals be conducted for any Federal land acquisition. The \nappropriators had the foresight, of course, to recognize this \nhypocrisy.\n  Fair market value appraisals for both properties must be submitted to \nCongress within 120 days of enactment. The appraisals also must be \nreviewed, and independently analyzed by the Comptroller General of the \nUnited States.\n  Once these appraisals are completed, I intend to closely examine \nthem. I plan to look at the methodology and data used in the \nappraisals. Among the specific questions, I will ask:\n  Do the appraisals comply with the Department of Justice's Uniform \nAppraisal Standards for Federal Land Acquisitions?\n  What criteria were employed to determine fair market value?\n  What assumptions were made about the property and the use of the \nproperty?\n  What was the scope of the appraisal?\n  It is important to remember that neither the Headwaters Forest nor \nNew World Mine acquisitions can proceed, absent these appraisals. So \nthese appraisals must be done.\n  Further, Congress will have, at a minimum, 60 days to examine the \nappraisals. For every day, after 120 days, that appraisals are not \nsubmitted to Congress, the 180 day period will be extended by 1 day.\n  I also intend to examine during the 180 day review period, the true \ncost to the American taxpayer of the Headwaters Forest acquisition. A \ncondition to the Headwaters Forest acquisition is that the current \nowner of the property can take on his Federal taxes, as a business \nloss, the difference between what he contends is the property's fair \nmarket value and the price the Federal Government and California are \npaying for the property. That differential is $700 million.\n  In the event the owner receives such a ruling from the IRS, there \nwill be a lost of tax revenue to the Federal treasury. This lost tax \nrevenue could amount to $100 million or more. It is inaccurate to say \nthat the Headwaters Forest is costing the American taxpayer $250 \nmillion. It could well cost the American taxpayer not only the $250 \nmillion cash purchase price but also this lost tax revenue. Under no \ncircumstances should this total cost exceed the appraised value of the \nHeadwaters Forest.\n  As to the New World Mine acquisition, I intend to examine exactly \nwhat land or interests in the land the Federal Government is acquiring \nfor $65 million from the mining company. This issue needs to be \nexamined because the agreement, committing the United States to buy \nthis property, incredibly does not answer this question.\n  The mining company, which agreed to sell, owns or has under lease, \ninterests in nearly 6,000 acres. However, the mining company has fee \ntitle to only 1,700 acres. The remainder is unpatented mining claims. \nThe ownership situation is further complicated by the fact that most of \nthe interests in the 6,000 acres are owned by a third party not a \nsignatory to the agreement with the Federal Government. Congress, and \nthe American taxpayer, have\n\n[[Page S11922]]\n\na right to know, what we are getting for $65 million.\n  There are many other issues that my committee will examine about \nthese acquisitions including:\n  What is the status of the Habitat Conservation Plan for the land \nsurrounding the Headwaters Forest?\n  What impact will that Habitat Conservation Plan have on other \nproperty owners in the western United States and Pacific Northwest?\n  Has California come up with its $130 million share of the purchase \nprice for the Headwaters Forest?\n  Do both acquisitions comply with the terms of the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act?\n  How will the properties be managed?\n  By whom?\n  At what cost?\n  How will the public access the Headwaters Forest?\n  Is it good public policy to settle constitutional takings cases \nagainst the United States in this manner?\n  Is it good public policy to settle environmental litigation in this \nmanner?\n  How does the Clinton administration interpret the phrase ``priority \nFederal land acquisitions?''\n  Are the Headwaters Forest and New World Mine acquisitions consistent \nwith the Federal land management policy on Federal land acquisitions?\n  While this may seem like an exhaustive list of issue, I only have \nskimmed the surface of the numerous unanswered questions about the \nacquisitions.\n  I want all of these questions answered before the acquisitions occur. \nIt is in the interest of the taxpayers. It is the responsibility of \nthis body.\n  My goal is to ensure, despite the uncommon circumstances which have \nled us to this point, that Congress and the American people can have \nconfidence in the decisions to acquire the Headwaters Forest and the \nNew World Mine in the interest of the taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see several Senators seeking \nrecognition, including the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

And it was accepted on \na voice vote. Senators were aware of what was being discussed. But in a \ndesire to be totally fair and making sure the proper notification was \ngiven, and to have opposition on the floor when action of that nature \nis taken, Senator Inhofe has been willing to agree to vitiate that \naction at this time. I thank him for his cooperation.\n  This is a very important issue which will be debated in the Senate \nand which should be considered by the Senate. It is an issue that has \nsupport and opposition on both sides of the aisle. Senator Inhofe \ncertainly is very committed to having this subject considered by the \nSenate either later on this year or next year.\n  Again, I reiterate my thanks to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11922-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senate now \nis in a position to consider the Amtrak reform bill. The bill would \nthen be agreed to after brief debate.\n  The Senate would then conduct a rollcall vote on the nomination of \nJudge Christina Snyder.\n  Following the confirmation vote, it is my hope that the District of \nColumbia appropriations bill will be ready to be considered.\n  Therefore, votes will occur with the first vote occurring at \napproximately 2:15 today.\n  I thank all Senators who have been involved in these other two bills, \nand we will update them further with information as to when votes may \noccur. It is possible that another vote will occur this afternoon. But \nit depends on action in the other body with regard to the \nappropriations conference reports.\n  Mr. DASCHLE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, let me thank the majority leader for his \nefforts over the last 24 hours.\n  I also thank the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Obviously, Democratic Senators need to be on the floor to voice their \nopposition and to object on the occasions when situations like this \narise. We also have to work with good faith, and we intend to do that.\n  There is no reason why we need to be monitoring each other if we are \nworking in good faith. I think this is a misunderstanding. I appreciate \nvery much the cooperation. And we will work with the majority leader to \nensure that at some point we have a good debate about the matter that \nwould be addressed by the Inhofe amendment. We will work on this matter \nin the future.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I want the majority leader to be aware that I did consult \nwith several Democrats and Republicans before taking up the amendment. \nBut I am happy to do this.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Very good.\n  Again, Mr. President, let me just say that we have a lot of work to \ndo. I look forward to working with the majority leader in the next 48 \nhours to see if we can complete it. I am pleased that we are now able \nto move to the Amtrak bill, and nominations. We can do that, and then \nmove on to other things.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11922-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11922]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--NOMINATION OF CHRISTINA A.

Mr. President, before we move to the Amtrak legislation, I \nwant to say for the information of all Senators--and I will have more \nto say about this when we have a recorded vote at 2:15. I think at that \ntime we should take the time to talk about the schedule for the \nremainder of the day and perhaps Saturday and Sunday.\n  It is our intent to stay and continue working. I don't see the \nnecessity for us to be late tonight. But we will be back in on \nSaturday, and again on Sunday. We hope that we will have appropriations \nconference reports, possibly the first one being the Labor-HHS \nappropriations conference report, perhaps even later on today or \ntomorrow, and the Commerce-State-Justice conference report we hope to \nhave by tomorrow, and, if not then, on Sunday.\n  We will continue to work on other issues, some of which may require \nvotes, even on the Executive Calendar. And then when the House votes, \nof course, we would then proceed to act on fast track after the House \nhas acted. Whether that is Saturday or Sunday now is not clear. But the \nHouse has postponed their action on fast track today. So that will not \nbe taken up until Saturday or Sunday.\n  So we could be voting on fast track--perhaps on final passage--later \non this weekend. But, in the meantime, of course, when we complete \nthese intervening actions, we will go back to fast track as it is now \npending before the Senate, and amendments will be in order, and other \namendments I am sure will be offered. We will consult with the \ninterested parties about how to proceed on those amendments and what \ntime votes would occur.\n\n[[Page S11923]]\n\n  But, again, I think that during the remainder of the day it is very \nlikely that we will have a minimum of two votes, and maybe even three \nor four.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11922-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11923]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 738\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to consideration of Calendar No. 179, S. 738.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be \nwithdrawn, and I understand Senator Hutchison has a substitute \namendment at the desk, and I would ask for its consideration.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I only do \nso at the request of Senators Kerry and Lautenberg, that they be given \n10 minutes each at some point following the introduction of the \namendment and comments made by Senators McCain and Hutchison.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I don't know if we should at this time get \nconsent in that we would have that time. I think they will have it and \nmaybe more if they would like to have it, and we should not and will \nnot complete the discussion on it until the Senators have been involved \nin working out this compromise are in the Chamber.\n  I would like to say if I could at this point, I thank the chairman of \nthe committee of jurisdiction, Senator McCain, for his persistence on \nthis matter, and Senator Hutchison, who is chairman of the \nsubcommittee, for her efforts in bringing about this compromise. \nSenator Kerry from the committee as well as Senator Breaux have worked \nvery hard in developing this compromise.\n  I have been involved in this effort now for 3 years, having served as \nchairman of the subcommittee in the previous Congress. I think it is \nvery important that we get fundamental reform of Amtrak so that Amtrak \nat least will have a chance to be able to provide good service and do \nit without depending on continuing subsidies from the Federal \nGovernment forever. They should be able to turn a profit, and I think \nthis legislation will make that possible. They should be able to \ncontract outwork. They should be able to advertise. There are so many \nbasic private sector things that they could do and should have been \ndoing before now that would allow them to actually make a profit so \nthat we can keep a national rail passenger system. We need a passenger \nsystem that serves all the country, not just the eastern seaboard, and \nthis is a major step in that direction.\n  I want to emphasize, though, too, this is required in order to get \nthe $2.3 billion that was fenced in the budget agreement for capital \nimprovements. And those funds are only for capital improvements, not \nfor operating subsidies, makeup of shortfalls in the past or salaries. \nThat is not included in this legislation.\n  I think we have a good bill. After trying to move it for 2 years, I \nam delighted that the work of a lot of Senators including the Senators \nhere now in the Chamber and others that will be here momentarily will \nmake this possible. I don't want to delay it any longer for fear \nsomebody might have a good idea of one word that might be added.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, at the risk of delaying and only to do \nwhat the majority leader has just done, I think the Senators who have \nworked on this as hard and as long as they have do deserve the \ncommendation just given them not only on that side of the bill but ours \nas well. The Senators have done an extraordinary job, and I only wish \nthere were more occasions when on a bipartisan basis we could see this \nkind of leadership and effort put forth. This is a tribute to their \neffort, and I think a very successful one and I think as a result we \nare going to see an overwhelming vote on this legislation as we should \nand I appreciate very much their efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do want to add, and Senator Daschle will \nwant to add, the fact that the ranking member on the committee, Senator \nHollings, also has been involved in this for quite some time, and he \nhas been helpful in bringing it to this conclusion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I certainly would add that Senator Hollings, in fact, \nwas the last person to sign off on this legislation as is \nunderstandable. We appreciate very much the early and perpetual effort \nhe makes on Amtrak matters, and certainly he deserves that recognition \nas well.\n  I thank the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Was there an objection to the request from the \nDemocratic leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. I believe the Chair did not hear objection.\n  There was not an objection from the Democratic leader on that \nunanimous consent request to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the \nfloor, are we contemplating a recorded vote on this, I would ask the \nmajority leader, or what is the will of the Democratic leader?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, if I could respond, I believe we have it \ncleared and that this could be moved by voice vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator from Pennsylvania want a recorded vote \non this or is a voice vote sufficient?\n  Mr. LOTT. If I could respond to the question, I know Pennsylvania is \nvery supportive of Amtrak and would like this proposal to move forward \nas quickly as possible so I hope that we wouldn't have to have a \nrecorded vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader. The reason why I asked is \nthat the Senator from Pennsylvania had asked the question as to whether \nwe would have a recorded vote.\n  I thank the Democratic leader as well as the majority leader for \ntheir kind remarks.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1609\n\n        (Purpose: To reauthorize Amtrak and for other purposes)\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We need to have the clerk report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for herself, Mr. \n     Lott, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Jeffords, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1609.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  I thank the majority leader and the Democratic leader for their kind \nremarks. I especially wish to thank Senator Hutchison and Senator Kerry \nand Senator Breaux who spent literally hundreds of hours on this bill. \nI think it is important to point out for the Record that this effort \nwas begun by the majority leader when he was chairman of the \nsubcommittee which is now chaired by the Senator from Texas, and the \ngroundwork was laid through his strong efforts.\n  I might say that there were several occasions when we were gridlocked \non this bill and we gathered in the majority leader's office and he \nhelped us find ways to reach common ground.\n  Mr. President, this compromise reauthorization legislation is the \nproduct of more than 3 years of bipartisan negotiations. Let there be \nno mistake. Amtrak is on the verge of bankruptcy. Fundamental reforms \nare needed immediately if there is to be any possibility of addressing \nAmtrak's financial crisis and turning it into a viable operation. This \nmeasure is long overdue. Some fear, as I do, that even with these \nreforms Amtrak may not make it.\n  Again, I thank Senator Hutchison for all her hard work, along with \nSenator Breaux and Senator Kerry. Senator Breaux and Senator Kerry will \nbe in the Chamber shortly, I am told, to add their comments. Senator \nHutchison will describe the details of her amendment which have to do \nwith labor, contracting out, liability, and the sunset trigger which is \npart of this legislation.\n  I think everyone knows that I hold strong reservations about Amtrak. \nAfter subsidizing for 26 years what was to have been a 2-year \nexperiment, I believe Congress must carefully evaluate whether this is \nthe best use of our limited taxpayers dollars.\n  Since 1971, Amtrak has received over $20 billion in Federal tax \ndollars. I know that Amtrak has strived to reduce its operating costs \nand increase its revenues. And, yes, a portion of Amtrak's financial \nchallenges are due to statutory constraints that Congress imposed and \nhas failed to lift, but the fact remains the Amtrak 12-year experiment \nwas unsuccessful 26 years ago, it is unsuccessful today, and the \nprospects of its future are rather bleak.\n  I realize that my pessimistic view of Amtrak's future, based on its \ntrack record, is not shared by the majority of the Congress. That is \nwhy I have worked with my colleagues to bring some semblance of \nlegitimacy to this operation. The bill before us does not go as far as \nmany of us would like. For some of my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle, they may say it goes too far. Regardless of the position \nheld, the bill does provide for some comprehensive changes.\n  According to a November 5, 1997, letter from Tom Downs, ``enactment \nof the Amtrak Accountability and Reform Act of 1997 would be the \nsingle-most significant action the Congress can take to aid Amtrak in \nachieving operating self-sufficiency by 2002.'' He goes on to say, \n``The legislative reforms contained in the bill will allow Amtrak to \noperate in a more businesslike, cost-effective manner, thus allowing \ngreater productivity and increased savings.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Tom \nDowns, who is the president and chief executive officer of Amtrak, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 National Railroad\n\n\n                                        Passenger Corporation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 1997.\n     Hon. John McCain, Chair,\n     Hon. Ernest F. Hollings,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen: Thank you for your leadership in working \n     toward an agreement in the Senate on comprehensive reform \n     legislation for Amtrak. It is my understanding that agreement \n     has been reached, and the Senate will soon consider the \n     modified version of S. 738. I want to let you know that \n     enactment of the Amtrak Reform and Revitalization Act of 1997 \n     would be the single most significant action the Congress can \n     take to aid Amtrak in achieving operating self-sufficiency by \n     2002. I will urge your colleagues to support the compromise \n     you have achieved.\n       Enactment of the reauthorization bill will not in and of \n     itself enable Amtrak to become independent of federal \n     operating support, but it is the most critical step in the \n     process. The legislative reforms contained in the bill will \n     allow Amtrak to operate in a more businesslike, cost-\n     effective manner, thus allowing greater productivity and \n     increased savings. The capital funding made available by \n     enactment of the legislation will allow us to begin to bring \n     the system up to a state of good repair and invest in high \n     rate-of-return capital projects. Adequate capital investment \n     is the key to operational self-sufficiency and the overall \n     economic viability of the railroad.\n       Consistent with all our previous statement on becoming \n     independent of federal operating support and as outlined in \n     our Strategic Business Plan, we will still require a \n     specific, declining level of federal operating support \n     through 2002, excess mandatory Railroad Retirement payments, \n     an the level of capital identified in the Congressional \n     Budget Resolution. It is my strong hope that the \n     Administration and the Congress will continue to support us \n     as we come closer to reaching our goal.\n       Again, thank you for all your leadership and diligence on \n     working out an agreement on this legislation. As both Amtrak \n     and the General Accounting Office (GAO) have made very clear \n     this year, Amtrak will not be around much longer under the \n     status quo. Legislative relief and capital funding are two of \n     the three most critical pieces in regaining our economic \n     health and long-term viability, and enactment of this \n     legislation will accomplish those two goals. Achieving an \n     agreement on this legislation is a goal both the Secretary of \n     Transportation and the Senate Majority Leader have identified \n     as important for this Congress, due to Amtrak's precarious \n     financial condition. I congratulate you on achieving this in \n     the substitute offered today.\n           Very truly yours,\n\n                                              Thomas M. Downs,\n\n                                           Chairman, President and\n                                          Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. In closing, Mr. President, I want to remind my colleagues \nthat even if Congress approves the statutory reforms and the $2.3 \nbillion for capital improvements is released, Amtrak's viability \nremains uncertain. Let's be clear. Amtrak is $1 billion in debt and \nthat debt level is predicted by the General Accounting Office to double \nto $2 billion in the next 2 years. Tom Downs predicts that without this \nlegislation Amtrak could be bankrupt by next spring. Others predict \neven sooner.\n  I hope the dire predictions are wrong but prudence dictates that \nwhile we\n\n[[Page S11930]]\n\nempower Amtrak to meet its financial goals and protect taxpayers, \nCongress and the administration prepare for and have a clear \nunderstanding of the long-range economic effects of a potential \nbankruptcy.\n  I requested the General Accounting Office to conduct an analysis of \nthis issue and submit a report to the committee providing an overview \nof the financial issues and implications associated with an Amtrak \nliquidation. The report will include an analysis of the financial \nimplications for the Federal Government, Amtrak's creditor's and the \nrailroad retirement system.\n  I strongly support passage of this reform measure. However, I will \ncontinue to hold strong reservations over Amtrak's ability to ever turn \nAmtrak into a profitable, subsidy-free operation. One of the most \nimportant elements of this bill is that it provides the opportunity for \nus to shut off the spigot if and when it is clear the promise of \nfinancial viability will not or cannot be achieved.\n  What is happening here is not just a piece of reform legislation, Mr. \nPresident. We are releasing $2.3 billion in what I have previously \ndescribed as the great train robbery of 1997. Back in the old days some \ncitizens of my State used to rob trains. But now the trains have \ndecided to rob the taxpayers of $2.3 billion with the help of this \nbody.\n  The proviso, or the rationale that allowed the $2.3 billion to be \nfenced off was $2.3 billion in back taxes. The only problem with that \nscenario, Mr. President, is Amtrak has never paid any taxes. So we are \nproviding another $2.3 billion giveaway to Amtrak. These reforms \nrelease that money.\n  I will never forget when I first came to Congress in 1982, Mr. \nPresident. I was visited by a man whom I respect as much as any man, \nGraham Claytor, who was then the head of Amtrak. And he gave me in \ngraphic detail a long and extensive briefing about how Amtrak was going \nto be viable financially by the year 1985. That's only 12 years ago. \nBut every 2 or 3 years Amtrak has come over to Congress with another \nplan to become financially viable within 2 or 3 years, and we know the \nanswer. The answer is that they have now received more than $20 billion \nof the taxpayers' money.\n  I say enough is enough. And I commit now that if this reform and \nreauthorization plan does not make Amtrak financially viable, I will do \neverything in my power as a Senator and as chairman of the Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee to see that it comes to an end.\n  I wish Amtrak every success with the passage of this legislation by \nthe House. I will hope and pray that Amtrak succeeds. But I must tell \nyou I am not optimistic that they will succeed and I hope to God that \nthis is the last trip to the taxpayers' pocket book that we make on \nbehalf of Amtrak.\n  Mr. President, again I thank Senator Hutchison who has done such a \nmagnificent job on this legislation. She has worked countless numbers \nof hours. She has made compromises that clearly at the beginning she \nwas not prepared to do. She made these compromises because she knew \nthat that is the essence of legislation and the lessons of getting \nlegislative results. She deserves enormous credit, along with my dear \nfriend, Senator Kerry and Senator Breaux, from Massachusetts and \nLouisiana, who played a great role. Bipartisanship is what this place \nis supposed to be about on issues that don't lend themselves to \npartisanship, and I believe that this is truly a bipartisan effort of \nwhich I think all of us can be proud. Again, my thanks to Senator \nHutchison.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nSantorum and Jeffords be added as original cosponsors of the \nsubstitute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I am ready to vote, after which we will then debate.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1609) was agreed to.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say that what Senator McCain \nsaid is absolutely true. I think it is fairly clear from his comments \nthat he is not a fan of Amtrak. But as the chairman of the committee, \nhe worked with all of us who do care about Amtrak, who do want \npassenger rail for our country, to try to give Amtrak a chance to \nsucceed. I think all of us have come together on a bill that will give \nAmtrak a chance to succeed and will also make Amtrak accountable. That \nis what Senator McCain is looking for and that is what all of us hope \nwill happen.\n  In fact, Senator Lott, the majority leader, who has worked on this \nfor, as he said, 3 years--he was the Surface Transportation \nSubcommittee chairman before I took that position, before he became \nmajority leader--Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Kerry, all contributed greatly to a very hard-fought \ncompromise. Because, of course, we are making huge changes in the law \nas it affects Amtrak and passenger rail in our country. Anything that \nmakes this many changes, of course, could not be done easily. It took \nthe labor groups, it took the trial lawyer groups to come together and \nwork with us, along with Senators such as Senator McCain who want \naccountability. So I think we have come together in a bill that will \ngive Amtrak a chance. It is not a slam dunk. It is not an assured \nsuccess. This is the first step in many steps that must be made for \nAmtrak to be able to operate without subsidies in the future.\n  What this bill has done is authorize the subsidies over the next 5 \nyears that eventually will phase out. At the end of 5 years there will \nnot be operational subsidies by the taxpayers of Amtrak. We have all \nagreed to that. That is why it was essential that we have reforms, so \nthat Amtrak could be more efficient, so it could compete in the \nmarketplace, so that it could have a passenger operation that would be \nmuch improved and, hopefully, bring more people into the system so it \ncould operate without the subsidies. In addition, the $2.3 billion in \ninfrastructure improvements, which are necessary both for the efficient \noperations and for the higher technology trains that we hope they will \nbe able to operate, is contingent on these reforms. I think it was very \nwise, in the budget reconciliation bill, that the $2.3 billion that \nwould be put into investment in capital improvements would be tied to \nthese very important reforms. Because without the reforms, Amtrak has \nno chance to succeed--none. With the reforms, it has a chance. That is \nwhat our bill today will give it. I would like to go through a few of \nthe most important points of what we did today.\n  First, some of the labor protections that were mandated by the \nFederal Government are now taken out of the law. The 6-year statutory \nseverance benefits will now be in place for 180 days as they are \nnegotiated at the bargaining table, after which they will be totally \nlifted from all negotiation and there will be no Federal mandates. In \nother words, today if a line goes out of business or Amtrak takes it \noff, those employees today would be entitled by Federal law to 6 years \nof severance pay. Most Americans do not have jobs that have 6-year \ntermination agreements. In fact, when Amtrak first came into place, it \nwas a different time. Today, these severance packages are about to \nbreak the system, and I think the unions realize that and they are \nwilling to say we will put it on the negotiating table and we will let \nthe free market reign. So that is the first thing we are doing.\n  The second thing we are doing is taking the prohibition against any \ncontracting out out of the law once again. It will be part of the \ncontracts for the next 2 years, but it is on the negotiating table now \nso that Amtrak, if it sees that it can make efficiencies by contracting \nout certain services, will be able to do that in a negotiated \nframework. So that will be on the table as well.\n  It is very important that Amtrak bring its labor costs into line \nbecause, in fact, if you look at other forms of transportation, the \nlabor costs in passenger rail transportation are lopsided. For \ninstance, no airline has more than 37 percent total labor expense, yet \nAmtrak is at 54 percent of its total expenses in labor. No competing \npassenger industry has similar protection rules that are mandated by \nthe Federal Government. In fact, Greyhound drivers and mechanics, who \nmight be laid off because of service discontinuances,\n\n[[Page S11931]]\n\nare guaranteed 7 days' notice under union contracts; no statutory \nguarantee against contracting out. So I think if you are looking at \ntransportation in its totality in our country, you have to have the \nability to compete. So we have to have the ability at the bargaining \ntable to bring these costs in line, if Amtrak is going to be a viable \nalternative form of transportation.\n  Another major area that needed some limitations was liability. Our \nsubstitute bill provides for a global passenger liability cap of $200 \nmillion. I think this is very important. For any one accident there \nwill be a cap, so Amtrak will be able to buy insurance. That is what we \nare trying to do, is have some sort of quantifiable limit so we will \nknow what the costs would be in the most extreme circumstances. And \nAmtrak could buy insurance to cover that, hopefully at a reasonable \ncost.\n  As Senator McCain mentioned, there is a trigger on this. There will \nbe an Amtrak Reform Council appointed to monitor Amtrak's progress with \nthese new reforms, to look at the 5-year glidepath that Amtrak is on, \nto try to get to the point that there will be no more taxpayer \nsubsidies of Amtrak. This Amtrak Reform Council is going to look at the \nAmtrak operation and the reforms and see how Amtrak is doing. After 2 \nyears they will submit a strategic plan for Amtrak, and they will also \nreport to Congress if they just don't think Amtrak has a chance to make \nit, after which Congress will be able, then, to either implement the \nplan, the strategic plan that would be put forward, or pull the plug on \nAmtrak.\n  These are accountability standards that I think are reasonable. \nCertainly we want to put good money into helping Amtrak succeed, but if \nit is going to be hopeless, we don't want to throw good money after \nbad. So I think the accountability is a very important part of this \ncompromise.\n  We also provide in this bill for interstate rail compacts, so that \ntwo States that have traffic that would warrant, perhaps, a joint \neffort toward rail transportation could come together, could pool their \nresources and provide for rail transportation in their States. I think \nthat is a very important step, for our States to be able to form \ncompacts, because that will add to the options of rail transportation.\n  It also provides that Amtrak will have to give 180 days' notice if \nthey are going to discontinue a route. The previous law required 90 \ndays' notice. That is not enough time for a State to be able to step in \nand help Amtrak, especially if it's a State that has a legislature that \nonly meets every other year and would have to make some emergency \narrangements.\n  So I think we have several new parts of the law that will help very \nmuch in giving Amtrak the ability to succeed and also in giving more \noptions to our States to add to the rail passenger capabilities in our \ncountry. Because, you see, I think one of the reasons that Amtrak is \nnot only viable but a very important part of an intermodal mobility \nsystem for our country is because cities are now going more and more \ninto intracity rail systems. Even in southern States, in my State of \nTexas, now, in Dallas, Dallas has a rail train system that goes out of \nthe Amtrak station. So I am very happy that the Texas Eagle Amtrak \ntrain will be able to start in Chicago, IL, come down through Missouri, \nthrough Arkansas, over through east Texas into Dallas and Fort Worth. \nPeople can get off the train in Dallas or Fort Worth and they can get \non an intracity train and go all over the city of Dallas. They can go \nto the zoo, they can go to the museums, they can go out north where the \ncommuting traffic is. They will be able eventually to go to the \nairport.\n  So, as more cities are beginning to have rail transportation options, \nthen the feeding in of Amtrak also provides more passengers for Amtrak \nand more mobility for the citizens of our country. I love the fact that \nyou can go from Chicago all the way down through Texas to San Antonio \nand then get on another Amtrak train, the Sunset Limited, and go to Los \nAngeles or all the way over to Florida.\n  These systems will provide vacation capabilities for people in our \ncountry to see the sights of America on a train. I think it is \nsomething that has been so successful in Europe through the years that \nit will also have a resurrection in America that will provide more \nopportunities for families to see this great country from a train and \nhave that experience that we really almost lost in the last 25 or 30 \nyears.\n  So I think what we are doing today is not propping up a historic, \nold, antiquated type of transportation that we have known in the past \nin this country. That is not what we are doing today. What we are doing \ntoday is providing a new, vibrant option for rail transportation to be \nadded to the air transportation that is so terrific in our country and \nthe bus transportation and the automobiles and highways that provide \nmobility options for all kinds of people--people who can't drive and \npeople who don't want to drive. People who don't live near airports \nwould be able to go to a train station that is fed from buses from \nsmall communities all over our States, going into an Amtrak train \nstation where someone can get off a bus in a very small town and get \nonto an Amtrak train and go into cities from Florida to California, \nfrom Illinois to Massachusetts, and all the way down to Texas.\n  So I think it is a very exciting thing we are doing. That is why I \nhave worked so hard with my colleagues, Senator Kerry, Senator Breaux, \nSenator Hollings and Senator McCain, to make this a reality, to give \nAmtrak a chance. Because if Amtrak can compete with the other kinds of \ntransportation, I think it will not be a relic of the past but a very \nimportant part of an overall transportation system for the future for \nour country, for our children to have this experience, for our elderly \npeople to have the mobility that train passenger systems can give.\n  I am very excited that we have come to this agreement. I appreciate \nthe bipartisan spirit in which this agreement has been made.\n  I thank the Senators who are waiting to speak and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today we move another step closer to \npreserving our Nation's passenger rail system. The desperate call for \naction signals the importance of rail travel and the severe impacts a \nshutdown of Amtrak would have on the daily lives of millions of \nAmericans.\n  We live in a nation that prides itself on independence. For many \nAmericans, their personal automobile grants them the ability to travel \nunincumbered for work and pleasure. But as we all know, this freedom is \nslowly ebbing as our Nation's highways and skies become more and more \ncongested. Our roadways and runways are at capacity and growth \nopportunities are severely limited.\n  A drive through and around any major American city today will leave \nmost drivers frustrated by delays. This constant automobile congestion \nslows commerce, reduces worker productivity, and limits travel \nindependence. In fact, highway congestion now costs the United States \n$100 billion annually, not including the economic and societal costs of \nincreased pollution and wasted energy.\n  The American solution has been to find alternatives. Our road options \nare limited. Ten-lane highways cannot be expanded, and new highways are \ndifficult to site and result in the destruction of irreplaceable land \nand neighborhoods.\n  Congestion in the air is also a major issue. Slots at airports are \nfilled. Runways are backed up. Air space is busy. A recent safety study \nreported that 21 of the 26 major airports experienced serious delays, \ncosting billions of dollars. New airports are expensive and only add to \nthe problems we face today.\n  Rail remains the one underutilized infrastructure available to our \nNation. Railroads offer us the opportunity to move cars off the \nhighways and planes from the air. Rail is efficient, cheaper and more \nenvironmentally preferable than our other options. We must now begin \nthe careful process of retaining and rebuilding passenger rail in our \ncountry.\n  Created in 1970, Amtrak serves millions of passengers each year. For \n10 million households that have no car, and many communities without \nair or bus service, Amtrak is their lifeline. Amtrak connects 68 of the \n75 largest urban areas in the United States, and serves many of the 62 \nmillion Americans living in rural areas.\n  According to the Journal of Commerce, without Amtrak there would be\n\n[[Page S11932]]\n\nan immediate need for 10 new tunnels under the Hudson River between \nnorthern New Jersey and New York City and 20 new highway lanes in New \nYork. If Amtrak disappeared tomorrow, there would be an additional \n27,000 cars on the highway between New York and Boston every day.\n  In my home State of Vermont, passenger rail has been rediscovered. We \nlaunched a new passenger service, the Ethan Allen Express last year, to \ncomplement the already existing Vermonter. Both trains have been \nimmensely successful, brining passengers from New England, New York, \nand across the Nation to our beautiful State. These trains have \nrelieved highway congestion, given an economic boost to the State and \noffer travelers an alternative to driving or flying. Our dream in \nVermont is to expand this service, linking a number of our larger \ncities and reestablishing rail service to Maine, New Hampshire, and \nBoston.\n  And as we learned last winter in Vermont, rail keeps rolling \nregardless of weather. During the deep winter storms, as cars were \nsnowbound and planes held on the ground, the trains were bringing \nbusiness travelers and skiers to our State. We all remember when the \neastern seaboard was hit with a major blizzard in in the winter of 1996 \nand the Federal Government was shut down for a solid week. But Amtrak \nkept running. In fact, my only means of getting to the Senate that week \nwas on the train, as roads were blocked an planes grounded.\n  Passenger rail service is the future. But many in this city have yet \nto recognize this reality. Amtrak has never been given the proper tools \nto bring the train into the modern age. The rail system operates on \n1930's technology, with outdated engines, cars and maintenance \nfacilities.\n  While this system struggles, other nation's have invested heavily in \ntechnologically advanced high speed trains. France, Japan, and many \nother nations operate state-of-the-art trains, an efficient mode of \ntravel in densely populated regions. Japan installed their bullet \ntrains in the early 1960's, and Europe in the 1970's. The high-speed \ntrains, cruising at 200 miles per hour or more, easily compete with \ncars, buses, and planes.\n  Why has the United States fallen so far behind? Railroads in this \ncountry once had the prestige and financial capital to do nearly \nanything, but that changed over the years. Through mismanagement and \nlimited public support we let our passenger railroads decay to the \npoint of extinction. Today, we face the same choices. Should we support \nreviving and expanding advanced passenger rail through public financing \nor shut the system down? Let's not make a mistake that we would truly \nregret in the future. It's time to make this railroad work and maintain \nits role as a vital component of our Nation's transportation \ninfrastructure.\n  This Nation is on the verge of one of the most important \ntransportation developments in its history. High speed rail should be \noperational from Washington to Boston by 1999. Other regions of the \ncountry are also working to develop high-speed train service, including \nCalifornia, Florida, and many other States. These trains easily compete \nwith air travel and allow travelers a comfortable, fast and efficient \nmeans to reach their destination.\n  High-speed rail will also aid Amtrak's bottom line. This new system \nwill bring further profits to a business that badly needs the capital.\n  Many critics will question the need for further public investment in \nAmtrak. As compared to other infrastructure programs, passenger rail \ngets little public support. Last year we spent $20 billion on highways, \nwhile capital investment for Amtrak was less than $450 million. In \nrelative terms, between fiscal year 1980 and fiscal year 1994, spending \non highways increased 73 percent, aviation increased 170 percent, while \nspending on rail declined by 60 percent.\n  Without proper reforms and additional capital funding the future of \nthis railroad is at risk. I commend members of the Senate Commerce \ncommittee who have worked to deliver a solid reform proposal to the \nSenate. My hope is that the House will accept these changes and send \nthis bill to the President before we adjourn for the year. The plan we \nhave developed offers serious reforms that will enable the railroad to \nmodernize while reducing operating costs.\n  Our Nation needs passenger rail. Together, we must move forward to \npreserve this important transportation option. The investments we are \ncommitting to today will increase our Nation's investment in the Amtrak \nrail system, and allow it to succeed in its efforts to continue to \noperate into the future.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the compromise \nAmtrak reauthorization bill being offered by Senator Hutchison. Passage \nof this bill brings us one step closer to putting Amtrak on firm \nfooting by extending authorization for 5 years, and most importantly, \nby giving Amtrak $2.3 billion in tax credits for much-needed capital \ninvestments.\n  But let's not pretend we are completely solving the problem today. \nThe General Accounting Office has warned us over and over again that \nmaking Amtrak self sufficient will be difficult and that realistically \nwe have to look at continued investment in the system beyond the year \n2002.\n  Mr. President, our national transportation system is crucial to our \neconomy. And a national rail system is a crucial part of any national \ntransportation plan. But over the years we have consistently \nshortchanged Amtrak.\n  For instance, over the course of this decade, Germany has decided to \ninvest nearly $70 billion on what is already an excellent railway \nsystem in a country a fraction of the size of the United States.\n  What have we done? Well, since 1971, we've invested just $19 billion \nin Amtrak. And now we are preparing to phase out operating subsidies \nentirely. I think this is unrealistic.\n  Mr. President, let me put this in perspective. We continue to \nsubsidize every other form of transportation.\n  Over the past 15 years, in relative terms, we've increased spending \non highways by 73 percent and aviation by 170 percent, while we have \ncut Amtrak's funding 62 percent.\n  As we starved our national rail system during most of this decade, \nservice declined and so did ridership. Between 1994 and 1996 Amtrak \nwent from 21.1 million passengers to 19.7 million --meaning Amtrak lost \neven more revenue and was being sent into a downward spiral toward \nbankruptcy.\n  And those 1.4 million riders Amtrak lost still had to get to their \ndestinations somehow and that likely meant more cars, buses, or planes \nin our already congested airports and highways.\n  Coming from the State of New Jersey, I can speak first hand about the \nimportance of Amtrak to my State and the rest of the northeast \ncorridor.\n  The New York/New Jersey metropolitan area is one of the most \ncongested in the nation. A recent study said that every day people \nwaste more than 2 million hours in traffic--2 million hours a day.\n  To put that number into perspective, that means that people here will \nwaste more time in traffic in a single year than the man-hours to build \nthe entire Continental railroad.\n  And if Amtrak wasn't there, another 11 million people would be dumped \nonto our roads.\n  How many billions of dollars would we have to spend widening roads in \norder to accommodate this new traffic? How much time and money would \ntrucking companies, businesses and commuters lose as a result of \nincreased traffic and congestion? I do not think that anyone can \nlegitimately make the argument that highway users do not benefit from \nAmtrak's operations.\n  Amtrak does not just reduce congestion on our highways. It carries \nover 40 percent of the combined air-rail market between Washington and \nNew York. Loss of Amtrak service in this corridor would require another \n7,500 fully booked 757 jetliners to carry Amtrak's passenger load each \nyear. How many billions would we have to invest in our air \ninfrastructure to accommodate these travelers?\n  Mr. President, while I've spoken about my region, Amtrak is also a \nnational passenger rail system that provides important service in areas \nof the country that are not as congested. In many cases, Amtrak \nprovides residents of small rural towns with their only form of \nintercity transportation. Each year, some 22 million passengers depend \non Amtrak for transportation between urban centers and rural locations. \nAmtrak provides service in 45 of the 50 States.\n\n[[Page S11933]]\n\n  Ask any Amtrak passenger, traveling through the State of Montana, \nperhaps stopping off at Havre, on their way to Glacier National Park, \nwhether Amtrak is important to them. Of course it is.\n  Mr. President, this agreement in front of us today strikes a \ncompromise on very difficult labor issues. It asks Amtrak's workers to \nmake signficant concessions.\n  Mr. President, I worked hard to make these funds available to Amtrak. \nDuring the budget negotiations, I worked with Senators Roth and \nDomenici to include a reserve fund for Amtrak to allow us to make \nadditional capital funding available in future legislation.\n  Thanks to the leadership of Senators Roth and Moynihan, the Finance \nCommittee found a way to provide this funding in the tax reconciliation \nbill through a $2.3 billion tax credit.\n  Mr. President, I would like to end by commending all of those who \nworked so feverishly to put this compromise together. In particular, \nSenators Kerry, Hollings, Lott, Hutchison, McCain, Roth and Breaux \ndeserve special recognition for their efforts and leadership in this \nmatter.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Amtrak reauthorization \ncompromise.\n  I think this step we take today to begin rejuvenating our national \nrail system might someday be considered just as historic as the \ncentury-old congressional decision to build it in the first place.\n  But we must not kid ourselves. More will need to be done if Amtrak is \nto thrive, not just survive.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I strongly support this legislation, which \nwill preserve vital passenger rail service in the United States. I \napplaud the hard work of the members of the Commerce Committee who have \nworked out a reasonable compromise on this much-needed bill.\n  In the 25 years since Amtrak was created, we've learned several \nthings about passenger rail operations in the United States: First, in \ntoday's increasingly competitive transportation marketplace, Amtrak \ncannot continue to operate viably under the status quo. Second, we \nrecognize political reality and know that the American people will not \ncontinue to support taxpayer subsidies of Amtrak if the railroad \ncontinues to operate under the same structure that has brought it close \nto financial collapse. Third, like its counterparts in the highway and \naviation sectors, passenger railroad ought to be afforded a reasonable \nlevel of Federal assistance for its increasingly urgent infrastructure \nneeds.\n  With regard this third matter--Federal support--I am pleased that \nCongress included within the tax bill passed earlier this year $2.3 \nbillion for Amtrak's capital improvements. These funds will help Amtrak \nconduct badly needed modernization of its infrastructure so that it can \nenhance service to its customers and more effectively perform in a \ncompetitive marketplace. However, these funds are on hold until the \nbill before the Senate today is enacted into law.\n  What is also needed is a realistic assessment of the Federal laws \ncurrently governing Amtrak's operation. Although attention recently \nseems to be focused on the protections for Amtrak employees, there are \na wide range of laws that hinder Amtrak's stated goal of operating more \nlike a business.\n  It has been the provisions affecting Amtrak workers that have been \nmost controversial and have stymied action in Congress for the past 2 \nyears. Some of these laws stem from the Depression era, a time when \nCongress and the President sought to relieve a national tragedy. Others \nwere enacted when Amtrak was first created in the early 1970's, well \nbefore the railroad's financial problems had developed.\n  In any event, it is important to note that many of these provisions \nare mandated by law, rather than agreed to through the traditional \ncollective-bargaining process that businesses and labor unions across \nAmerica deal with regularly. Other employers in the United States are \ncertainly not required by law to provide worker benefits similar to \nthose required of Amtrak.\n  If financial and operational viability is going to be restored at \nAmtrak, we simply must take a candid and reasonable look at all of the \nvery unique laws--not just the labor protections--that have hindered \nAmtrak's ability to succeed. We must also ensure that, like its \ncounterparts in the aviation and highway sectors, passenger rail is \nprovided a reasonable level of support for capital improvements. These \nare the goals this bill seeks to achieve, and I am pleased that Senate \nis able to take it up today.\n  Specifically, when amended by this substitute, S. 738 will:\n  Authorize $5.163 billion for Amtrak over the next 5 years;\n  Mandate that Amtrak be independent of Federal operating subsidies in \n5 years;\n  Repeal two statutes that affect work rules at Amtrak, and put them \ninto the collective bargaining process. These outdated statutes \nprohibit Amtrak from contracting out, and mandate 6 years of severance \npay for laid off employees;\n  Impose a reasonable cap on punitive damages on rail transportation \nliability;\n  Create an Amtrak reform council [ARC] that will regularly evaluate \nAmtrak's financial performance to ensure accountability to the \ntaxpayer;\n  Clarify that the $2.3 billion included within the tax bill can only \nbe used for Amtrak capital improvements.\n  When taken together, the provisions of this legislation will restore \nfinancial viability to Amtrak by permitting the company to operate more \nlike a business. The bill also gives the U.S. taxpayer the assurance \nthat Congress will no longer provide open-ended subsidies to passenger \nrail.\n  There are allegations that Amtrak's operational reforms are being \nsought as a ploy to make it less expensive to eliminate these jobs and \nshut down the railroad altogether. This contention is ludicrous. The \nbiggest threat to these jobs is maintaining the status quo, which is \nnot financially viable for Amtrak.\n  If things continue under the current framework, Amtrak will soon be \nforced into bankruptcy. Such an outcome would eliminate all of Amtrak's \n20,000 jobs, to say nothing of depriving the Nation of a needed \nservice.\n  Ultimately, our effort to ensure that passenger rail survives into \nthe 21st century should be focused on the customer: we should help \nensure that conditions exist that will allow Amtrak to provide \nefficient, reliable national transportation service without adversely \nimpacting its workforce or burdening U.S. taxpayers.\n  Absent this service, Amtrak's customers would go elsewhere, and our \nhighways and airports would become severely clogged. This legislation \nensures the viability of passenger rail service for the traveling \npublic, and I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today the Senate holds the future of Amtrak \nin its hands. The legislation before us seeks to put Amtrak's financial \nsituation on a track to self-sufficiency. We have delayed action on \nAmtrak for three years and we cannot afford to delay it any longer.\n  As a member of the Senate Commerce Committee for the last 3 years, I \nhave listened to Amtrak and its detractors discuss the problems and the \npotential for passenger rail service. The committee, first under the \nleadership of Senator Lott, and now under the leadership of Senator \nHutchison, chair of the Surface Transportation Subcommittee, have \nreported out tough but fair reform bills that put the burden on Amtrak \nto prove it can survive without a Federal operating subsidy.\n  In the last Congress, despite the best efforts of Senator Lott, no \nagreement could be reached with those who claim they want Amtrak reform \nbut also wouldn't let it come to the floor--even when they were offered \nthe opportunity to offer, debate, and vote on their amendments. Much \nthe same can be said to explain why we are here, in the waning hours of \nthe first session, considering this important bill.\n  I want to express my support for the amendment offered by Senator \nHutchison and my appreciation for her dedication to moving the reform \nprocess forward. She has fought a difficult battle because of her \nbelief in the importance of maintaining a national passenger rail \nsystem, and I would like to commend her for her hard work and \ndedication to reform.\n  But, we are not simply debating Amtrak reform, but a more complex \nquestion: Do we, as a Nation, believe that we should have a national \npassenger rail service? If we do, then we will pass\n\n[[Page S11934]]\n\nthis bill with Senator Hutchison's amendment. If we fail to address the \nfinancial problems at Amtrak all we are doing is delaying the \ninevitable.\n  We need to make the tough choices--that is what the people of this \ncountry have sent us here to do. If we are not willing or able to do \nthat for Amtrak then we might as well shut the system down rather then \nallow it to slowly bleed to death. That is what is happening now \nbecause some in this body have been unwilling to face up to the fact \nthat there is no easy answer to the financial problems facing Amtrak. \nIf there were--we would not find ourselves in this situation.\n  Three years ago, Amtrak took the Government's pronouncement that it \nshould operate without Federal operating subsidies to heart. They \ndeveloped a business plan and told Congress what was needed both in the \nway of statutory changes and capital funding in order to meet this \ngoal. Earlier this year we created the capital trust fund--an important \nfirst step--but in this case money simply isn't enough. Until we \naddress the statutory changes they need, we have left them to sink \nslowly into bankruptcy.\n  Tom Downs has come before the Commerce Committee, the Finance \nCommittee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to tell the Senate what changes Amtrak needs in order \nto turn a public railroad into a business. He has laid out the \nstatutory changes that are necessary in order to allow Amtrak to \ncompete in the next century. He has been very straightforward about the \nfact that without these changes, Amtrak has no future.\n  The Commerce Committee has twice reported out bills that provide \nthese changes. But the committee has also made it clear that the reform \nbill is a commitment between Congress and Amtrak to achieve the mutual \ngoal of self-sufficiency. We have created the Amtrak Review Council \nwhich will consider factors that will help it determine if Amtrak has \nkept its end of the deal--Amtrak's performance, and the findings of the \nindependent assessment--in order to determine whether or not Amtrak \nshould continue to exist. I included a provision in the bill that will \nrequire the ARC to also consider whether Congress has held up its end \nof the bargain by requiring the council to look at whether sufficient \nfunding was provided for Amtrak to carry out the financial plan it is \nrequired to write under the bill.\n  In my very first Commerce Committee hearing in January, 1995, Ken \nMead, then with GAO told us that ``. . . Congress needs to decide what \nis to be expected from Amtrak and how much it is willing to pay to \nfulfill those expectations.'' I believe the committee has provided the \nfull Senate with a bill that provides Amtrak and its shareholders with \na clear outline of those expectations and most importantly, provides \nAmtrak with all the tools, within its power, to meet those \nexpectations.\n  I believe that the committee's reform package--offered today by the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas--is a fair one, but least anyone think \nthat we are simply pouring money into a sinking ship, it is important \nto remember that this bill also includes a heavy dose of tough love. If \nthe ARC determines that Amtrak cannot become free of Federal operating \nsubsidies, then plans will be made for liquidation or a major \nrestructuring will be undertaken.\n  Having worked with Tom Downs, I am a firm believer that he and the \nmen and women who have worked so hard to keep Amtrak moving will meet \nthe goal of self-sufficiency. If they cannot, even after Congress has \nprovided them with the tools they have asked for, then I am ready to \nclose them down. But I want to know that they had the opportunity, the \nresources and the tools to meet that goal, first. And that is why it is \nso important that we adopt the amendment offered by Senator Hutchison.\n  It is also important to look at what, until today, has prevented us \nfrom moving the Amtrak reform legislation--labor and liability.\n  According to the General Accounting Office, labor accounts for 52 \npercent of the costs at Amtrak. You don't need to be an accountant to \nknow that if Amtrak is to succeed it needs to be able to address these \ncosts. Amtrak has asked for the ability to sit down at the bargaining \ntable and negotiate on the issues of contracting out of services and \nseverance pay, which under current law is 6 years. The Committee bill \nrequired both sides to negotiate. Under the Hutchison amendment, the \nissue of contracting out shall itself be negotiated in the next round \nof contract negotiations.\n  A lot has changed since Amtrak was created and we need to allow the \nsystem to change with the times if it is to be a competitive force as \nwe enter the next century. The men and women of Amtrak have worked hard \nto improve the system, make no mistake about it, and they have more at \nstake then anyone for without Amtrak they have no job. I do not believe \nthat asking them to sit down at the table and negotiate is asking too \nmuch.\n  The Hutchison amendment also makes changes in the liability issue \nthat has long held up reform. It is a much misunderstood issue and I \napplaud the Senator from Texas' ability to reach agreement on the \nissue.\n  The Senate will make an important decision today. We can take the \nresponsible approach, pass reform, and help put Amtrak on the road to \nself-sufficiency. Or we can take the irresponsible approach, kill the \nbill and shut down passenger rail service. I have the luxury, I \nsuppose, of coming from a State that will not be impacted one way or \nthe other at this time. Maine does not have train service. We would \nlike it, and we are waiting for a decision by the Surface \nTransportation Board to determine if we will get it, but the people of \nmy State believe that a national passenger rail system is important, \nand so do I.\n  A national passenger rail system is as much a part of our future as \nit is of our past. The Journal of Commerce noted last year that \nAmtrak's presence eliminates the need for 20 additional highway lanes \nin New York City and 10 new tunnels under the Hudson. It also replaces \n27,000 cars on the highway between Boston and New York every day. We \ncan only add so many lanes to any given highway.\n  We need Amtrak--not as a reminder of our past, but as a vital part of \nour transportation future, and I urge my colleagues to join me in \npassing this bill.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 738, the \nAmtrak Reform and Revitalization Act of 1997, and urge its immediate \npassage.\n  S. 738 is the final product of a long collaborative process between \nDemocrats and Republicans alike who have come together in a bipartisan \nway in order to save and strengthen Amtrak, the Nation's passenger rail \ncarrier. Credit must be given to Senator Hutchison, the subcommittee \nchairman, Senator McCain, our Commerce Committee chairman, and the \nmajority leader, Senator Lott who took a personal interest in this \nlegislation to get it done. On my side of the aisle we must acknowledge \nthe contributions of Senators Kerry, Breaux, and Ford who negotiated \nthis compromise.\n  In addition, we should mention those Senate staff members who worked \nlong hours to bring this legislation to the floor today. They include: \nAnn Begeman and Charlotte Casey from the Commerce Committee majority \nstaff; Amy Henderson and Larry DiRita from Senator Hutchison's staff; \nCarl Biersack of the majority leader's office. On the Democratic side I \nwant to mention: Ivan Schlager, Jim Drewry, Clyde Hart, and Carl \nBentzel from the committee staff; Gregg Rothschild from Senator Kerry's \noffice; Mark Ashby from Senator Breaux's staff; Greg Rohde from Senator \nDorgan's office; Tom Zoeller from Senator Ford's office; and Jonathan \nAdelstein of the minority leader's office.\n  This bill gives Amtrak the tools it says it needs to survive and \nprosper into the 21st century. In order for this to be done, each of \nAmtrak's stakeholders has had to give up some benefit. Amtrak \npassengers will have to bear a limit on Amtrak's liability to them, \nmuch the same way that the airlines limit their liability to \npassengers. Amtrak employees will have labor protections trimmed, but \nthey will retain the ability to renegotiate these protections in the \ncollective bargaining process. In addition, Amtrak management will be \nunder increased scrutiny to perform. The bill establishes an Amtrak \nReform Council to advise Amtrak management and to report to the \nCongress\n\n[[Page S11935]]\n\non Amtrak's progress to self-sufficiency.\n  However, in return for those sacrifices, the bill provides Amtrak, \nfor perhaps the first time, sufficient funds for it to repair and \nrevitalize its track and facilities to grow into a first-class rail \npassenger service. The United States ranks very low in the world in the \namount of money it spends on rail passenger service. According to one \nstudy the United States ranks below Bangladesh in the amount of money \nwe allocate to this service. With this bill we can begin to close that \ngap and give the American people a service they can use and be proud \nof.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues on the Senate \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee on today's successful \npassage of the Amtrak reauthorization bill. I acknowledge that the \nprocurement, labor, and liability reforms contained in this bill as \namended by the chairman's substitute amendment are the end result of \ndifficult negotiations and compromises among many competing interests, \nand represent many years' effort. Issues such as contracting out and \nmandatory 6-year severance pay have been taken out of statute and put \non the negotiating table.\n  I hope this bill's provisions, along with future negotiations, result \nin some real reforms. Even with the $2.3 billion in tax credits that \nwill be released on January 1, 1998 if this reauthorization bill is \nenacted into law, Amtrak will still be hard-pressed to continue running \ntrains in the future, if meaningful improvements are not made in the \nway the railroad does business. Since I have taken on the chairmanship \nof the Senate Appropriations Transportation Subcommittee this year, one \nthing has become crystal clear: Amtrak does not intend to be weaned \nfrom Federal subsidies any time soon. The Amtrak-Brotherhood of \nMaintenance of Way Employees [BMWE] union agreement reached last \nweekend contains contingencies that require appropriations levels \nhigher than those in current law or contemplated by the balanced budget \nagreement. Amtrak touts its glidepath to self-sufficiency as the \nfunding path that will eventually lead to the elimination of Federal \noperating subsidies. However, the Amtrak-BMWE agreement points to a \nglidepath in the opposite direction.\n  The fiscal year 1998 transportation appropriations bill provided $793 \nmillion for Amtrak operating and capital expenses. Added to Federal \nsubsidies paid to Amtrak since the Corporation was formed in 1971, the \ntaxpayers have thus far spent $22 billion on a national railroad that \ncarries fewer than 20 million passengers a year--less than 1 percent of \nall annual intercity passenger trips in the United States. According to \nthe General Accounting Office, the average Amtrak direct Federal \nsubsidy is $38 per passenger trip, compared to $1.50 per commercial \nairline passenger enplanement. This is subsidy that comes out of the \npockets of every American taxpayer, and yet, wide swaths of the country \nare not served at all by Amtrak, and many communities that do have \ntrain service only see the train a few times a week, or at odd hours of \nthe night.\n  There is a growing sense that Federal funding of Amtrak can no longer \nbe justified on fiscal or mobility grounds, and that it is time to \nconsider phasing out the railroads's public monopoly status. I really \nhope that the reforms contained in this reauthorization bill do make a \ndifference in the way Amtrak does business. Because if they do not, by \nreleasing these tax credit funds, the Congress may simply be extending \nAmtrak's financial instability for 2 more years, and costing the \ntaxpayers yet more appropriated funds for the subsidy of a failed \nexperiment.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased that we finally have before us \nthe legislation we need to give Amtrak a new lease on life. In my \nremarks this afternoon, I will start with the bottom line.\n  When we pass this legislation today, Amtrak will be eligible to \nreceive the $2.3 billion that was provided in last summer's balanced \nbudget plan. This legislation authorizes the continued existence of \nAmtrak--that authorization expired in 1994--and therefore gives Amtrak \naccess to the capital fund that some of us have worked so many years to \nestablish.\n  Agreement on the terms of Amtrak's reauthorization has not been easy, \nMr. President. It has taken several years to accomplish, marked by many \nlong hours and more frustrations than I care to recall, as agreements \nwe thought were done unraveled over and over again.\n  The bill before us this afternoon has required the best efforts of \nmany of my colleagues, who have persevered in the face of those \nfrustrations. We could not have reached this point without the \nleadership of Senator Hutchison, along with Senator McCain, and of \ncourse, their colleague on the Commerce Committee, the distinguished \nmajority leader, to reach agreement on the many difficult issues that \nthis legislation has raised.\n  And I know that without the persistence of Senator John Kerry, along \nwith Senators Hollings and Breaux, we would not have reached this \npoint.\n  And if I may say so, Mr. President, the entire Delaware congressional \ndelegation has been a part of this process from the beginning. My good \nfriend Bill Roth, chair of the Finance Committee, and our Governor, Tom \nCarper, who is on the Amtrak board of directors, both continued to play \ntheir key roles at critical moments in this process.\n  The result is a bipartisan compromise, that required that everyone \ngive up some of what they wanted to get as much as possible of what \nAmtrak needs. Those of us who followed these negotiations closely can \ncount many moments when it seemed that this legislation was dead. Only \nthe long-suffering perseverance of the key players made this \nlegislation possible.\n  But let's be clear about where we are in the life of Amtrak. As my \ngood friend, Senator McCain, has stressed today, Amtrak is indeed in \ndire economic trouble. And yes, some of this trouble is indeed due to \nsome of the constraints that we in Congress put on Amtrak's business \npractices when we created it a quarter of a century ago. That is why \nthe reforms in this legislation are needed.\n  But I believe that much of the problem is due to our failure over the \nyears to provide our nation's passenger rail system with the level of \nfinancial support that we give to other elements of our country's \ntransportation system.\n  As Senator Kerry has argued here this afternoon, we here in the \nUnited States rank below some of the poorest Nations on the planet in \nthe level of financial support per citizen that we provide our \npassenger rail system.\n  One result of this has been that during the 25 year life of Amtrak, \nits employees have seen their wages cut as the cost of living \ngrew while their paychecks stagnated.\n\n  In my State of Delaware, we have two of the essential maintenance \nfacilities for Amtrak--at the Wilmington and Bear, DE yards. The \nworkers at these facilities are the best in the business, and are \ncarrying on a tradition that reaches back to the turn of the century in \nwhich Delaware has provided essential support for passenger rail along \nthe East Coast.\n  The hard work that the men and women of the Delaware yards have put \nin keeping Amtrak's equipment and tracks safe and dependable has been \nrewarded with a stagnant standard of living. And our citizens--not just \nin East Coast urban areas, as we often hear, but in small towns all \nover the country--have had much less passenger rail service than the \ncitizens of other major industrial nations.\n  By failing to support Amtrak adequately, we have been forced to live \nwith a less efficient transportation system, reducing the effectiveness \nof the more substantial funds we provide for highways and airports, \nwhich are crowded with travelers who might otherwise be able to travel \nby rail.\n  We all hope that Amtrak will make the best of the management reforms \nin this bill to put passenger rail on a healthier financial track for \nthe future. But this legislation entails more than operating reforms \nand access to a new capital fund.\n  As Senator McCain so rightly pointed out, this legislation makes \nprovision for termination of Federal Financial support for Amtrak's \noperations by the year 2002, something already part of our long-term \nbudget plans. It includes provision for a study of the possibility of \nAmtrak's bankruptcy and liquidation. For the first time in Federal law,\n\n[[Page S11936]]\n\nwe are contemplating the possibility of shutting down passenger rail in \nthis country.\n  So while those of us who put in the hard work that made this moment \npossible should rightfully be proud of those efforts, we must not lose \nsight of the big picture. While we have bought a little more time for \nAmtrak, we have by no means assured that passenger rail--essential to \nthe efficient operation of every other industrial economy's \ntransportation system--will survive in the United States.\n  Over the next 5 years, there will be more tough choices as we move \ntoward the twin goals of a balanced Federal budget and the end of \nFederal operating support for our country's passenger rail system. If \nwe fail to provide Amtrak with the resources it needs to modernize, to \nattract the ridership and revenues that can advance the goal of self-\nsufficiency, today's accomplishment will be hollow.\n  I am not convinced, Mr. President, that we have chosen the right \ncourse for passenger rail in this country. No one argues against \nreforms that make the best use of taxpayers dollars, reforms that \npermit Amtrak to make use of the best business practices to attract \nriders and to expand our country's passenger rail system.\n  But by themselves, those reforms will not relieve us of our \nresponsibility to keep passenger rail alive.\n  Senator Kerry reminded us today that the European Community has \ncommitted to major new investments on top of their substantial \ncontributions to their continent's passenger rails system. As the most \nproductive economy in the world, we should face up to the need to make \nsimilar commitments here.\n  So many benefits flow from these investments--benefits that can be \nmeasured, but not always on the books of any given passenger rail \nsystem--that the rest of the developed world is willing to make that \nkind of commitment. Those benefits include more efficient use of fuel, \ncleaner air, reduced congestion on our highways and at our airports--\nreal benefits that add up to real dollars saved that can be put to \nbetter use.\n  In today's world--with balanced budgets and increased economic \ncompetition--we must make sure that we capture those benefits and save \nthose dollars. That is why the fight for passenger rail in the United \nStates is far from over today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote that \nwas scheduled for 2:15 be delayed until the end of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join with the Senator \nfrom Texas, the chairman of the Commerce Committee, the Senator from \nArizona, Senator Hollings, Senator Breaux in strongly supporting Amtrak \nitself and, equally important, supporting this reauthorization bill \nwhich is pending before the Senate.\n  I offer my sincere thanks to the Senator from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, for her persistence on behalf not just of the bill but \nparticularly Amtrak, which she just talked about, which she has vision \nof and of which we share a vision.\n  I also thank Senator McCain who worked hard with all of us. Despite \nhis own very deeply felt misgivings regarding federally subsidized \npassenger rail, as chairman he was very fair to all of the opinions \nthat existed on the committee and gave us the opportunity to be able to \ncome together to forge what I think is a good compromise.\n  A compromise, obviously, doesn't leave everybody happy. It is not \nsupposed to. There are folks on both sides of the aisle who, if they \nwrote their own bill, would have written a different bill. Clearly, \nthat is true. But it is because we reached that compromise that I think \nwe put Amtrak in a position not only to survive but to thrive, and we \nhave preserved the rights of labor to be able to negotiate \nappropriately for their relationship with the management.\n  I will not review, in the interest of time, any of the specific \nprovisions at this moment. Senator Hutchison has done that. Senator \nMcCain has done that. But I would like to take a moment just to \nemphasize what I think can't be emphasized enough, which is the \nimportance of Amtrak to the country and particularly important to the \nNortheast Corridor Improvement Project and to the transportation \ninfrastructure of the Northeast region of the country. I think it is \nimportant to all the regions it reaches, but I particularly point out \nthat the future completion of the Northeast corridor, which this \nlegislation will help to ensure, is expected to attract 3 million \nadditional passengers annually between New York and Boston.\n  This improved rail service is going to ease the congestion of Logan \nand other major Northeast airports. The Federal Railroad Administration \nexpects passenger air service between Boston and New York to decrease \nby 40 percent as a result of these measures and to result in the \nelimination of over 50 daily New York-Boston flights. Indeed, without \nthis legislation, and without the continued modernization of rail \ntravel in the Northeast, the four airports between New York and Boston \nwould be projected to produce annual passenger delays of over 20 \nmillion hours per year. That is lost productivity. That is a lost \ncompetitive edge for our country, as well as for the region.\n  We can expect improved Northeast rail service that will come as a \nresult of this legislation to have a spillover positive impact on road \ncongestion. Mr. President, 5.9 billion passenger miles were taken on \nAmtrak in 1994. These are trips that were not taken on crowded highways \nand airways. Improved rail service in the Northeast is projected to \neliminate over 300,000 auto trips each year from highways that are \nincreasingly overly congested, and it will reduce auto congestion \naround the airports as well as improving air quality for the country \nand in the Northeast.\n  As these figures demonstrate, a healthy and financially viable \npassenger rail system is the key to ensuring an efficient \ntransportation infrastructure in our country. We simply cannot \ncontinue, in some parts of the country certainly, to build more and \nmore roads and more and more airports. The space doesn't allow it. We \nshould look to Europe, and we should look to Japan, and we should look \nto other countries for the experience that they have had as more and \nmore of the square miles of their country are consumed by business and \nby living space and where they have had to make use of those spaces \neffectively.\n  The fact is that in the United States of America within the next 20 \nto 30 years, the vast majority of our population, 75 percent of it, \nwill live within 50 miles of coastline, including the Great Lakes. We \nwill need to consider how we move people and products as those areas \nbecome more crowded.\n  So, simply stated, we need Amtrak because we cannot continue to pave \nour way out of our transportation problems. I would like to take just a \nquick moment to address some of those in the Congress who criticize \nAmtrak and any kind of Federal subsidy of rail as a form of some kind \nof central planning that is inherently dangerous and that supposedly \nthe United States has always avoided. The fact is, Mr. President, we \nhave not only not always avoided it; we have relied significantly on \nthat kind of Federal input and planning to help us to be able to build \nthe network of transportation that we rely on.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, we in Congress have been proactive \nand aggressive about this kind of assistance. You can drive in one \nrelatively straight line from the northern coast of Maine to Florida on \na well-paved road because the Federal Government planned it and because \nwe funded the Interstate Highway System. The planning and construction \nof our Nation's ports and canal networks, transcontinental railroads, \nthe air traffic control system, and the Interstate Highway System are \nall examples of Federal leadership in transportation policy which led \nto overall economic growth, to improved transportation efficiency and, \nfinally, to the development of entirely new industries.\n  Indeed, while we in Congress have argued over whether the Federal \nGovernment should or shouldn't ensure a healthy inter-city rail system, \ninternationally it is no secret that a well-founded rail network is an \nessential ingredient of a strong 21st century economy.\n\n[[Page S11937]]\n\n  In fact, every major economic power, except the United States, \ninvests several billions of dollars annually in passenger rail \ntransportation. The European Union plans to invest more than $100 \nbillion to better utilize and integrate its multibillion-dollar-rail \nnetwork. And our economic competitors in Asia, including China, Taiwan, \nMalaysia, and South Korea, are all investing heavily in rail.\n  The unfortunate truth is that on a per capita basis, at least 34 \ncountries, including Guinea, Myanmar, South Africa, Iran, and Botswana \neach spend more than the United States on passenger rail. In this \nlight, which I think is the correct light in which to view what we are \ndoing today, we are doing the bare minimum necessary to ensure \ncontinued passenger rail travel in the United States and to maintain a \nvibrant national transportation network.\n\n  Finally, I would like to take a moment just to say something about \nthe men and women in Amtrak's labor organizations who work \nextraordinarily hard daily to ensure that the trains are in working \norder, that the tracks are maintained and that millions of Americans \nare able to get to work and travel comfortably and safely from city to \ncity.\n  Much has been made in the arguments over reform about labor \nprovisions in U.S. law which did give protections to those who worked \non Amtrak. Those protections were to guarantee that their jobs wouldn't \nbe contracted away or that a specific level of a severance might exist \nin order to safeguard them.\n  Before one overly criticizes those provisions which we have changed \nand which, in my judgment, we appropriately came to a compromise on, \nrecognizing the times that we now live in, but it is important to not \nbe overly cynical about them and to, frankly, understand the context in \nwhich they came about.\n  Amtrak was formed only in the 1970`s, and the reason it was formed \nwas that the freight carriers were unwilling to continue to provide \npassenger service. It was unclear at the time whether a new entity, \ncalled Amtrak, was going to be able to survive at all. It needed \nexperienced, skillful workers in order to be able to put that survival \nto the test, in order to try to become a viable entity.\n  So to attract those skilled, viable workers from another job under \nanother umbrella which they worked in where they had a pension and \nwhere they had years of experience, it was necessary to say to them, \n``You are not going to lose your job immediately. We are going to \nguarantee you that for taking the risk for helping to make Amtrak work, \nwe will provide you with a guarantee.''\n  The labor provisions that are at issue in this debate were originally \nput into Amtrak law in order to attract employees from other carriers \nso that they would work for Amtrak. Simply stated, the provisions \nguaranteed that people who came to work for Amtrak when they didn't \nknow it would survive would receive nothing more than the protection \nthey had enjoyed previously.\n  Since that time, I point out to my colleagues, that Amtrak employees \nhave made tremendous financial sacrifices in order to help keep Amtrak \ngoing. I don't think those have been recognized. In the early 1980's, \nAmtrak employees agreed to a 12-percent wage deferral in order to help \nAmtrak's bottom line. This deferral has never been repaid. So in point \nof fact, it became not a deferral, it became a wage giveback, a 12-\npercent wage giveback.\n  From 1987 through 1992, Amtrak employees agreed to have their wages \nfrozen, even though management received salary increases as high as 15 \npercent during that period.\n  In addition, Amtrak employees are paid considerably less than workers \nholding similar jobs in other transportation agencies. For example, \nAmtrak car mechanics will earn $2,200 less than those car mechanics on \nAtlanta's commuter lines; $6,500 less than those on Chicago's commuter \nlines; and $16,300 less than those on New York's and New Jersey's PATH \ncommuter lines. A mechanic who started to work at Washington's Metro in \n1980 literally would have received over $100,000 more than if he or she \nhad worked for Amtrak.\n  So now with this bill, Amtrak's employees are making yet another \nsacrifice, and they are giving up statutory protections to allow them \nseverance benefits in the event of route cuts and also to change the \ncontracting-out provisions.\n  Mr. President, one of the reasons we have this bill is because Amtrak \nemployees have agreed to make this sacrifice. I think that those of us \nin Congress and the millions of Americans who enjoy Amtrak ought to be \ngrateful for their courage and commitment to its continued viability.\n  I believe we have laid the groundwork for Amtrak to survive. Labor \nwould be permitted to negotiate as normally as they can negotiate in \nthe marketing process. I think we have reached an accommodation that \nwill help us keep Amtrak not just alive but on the first steps to \nbecoming a model, hopefully, in the long run as we go into the next \ncentury for what a good passenger rail system can be.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from the great State of Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMassachusetts who was so helpful in working out this compromise. I \nthink, as he said, a lot of people had to give something that they \ndidn't want to give, which probably means that we did a fair \ncompromise. Senator Breaux, who is also on the floor, was very much a \npart of this. Senator Hollings, who was here, I also thank.\n  If there is no one else wishing to speak, then I would like to have \nthird reading and then go to a vote, if that is possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall it pass, as amended?\n  The bill (S. 738), as amended, was passed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, today the Senate acted in a fully bipartisan \nmanner to adopt meaningful and genuine legal, labor, and management \nreforms for America's national passenger railroad. It offers \nlegislative solutions that could begin to restore the fiscal health of \nthis failing railroad.\n  American taxpayers have already invested over $20 million in this \nrailroad.\n  Let me be clear: the Senate is sending a bipartisan message to this \nrailroad--the management and the workers must fundamentally change both \ntheir culture and operating methods.\n  Amtrak cannot continue getting subsidies.\n  The legislation adopted today is an amendment to the bill reported by \nthe Commerce Committee earlier this year. It is the bill sponsored by \nSenator Kay Bailey Hutchison. The amendment was a joint effort of \nseveral members of the Commerce Committee on both sides of the aisle.\n  I want to personally commend the Senate's Commerce Committee for \ntheir leadership on this important transportation issue.\n  I'm sure the nearly 2 million Americans who ride the commuter rail \nsystem every day want to also thank them.\n  I also want to recognize the work of a number of dedicated staffers \nwho have invested many hours, evenings and weekends to get the \nlegislative language right. The work was intense, emotional and \npersonal, but everyone maintained their professional manner and got the \njob done. The staff responsible for the details are: Ann Begeman, Clyde \nHart, Amy Henderson, James Drewry, Lloyd Ator, and Penny Compton.\n  Let me just take one moment and clarify one important issue within \nthis reform bill. The current industry practice between Amtrak and \nother rail carriers is to allocate financial responsibility for claims. \nThis makes sense and in fact many such contractual agreements exist \ntoday. The language in section 28103(b) of the bill is intended to \nconfirm that such contractual agreements are consistent with Federal \nlaw and public policy. One should not construe this section as \nmodifying such agreements.\n  Today, the Senate has taken action to ensure America's passenger rail \nservice will not be interrupted. And, the Senate also mandated reforms \nto assure a prosperous passenger railroad.\n\n[[Page S11938]]\n\n  Mr. President, this reauthorization reform for Amtrak is long \noverdue, but it is on the right track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11923-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11938-S11940]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF CHRISTINA A. SNYDER, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE U.S. DISTRICT \n              JUDGE FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Christina A. \nSnyder, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Christina A. Snyder, of \nCalifornia, to be U.S. district judge for the central district of \nCalifornia.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am glad to see that the Senate is finally \nturning its attention to the nomination of Christina Snyder. She was \nfirst nominated in May 1996, over 17 months ago. Her hearing was \nfinally held in July of this year and after another 2-month delay, she \nwas reported by the Judiciary Committee without objection. She has been \npending on the Senate Calendar without action and without any \nexplanation for the 2-month delay that has since ensued.\n  It seems that the delay in considering her nomination had nothing to \ndo with her outstanding qualifications or temperament or ability to \nserve as a Federal judge. Rather, it seems that some opposed this fine \nwoman and held up her nomination to a very busy court because she had \nencouraged lawyers to be involved in pro bono activities.\n  Ms. Snyder has been held up anonymously for months and months. When \nthe Judiciary Committee finally met to consider her nomination, I was \ncurious to learn who and what had delayed her confirmation for over a \nyear. But no one spoke against her and no one voted against her.\n  Ms. Snyder has been an outstanding lawyer, a member of the American \nLaw Institute, and someone who contributes to the community and has \nlived the ethical consideration under Canon 2 of the Code of \nProfessional Responsibility. I congratulate her on her outstanding \ncareer.\n  When she was being interrogated about her membership on the boards of \nPublic Counsel and the Western Center on Law and Public Interest, \nSenator Feingold properly observed:\n\n       [I]t is kind of an irony when we get to the day where if \n     you don't participate in pro bono activities, you are somehow \n     in a situation where your record is a little safer vis a vis \n     being appointed to a Federal judgeship. And then when you get \n     involved in pro bono activity, that might actually cause you \n     to get a few more questions. . . . [T]hat can't be an \n     encouragement for lawyers to get involved in pro bono \n     activities on behalf of people who don't have the ability to \n     go to court very easily.\n\n  After all these months, I was please to hear Senator Sessions \npronounce Ms. Snyder ``an outstanding individual with a fine record'' \nand ``a capable lawyer of integrity and ability,'' when her nomination \nwas considered by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I congratulate Ms. Snyder and her family and look forward to her \nservice on the Federal court.\n  Although I am delighted that the Senate will today be confirming \nChristina Snyder as a Federal district court judge, the Republican \nleadership has once again passed over and refused to take up the \nnomination of Margaret Morrow. Ms. Morrow's nomination is the longest \npending judicial nomination on the Senate Calendar, having languished \non the Senate Calendar since June 12.\n  The central district of California desperately needs this vacancy \nfilled, which has been open for more than 18 months, and Margaret \nMorrow is eminently qualified to fill it. Thus, while the Senate is \nfinally proceeded to fill one of the judicial emergency vacancies that \nhas plagued the U.S. District Court for the central district of \nCalifornia, it continues to shirk its duty with respect to the other \njudicial emergency vacancy, that for which Margaret Morrow was \nnominated on May 9, 1996.\n  Just 2 week's ago, the opponents of this nomination announced in a \npress conference that they welcomed a debate and rollcall vote on \nMargaret Morrow. But again the Republican majority leader has refused \nto bring up this well-qualified nominee for such debate and vote. It \nappears that Republicans have time for press conferences to attack one \nof the President's judicial nominations, but the majority leader will \nnot allow the U.S. Senate to turn to that nomination for a vote. We can \ndiscuss the nomination in sequential press conferences and weekend talk \nshow appearances but not in the one place that action must be taken on \nit, on the floor of the U.S. Senate.\n  The Senate has suffered through hours of quorum calls in the past few \nweeks which time would have been better spent debating and voting on \nthis judicial nomination. The extremist attacks on Margaret Morrow are \npuzzling--not only to those of us in the Senate who know her record but \nto those who know her best in California, including many Republicans.\n  They cannot fathom why a few senators have decided to target someone \nas well-qualified and as moderate as she is. Just this week I included \nin the Congressional Record a recent article from the Los Angeles Times \nby Henry Weinstein on the nomination of Margaret Morrow, entitled \n``Bipartisan Support Not Enough for Judicial Nominee.'' This article \ndocuments the deep and widespread bipartisan support that Margaret \nMorrow enjoys from Republicans that know her. In fact, these \nRepublicans are shocked that some Senators have attacked Ms. Morrow.\n  For example, Sheldon H. Sloan, a former president of the Los Angeles \nCounty Bar Association and an associate of Gov. Pete Wilson, declared \nthat: ``My party has the wrong woman in their sights.'' Stephen S. \nTrott, a former high-ranking official in the Reagan administration and \nnow a Court of Appeals Judge wrote to the majority leader to try to \nfree up the Morrow nomination, according to this article Judge Trott \ninformed Senator Lott:\n\n       ``I know that you are concerned, and properly so, about the \n     judicial philosophy of each candidate to the federal bench. \n     So am I. I have taken the oath, and I know what it means: \n     follow the law, don't make it up to suit your own purposes. \n     Based on my own long acquaintance with Margaret Morrow, I \n     have every confidence she will respect the limitations of a \n     judicial position.''\n\n  Robert Bonner, the former head of DEA under a Republican \nadministration, observed in the article that: ``Margaret has gotten \ntangled in a web of larger forces about Clinton nominees. She is a mere \npawn in this struggle.'' I could not agree more.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article by \nTerry Carter from the Los Angeles Daily Journal entitled ``Is Jihad on \nJudicial Activism About Principle or Politics?'' In that article \nSenator Sessions is quoted as saying that the Senate ``can have a vote \non [Morrow] nomination tomorrow.'' Well, today is tomorrow. It is high \ntime to free the nomination of Margaret Morrow for debate and a vote.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Los Angeles Daily Journal, Nov. 6, 1997]\n\n       Is Jihad on Judicial Activism About Principle or Politics?\n\n                           (By Terry Carter)\n\n       Washington.--Three years after being nominated for the \n     federal bench--having been branded a California ``activist,'' \n     grilled by Senate Judiciary Committee members about her \n     personal voting habits and consigned to nomination limbo by \n     an unidentified senator's ``hold''--it would have been \n     understandable if Los Angeles lawyer Margaret Morrow began \n     composing a withdrawal letter in her head.\n       If she did, she could have looked for inspiration to what \n     previous failed nominees had written.\n       ``Despite the unpleasantness of the process, I am grateful \n     for the honor of having had your support,'' one would-be \n     federal judge wrote to his sponsor. ``. . .For a while there, \n     I really thought that your Herculean efforts had overcome the \n     false and misleading charges that were made against me.''\n       The author of that letter found salve in a manner few dream \n     of. After his 1986 bid for a judgeship fell to a party line \n     vote, then-Alabama U.S. Attorney Jeff Sessions, who faced \n     questionable charges of racial insensitivity during Judiciary \n     Committee hearings, went on to become a two-term governor and \n     was\n\n[[Page S11939]]\n\n     elected to the Senate in 1994 along with a number of other \n     uncompromising firebrands. Today, Sessions sits on the very \n     Judiciary Committee that rejected him, and he holds his thumb \n     up or down on judicial nominations.\n       In an interview, Sessions said, ``We can have a vote on \n     [Morrow] tomorrow as far as I'm concerned. And I'd want to \n     talk about some of her writings and statements and the Senate \n     could vote.'' Sessions went on to say, ``Margaret Morrow has \n     written disrespectfully of the potential for good public \n     policy coming out of the referendums in California. We have a \n     real popular uproar over judges who've overturned \n     referendums.''\n       She likely would be, Sessions said, ``a judicial \n     activist.''\n       In the judicial activism wars, Morrow will be either a \n     victim or a survivor. In the spring, Morrow, a partner with \n     Arnold & Porter and the first woman president of the State \n     Bar, made it through the committee on a 13-5 vote.\n       Tough questions from, among others, Sen. Charles Grassley, \n     R-Iowa, about how she voted on past state referenda were seen \n     by many observers as transparent attempts to see how, as a \n     judge, she might rule on matters concerning immigration, the \n     death penalty, medical use of marijuana and other hot-button \n     issues. But she seemed to weather the storm. Even the \n     conservative Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, \n     R-Utah, finally pronounced Morrow fit, saying his reservation \n     about her potential for judicial activism had been assuaged. \n     Now that her name has gone to the floor, her candidacy is \n     promised a full-fledged debate by both sides.\n       Either way, Morrow has come to define the renewed flare-up \n     of the age-old debate over the role of judges, predicted 200 \n     years ago by Madison and Hamilton in the Federalist Papers. \n     But there is a difference this time. Swirling in the \n     background is a clash of old and new politics on Capitol \n     Hill, particularly among Republicans campaigning for re-\n     election and intent on keeping control of the Congress, even \n     as they battle among themselves over leadership.\n       Republicans didn't have to look far to find a bogeyman in \n     the judiciary--which not only is a good target, but it can't \n     fight back.\n       Chasing so-called judicial activists is more than sucker-\n     punching a patsy, as liberals put it. It gives Republicans \n     something to do together while battling over party \n     leadership. The excesses, the speed, have come mostly from \n     the Young Turks and some old hands trying to get ahead. \n     Whenever one pulls a foot off the accelerator to slow it \n     down, another jams it to the floor--and no one wants out of \n     the car.\n       ``On this issue it's more strategy and tactics that bring \n     disagreement among conservatives, not goals and objectives,'' \n     said Elliot Mincberg, counsel for the liberal interest group \n     People for the American Way. The Young Turks and the \n     establishment all agree to keep as many Clinton nominees off \n     the bench as they can in a four-year stall, as much as they \n     can get away with it.\n       The old guard hasn't gone out of its way to thwart the \n     excesses. One of the most extreme of those was the \n     announcement by Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, earlier this year \n     that he would seek impeachment of activist judges. DeLay \n     recently reiterated the threat, and added that he wants it to \n     ``intimidate'' judges.\n       Republican colleagues are quick to say that's beyond the \n     pale, that impeachment for individual rulings won't happen, \n     but, they admit, they like how it pushes the curve farther to \n     the right.\n       A good example of that right-shifting spectrum is Hatch's \n     unilateral move earlier this year to end the American Bar \n     Association's formal role of advising the Senate on judicial \n     nominations, though individual senators still receive \n     reports, and the more important pre-screening for the White \n     House continues. Hatch told colleagues privately that he did \n     so to keep the hard liners from doing worse. He said he's in \n     the middle, but the middle keeps moving to the right.\n       The hunt for judicial activists is also proving a good \n     fund-raising tool for some Republicans. Another freshman \n     senator on the Judiciary Committee, John Ashcroft, R-Mo., \n     already is signaling a run for the presidency. It was \n     Ashcroft who placed the ``hold'' on the Morrow nomination, it \n     was revealed last month. And Ashcroft used his chairmanship \n     of the subcommittee on the Constitution, Federalism and \n     Property Rights to hold hearings on judicial activism this \n     year. ``Its a good launching pad,'' said one Hill staffer. A \n     sophisticated Internet user, Ashcroft at one point dedicated \n     much of his Web site to judicial activism.\n       He is one of only 10 senators, for several months one of \n     only six, to sign the so-called Hatch Pledge, which was \n     crafted in February by the Judicial Selection Monitoring \n     Project, a spinoff of the conservative Free Congress \n     Education and Research Foundation. Each senator was asked to \n     sign the pledge. It seized a sentence from a speech by Hatch \n     at a Federalist Society meeting in his home state. ``Those \n     nominees who are or will be judicial activists should not be \n     nominated by the president or conformed by the Senate, and I \n     personally will do my best to see that they are not.''\n       Hatch himself declined the request, citing personal policy \n     against signing pledges, but he praised the efforts of the \n     coalition of 260 conservative groups brought together by the \n     Judicial Selection Monitoring Project. Also not joining \n     Ashcroft in signing it were Grassley and Sessions. ``I \n     believe in fighting judicial activism but I don't need to \n     sign a pledge,'' Sessions said. While judicial activism has \n     been debated hotly the past two years in a presidential \n     campaign, congressional hearings, on op-ed pages and in think \n     tanks and bar panel discussions; the term's definition \n     remains slippery. ``It has been debased by conservatives so \n     badly it has degenerated into an epithet for decisions you \n     don't like--it's aimed only at results,'' said Bruce Fein, a \n     former high-ranking official in the Ronald Reagan Justice \n     Department.\n       Just the same, the debate quickened and became more focused \n     in June when the Supreme Court struck down federal laws \n     concerning religious freedom, Internet decency and handgun \n     regulation. Outcries from both the left and the right \n     questioned the process--calling it judicial activism--that \n     led to these results.\n       No one did so more strongly than Hatch, who is considered \n     by many to be an ideological soul-mate of Chief Justice \n     William Rehnquist and Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence \n     Thomas. But those three were in the majority that were \n     against Hatch's own Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which \n     Congress enacted to maneuver around an earlier Supreme Court \n     ruling.\n       ``The Supreme Court has thrown down a gauntlet,'' Hatch \n     said in a statement released the day after the decision was \n     announced. ``I intend to pick it up.'' After stumping against \n     judicial activism for the better part of a year, Hatch \n     suddenly expanded the term. Now he complained about \n     ``conservative judicial activism.''\n       Perhaps, as a result, there will be a finer point to the \n     debate, which is likely to continue. It has quickened in \n     academia. But asking legal scholars to define judicial \n     activism is like asking judges to interpret the Constitution. \n     Often the only common thread is their certainty. An activist \n     against judicial activism, Thomas Jipping of the Judicial \n     Selection Monitoring Project offers a quote from Humpty \n     Dumpty in a colloquy with Alice after she ventured beyond the \n     looking glass: ``When I use a word it means just what I \n     choose it to mean--neither more nor less.''\n       Without using the term, Justice John Paul Stevens, in a 35-\n     page dissent in Printz v. US, which struck down parts of the \n     Bready Handgun Violence Prevention Act, chided his \n     conservative colleagues--Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas in \n     particular--for engaging in the kind of judicial activism \n     they've eschewed so vocally in the past. Stevens pointed out \n     that they had resorted to ``emanations'' and ``penumbras'' \n     from the Constitution, tools liberals often are accused of \n     wielding to torture the document.\n       While there is no locus classicus defining judicial \n     activism, Laurence Tribe at Harvard Law School may trump them \n     all: ``To say there is a neutral vantage point outside the \n     system for someone to declare in an Olympian and purportedly \n     objective way that this is activism and that is restraint is \n     itself a rather arrogant delusion.''\n       But then, Tribe comes from the ``eye of the beholder'' \n     school of thought, which tends to be composed of liberals. \n     Those in the middle offer ``on the one hand, and not the \n     other'' definitions. And conservative scholars usually define \n     the term in considerable detail and nuance, with explanations \n     of the mistakes others make in trying to do so.\n       Most are quick to mention specific cases, both old and \n     recent. Some still argue Marbury v. Madison. 5 U.S. 137 \n     (1803).\n       The conservative constitutional law professor Michael \n     McConnell, now teaching at the University of Utah College of \n     Law, made this response to Tribe. During the past 10 to 20 \n     years, he said, the term judicial activism ``has been a \n     rhetorical theme of conservatives criticizing the court, and \n     it's only natural that their ideological opposites would try \n     to deconstruct and weaken that by saying it could be anything \n     in the eye of the beholder.''\n       McConnell offered a definition: ``When a court imposes its \n     own moral or political judgments in place of those of the \n     democratically elected branches, without adequate warrant in \n     the constitutional text, history, structure and precedent.'' \n     But then he acknowledged the eye-of-the-beholder argument. \n     ``The devil is in the subordinate clause because we all see \n     that differently,'' McConnell added.\n       A corollary to the argument that judicial activism is in \n     the beholder's eye might be that made by some that it is \n     necessary. Conservatives have complained for years that \n     liberals went to the courts to get policy they couldn't \n     muster through legislatures. Now many conservatives would \n     like to turn the tables.\n       Clint Bolick, director of the libertarian Cato Institute's \n     Center for Constitutional Studies, believes the courts \n     ``should play a feisty role.'' The courts, particularly the \n     Supreme Court, were intended to be ``a vigorous guardian of \n     individual liberties against the encroachment of other \n     branches of government,'' he explained. So at Cato, ``we're \n     in the business of securing judicial activism of the right \n     kind, as in the correct kind.'' The Supreme Court's decisions \n     striking down several federal laws this past term are ``the \n     way the court is supposed to be activist,'' he said.\n       In a more playful take on reining in judicial activism a \n     belt with a jagged edge, the pro-life, Christian-oriented \n     Family Research Council in June announced winners of its \n     Court Jesters Award, for judges it believes stepped out of \n     bounds. Noticeably missing\n\n[[Page S11940]]\n\n     from the list, as the conservative gratify Fein pointed out, \n     were two who made headlines during the year. One is federal \n     Judge John Spizzo in New York, who acquitted two men arrested \n     for blocking access to an abortion clinic because their \n     actions stemmed from ``conscience-driven religious belief'' \n     rather than willful criminal intent. The other is a state \n     court judge in Alabama who posted in Ten Commandments in his \n     courtroom and invited clergy to lead juries in prayer prior \n     to hearing cases. The FRC's director, Gary Bauer, was willing \n     to offer a written definition of judicial activism for this \n     story but was unavailable over several weeks for an interview \n     to discuss the topic.\n       ``So many conservatives are so unprincipled in attacking \n     judicial activism because the real grievance is against the \n     results they don't like,'' said Fein, a columnist for the \n     conservative Washington Times newspaper and a regular \n     commentator on CNN, ``And the standards Republicans are now \n     voicing to screen Clinton nominees is what they said in the \n     Bork hearings should never be applied,'' he said referring to \n     the failed Republican nomination of Robert Bork in 1986.\n       The Jihad against judicial activism is seen some, in part, \n     as the continuation of a dynamic the simmered through the \n     Bork hearings: a long continuing battle against the Warren \n     and Burger court. For one such attack through the rear-view \n     minor former attorney general Edwin Meese appeared Ashcroft's \n     hearings on judicial activism. A fellow the Heritage \n     Foundation, Meese followed up, releasing to the Judiciary \n     Committee a report titled ``Putting the Federal Judiciary \n     Back on Track.'' The former Reagan administration official \n     wants a number of landmark decisions by the Warren and Burger \n     courts reversed, and agrees with Bork much-criticized belief \n     that Congress should be empowered to overrule Supreme Court \n     decision by simple majority vote.\n       For some, that rear-view mirror is cloudy. ``The irony of \n     complaints now about judicial activism,'' said Professor \n     Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern California \n     Law School, ``is that the majority of justices on the Supreme \n     Court and the majority of federal judges are Republican \n     appointees. And the Supreme Court hasn't recognized a new \n     constitutional right in 25 years.''\n       That may be why many believe the judicial activism wars are \n     more of a political tool. Federal judges and the Supreme \n     Court are ``pushing fewer hot bottoms than they were 25 or 30 \n     or 40 years ago,'' said A.E. Dick Howard, a constitutional \n     scholar at the University of Virginia School of Law. The \n     debate over judicial activism ``is not as hot today. No \n     attack on the modern court is comparable to [President \n     Richard] Nixon's attacks on the Warren court.''\n       There is no broad-based criticism of the courts today that \n     compares to the time of Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. \n     483 (1954), and issues of one-person-one-vote and school \n     prayer. Howard explained. Criticism today is more episodic, \n     he said.\n       On Capitol Hill, senators trying to break the lock on \n     judicial nominations believe Chief Justice Rehnquist should \n     go further than criticizing it in his annual report on the \n     judiciary, ``Who reads that?'' asks one Senate staffer, ``He \n     needs to get out and say it in speeches.'' And others say \n     that if President Clinton went to war over one or two judges, \n     win or lose in Senate confirmations, the floodgates would \n     open for all the others. ``Every time a president has fought, \n     if it looks like he's fighting for principle, he wins \n     politically,'' said Professor Herman Schwartz, of American \n     University's Washington College of Law. ``People would pay \n     attention, American like an independent judiciary.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Daschle and I have been talking \nabout the rest of the schedule this afternoon.\n  First, once again, I am very pleased that after 3 years of effort, we \nhave a bipartisan compromise on Amtrak reform. That was a good day's \nwork. It still has to go to conference, but I believe now that we have \na good chance to get that legislation through. That would be very \nbeneficial to maintaining a national rail passenger system that would \npay for itself.\n  I believe we are now prepared to go to the D.C. bill. We have worked \nout an agreement on that. Then later on this afternoon we hope to be \nable to have another vote. We hoped we would get something on the \nlabor-HHS appropriations conference report. We don't know for sure, but \nthat may not be possible. We still have the option to go back to fast \ntrack, and there are some amendments, I am sure, that are in the \noffing. But whatever votes we would have this afternoon, and it appears \nit would be a minimum of one more vote, but the last vote for today \nwould occur not later than 5 p.m. this afternoon, and we would then \ncome back in tomorrow at noon and get an assessment of where we are.\n  We are still hoping there may be an FDA reform conference report \nagreement. There is a possibility. We have worked out an agreement on \nthe adoption-foster-care issue. If either of those are ready, we would \ntry to do those tomorrow afternoon. We also would get an assessment of \nwhat will happen with regard to the appropriations bills coming from \nthe House and also see if there is any way we can take some action that \nwould help to expedite some conclusion to the appropriations process.\n  With regard to fast track, we will continue to go back to it and have \ndiscussion, debate, and amendments when they are ready. The House has \ndelayed their taking a vote on fast track until Saturday or Sunday. \nThey will not do it today. Of course, that will have an impact on what \nwe do and when we do it. I don't think we can say anything beyond that \nuntil we see what happens in the House.\n  We have been asked by our colleagues in the House and by the \nadministration to stay and continue to work to see if we can resolve \nthe outstanding issues\n\n[[Page S11941]]\n\non appropriations and be prepared to act on fast track, if and when the \nHouse does act. We will keep the Members informed. We will try to be \nconscious of schedules, but I think you should be prepared to have at \nleast one more vote this afternoon, and there is a possibility that \nthere would be a vote or two tomorrow afternoon and Sunday afternoon.\n  Again, on Sunday we would not be in until probably 1 o'clock to give \nMembers an opportunity to go to church. One of the reasons why we won't \nhave votes after 5 o'clock tonight is because of the Jewish sabbath. We \nare trying to honor Members' commitments in that regard while still \ntrying to move this process forward.\n  There is a 50-50 chance, still, that we can finish all this by \nSunday. There is one thing for sure: If we don't stay here and keep \nworking, there is a 100-percent chance we will be here next Friday. \nLet's keep trying to get it to a conclusion. I believe it is possible.\n  I thank Senator Daschle for collaborating with me on these issues. I \nwonder if the minority leader might want to add anything?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I think the majority leader has laid it out pretty well. \nWe have had a lot of questions about what the schedule is for the \nweekend. As the majority leader has indicated, we can expect to be here \ntomorrow and most likely on Sunday. I think if we can work as we have \nin the last few hours on appropriations bills and other related \nlegislation, there is at least that 50-50 chance we can complete our \nwork this weekend.\n  One of the concerns that I have been hearing is that at some of the \nmeetings we are not getting the kind of attendance that is necessary in \norder to complete the negotiations.

Mr. President, a court decision was issued recently which \ncould throw the entire system of supplying milk to consumers into chaos \nand could lead to dramatically higher milk prices for consumers.\n  This decision was a runaway ruling that jeopardizes the survival of \nthousands of dairy farmers outside the Midwest.\n  The current milk marketing order system assures local milk production \nand reliable supplies of fresh and wholesome local milk.''\n  The system is designed, according to the Congressional Research \nService, to avoid ``shortages of milk,'' and ``to assure consumers of \nadequate and dependable supplies of pure and wholesome fluid milk.''\n  In this respect, America is the envy of many nations in the world \nwhich have unreliable milk supplies shipped in from distant locations \nat high prices because there is no local competition.\n  Price differentials, which were struck down in this decision, help \nkeep local producers in business, help cover the costs of transporting \nfluid milk, and avoid shortages of milk in supermarkets, according to \nCRS.\n  Common sense tells us that the cost of producing and transporting \nmilk varies from region to region. A flat pricing system is flat-out \nwrong.\n  I joined with 47 of my colleagues recently in sending a letter to the \nSecretary of Agriculture urging him to keep the current system which \nassures local supplies of fresh milk to millions of American families.\n  The key to this system that has worked so well for decades is under \nattack--once again--in Minnesota.\n  It is no secret that Northern Midwestern States want to provide milk \nto the Nation. New technology is available where they can ``drain'' the \nwater out of their milk, ship the resulting concentrate, and then \nreconstitute the milk at distant locations.\n  Over time, this new concentration of the dairy industry in Northern \nMidwestern States could put thousands of dairy farmers out of business \naround the Nation. I am very afraid that, ultimately, prices to \nconsumers will rise as the supply of milk becomes more and more \nconcentrated in one area of the country.\n  My major fear is that when Midwestern winter storms blanket roads \nwith snow, or when freezing conditions in the North stop traffic on the \ninterstates, or when there is a trucker's strike, that consumers in the \nrest of the country are going to feel lucky if they can buy milk for \njust $5 a gallon. Parents who need milk for children might want to pay \na lot more than $5 a gallon, if they could buy milk at any price.\n  I do not think consumers are going to like this system of being \ndependent on reconstituted milk being shipped in from 1,000 miles away \nat who knows what price.\n  Our current system of encouraging local production of milk works very \nwell for consumers. USDA has been right to promote the local production \nof fresh milk instead of this system of concentrating the industry in \none region and then shipping products to be reconstituted into milk \nlater.\n  The Court's ruling--unless stayed--will be effective almost \nimmediately. the order will not have a great deal of effect in states \nfortunate enough to be in Northeast Dairy Compact, or in states that \nhave their own milk order system such as California.\n  In those states, local dairy farmers should be able to stay in \nbusiness and provide towns and cities with local, fresh supplies of \nmilk.\n  When disasters, or winter storms hit, consumers in these areas will \nbe able to buy milk.\n  USDA must appeal the decision immediately--no ifs, ands, or buts. The \nexistence of thousands of dairy farmers is at stake.\n  It is unclear to me precisely which order regions will be affected by \nthe Court order. The Order terminates Class I differentials in ``all \nsurplus and balanced marketing orders and all deficit orders that do \nnot rely on direct shipments of alternative milk supplies from the \nUpper Midwest or from other deficit orders which in turn rely on the \nUpper Midwest for replacement supplies.''\n  A balanced market is one with sufficient milk to meet demand plus a \n40% reserve. A surplus market produces milk in excess of the demand and \nreserve percentage.\n  Thus, a few Southeastern states may be exempt from the Order.\n  For states like New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and some \nSoutheastern states, and southern Midwestern states, impact of the \nOrder should come swiftly as banks decline to make loans to dairy \nfarmers.\n  The expectation is that producer income will drop significantly and \nthat farmers would go out of business as lenders refuse to provide \ncredit.\n  Prices in the Northern Midwest could strengthen 20 to 30 cents per \nhundredweight (one-hundred pounds) sold--but it is too early to really \nknow how much their prices would go up.\n  This action was originally filed some years ago by Eric Olsen, \nPatricia Jensen, James Massey and Lynn Hayes representing the Farmers \nLegal Aid Action Group. It was filed before the Honorable Judge David \nS. Doty of the Fourth Division for the District of Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, I know that my distinguished colleague from Vermont, \nMr. Jeffords, will also be addressing the Senate on the same issue. \nAgain, It is about a court decision that was issued recently which \ncould throw the entire system of supplying milk to consumers into chaos \nand could also lead to dramatically higher milk prices for consumers.\n  The decision was a runaway ruling that jeopardizes the survival of \nthousands of dairy farmers everywhere except the Midwest.\n  Now, the current milk marketing order system, which is a very complex\n\n[[Page S11942]]\n\none, assures local milk production, and it assures reliable supplies of \nfresh and wholesome local milk. In this respect, we are the envy here \nin the United States of most nations of the world. Most nations have \nunreliable milk supplies that are shipped in from distant locations at \nhigh prices, because there is no local competition. Common sense tells \nus that the cost of producing and transporting milk varies from region \nto region. You can't have a flatout pricing system that is the same \neverywhere.\n  Now, again, I joined with 47 other Senators recently in sending a \nletter to the Secretary of Agriculture urging him to keep the current \nsystem, which assures local supplies of fresh milk to millions of \nAmericans. It's no secret that northern Midwestern States want to \nprovide all the milk to the Nation. They have a technology where they \ntake all the water out of their milk and you get this kind of ``glop'' \nthat is left, and you ship it to distant places and somebody pumps some \nwater back into it, and you end up with this reconstituted milk, which \nthey can then sell. If you do that, what is going to happen is that the \n``glop\" producers of this reconstituted milk will all be in one part of \nthe country and the rest of us will be everywhere else in the country. \nThe rest of the country will be at their mercy, depending upon when, \nhow often, and at what price they want to send this concentrate to us.\n  Now, my major fear is--especially coming from a part of the country \nthat has severe winters--what happens when the Midwestern winter storms \nblanket roads with snow, or you get the freezing conditions in the \nNorth and that stops traffic on the Interstates? It happens fairly \noften. Or what happens when there is a truckers' strike? When that \nhappens, I think you are going to find consumers in the country feeling \nlucky they can buy milk for $5 a gallon. Parents who need milk for \ntheir children might have to pay a lot more than $5 a gallon if they \nhave to buy milk at whatever price. Whatever price they get it for, it \nis going to be the reconstituted ``glop'' coming to that area--and \nwater is going to have to be added--from producers from a thousand \nmiles away. I don't think this makes much sense. I like the system we \nhave today, which encourages producers in a number of different areas \nof the country where they can produce fresh milk for the consumers at \nprices they can afford.\n  Now, the court's ruling will be effective immediately. It is not \ngoing to have a great deal of effect on the States in the Northeast \ndairy compact or States who have their own milk order system, such as \nCalifornia. In those States, local dairy farmers should be able to stay \nin business and provide local, fresh supplies of milk. When disasters \nand winter storms hit, consumers in those areas will be able to get \nmilk. What I worry about is all the other areas.\n  The Department of Agriculture has to appeal this decision \nimmediately--no ifs, ands, or buts. The existence of thousands of dairy \nfarmers is at stake. USDA has to act for these farmers and for the \nconsumers.\n  Mr. President, I see my distinguished colleague from Vermont on the \nfloor. I now yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Vermont for \nraising what could be a very important issue to all of the people of \nthis country who like milk. I don't understand how a court could do \nthat, other than the fact that, when I read he was from Minnesota, I \nnew why it was done. The judiciary sometimes gets a little prone to its \nown constituency. But I want to tell you, I want to raise the danger \nthat this precedent sets. I urge Secretary Glickman to appeal the \njudge's decision and to make sure that this does not maintain an \nexistence.\n  If this ruling survives, it could be the final financial blow to many \nfarmers throughout the country. It could also lead to higher prices \nconsumers pay for their milk. Senator Leahy and I have stood on the \nfloor many times defending Vermont's dairy farmers and dairy farmers \nacross the country. We have fought to give both the dairy farmers and \nthe consumers a fair and stable milk price. At times, debates on dairy \npolicy have pitted one region against the other. In this case, a group \nof Midwestern milk producers hope to eliminate the pricing structure \nfor fluid milk that dairy farmers and consumers rely upon for stable \nprices.\n  This methodology of creating a system to provide differentials was \ncreated way back in our history, at a time when the original milk acts \nwere considered, recognizing that it's incredibly important that we \nhave fluid milk available to the families all across the Nation. One \nonly has to remember back a few years ago when there was a tremendous \ndrought in Minnesota and Wisconsin, in the area where these farmers say \nthey can produce it for all the country. As a result of that, we had \nthe huge price increases. We had to supply milk to other regions \nbecause they could not produce it sufficiently in Minnesota and \nWisconsin. That is a demonstration as to why the original dairy \nlegislation in the acts of the thirties made sure that this fluid milk \nwould be available across the Nation at all times, understanding the \nneed for fresh milk.\n  If this ruling of the judge from Minnesota prevails, the entire \ncountry may ultimately rely on Minnesota and her bordering States for \ntheir milk supply. This would be extremely dangerous to consumers for \nprices and not being able to get it because of the lack of milk.\n  I know that in Vermont, every morning--and I am sure it's the same at \nbreakfast tables across the country--people enjoy fresh milk that was \nproduced and packaged within a reasonable distance of their home and at \nreasonable prices. There are many other reasons for maintaining a \nhealthy dairy industry in each region. The economic and social benefits \nripple through each farming community.\n  Mr. President, the present system for pricing fluid milk is currently \nunder consideration from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. There is \ntremendous support for maintaining the current pricing structure for \nfluid milk. Recently, as Senator Leahy mentioned, 48 Senators and 113 \nHouse Members sent a letter to Secretary Glickman urging him to keep \nthe current system.\n  It is critical that the Secretary act quickly to request a stay and \nappeal this decision. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Leahy and \nmyself in that request.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11941-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11942-S11943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA APPROPRIATIONS BILL\n\n  Ms. MOSELEY-BRAUN. Mr. President, I rise to state my objection to the \nmotion to proceed on the District of Columbia appropriations bill, at \nleast temporarily. I want to explain why.\n  There is currently an amendment on the D.C. appropriations bill that \nwill grant certain Central Americans access to the suspension of \ndeportation procedure. These are refugees--people who leave their \ncountries for political asylum here. And they will not be deported \nbecause of the amendment that is part of the D.C. appropriations bill. \nIt covers some 191,000 Salvadorans, some 21,000 Nicaraguans, some \n118,000 Guatemalans, and I certainly support the suspension of \ndeportation for all of those groups of asylum seekers. It does not, \nhowever, cover just about 18,000 Haitians. In fact, the only group of \nasylum seekers that were left out of the bill as it came out of the \nHouse were the Haitians.\n  This is not only patently unfair but certainly suggests almost a tin \near on the racial implications of what came out of the House by the \nHouse Members who put this together that they would not understand--\nthat singling out the Haitians for exclusion from this relief would be \nperceived as negative in many parts of this country which is nothing \nshort of stunning to me.\n  I am happy to report that I had a conversation with the majority \nleader, Senator Lott. He wants to try to help us with this situation. \nSenator Graham has an actual bill to try to fix the situation with \nregard to the Haitians separate and apart from the District of Columbia \nappropriations. I support and would cosponsor Senator Graham's \nlegislation. However, the catch here and the reason for my voicing my \nobjection\n\n[[Page S11943]]\n\nright now--my temporary objection right now--is that, as Senator Lott \npointed out in his comments, we talk about whether or not these \nHaitians would be deported in the meantime until Senator Graham's bill \ncan get passed. We don't yet have an agreement from the administration, \nfrom the INS, from the House, from the Senate in terms of Senate \noversight. We don't have an agreement that these Haitians won't be \nsingled out--18,000 out of almost 250,000 people to be deported in the \ninterim until the Graham effort is concluded.\n  So I find myself in the difficult position of having to object to \nproceeding to something that might otherwise be a good thing until this \nobvious blatant error is--at least until we get some commitments that \nthese people will not be harmed. That is what the number of men, women, \nand children need for their lives in behalf of and in pursuit of \ndemocracy. It is not fair to single them out for special treatment for \nno rational reason other than as they have brought to me that they fear \nthey have been singled out because of their color, that they have been \nsingled out because of their race.\n  That is not right. That is not what this country stands for. I hope \nthat is not the signal that we are going to send by the way this \nlegislative process works out.\n  So, until we get an agreement on suspension of deportation, I am \nafraid I will have to object to the motion to proceed with regard to \nthe District of Columbia appropriations bill. I know there are some \nother issues. I hope these issues get worked out. I hope this issue \ngets worked out.\n  I want to put the Senate on notice that this legislation in its \ncurrent form sends the absolute wrong signal to the country and, \nindeed, to the world regarding our commitment to family.\n  How are you going to suspend deportation for 191,000 people from El \nSalvador, 21,000 people from Nicaragua, 118,000 people from Guatemala \nand not allow 18,000 people from Haiti to take advantage of the same \nrelief under almost identical circumstances? There is no reason for it. \nThere is no rational for it. Quite frankly, I would be remiss if I \nallowed this mistake to go forward. I am confident it is going to be \nworked out.\n  Again, my conversation with Senator Lott, my conversation with \nSenator Graham, with Senator Kennedy, and with Senator Mack--we have \nhad conversations across the board. We just want to make certain there \nis agreement before this starts to leave here--that there is a \nagreement that these people will not be kicked out of country under \ncircumstances in which almost 250,000 people similarly situated are \nallowed to stay. That is my objection. That is my problem with the bill \nat the time.\n  I want to make the point that we in the Senate are not prepared to \nsend that kind of negative signal to the country or to the rest of the \nworld, and that we will at least resolve the deportation issue before \nthe District of Columbia appropriations legislation goes forward.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this week an expert scientific \npanel at the National Institutes of Health strongly endorsed \nacupuncture as an effective treatment for certain conditions. This is \nthe first time that the NIH has endorsed a major alternative therapy. \nIt is truly a breakthrough, and is just the type of advance that I \nenvisioned when I worked to establish the Office of Alternative \nMedicine at the NIH.\n  The consensus conference held by NIH involved top scientists from \naround the Nation, including those with expertise in acupuncture and \nexperts in research evaluation and design. These scientists, led by Dr. \nDavid Ramsey, president of the University of Maryland, Baltimore, \nobjectively evaluated the evidence of acupuncture's efficacy and came \nto a consensus that this therapy is safe and provides significant help \nfor a number of health problems.\n  They found that acupuncture is an effective treatment for \npostoperative dental pain, postoperative and chemotherapy-induced \nnausea, nausea during pregnancy, and other conditions. They also \nidentified a number of other conditions, including asthma, substance \naddiction, stroke rehabilitation, headache, general muscle pain, low \nback pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, for which acupuncture demonstrates \neffectiveness but with a less degree of certainty.\n  I was dismayed to read that despite this consensus agreement after \nrigorous evaluation of the scientific evidence, there is still a fringe \nelement in the medical community that refuses to acknowledge the facts. \nThese critics seem only to be interested in bad mouthing anything out \nof what they consider to be the medical mainstream. While we all \nbenefit from a healthy dose of skepticism in the scientific process, I \nhope in the future, this small group of critics take off their blinders \nlong enough to objectively look at the scientific evidence and give \ncredit where credit is due.\n  Mr. President, as I have said before, millions of Americans--more and \nmore each day--are using alternative medical therapies. In 1993, the \nFDA reported that Americans were spending $500 million a year for \nbetween 9 and 12 million acupuncture treatment visits. Unfortunately, \nresearch has not kept pace. The NIH has failed to break through biases \nthat exist and devote the attention to this area that is needed. As a \nresult, American consumers have been denied information about the \neffectiveness of the therapies they are using or thinking of using.\n  I am pleased to report that the conference report on the fiscal year \n1998 Health and Human Services appropriations bill has agreed to \nprovide more than a 50-percent increase to the Office of Alternative \nMedicine to expand efforts like this week's consensus conference on \nacupuncture to other work and to investigate and validate complementary \nand alternative therapies. Our report also guarantees that this \nincrease will be spent on grants and contracts that directly respond to \nrequests for proposals and program announcements issued by the Office \nof Alternative Medicine.\n  Mr. President, this week's endorsement of acupuncture by NIH is a \npositive step forward for the American public and for the medical \nresearch in our Nation. I hope that it will lead not only to greater \nacceptance of, and access to, cost effective acupuncture services, but \nto increased willingness on the part of NIH and the medical community \nto commit to the objective evaluation of a range of promising \ncomplementary and alternative medical therapies.\n  Mr. President, I ask that the full text of the findings of this \nhistoric NIH consensus panel be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Statement\n\n\n                              introduction\n\n       Acupuncture is a component of the health care system of \n     China that can be traced back for at least 2,500 years. The \n     general theory of acupuncture is based on the premise that \n     there are patterns of energy flow (Qi) through the body that \n     are essential for health. Disruptions of this flow are \n     believed to be responsible for disease. The acupuncturist can \n     correct imbalances of flow at identifiable points close to \n     the skin. The practice of acupuncture to treat identifiable \n     pathophysiological conditions in American medicine was rare \n     until the visit of President Nixon to China in 1972. Since \n     that time, there has been an explosion of interest in the \n     United States and Europe in the application of the technique \n     of acupuncture to Western medicine.\n       Acupuncture describes a family of procedures involving \n     stimulation of anatomical locations on the skin by a variety \n     of techniques. The most studied mechanism of stimulation of \n     acupuncture points employs penetration of the skin by thin, \n     solid, metallic needles, which are manipulated manually or by \n     electric stimulation. The majority of comments in this report \n     are based on data that came from such studies. Stimulation of \n     these areas by moxibustion, pressure, heat, and lasers is \n     used in acupuncture practice, but due to the paucity of \n     studies, these techniques are more difficult to evaluate. \n     Thus, there are a variety of approaches to diagnosis and \n     treatment in American acupuncture that incorporate medical \n     traditions from China, Japan, Korea, and other countries.\n       Acupuncture has been used by millions of American patients \n     and performed by thousands of physicians, dentists, \n     acupuncturists,\n\n[[Page S11944]]\n\n     and other practitioners for relief or prevention of pain and \n     for a variety of health conditions. After reviewing the \n     existing body of knowledge, the U.S. Food and Drug \n     Administration recently removed acupuncture needles from the \n     category of ``experimental medical devices'' and now \n     regulates them just as it does other devices, such as \n     surgical scalpels and hypodermic syringes, under good \n     manufacturing practices and single-use standards of \n     sterility.\n       Over the years, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has \n     funded a variety of research projects on acupuncture, \n     including studies on the mechanisms by which acupuncture may \n     have its effects, as well as clinical trials and other \n     studies. There is also a considerable body of international \n     literature on the risks and benefits of acupuncture, and the \n     World Health Organization lists a variety of medical \n     conditions that may benefit from the use of acupuncture or \n     moxibustion. Such applications include pre-vention and \n     treatment of nausea and vomiting; treatment of pain and \n     addictions to alcohol, tobacco, and other drugs; treatment of \n     pulmonary problems such as asthma and bronchitis; and \n     rehabilitation from neurological damage such as that caused \n     by stroke.\n       To address important issues regarding acupuncture, the NIH \n     Office of Alternative Medicine and the NIH Office of Medical \n     Applications of Research organized a 2\\1/2\\-day conference to \n     evaluate the scientific and medical data on the uses, risks, \n     and benefits of acupuncture procedures for a variety of \n     conditions. Cosponsors of the conference were the National \n     Cancer Institute, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood \n     Institute, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \n     Diseases, and National Institute of Arthritis and \n     Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Institute of \n     Dental Research, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, and \n     the Office of Research on Women's Health and the NIH. The \n     conference brought together national and international \n     experts in the fields of acupuncture, pain, psychology, \n     psychiatry, physical medicine and rehabilitation, drug abuse, \n     family practice, internal medicine, health policy, \n     epidemiology, statistics, physiology, and biophysics, as well \n     as representatives from the public.\n       After 1\\1/2\\ days of available presentation and audience \n     discussion, an independent, non-Federal consensus panel \n     weighed the scientific evidence and wrote a draft statement \n     that was presented to the audience on the third day. The \n     consensus statement addressed the following key questions:\n       What is the efficacy of acupuncture, compared with placebo \n     or sham acupuncture, in the conditions for which sufficient \n     data are available to evaluate?\n       What is the place of acupuncture in the treatment of \n     various conditions for which sufficient data are available, \n     in comparison with or in combination with other \n     interventions (including no intervention)?\n       What is known about the biological effects of acupuncture \n     that helps us understand how it works?\n       What issues need to be addressed so that acupuncture may be \n     appropriately incorporated into today's health care system?\n       What are the directions for future research?\n       The primary sponsors of this meeting were the National \n     Human Genome Research Institute and the NIH Office of Medical \n     Applications of Research. The conference was cosponsored by \n     the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney \n     Diseases; the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, the \n     National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the \n     NIH Office of Rare Diseases; the National Institute of Mental \n     Health; the National Institute of Nursing Research; the NIH \n     Office of Research on Women's Health; the Agency for Health \n     Care Policy and Research; and the Centers for Disease Control \n     and Prevention.\n       1. What is the efficacy of acupuncture, compared with \n     placebo or sham acupuncture, in the conditions for which \n     sufficient data are available to evaluate?\n       Acupuncture is a complex intervention that may vary for \n     different patients with similar chief complaints. The number \n     and length of treatments and the specific points used may \n     vary among individuals and during the course of treatment. \n     Given this reality, it is perhaps encouraging that there \n     exist a number of studies of sufficient quality to assess the \n     efficacy of acupuncture for certain conditions.\n       According to contemporary research standards, there is a \n     paucity of high-quality research assessing efficacy of \n     acupuncture compared with placebo or sham acupuncture. The \n     vast majority of papers studying acupuncture in the \n     biomedical literature consist of case reports, case series, \n     or intervention studies with designs inadequate to assess \n     efficacy.\n       This discussion of efficacy refers to needle acupuncture \n     (manual or electroacupuncture) because the published research \n     is primarily on needle acupuncture and often does not \n     encompass the full breadth of acupuncture techniques and \n     practices. The controlled trials usually have only involved \n     adults and did not involve long-term (i.e., years) \n     acupuncture treatment.\n       Efficacy of a treatment assesses the differential effect of \n     a treatment when compared with placebo or another treatment \n     modality using a double-blind controlled trial and a rigidly \n     defined protocol. Papers should describe enrollment \n     procedures, eligibility criteria, description of the clinical \n     characteristics of the subjects, methods for diagnosis, and a \n     description of the protocol (i.e., randomization method, \n     specific definition of treatment, and control conditions, \n     including length of treatment, and number of acupuncture \n     sessions). Optimal trials should also use standardized \n     outcomes and appropriate statistical analyses. This \n     assessment of efficacy focuses on high-quality trials \n     comparing acupuncture with sham acupuncture or placebo.\n\n                             Response rate\n\n       As with other interventions, some individuals are poor \n     responders to specific acupuncture protocols. Both animal and \n     human laboratory and clinical experience suggest that the \n     majority of subjects respond to acupuncture, with a minority \n     not responding. Some of the clinical research \n     outcomes, however, suggest that a larger percentage may \n     not respond. The reason for this paradox is unclear and \n     may reflect the current state of the research.\n\n                    Efficacy for specific disorders\n\n       There is clear evidence that needle acupuncture is \n     efficacious for adult post-operative and chemotherapy nausea \n     and vomiting and probably for the nausea of pregnancy.\n       Much of the research is on various pain problems. There is \n     evidence of efficacy for postoperative dental pain. There are \n     reasonable studies (although sometimes only single studies) \n     showing relief of pain with acupuncture on diverse pain \n     conditions such as menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, and fibro-\n     myalgia. This suggests that acupuncture may have a more \n     general effect on pain. However, there are also studies that \n     do not find efficacy for acupuncture in pain.\n       There is evidence that acupuncture does not demonstrate \n     efficacy for cessation of smoking and may not be efficacious \n     for some other conditions.\n       While many other conditions have received some attention in \n     the literature and, in fact, the research suggests some \n     exciting potential areas for the use of acupuncture, the \n     quality or quantity of the research evidence is not \n     sufficient to provide firm evidence of efficacy at this time.\n\n                            Sham acupuncture\n\n       A commonly used control group is sham acupuncture, using \n     techniques that are not intended to stimulate known \n     acupuncture points. However, there is disagreement on correct \n     needle placement. Also, particularly in the studies of pain, \n     sham acupuncture often seems to have either intermediate \n     effects between the placebo and Oreal' acupuncture points or \n     effects similar to those of the Oreal' acupuncture points. \n     Placement of a needle in any position elicits a biological \n     response that complicates the interpretation of studies \n     involving sham acupuncture. Thus, there is substantial \n     controversy over the use of sham acupuncture as control \n     groups. This may be less of a problem in studies not \n     involving pain.\n       2. What is the place of acupuncture in the treatment of \n     various conditions for which sufficient data are available, \n     in comparison with or in combination with other interventions \n     (including no intervention)?\n       Assessing the usefulness of a medical intervention in \n     practice differs from assessing formal efficacy. In \n     conventional practice, clinicians make decisions based on the \n     characteristics of the patient, clinical experience, \n     potential for harm, and information from colleagues and the \n     medical literature. In addition, when more than one treatment \n     is possible, the clinician may make the choice taking into \n     account the patient's preferences. While it is often thought \n     that there is substantial research evidence to support \n     conventional medical practices, this is frequently not that \n     case. This does not mean that these treatments are \n     ineffective. The data in support of acupuncture are as strong \n     as those for many accepted Western medical therapies.\n       One of the advantages of acupuncture is that the incidence \n     of adverse effects if substantially lower than that of many \n     drugs or other accepted medical procedures used for the same \n     conditions. As an example, musculoskeletal conditions, such \n     as fibromyalgia, myofascial pain, and ``tennis elbow,'' or \n     epicondylitis, are conditions for which acupuncture may be \n     beneficial. These painful conditions are often treated with, \n     among other things, anti-inflammatory medications (aspirin, \n     ibuprofen, etc.) or with steroid injections. Both medical \n     interventions have a potential for deleterious side effects, \n     but are still widely used, and are considered acceptable \n     treatment. The evidence supporting these therapies is no \n     better than that for acupuncture.\n       In addition, ample clinical experience, supported by some \n     research data, suggests that acupuncture may be a reasonable \n     option for a number of clinical conditions. Examples are \n     postoperative pain and myofascial and low back pain. Examples \n     of disorders for which the research evidence is less \n     convincing but for which there are some positive clinical \n     reports include addiction, stroke rehabilitation, carpal \n     tunnel syndrome, osteoarthritis, and headache. Acupuncture \n     treatment for many conditions such as asthma, addiction, or \n     smoking cessation should be part of a comprehensive \n     management program.\n       Many other conditions have been treated by acupuncture, the \n     World Health Organization, for example, has listed more than \n     40 for which the technique may be indicated.\n       3. What is known about the biological effects of \n     acupuncture that helps us understand how it works?\n\n[[Page S11945]]\n\n       Many studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that \n     acupuncture can cause multiple biological responses. These \n     responses can occur locally, i.e., at or close to the site of \n     application, or at a distance, mediated mainly by sensory \n     neurons to many structures within the central nervous system. \n     This can lead to activation of pathways affecting various \n     physiological systems in the brain as well as in the \n     periphery. A focus of attention has been the role of \n     endogenous opioids in acupuncture analgesia. Considerable \n     evidence supports the claim that opioid peptides are released \n     during acupuncture and that the analgesic effects of \n     acupuncture are at least partially explained by their \n     actions. That opioid antagonists such as naloxone reverse the \n     analgesic effects of acupuncture further strengthens this \n     hypothesis. Stimulation by acupuncture may also activate the \n     hypothalamus and the pituitary gland, resulting in a broad \n     spectrum of systemic effects. Alteration in the secretion of \n     neurotransmitters and neurohormones and changes in the \n     regulation of blood flow, both centrally and peripherally, \n     have been documented. There is also evidence that there are \n     alterations in immune functions produced by acupuncture. \n     Which of these and other physiological changes mediate \n     clinical effects is a present unclear.\n       Despite considerable efforts to understand the anatomy and \n     physiology of the ``acupuncture points,'' the definition and \n     characterization of these points remains controversial. Even \n     more elusive is the scientific basis of some of the key \n     traditional Eastern medical concepts such as the circulation \n     of Qi, the meridian system, and the five phases theory, which \n     are difficult to reconcile with contemporary biomedical \n     information but continue to play an important role in the \n     evaluation of patients and the formulation of treatment in \n     acupuncture.\n       Some of the biological effects of acupuncture have also \n     been observed when ``sham'' acupuncture points are \n     stimulated, highlighting the importance of defining \n     appropriate control groups in assessing biological changes \n     purported to be due to acupuncture. Such findings raise \n     questions regarding the specificity of these biological \n     changes. In addition, similar biological alterations \n     including the release of endogenous opioids and changes in \n     blood pressure have been observed after painful stimuli, \n     vigorous exercise, and/or relaxation training; it is at \n     present unclear to what extent acupuncture shares similar \n     biological mechanisms.\n       It should be noted also that for any therapeutic \n     intervention, including acupuncture, the so-called ``non-\n     specific'' effects account for a substantial proportion of \n     its effectiveness, and thus should not be casually \n     discounted. Many factors may profoundly determine therapeutic \n     outcome including the quality of the relationship between the \n     clinician and the patient, the degree of trust, the \n     expectations of the patient, the compatibility of the \n     backgrounds and belief systems of the clinician and the \n     patient, as well as a myriad of factors that together \n     define the therapeutic milieu.\n       Although much remains unknown regarding the mechanism(s) \n     that might mediate the therapeutic effect of acupuncture, the \n     panel is encouraged that a number of significant acupuncture-\n     related biological changes can be identified and carefully \n     delineated. Further research in this direction not only is \n     important for elucidating the phenomena associated with \n     acupuncture, but also has the potential for exploring new \n     pathways in human physiology not previously examined in a \n     systematic manner.\n       4. What issues need to be addressed so that acupuncture may \n     be appropriately incorporated into today's health care \n     system?\n       The integration of acupuncture into today's health care \n     system will be facilitated by a better understanding among \n     providers of the language and practices of both the Eastern \n     and Western health care communities. Acupuncture focuses on a \n     holistic, energy-based approach to the patient rather than a \n     disease-oriented diagnostic and treatment model.\n       An important factor for the integration of acupuncture into \n     the health care system is the training and credentialing of \n     acupuncture practitioners by the appropriate state agencies. \n     This is necessary to allow the public and other health \n     practitioners to identify qualified acupuncture \n     practitioners. The acupuncture educational community has made \n     substantial progress in this area and is encouraged to \n     continue along this path. Educational standards have been \n     established for training of physician and non-physician \n     acupuncturists. Many acupuncture educational programs are \n     accredited by an agency that is recognized by the U.S. \n     Department of Education. A national credentialing agency \n     exists that is recognized by some of the major professional \n     acupuncture organizations and provides examinations for \n     entry-level competency in the field.\n       A majority of States provide licensure or registration for \n     acupuncture practitioners. Because some acupuncture \n     practitioners have limited English proficiency, credentialing \n     and licensing examinations should be provided in languages \n     other than English where necessary. There is variation in the \n     titles that are conferred through these processes, and the \n     requirements to obtain licensure vary widely. The scope of \n     practice allowed under these State requirements varies as \n     well. While States have the individual prerogative to set \n     standards for licensing professions, harmonization in these \n     areas will provide greater confidence in the qualifications \n     of acupuncture practitioners. For example, not all States \n     recognize the same credentialing examination, thus making \n     reciprocity difficult.\n       The occurrence of adverse events in the practice of \n     acupuncture has been documented to be extremely low. However, \n     these events have occurred in rare occasions, some of which \n     are life threatening (e.g., pneumothorax). Therefore, \n     appropriate safeguards for the protection of patients and \n     consumers need to be in place. Patients should be fully \n     informed of their treatment options, expected prognosis, \n     relative risk, and safety practices to minimize these risks \n     prior to their receipt of acupuncture. This information must \n     be provided in a manner that is linguistically and culturally \n     appropriate to the patient. Use of acupuncture needles should \n     always follow FDA regulations, including use of sterile, \n     single-use needles. It is noted that these practices are \n     already being done by many acupuncture practitioners; \n     however, these practices should be uniform. Recourse for \n     patient grievance and professional censure are provided \n     through credentialing and licensing procedures and are \n     available through appropriate State jurisdictions.\n       It has been reported that more than 1 million Americans \n     currently receive acupuncture each year. Continued access to \n     qualified acupuncture professionals for appropriate \n     conditions should be ensured. Because many individuals \n     seek health care treatment from both acupuncturists and \n     physicians, communication between these providers should \n     be strengthened and improved. If a patient is under the \n     care of an acupuncturist and a physician, both \n     practitioners should be informed. Care should be taken so \n     that important medical problems are not overlooked. \n     Patients and providers have a responsibility to facilitate \n     this communication.\n       There is evidence that some patients have limited access to \n     acupuncture services because of inability to pay. Insurance \n     companies can decrease or remove financial barriers to access \n     depending on their willingness to provide coverage for \n     appropriate acupuncture services. An increasing number of \n     insurance companies are either considering this possibility \n     or now provide coverage for acupuncture services. Where there \n     are State health insurance plans, and for populations served \n     by Medicare or Medicaid, expansion of coverage to include \n     appropriate acupuncture services would also help remove \n     financial barriers to access.\n       As acupuncture is incorporated into today's health care \n     system, and further research clarifies the role of \n     acupuncture for various health conditions, it is expected \n     that dissemination of this information to health care \n     practitioners, insurance providers, policymakers, and the \n     general public will lead to more informed decisions in regard \n     to the appropriate use of acupuncture.\n       5. What are the directions for future research?\n       The incorporation of any new clinical intervention into \n     accepted practice faces more scrutiny now than ever before. \n     The demands of evidence-based medicine, outcomes research, \n     managed care systems of health care delivery, and a plethora \n     of therapeutic choices makes the acceptance of new treatments \n     an arduous process. The difficulties are accentuated when the \n     treatment is based on theories unfamiliar to Western medicine \n     and its practitioners. It is important, therefore, that the \n     evaluation of acupuncture for the treatment of specific \n     conditions be carried out carefully, using designs which can \n     withstand rigorous scrutiny. In order to further the \n     evaluation of the role of acupuncture in the management of \n     various conditions, the following general areas for future \n     research are suggested.\n       What are the demographics and patterns of use of \n     acupuncture in the U.S. and other countries?\n       There is currently limited information on basic questions \n     such as who uses acupuncture, for what indications is \n     acupuncture most commonly sought, what variations in \n     experience and techniques used exist among acupuncture \n     practitioners, and whether there are differences in these \n     patterns by geography or ethnic group. Descriptive \n     epidemiologic studies can provide insight into these and \n     other questions. This information can in turn be used to \n     guide future research and to identify areas of greatest \n     public health concern.\n       Can the efficacy of acupuncture for various conditions for \n     which it is used or for which it shows promise be \n     demonstrated?\n       Relatively few high-quality, randomized, controlled trials \n     have been published on the effects of acupuncture. Such \n     studies should be designed in a rigorous manner to allow \n     evaluation of the effectiveness of acupuncture. Such studies \n     should include experienced acupuncture practitioners in order \n     to design and deliver appropriate interventions. Emphasis \n     should be placed on studies that examine acupuncture as used \n     in clinical practice, and that respect the theoretical basis \n     for acupuncture therapy.\n       Although randomized controlled trials provide a strong \n     basis for inferring causality, other study designs such as \n     used in clinical epidemiology or outcomes research can also \n     provide important insights regarding the usefulness of \n     acupuncture for various conditions. There have been few such \n     studies in the acupuncture literature.\n       Do different theoretical bases for acupuncture result in \n     different treatment outcomes?\n       Competing theoretical orientations (e.g., Chinese, \n     Japanese, French) currently exist\n\n[[Page S11946]]\n\n     that might predict divergent therapeutic approaches (i.e., \n     the use of different acupuncture points). Research projects \n     should be designed to assess the relative merit of these \n     divergent approaches, as well to compare these systems with \n     treatment programs using fixed acupuncture points.\n       In order to fully assess the efficacy of acupuncture, \n     studies should be designed to examine not only fixed \n     acupuncture points, but also the Eastern medical systems that \n     provide the foundation for acupuncture therapy, including the \n     choice of points. In addition to assessing the effect of \n     acupuncture in context, this would also provide the \n     opportunity to determine if Eastern medical theories predict \n     more effective acupuncture points, as well as to examine the \n     relative utility of competing systems (e.g., Chinese vs. \n     Japanese vs. French) for such purposes.\n       What areas of public policy research can provide guidance \n     for the integration of acupuncture into today's health care \n     system?\n       The incorporation of acupuncture as a treatment raises \n     numerous questions of public policy. These include issues of \n     access, cost-effectiveness, reimbursement by State, Federal, \n     and private payors, and training, licensure, and \n     accreditation. These public policy issues must be founded on \n     quality epidemiologic and demographic data and effectiveness \n     research.\n       Can further insight into the biological basis for \n     acupuncture be gained?\n       Mechanisms which provide a Western scientific explanation \n     for some of the effects of acupuncture are beginning to \n     emerge. This is encouraging, and may provide novel insights \n     into neural, endocrine and other physiological processes. \n     Research should be supported to provide a better \n     understanding of the mechanisms involved, and such research \n     may lead to improvements in treatment.\n       Does an organized energetic system exist in the human body \n     that has clinical applications?\n       Although biochemical and physiologic studies have provided \n     insight into some of the biologic effects of acupuncture, \n     acupuncture practice is based on a very different model of \n     energy balance. This theory may provide new insights to \n     medical research that may further elucidate the basis for \n     acupuncture.\n       How do the approaches and answers to these questions differ \n     among populations that have used acupuncture as a part of its \n     healing tradition for centuries, compared to populations that \n     have only recently begun to incorporate acupuncture into \n     health care?\n\n\n                    conclusions and recommendations\n\n       Acupuncture as a therapeutic interventions is widely \n     practiced in the United States. There have been many studies \n     of its potential usefulness. However, many of these \n     studies provide equivocal results because of design, \n     sample size, and other factors. The issue is further \n     complicated by inherent difficulties in the use of \n     appropriate controls, such as placebo and sham acupuncture \n     groups.\n       However, promising results have emerged, for example, \n     efficacy of acupuncture in adult post-operative and \n     chemotherapy nausea and vomiting and in post-operative dental \n     pain. There are other situations such as addiction, stroke \n     rehabilitation, headache, menstrual cramps, tennis elbow, \n     fibromyalgia myofascial pain, osteoarthritis, low back pain, \n     carpal tunnel syndrome, and asthma where acupuncture may be \n     useful as an adjunct treatment or an acceptable alternative \n     or be included in a comprehensive management program. Further \n     research is likely to uncover additional areas where \n     acupuncture interventions will be useful.\n       Findings from basic research have begun to elucidate the \n     mechanisms of action of acupuncture, including the release of \n     opioids and other peptides in the central nervous system and \n     the periphery and changes in neuroendocrine function. \n     Although much needs to be accomplished, the emergence of \n     plausible mechanisms for the therapeutic effects of \n     acupuncture is encouraging.\n       The introduction of acupuncture into the choice of \n     treatment modalities that are readily available to the public \n     is in its early stages. Issues of training, licensure, and \n     reimbursement remain to be clarified. There is sufficient \n     evidence, however, of its potential value to conventional \n     medicine to encourage further studies.\n       There is sufficient evidence of acupuncture's value to \n     expand its use into correctional medicine and to encourage \n     further studies of its physiology and clinical value.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nrespond to my friends, the Senators from Vermont, Mr. Leahy and Mr. \nJeffords, who just spoke with regard to a recent decision by the \nFederal District Court of Minnesota. It also gives me an opportunity to \nnot only present a different perspective on that ruling, but to also \nhail the ruling, which is the first ray of hope that the dairy farmers \nin the upper Midwest, and in particular the farmers in my home State of \nWisconsin, have had for a very, very long time.\n  I think the judge in this case ruled correctly. In the Minnesota Milk \nProducers versus Dan Glickman, Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, Federal Judge David Doty finally said what Wisconsin dairy \nfarmers have long known is the case, and that is that the current \nFederal milk marketing order system is outdated and is, in fact, \nillegal, given the realities of our national dairy market today. This \nsystem was set up some 60 years ago, because at that time it was not \nalways possible for consumers in other parts of the country, \nparticularly the South and the Southeast, to get fresh milk because of \ninadequate refrigeration and transportation technology. So this system \nwas set up on the basis of how far a farmer lived from Eau Claire, WI--\nthe supposed reserve supply of milk in the United States. In other \nwords, the closer a farmer lived to Eau Claire, WI, the less he got as \nan add-on for his class I fluid milk. The system worked, and it \ncertainly provided the needed fresh milk for virtually every marketing \norder in the country east of the Rocky Mountains.\n  Times have changed. During the past 60 years these areas, such as the \nNortheastern, Southwestern and Southcentral regions of the United \nStates, are now able to produce enough milk to provide for their fluid \nmilk needs and then some. Yet there is still a gross discrepancy \nbetween what a dairy farmer gets, let's say in Texas or Vermont, for \nhis or her class I milk, and what a farmer in Wisconsin gets for the \nsame type of milk. For example, farmers in Wisconsin may receive $1.20 \nper hundredweight in addition to the base price for milk, but in other \nregions more distant from Wisconsin, dairy farmers might receive $2 or \n$3 or even $4 more than Wisconsin farmers.\n  These are very serious disparities and these differentials have led \nto an extremely unfair situation to the dairy farmers in the upper \nMidwest. The decision by the district court this week finally says, \n``Enough is enough.'' It takes note, in effect, of the fact that in the \nlast 17 years, Wisconsin alone has gone from having 45,000 dairy farms \nto less than 25,000. We have lost over 1,000 dairy farms per year each \nyear. And when upper Midwest dairy farmers talk about all of the \nproblems facing their industry, the complaint that arises most often is \nthe unfairness of the Federal milk marketing order system.\n  In contrast to what the two Senators from Vermont were saying--one of \nthem actually indicated there had to be these disparities in order for \nmilk to be supplied to consumers--the fact is, current market \nconditions and existing technologies no longer necessitate a system \nthat prices milk based on distance from Eau Claire. In fact, in recent \nyears, when our dairy farmers have tried to sell their milk in Chicago, \nhave been beaten out of that market by milk from southcentral and \nsouthwestern producers. How can that be if these regions can't produce \nenough milk for their own needs in that area? Obviously, they can meet \ntheir needs and still afford to export milk to other regions because \nthey are receiving a higher class I milk price. And the result is that \nthis system subsidizes the farmers in the Southeast, Northeastern, and \nregions of the United States and provides them an unfair advantage and \ncompetitive advantage over our farmers in the upper Midwest. It has had \na lot to do, in my view and the view of almost every farmer in \nWisconsin, with the loss of so many of our dairy farms in our State.\n  It is ironic, at a time when the Federal Government, including \nCongress with the passage of the 1996 farm bill, has made it a policy \nto reduce Government pricing interference in agricultural markets, that \nit is still interfering in a very serious and detrimental way with a \nfree and open national dairy market. This decision by the judge in the \nU.S. District Court of Minnesota--a Federal court--is an excellent \ndecision. It is a decision that finally tells it like it is--and that \nis that there is no legitimate basis for these discriminatory class I \nprice differentials which provide one farmer in the Northeastern part \nof the United States and another farmer in Texas far more for the same \ntype of milk than the hard-working farmers in Wisconsin or Minnesota.\n\n  Mr. President, we in Wisconsin and the upper Midwest praise this \ncourt ruling. We believe it is an important, proper and very overdue \ndecision. It gives us some hope that the remaining\n\n[[Page S11947]]\n\nfarmers in our State, in the upper Midwest, will be allowed to survive \nwithout the interference of an outdated and unfair system--in fact, as \nnow indicated by the court, a system that is unlawful, given the \nchanges in the dairy market and given the changes in the times.\n  Mr. President, this court decision was, at long last, the right one \nand I look forward to the positive consequences that can flow from it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11943-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL DRUG POLICY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to commend and \nstrongly support Gen. Barry McCaffrey, Director of the Office of \nNational Drug Policy Control, in his call for increased funds for the \ndrug interdiction effort. I have been one who has been most critical \nover the low priority effort that has been made to stop the flow of \ndrugs into this country. The recent series in the Washington Post--I \nthink it was five articles--pointed out that anywhere from 5 to 7 tons \na day of heavy narcotics is flowing into our country.\n  General McCaffrey reports that he has been visiting at least four \nCabinet Secretaries, including the Cabinet Secretary representing \nDefense, to really ask for moneys to increase the interdiction efforts \nwith respect to hard narcotics.\n  I, who have criticized, must also be one who stands and supports \nthis. Later today, Senator Coverdell and I, and I hope the \ndistinguished Senator from Iowa, Senator Grassley, who has just come to \nthe floor, will be joining in a letter to the Secretary, also \nindicating our support.\n  General McCaffrey insists that he cannot certify the Pentagon's \nrequested budget for fiscal 1999 unless it includes $141 million in \nadditional drug interdiction funding. I believe the general is right in \ntaking this action. I urge the administration to support him.\n  While highlighting the fact that other Federal agencies have \nincreased their counternarcotics spending at a faster rate, the general \nhas asked that the Defense Department increase the amount it spends for \nthe drug fight in four key areas.\n  The first is Andean coca reduction. He is asking for an increase of \n$75 million to carry on the drug fight in the Andes region, where \nAmerican and local officials are working in cooperation to disrupt the \ncocaine export industry.\n  National Guard counterdrug operations--he is asking for an increase \nof $30 million to support antidrug activities of the National Guard \nthat partially restores reductions incurred since 1993 in State plans \nfunding, which include support for counterdrug activities along the \nborder.\n  Third, he is asking for an increase of $12 million for a program to \nintercept traffickers in the Caribbean Basin, including southern \nFlorida, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the eastern \nCaribbean. This would implement commitments made by the President \nduring the Caribbean summit in Barbados.\n  And he is asking for money for Mexican initiatives, an increase of \n$24 million to provide additional resources to reduce the flow of \nillicit drugs from Mexico and for a drug training program for Mexican \nofficials so that they can locate and arrest drug traffickers and money \nlaunderers at the border.\n  The point that General McCaffrey makes, that I think is so important, \nis although the domestic funding of domestic agencies to fight drugs \nhas gone up, the Defense Department funding, which is really the \ninterdiction funding--the air surveillance, the radar, the trafficking, \nthose thing that is going into really cutting off the flow of \nnarcotics--has gone down by 2 percent this year. If you look at a chart \nof its decline over a period of years you will see where it went up to \na high in 1992, came dramatically down by 1994, and has remained \nvirtually flat, even declining some more, between 1995 and 1999. So the \ncurrent DOD budget is only 1.3 percent higher than fiscal year 1990.\n  We were told we have 5 to 7 tons of cocaine and hard narcotics coming \nin over our border a day. And yet, the DOD budget is only 1.3 percent \nhigher in these areas than it was in 1990. That is less than a single \nyear of inflation.\n\n  So, I think the head of this Office of Drug Control has a very, very \ngood point in asking for this money and, frankly, for really putting \nhis foot down. Many of us in the Senate have been after him to be more \nvigorous to stop the flow of narcotics: ``Why don't you do something \nabout it? Why don't you see that the air and sea and land interdiction \nis beefed up?'' He can't do that without the resources to do it.\n  Mr. President, I happen to believe in terms of the appropriateness of \nit being in the Defense Department budget, that there is no threat to \nAmerica's national security equal to the threat of drugs. Tens of \nthousands of people are killed in this country from drugs. Hundreds of \nthousands of lives in this country are ruined by drugs. It is largely \nresponsible today for the crime rate in virtually every community \nthroughout this Nation. It is a driving force and a central drawing \ncard for the gang movement in the United States and its spread across \nState lines.\n  The cartels have flourished because of it, and with it has come some \nof the most violent actions which anyone can possibly conceive: \nprosecutors killed, attorneys threatened. Just today, if you pick up \nthe newspaper, you will see one of the cartel leaders, Amado Carrillo \nFuentes, who underwent plastic surgery. The doctors who performed that \nsurgery disappeared. Their bodies were just found. Their fingernails \nhad been pulled out. Their bodies were covered with burns. The garrote \nstill remained around their neck. And this is everyday action \nsurrounding drugs, the movement of drugs and the activities of the five \nbig Mexican cartels.\n  All of this has created increased and, I think, unnecessary tensions \nbetween two countries, neighboring countries--the United States and \nMexico--who should be good friends and working together. We can't work \ntogether without the resources to carry out the job well. No Nation \ntoday, again, presents the threat to this Nation's national security as \ndoes the heavy flow of narcotics into this country.\n  So I am very proud, and Senator Coverdell and I will be issuing a \njoint press statement indicating our strong support for this action. We \nwant a standup drug czar. We want him to call it as he sees it. We want \nhim to take forceful action wherever that action is needed.\n  I am proud to stand here representing one of the States that is \nimpacted in a major way by drugs, to say both to the Secretary of \nDefense and to the President of the United States, ``Please support the \ndrug czar in his request for these additional moneys. They are \nnecessary for him to do the job.''\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I thank the Senate, in particular I \nthank the majority and minority leaders for the agreement that allowed \nthe confirmation of Christina Snyder as a Federal district court judge \nto proceed. I think this body will be proud of Mrs. Snyder's work on \nthe bench. I have a great deal of faith in her.\n  I thank the majority leader very much for scheduling this vote on the \nnomination of Christina Snyder. Mrs. Snyder is an excellent candidate, \nand I am delighted that the Senate will act today on her nomination.\n  Christina Snyder's nomination has been pending before the Senate \nsince\n\n[[Page S11948]]\n\nbeing reported by the Judiciary Committee on September 18, and the \nCalifornia district courts face an urgent need for additional judges on \nthe bench.\n  I recommended Chris Snyder to the President, in January 1996, for \nappointment to the central district of California because I believe she \nis extremely well qualified for the position.\n  Christina Snyder is a highly respected lawyer in Los Angeles. She has \nmore than 20 years of experience in the courtroom and served as a \npartner in three respected Los Angeles law firms.\n  She has focused her legal career on civil proceedings, where \napproximately 70 percent of her cases have been in the Federal courts.\n  Her practice has consisted of complex civil litigation, representing \nmostly defendants, including cases involving the Federal securities \nlaws, civil RICO, antitrust, intellectual property, and the Lanham Act.\n  Christina's record for integrity and decisiveness has earned the \nrespect of her peers, both Democrats and Republicans alike.\n  Chris Snyder has the support of professors, judges, and lawyers in \nthe central district and throughout California.\n  Among her many supporters are such prominent Republican Los Angeles \nleaders as Mayor Richard Riordan, who noted his very high regard and \nenthusiastic support for her, and Sheriff Sherman Block.\n  As a testament to her high regard by her colleagues in the legal \nprofession, Mrs. Snyder was nominated for membership to the prestigious \nAmerican Law Institute. Membership in the organization is equally \ndivided between lawyers, judges, and legal professors. It is indeed an \nhonor to be elected to the organization and Mrs. Snyder was elected to \nthe institute the very first time she was nominated, a noteworthy \naccomplishment.\n  Mrs. Snyder has also lectured on various subjects related to banking \nlaw and intellectual property law, and is currently coauthoring a \ntreatise on the local rules of practice of the Federal courts in the \nState of California.\n  As an attorney for over 20 years, she has the experience and \ntemperament to excel in this position.\n  I urge the Senate to confirm her nomination to the central district \ncourt.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I personally say to Senators Lott and \nDaschle an enormous thank you for working out an agreement by which we \ncan vote on another extraordinary woman, Margaret Morrow, and make sure \nthat vote will take place before the February break.\n  We have had one or two Senators who put anonymous holds on this \nnomination. I am happy to say they decided to come out and talk about \nwhy they don't feel it is a good nomination, because at least we know \nwho is objecting to Margaret Morrow.\n  Those two Senators and I have spoken. We have written to each other \nextensively, and they have agreed that it is only fair that there be a \nvote on Margaret Morrow. She has the support of Senator Hatch. She has \nthe support of many members of the Judiciary Committee on both sides of \nthe aisle. Margaret Morrow will make a great judge. I think it is most \nunfortunate that she has to wait until February, but I feel that at \nleast we have a commitment for a date certain that we will have a vote, \nand that will be before the February recess.\n  Again, I thank very much the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the \nDemocratic leader, Senator Daschle, for working with me to make sure \nthat this happens.\n  I think as we wind down, I have something to be very happy about, \nwhich is that we are going to have a vote on Margaret Morrow. I know \nwhen my colleagues see the strong bipartisan support she has in the \nState of California and in this U.S. Senate that she will win \nconfirmation.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I have followed the fast-track debate \nclosely, and it is with some disappointment that I note the absence of \nany discussion of the constitutional and institutional framework that \ngoverns our country's approach to foreign trade. A proper understanding \nof that framework is essential if we are to have a productive, \nenlightened debate about fast track.\n  I am also convinced that some of fast track's most ardent admirers \nmight find their ardor dimmed a little if they recognize the sordid \ntruth about fast track.\n  Accordingly, I wish to speak, not overly long, about the illegitimate \nbirth and disreputable pedigree of fast track. And I will attempt to \nunfold a decidedly unflattering but undeniably truthful account of how \nPresidential machinations and arrogance combined with congressional \nspinelessness to produce the monstrosity of fast track. They will learn \nthat fast track is not about saving jobs or opening markets or building \na bridge to the next century. Fast track, in a very considerable \nmeasure, is about power--raw, unfettered, Presidential power. And Mr. \nPresident, let me point out to any colleagues who doubt my reliability \nand objectivity in this regard that much of what I have to say is drawn \nfrom a recent article in the George Washington Journal of International \nLaw and Economics, whose author appears favorably disposed to fast \ntrack.\n  I start by noting that the Constitution assigns Congress a major role \nin the regulation of foreign affairs. Contrary to popular opinion--and \ncontrary to the beliefs of most Presidents--the executive branch does \nnot possess sole authority over foreign affairs. Indeed, beyond the \ngeneral statement in article II, section 1 that ``[t]he executive Power \nshall be vested in a President of the United States of America,'' the \nConstitution contains only four provisions that grant the executive \nclear foreign relations authority.\n  Now, I carry in my shirt pocket a copy of the Constitution of the \nUnited States. Alexander the Great greatly admired the Iliad. And he \ncarried with him a copy of the Iliad, a copy that Aristotle had \ncarefully examined and refined somewhat. And it was called the ``casket \ncopy.'' Aristotle slept with this casket copy of the Iliad under his \npillow. And along with the Iliad, there was a sword.\n  Now, Mr. President, I do not have a copy of the Constitution at night \nunder my pillow, but I try to carry it at all times whether I am in \nWest Virginia or whether I am here. I try to carry a copy of the \nConstitution in my shirt pocket. It is a copy of the Constitution that \nI have had for several years. It only cost 15 cents at the time I \nprocured it from the Government Printing Office. Although the price has \nadvanced now to probably about $1.50, $1.75, it is still the same \nConstitution.\n  We may have added one or two or three amendments to the Constitution \nsince I first procured this copy. I have not stopped to check on that. \nBut the Constitution itself has not changed in that time other than, as \nI say, some amendments have been added.\n  Would it surprise Senators to know that the Constitution contains \nonly four provisions that grant the executive clear foreign relations \nauthority? As one scholar has dryly observed, ``the support these \nclauses offer the President is less than overwhelming.'' The\n\n[[Page S11949]]\n\nclauses, all in article II, are these: the power to appoint ambassadors \nand to negotiate treaties, (section 2, clause 2), and both of these \nrequire the Senate's ``Advice and Consent''; also the responsibility to \nreceive ambassadors from foreign governments, (section 3); and the \nauthority to command the Armed Forces in case Congress, through its \nresponsibilities and powers under the Constitution, provides Armed \nForces for the President to command, (section 2, clause 1). These \nnarrow provisions provide a rather shaky foundation on which to build a \ncase for the executive's predominance over foreign affairs.\n\n  Congress, by contrast, is explicitly given substantial authority \nunder the Constitution and in the Constitution over foreign affairs. \nWhile the Constitutional Convention saw a lot of debate about which \nbranch was better qualified to make foreign policy, the document that \nwas signed on September 17, 1787 gives us a clue as to which side won. \nFully eleven of the powers granted to Congress in article I, section 8 \ninvolve foreign affairs. They include the powers: (1) ``To regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations'' (clause 3); (2) ``To lay and collect \nTaxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises'' (clause 1); (3) ``To define and \npunish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences \nagainst the Law of Nations'' (clause 9); (4) ``To declare War . . . and \nmake Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water'' (clause 11); (5) \n``To raise and support Armies'' (clause 12); (6) ``To provide and \nmaintain a Navy'' (clause 13); and (7) ``To provide for organizing, \narming, and disciplining, the Militia.'' (clause 16). When one throws \ninto the mix Congress' power to make the law--section 1, article 1--and \nits control over spending and appropriations in section 9, one \nconclusion is inescapable, namely: Congress' authority over foreign \naffairs is formidable.\n  Despite the Constitution's clear language, however, the history of \nthis country has seen the executive branch assume control over \nincreasingly large swathes of foreign affairs power, while Congress has \noccasionally taken back a scrap or two or a crumb or so for itself. It \nis now almost axiomatic that the President is sole representative of \nthe United States before foreign nations. This is the culmination of a \nprocess that began in the earliest days of the Republic, when Congress \nmet infrequently, giving the President effective day-to-day power over \nforeign affairs; the process has since accelerated with the advent of \nmodern media--particularly television--which provide the President with \na singularly powerful forum in which to make his case on matters of \nforeign policy.\n  While the executive branch has assumed general authority over foreign \naffairs, for a long time Congress made sure that its power over foreign \ntrade remained on the eastern end--on the eastern end--of Pennsylvania \nAvenue. After all, the Constitution is clear on this point: Congress \nhas sole authority over trade. Two of the article I clauses as I just \ncited deals squarely with that issue, and they are conclusive, namely: \nCongress must ``regulate Commerce,'' it has the power to ``regulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations'' and has the power to ``lay and collect \n. . . Duties, Imposts and Excises.''\n  For much of this Nation's history, there was little tension between \nthe legislative and executive branches over trade regulation, unlike \nother areas of foreign policy, such as the use of military force.\n  As I have said on earlier occasions, for the first 150 years or so of \nits existence, Congress exercised broad control over foreign trade and \ntariffs. Starting in 1934, however, Congress decided that it no longer \nwished to unilaterally exercise its power to set tariffs. Accordingly, \nCongress delegated to the President in the Reciprocal Trade Agreements \nAct of 1934 the authority to negotiate tariff agreements and to \nproclaim changes in tariff rates, within certain boundaries set by \nCongress. This so-called ``Proclamation Authority'' was periodically \nrenewed, typically for brief periods of around three years.\n  It did not take Congress long to decide that it had given away--that \nit had delegated--too much trade negotiating authority. The result was \nthe Trade Expansion Act of 1962 which, among other things, created the \nOffice of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations; required \nthat multilateral trade negotiations include designated members of the \nSenate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee; and \nprevented the President from negotiating certain tariff reductions \ndesignated by the Tariff Commission.\n  Congress soon discovered that the Trade Expansion Act was not enough \nto rein in a newly emboldened executive branch, which set about seizing \nas much control over foreign trade as it could get away with--and then \nsome! The first shoe to fall was the U.S.-Canada Automotive Products \nAgreement of 1965, which the administration secretly negotiated for \nover a year without so much as notifying Congress. When President \nJohnson sent the Agreement to Congress for approval, presenting it as a \nfait accompli which needed only a legislative rubber stamp, a number of \nmy colleagues were disconcerted at what they viewed as his high-\nhandedness. Many resented the President's usurpation of Congress' \nrightful role in trade matters. And I suspect that many others wish \nthat they had then stood up for congressional prerogatives rather than \npermitting the executive to accumulate still broader powers over trade. \nInstead, members adopted a course of conciliation and appeasement; they \nshould have known, as history so often reminds us, that nothing, \nnothing, whets the appetite for power so much as a tender morsel of the \nsubstance.\n  The other shoe dangled briefly before falling to the floor with a \nresounding crash a few years later. This time, the issue was the 1964-\n67 Kennedy Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or \nGATT. At the time, tariffs were relatively low, which meant that more \nattention was focused on non-tariff barriers. This posed a problem for \ncongressional oversight. After all, while tariff changes could be \nrestricted within a designated range of percentage rates, it was much \nmore difficult to provide precise limits on the negotiation of non-\ntariff barriers. During the second session of the 89th Congress the \nSenate therefore adopted a concurrent resolution, S. Con. Res. 100, \n``urging the President to instruct U.S. negotiators in Geneva to \nbargain only on provisions authorized in the Trade Expansion Act of \n1962.''\n\n  Now, what was the President's response to this clear, explicit \ninstruction from the Senate? As best I can determine, the President \nsimply cast those directions aside, for he promptly entered into two \nnon-tariff barrier agreements that the 1962 Act had not authorized. One \nof these agreements was an antidumping code, for which President \nJohnson claimed ``sole executive agreement authority.'' I was a member \nof the Senate back then, and let me assure you that we did not look \nkindly on the President's blatant refusal to follow our instructions or \nthose of the Constitution. Our response was to state unequivocally that \nthe President's agreement did not supersede domestic law or limit the \nTariff Commission's statutory discretion to implement the antidumping \nlaws. Congress made clear that the President's antidumping agreement \nwould be followed only in cases where it did not conflict with standing \nlaw; and Congress reiterated that no President--not even that master \narm-twister, Lyndon Baines Johnson!--could encroach upon Congress' \npower to make the laws.\n  The second non-tariff agreement that President Johnson entered into \nwithout congressional authorization was the repeal of the American \nSelling Price method of customs valuation. Once again, the President \nasserted his authority to make--or, in this case, to repeal--the laws. \nIt is just what we are seeing happen in the case of line-item veto. \nCongress has given the President the authority to repeal laws. Shame, \nshame on Congress. Once again, and to its everlasting credit, Congress \nstood firm. We condemned President Johnson's refusal to heed the \nSenate's instructions and we rejected his outrageous belief that \n``executive authority'' allowed him to make trade agreements that \nchanged U.S. domestic law! Few scholars, today, of course, would agree \nwith the President's position, but the matter was less clearly defined \nthen. And, Mr. President, I for one am relieved that Congress stood \nfast in defense of its constitutional powers. I wish it would wake up \none day and read history and read the Constitution again.\n\n[[Page S11950]]\n\n  The battle was not over, however. President Nixon continued his \npredecessor's attempts to usurp Congress' trade authority, though this \ntime by persuasion rather than by intimidation. The different tactics \nof Presidents Johnson and Nixon towards the same goal may say a lot \nabout their respective personalities and presidencies. President \nJohnson had launched a frontal attack upon Congress, relying on brute \nforce and his own, ample powers of persuasion to intimidate the \nlegislature into granting him greater trade power. Nixon, however, took \na different tack; rather than storming the barricades of Congress, he \ntried to convince us to open the gates to him.\n  The President made a powerful pitch for Congress granting him the \nability to unilaterally change domestic law. He declared, with a fervor \nthat subsequent fast track supporters have echoed, that the ability of \nthe country to enter into trade agreements hung in the balance. The \nfuture of the United States itself was in jeopardy unless Congress \nwould delegate to him--you will be hearing the same thing today; the \nUnited States was in jeopardy unless Congress would delegate to him--\nthe authority to proclaim all changes to U.S. law necessitated by a \ntrade agreement. Now, how prosperous. I will not dwell on the obvious \nconstitutional infirmities of Nixon's proposal; suffice it to say that \ngiving the President the power to proclaim changes to U.S. law might \nhave raised a few eyebrows at the Constitutional Convention! Don't you \nthink so? It might have raised a few eyebrows up there with that \nillustrious group of men that included James Madison, Hamilton, \nElbridge Gerry, and others. You would have seen some eyebrows going up \nand down. Our Constitution's framers knew full well that lawmaking by \nExecutive fiat is the very definition of tyranny.\n\n  I wish that this story of the executive branch's attempt to seize the \npowers of the legislative had a happier ending; one of the sad truths \nknown to all historians is that, in real life, the endings are so often \nconfused or disappointing. President Nixon did not, of course, win the \nauthority to proclaim changes to domestic law. However, he did succeed \nin pressuring Congress to grant him the authority to negotiate certain \ntrade agreements which Congress might neither amend nor debate \nextensively: what we now simply call ``fast track.'' The President's \ninvocation of the national interest, and the fears he raised that, \nwithout fast track--and we are hearing the same siren call today--he \nwould be unable to implement an effective trade policy for the United \nStates, and it won the day. In a moment of weakness--and Congress has \nhad its moments of weakness, as in this instance--Congress allowed \nitself to be seduced by the President's rhetoric and his appeal to \npatriotic duty; and a short time later, lo and behold, fast track was \nborn.\n  Well, today, Mr. President, history appears to be repeating itself. \nOnce again, the air is filled with the dire, somber predictions about \nwhat will happen if fast track is not approved. I read that there are \nall kinds of trading, all kinds of promises being made, and we are \nseeing arms twisted out of shape--no bones broken, you understand, but \njust arms being twisted. Once again, we have a President who appeals to \nnational interest and insists that he will be unable to negotiate trade \nagreements without fast track. Once again, Members have ears that \ncannot hear and eyes that cannot see. Once again, we have a Congress \nthat appears overawed by Executive authority and unwilling to assert \nits rightful role in regulating trade--in fact, a Congress that is \nquite willing, perhaps happy, as was the Roman senate in that case, to \nhand off another of its duties to a dictator or to an emperor--in our \ncase, happy to hand off another of its constitutional duties to the \nExecutive.\n  I am sure that most of the viewing public must wonder why any elected \nofficial would willingly give up some of the power of the people, the \npower that, under the Constitution, is to be exercised by elected \nrepresentatives of the people. Power, after all, they must imagine, is \nwhat politicians crave most.\n  Oh, that we could review again the story of Lucius Quinctius \nCincinnatus, who in the year 458 B.C. was called upon by a delegation \nfrom the Roman senate. And upon inquiring why this delegation had come \nto him to interrupt his plowing of his small farm of three acres \nalongside the Tiber River, he was informed that the senate had decided \nto thrust upon him the power of a dictator so that he could rid Rome of \nthe threat of certain tribes to the east, the Aequians. And being the \nloyal patriot that he was, Cincinnatus turned to his wife Racilia and \nsaid, ``We may not have enough food to live on this winter because we \nwon't be able to sow our fields.'' Nevertheless, he wiped his \nperspiring forehead, took on the regalia of a dictator, and loyally \nassumed the responsibilities and duties that the Roman senate had \nplaced upon him. He rid the city of Rome of the threats, and he \nrelieved the Roman legions that were being surrounded by the armies of \nthe tribes to the east. Within 16 days, he had accomplished this \nmission. And he turned back the powers of dictatorship.\n  So there was the old-fashioned model of simplicity, the old-fashioned \nmodel of one who did not seek power, who did not want power. He did not \nwant the power thrust upon him, but he willingly gave up this power.\n  So, today, the people of the United States, I am sure, feel that \npower is what politicians most crave. Isn't it the thirst for power \nthat causes politicians to chase campaign money like a hound on the \nscent of a fox? Isn't it power that opens doors, rolls out red carpets, \nand serves up free food and drink? Isn't it really power, more often \nthan character, that invites the respect of others? So how can the \npublic possibly accept the notion that Congress is actually giving up \nsome of its power--its constitutional power--through fast track?\n  Now, I am not claiming that the fast track legislation is \nunconstitutional; I am simply saying that the Congress is willingly \ngiving up much of its power under the Constitution through fast track--\nnot only giving it up, but saying: here it is, take it, relieve me of \nit.\n  Perhaps, in this age of television, in which the 30-second sound bite \nis preferable to a complete and meaningful discussion of issues, some \npoliticians have come to the realization that it is easy, perhaps \npreferable, to retain the illusion of power, without actually having to \nbe saddled with any of the burdensome responsibility that comes with \ntrue power. They would rather not have it because it carries with it \nresponsibilities.\n  Think about that. If we give up the power of Congress, we no longer \nhave to take the heat for bad decisions, do we? We can just point the \nfinger. We can take those letters from angry constituents and say, \n``Sorry, not me. It is not my fault. Blame the President. That is his \npower now. He did that.''\n  How much nicer will our reelection campaigns be? Not having to run \nfor 3 years, it would be much nicer for me, much easier for me, to say, \n``That wasn't my responsibility.'' What will our opponents be able to \ncomplain about? How can they possibly run negative ads against us when \nwe have given all of our responsibility to somebody else?\n  I can see the campaign ads now. ``Vote for me. I didn't do anything, \nbut I sure looked good not doing it.'' And our opponents could retort, \n``Don't vote for him. I cannot attach any blame to him for anything, \nbut he has big ears.'' So there we have it. If we hand over all of our \npowers, and thus all of our responsibilities, then we can't be blamed \nfor anything. All we need to do is keep our hair well coiffed, buy \nfancy suits, have a nip here and a tuck there, keep a list of snappy \nsound bites in our pocket--that's all it will require to be an \ninvincible political candidate.\n  Is this what we really want? Is this what the American public out \nthere deserves? Certainly not. We were elected to do a job--to protect \nand defend the Constitution of the United States. Actually, we took an \noath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. How \nmany of us have read it lately? We certainly are doing a sad job of it \nwhen we agree to bind ourselves to fast track and to lie prostrate, \nwaiting for the executive caboose to rumble over us.\n  I said a few moments ago that history seemed to be repeating itself. \nAnd others have said that, and for good reason. Lord Byron said, \n``History with all its volumes vast hath but one page.'' Cicero said, \n``To be ignorant of that\n\n[[Page S11951]]\n\nwhich occurred before you were born is to remain always a child.''\n  So history is repeating itself. I wonder why that is. God created \nwater and other things in the beginning. He created water, H20--two \nparts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen. And it hasn't changed. It is \nstill the same. It is still H20. It is still two parts of hydrogen and \none part oxygen. Well, human nature hasn't changed either from the \nbeginning. It changed through Abel. Abel's blood cried out from the \nground. Human nature hasn't changed. We are still a slave of it.\n  So history seems to be repeating itself because human nature hasn't \nchanged. Today, I urge my colleagues to study history: Stand firm. Do \nnot give up your constitutional responsibility. Do not rise to the bait \noffered by those who accuse you of protectionism; the cause of freer \nand fairer trade is not served by Congress abdicating its power. Do not \nbe fooled into thinking that no country will negotiate with the world's \nforemost economic power because of concern about how that country's \nlegislative branch conducts its debates; the foolishness of that \nargument should be self-evident. And don't allow the threats, \ncajolements, incentives, rewards, punishments or imprecations that the \nadministration may cast your way; don't allow these to sway your \ndecision. I hope that the House will stiffen--stiffen its opposition to \nfast track. It is time to resist the executive's encroachments on the \nprerogatives of Congress. It is time, Mr. President, for Congress to \nthrow off its cloak of humility and deference and reverence for the \nexecutive and to assert its rightful constitutional role in the \nregulation of commerce with foreign nations.\n  Mr. President, recent polls have illustrated how ill-informed most \nAmericans are about their Constitution. Oh, they like it, all right, \nbut few of them can accurately answer or debate the questions about it. \nEven fewer, I would posit, understand how well and how carefully the \nConstitution balances the powers given to the three branches of \nGovernment--a balance constructed by the Founding Fathers as a defense \nagainst the evils of one-man rule. Our Founding Fathers wanted to \nescape the tyranny that a king can impose over a subservient and \nsubjugated people. And that is why our forefathers fought the American \nRevolution. That is why lives were risked, and that is why lives were \nlost. Our Founding Fathers knew that every President would be tempted \nto amass power to himself, and they hoped that the combined strength of \nthe elected representatives in Congress could check those power grabs.\n  Of course, there were those at the Convention who were concerned \nabout the thirst of the legislative branch for power and how it might \nencroach on the powers of the President. But they could not foresee the \nday when we would have political parties. They could not foresee the \nday when the President of the United States would be the titular head \nof a political party; how he would command hundreds and thousands of \npatronage positions. They could not foresee the day when television \nwould bring to the American people the news of the second--not the news \nof the minute, but the news of the second.\n  Isaiah, a great prophet, was right when he said:\n\n       Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight in the desert \n     a highway for our God.\n       Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill \n     shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, \n     and the rough places plain:\n       And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh \n     shall see it together.\n\n  And that is true. Isn't television exalting the valleys and making \nlow the mountains and the hills? Isn't all flesh seeing the glory of \nthe Lord together?\n  There came a time when the clock struck and we had the underocean \ncable, the wireless telegraph, the telephone, the diesel motor train, \nthe airplane--all of these things. And by all of these things, radio \nand television, the printing press--by all of these things, then, the \nglory of the Lord has been revealed in all of the globe. And Isaiah's \nprophecy has come true.\n  So, our Founding Fathers could not possibly have foreseen the time \nwhen Americans would have these wonderful inventions. And when the \nPresident would have, at the snap of his finger, all of the media in \nthat White House gather around his bully pulpit. They could not foresee \nthese things.\n  For the most part, this system has worked. And I hope and pray that \nit will continue to work. Thus, I say to my colleagues in the House and \nhere: Stand firm. Hold fast, and together let us oppose this fast track \nto nowhere.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11948-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11951-S11952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATOR BYRD'S 80TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, on January 8, 1997, the Senate noted the \nbeginning of Senator Robert C. Byrd's 51st year of public service to \nthe people of West Virginia. On that occasion, I spoke of Senator \nByrd's public record, of his service in both houses of the West \nVirginia State legislature, his service in both houses of the U.S. \nCongress, of the leadership positions he has held in the Senate, and of \nthe remarkable seven consecutive terms to which he has been elected to \nrepresent the people of West Virginia as a U.S. Senator. I spoke of the \npublic man, of the fascinating orator seen edifying Senators and C-SPAN \naudiences alike with his grasp of history and his love of the \nConstitution and of this body.\n  On November 20, Senator Byrd will mark another, more personal, \nanniversary. On November 20, Senator Byrd will celebrate the completion \nof his 80th year of life. To celebrate this event, along with his \ncurrent and many of his former staff members, I want to share with this \nbody and the world some of our reflections on the personal man, the \nside of Senator Byrd we see, respect, and honor every day.\n  If the heart of West Virginia is made of coal--that rich, compressed \ncarbon of long-ago life that breathes fire to warm our homes and light \nour dark nights--then Senator Byrd is a diamond honed over time to be \nits purest, clearest core. Years of experience and study have cut many \nfacets in his character, each adding a distinctive sparkle.\n  Robert C. Byrd never forgets the people of West Virginia. He cares, \ndeeply, about living up to the trust and confidence that has been \nplaced in him and about setting the best possible example for others \nthat he can in his own life and behavior. He is a tireless worker. Many \nof his staff members can tell stories about leaving him in his office \nlate at night, still working, and dragging themselves wearily in the \nnext morning, only to be greeted by his chipper, ``Good morning.'' His \nenergy and drive have not lessened over the years. When added to his \nown natural bent for self-improvement, this tendency can make him a \nchallenging man to work for, but trying to live up to this challenge \nhas made every member of his staff a better and more committed \nemployee.\n  Senator Byrd speaks often about the old values--about the importance \nof hard work, the love of family, respect for authority, loyalty to \ncommunity and country, and about reverence for the Creator. He does not \nsay these things because he believes they are popular or engaging--he \ntalks about them because he believes in them and because he lives by \nthese values. He keeps a King James Bible on his desk and often refers \nto its passages, seeking ancient wisdom to guide him through the mire \nof convoluted political issues and diverse viewpoints.\n  Senator Byrd does not take anything or anyone for granted. Being a \nSenator and working in the Capitol building has lost none of its \nimportance and none of its magic for Senator Byrd. Often, when the Sun \nis setting behind the Washington Monument, he will invite his staff to \nlook out the window and down the Mall, so that moment--that special \nvantage point and that sunset--would not be taken for granted.\n  To travel with Senator Byrd in West Virginia is to see up-close the \ntremendous respect and esteem in which he is held. Yet, his stature as \na national statesman has not created a chasm between him and those he \nserves. On the\n\n[[Page S11952]]\n\ncontrary, all West Virginians feel as if they know him. And, not only \ndo people feel they know him, many have a personal story to tell about \nhim. They often comment on ``the night he spent with our family,'' or \nwhen ``he had dinner at our house,'' or when ``he spoke at my \ncommencement,'' or when ``he helped my mother to get her widow's \nbenefits after my dad died.''\n  As he values each and every citizen of West Virginia, so does Senator \nByrd value everyone who works for him--for themselves and for the job \nthat they do for him and the people of West Virginia. He sets high \nstandards, but he never asks more of anyone than he asks of himself. \nAnd, his drive is tempered by thoughtfulness.\n  He goes out of his way to smile, greet, and speak gently with \neveryone in his office. When personal or family tragedies strike, he is \nalso there, offering support and encouragement, and living up to his \nbelief that family must come first. Senator Byrd has seen members of \nhis staff through cancer, the birth and death of children, the loss of \nparents, and all of life's best and worst experiences with \ncharacteristic kindness and understanding. In return, he has a loyal \ngroup of employees, who belie the common perception that staff turnover \non Capitol Hill is frequent. His current staff combine for a total of \nover 4 centuries of experience in his service and in service to the \nNation and the people of West Virginia, and his former staff remain \nclose to him.\n  Working with Senator Byrd is an honor because he is a legendary \nfigure even in his own time. He is larger than life, not only for the \npositions he has held and his accomplishments, but for his principles. \nOn many occasions he has quoted Mark Twain: ``Fame is vapor, popularity \nan accident, riches take wings only one thing endures: character.'' He \nis a man of principle who is willing to stick to those principles, his \nexperience, and his reason, with his eye always on the unforgiving pen \nof history and not on polls or interest group calls. He has taken some \nlonely stands, speaking candidly and thoughtfully about controversial \nnominations and treaties, and even calling for Senators to step down \nwhen their actions were detrimental to the institution of the Senate.\n  Senator Byrd's legacy to West Virginia is not one that will be \nmeasured solely in years of service, or in the number of offices held, \nor, even, as some might cynically suggest, in dollar signs. More than \nanyone or anything in memory, Robert C. Byrd has provided West \nVirginians with hope---hope of a better economy, hope that dreams of \nwell-paying jobs and nice homes do not have to be hooked on the back of \na bumper on a winding road leading out of State, hope that the way of \nlife cherished among West Virginia's hills will survive and even \nflourish, to be passed on to future generations. He has made them feel \nproud--proud of their way of life, proud of their State and proud of \nhim. There is a difference in West Virginia today that can be \nattributed to a renewed feeling of hope and a sense of belief in the \nState that Senator Byrd has so unselfishly worked to fulfill.\n  As his 51st year of public service draws to a close, and the \nbeginning of his 81st year dawns, we all offer our heartiest \ncongratulations and best wishes to the man we have been honored to work \nwith, and to learn from. To follow in his example, let us close with a \nquote, this one from Alexander Pope (1688-1744) in a letter to Mr. \nAddison, that captures Senator Byrd's essence:\n\n       Statesman, yet friend of truth! Of soul sincere,\n       In action faithful, and in honour clear;\n       Who broke no promise, served no private end,\n       Who gained no title, and who lost no friend.\n  Working for Senator Byrd is an honor and a privilege of which every \nmember of his staff is mindful each day, and it is a blessing for which \neach one will always be grateful. The sign of a truly great man is how, \nby the example of his own daily living, in and out of the public's \nview, he touches and changes everyone around him for the better. \nThrough him, his staff becomes part of a great and living institution, \ndedicated like Senator Byrd to the service of the Nation and of the \ngreat State of West Virginia.\n  Today, I join Senator Byrd's staff in wishing him a happy 80th \nbirthday and happy 51st year of public service.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a list of Senator Byrd's \nstaff, many of whom contributed greatly to this birthday wish, be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n     Ann Adler\n     James Allen\n     Neyla Arnas\n     Alisa Bailey\n     Suzanne Bailey\n     Mary Bainbridge\n     Anne Barth\n     Sue Bayliss\n     Betsy Benitez\n     Elizabeth Blevins\n     Pat Braun\n     C.

Mr. President, lately, a discussion has been undertaken \nabout the question of civil rights. Some think civil rights means \npreferences, quotas, and set-asides; others say it principally means \nequality in the law. That has been a major bone of contention as we \nhave considered the nomination of Bill Lann Lee, an able attorney, for \nthe position of chief of the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice.\n  We have had a lot of discussions about this question in recent years, \nand it is an important issue as this Senate considers that nomination. \nBut there are other matters that come before the Civil Rights Division \nof the Department of Justice. It is a great division; it has played a \ntremendous role in the changing of race relations in America and has \nhelped break down legal and de facto desegregation throughout this \ncountry. It has a great staff of 250 lawyers.\n  But I think it is also a matter of significance and importance that \nthe chief of the Civil Rights Division maintain clear and firm control \nand supervision over that Department. In recent years, as the situation \nin our Nation has changed, legal barriers to equality have been broken \ndown, and actions by that Department have raised questions about the \nvalidity of their actions and whether or not the positions they are\n\n[[Page S11953]]\n\ntaking on a number of cases are worthwhile.\n  I have heard complaints about that. As a U.S. attorney for 12 years, \nI saw this division operate. Sometimes the actions taken by the \nDepartment were valid, however in many cases their actions can fairly \nbe characterized as questionable. As the attorney general for the State \nof Alabama, I have seen a number of instances that trouble me about the \nrole and the legal position of the Department of Justice. Just this \nweek, there was a major decision by the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. That opinion rendered an important decision. One newspaper \narticle, described this opinion as a ``stinging rebuke\" to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. The Federal court ordered the Department of \nJustice to pay $63,000 in attorney's fees to a Dallas County commission \nin Alabama over an election dispute that dragged on for 4 years. Let me \nread you some of the comments from that article. I think it points out \nthe need to make sure that the person we have as chief of the Civil \nRights Division is balanced and fair and treats everyone with the \njustice that the Department contends that they do.\n  Calling this case ``very troubling,'' the appeals court blasted the \nDepartment of Justice for its continued refusal to pay legal fees and \nfor its insistence that the white leadership on the Dallas County \ncommission helped a candidate win an election contest. This is what the \ncourt said:\n\n       A properly conducted investigation would have quickly \n     revealed there was no basis for the claim of purposeful \n     discrimination against black voters.\n\n  The opinion also pointed out that the actual placement of Dallas \nCounty voters within districts was made by the predominantly black \nboard of registrars. An attorney, John Kelly, who litigated the case \nfor the county commission, said, ``This is the toughest Federal court \ndecision I have ever read.''\n  Indeed, I would have to agree with that. It is remarkable. The \ndecision means that the Federal Government will have to pay to the \ncounty commission, out of taxpayers' money, your money and my money, \n$62,872.49 into their fund, to pay for the attorneys, which the court \nfound were having to defend a case that was unjustified.\n  The opinion was written by a U.S. district judge from California who \nwas sitting by designation on the eleventh circuit panel. Although the \nrepayment of the attorneys fees is partial compensation to those \naggrieved by the Department's actions, as this judge stated, \n``Unfortunately, we cannot restore the reputation of the persons \nwrongfully branded by the Justice Department as the public officials \nwho deliberately deprived their fellow citizens of their voting rights. \nWe also lack the power to remedy the damage done to race relations in \nDallas County by the unfounded accusations of purposeful discrimination \nmade by the Department of Justice.''\n\n  The three-judge panel suggested to the Justice Department that it be \n``more sensitive'' in the future ``to the impact on racial harmony that \ncan result from the filing of a claim of purposeful discrimination.'' \nThe court said it found the Justice Department's actions, ``without a \nproper investigation of the truth, unconscionable.''\n  ``Hopefully,'' the court goes on to say, ``we will not again be faced \nwith reviewing a case as carelessly investigated as this one.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I think that the Department of Justice has an \nimportant role in this country to ensure equal rights, to make sure \neveryone has the right to vote, to make sure that there is equal \njustice under the law. But they also have a responsibility to be fair, \nto carry on their cases effectively, to be nonpartisan, to be \nobjective, and to be careful in the cases they bring. This case went on \nfor 4 years, when in fact, it could have been disposed of in short \norder with an effective investigation.\n  So, whoever is chosen to head the Civil Rights Division of the \nDepartment of Justice will have an important task. I asked Mr. Lee when \nI interviewed him, if he would take control of this Department? Would \nhe make sure that the attorneys in that Department are obeying the law \nand are actually doing justice and not injustice? Would he make sure \nthat they would not engage in civil wrongs when focusing on civil \nrights?'' Yes, this article will tell you that the Department of \nJustice can do civil wrongs and, in fact, they have done so. As \nattorney general of the State of Alabama I had occasion to witness \nthis, as the following story illustrates.\n  There was a question about whether or not the voting rights section \nof the Department of Justice had the power and the duty and the \nobligation to preclear--that is, approve--a law change in Alabama in \nwhich the judges on a panel went from five members to seven members who \nwould be elected at large. They said that they did have a right to \nobject to that, that that law could not take effect until they had \napproved it--read it, studied and approved it. We did not believe that \nwas so. There was legal authority present, including a decision made by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, that clearly indicated to me as attorney \ngeneral of Alabama that they had no authority to preclear that \ndecision. So I said we were going to proceed with it, and they \nmaintained their objection.\n  Now, there is an interesting thing about this that you may not know. \nIf you object to a ruling of the Department of Justice, Civil Rights \nDivision, in Washington, DC, and you live in Alabama, you can't file a \nlawsuit in Federal court in Alabama to get a conclusion of the matter. \nUnder the law, you have to file the lawsuit in Washington, DC, in \nFederal court, which is a very expensive process. I submit, Mr. \nPresident, they didn't think we would do it. They didn't think we cared \nenough about that principle to do so. But we told them they were wrong \nand they were going to lose this opinion, and we would file the suit. \nThey called our bluff and refused to preclear or agree that they did \nnot have control over this position.\n  So we filed a suit, and the case proceeded for a short time. The U.S. \nDepartment of Justice then confessed--admitted--that they had no basis \nfor their case, and conceded our point.\n  I say to you, Mr. President, that you can say that was a mistake and \nsome might say so. In my opinion, it was a heavyhanded application of \nthe law.\n  Those were good attorneys. They knew they didn't have to have a good \nlegal basis for the position they took, and they tried to bluff the \nState of Alabama and force the State of Alabama to capitulate anyway.\n  So this is the kind of thing that is important. All of us care about \njustice in America. Also, we care about the law being enforced, and we \nbelieve that civil rights attorneys can also make errors; civil rights \nattorneys can actually do civil wrongs. We believe that they have to \nobey the law, also.\n  So I would just say that this points out another reason, as we debate \nwho should be the head of the Civil Rights Division of the Department \nof Justice, that we select a person who is balanced, who is fair, who \nis objective, and who will follow the law, including the Constitution \nof the United States, the laws passed by this Congress, and the case \nauthority of the courts of the United States.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. AKAKA addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                         Privilege of the Floor\n\n  Mr. AKAKA.

In recent years, as the situation \nin our Nation has changed, legal barriers to equality have been broken \ndown, and actions by that Department have raised questions about the \nvalidity of their actions and whether or not the positions they are\n\n[[Page S11953]]\n\ntaking on a number of cases are worthwhile.\n  I have heard complaints about that. As a U.S. attorney for 12 years, \nI saw this division operate. Sometimes the actions taken by the \nDepartment were valid, however in many cases their actions can fairly \nbe characterized as questionable. As the attorney general for the State \nof Alabama, I have seen a number of instances that trouble me about the \nrole and the legal position of the Department of Justice. Just this \nweek, there was a major decision by the U.S. Eleventh Circuit Court of \nAppeals. That opinion rendered an important decision. One newspaper \narticle, described this opinion as a ``stinging rebuke\" to the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice. The Federal court ordered the Department of \nJustice to pay $63,000 in attorney's fees to a Dallas County commission \nin Alabama over an election dispute that dragged on for 4 years. Let me \nread you some of the comments from that article. I think it points out \nthe need to make sure that the person we have as chief of the Civil \nRights Division is balanced and fair and treats everyone with the \njustice that the Department contends that they do.\n  Calling this case ``very troubling,'' the appeals court blasted the \nDepartment of Justice for its continued refusal to pay legal fees and \nfor its insistence that the white leadership on the Dallas County \ncommission helped a candidate win an election contest. This is what the \ncourt said:\n\n       A properly conducted investigation would have quickly \n     revealed there was no basis for the claim of purposeful \n     discrimination against black voters.\n\n  The opinion also pointed out that the actual placement of Dallas \nCounty voters within districts was made by the predominantly black \nboard of registrars. An attorney, John Kelly, who litigated the case \nfor the county commission, said, ``This is the toughest Federal court \ndecision I have ever read.''\n  Indeed, I would have to agree with that. It is remarkable. The \ndecision means that the Federal Government will have to pay to the \ncounty commission, out of taxpayers' money, your money and my money, \n$62,872.49 into their fund, to pay for the attorneys, which the court \nfound were having to defend a case that was unjustified.\n  The opinion was written by a U.S. district judge from California who \nwas sitting by designation on the eleventh circuit panel. Although the \nrepayment of the attorneys fees is partial compensation to those \naggrieved by the Department's actions, as this judge stated, \n``Unfortunately, we cannot restore the reputation of the persons \nwrongfully branded by the Justice Department as the public officials \nwho deliberately deprived their fellow citizens of their voting rights. \nWe also lack the power to remedy the damage done to race relations in \nDallas County by the unfounded accusations of purposeful discrimination \nmade by the Department of Justice.''\n\n  The three-judge panel suggested to the Justice Department that it be \n``more sensitive'' in the future ``to the impact on racial harmony that \ncan result from the filing of a claim of purposeful discrimination.'' \nThe court said it found the Justice Department's actions, ``without a \nproper investigation of the truth, unconscionable.''\n  ``Hopefully,'' the court goes on to say, ``we will not again be faced \nwith reviewing a case as carelessly investigated as this one.''\n  Now, Mr. President, I think that the Department of Justice has an \nimportant role in this country to ensure equal rights, to make sure \neveryone has the right to vote, to make sure that there is equal \njustice under the law. But they also have a responsibility to be fair, \nto carry on their cases effectively, to be nonpartisan, to be \nobjective, and to be careful in the cases they bring. This case went on \nfor 4 years, when in fact, it could have been disposed of in short \norder with an effective investigation.\n  So, whoever is chosen to head the Civil Rights Division of the \nDepartment of Justice will have an important task. I asked Mr. Lee when \nI interviewed him, if he would take control of this Department? Would \nhe make sure that the attorneys in that Department are obeying the law \nand are actually doing justice and not injustice? Would he make sure \nthat they would not engage in civil wrongs when focusing on civil \nrights?'' Yes, this article will tell you that the Department of \nJustice can do civil wrongs and, in fact, they have done so. As \nattorney general of the State of Alabama I had occasion to witness \nthis, as the following story illustrates.\n  There was a question about whether or not the voting rights section \nof the Department of Justice had the power and the duty and the \nobligation to preclear--that is, approve--a law change in Alabama in \nwhich the judges on a panel went from five members to seven members who \nwould be elected at large. They said that they did have a right to \nobject to that, that that law could not take effect until they had \napproved it--read it, studied and approved it. We did not believe that \nwas so. There was legal authority present, including a decision made by \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, that clearly indicated to me as attorney \ngeneral of Alabama that they had no authority to preclear that \ndecision. So I said we were going to proceed with it, and they \nmaintained their objection.\n  Now, there is an interesting thing about this that you may not know. \nIf you object to a ruling of the Department of Justice, Civil Rights \nDivision, in Washington, DC, and you live in Alabama, you can't file a \nlawsuit in Federal court in Alabama to get a conclusion of the matter. \nUnder the law, you have to file the lawsuit in Washington, DC, in \nFederal court, which is a very expensive process. I submit, Mr. \nPresident, they didn't think we would do it. They didn't think we cared \nenough about that principle to do so. But we told them they were wrong \nand they were going to lose this opinion, and we would file the suit. \nThey called our bluff and refused to preclear or agree that they did \nnot have control over this position.\n  So we filed a suit, and the case proceeded for a short time. The U.S. \nDepartment of Justice then confessed--admitted--that they had no basis \nfor their case, and conceded our point.\n  I say to you, Mr. President, that you can say that was a mistake and \nsome might say so. In my opinion, it was a heavyhanded application of \nthe law.\n  Those were good attorneys. They knew they didn't have to have a good \nlegal basis for the position they took, and they tried to bluff the \nState of Alabama and force the State of Alabama to capitulate anyway.\n  So this is the kind of thing that is important. All of us care about \njustice in America. Also, we care about the law being enforced, and we \nbelieve that civil rights attorneys can also make errors; civil rights \nattorneys can actually do civil wrongs. We believe that they have to \nobey the law, also.\n  So I would just say that this points out another reason, as we debate \nwho should be the head of the Civil Rights Division of the Department \nof Justice, that we select a person who is balanced, who is fair, who \nis objective, and who will follow the law, including the Constitution \nof the United States, the laws passed by this Congress, and the case \nauthority of the courts of the United States.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my remarks.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nexpress my gratitude today for the cooperation of my colleagues, and in \nparticular my good friend and home State colleague, Senator Richard \nShelby, as well as colleagues from Florida and Georgia and the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee, Senator Orrin Hatch, and the chairman of \nthe Constitution Subcommittee, Senator John Ashcroft, for their \nexpedited consideration of the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and \nApalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint River basin compacts that passed the \nSenate today.\n  Our citizens in Alabama and the Southeast region have many benefits \nfrom an outstanding environment and a generous water supply. But \npopulation increases have made water resources extremely valuable. The \nwater compacts passed today by the Senate are the first step in \nallowing the three States of Alabama, Georgia, and Florida to enter \ninto legal, acceptable agreements which will ensure the water resources \nof the region are divided in a responsible and equitable way, which \nprotects the environment and ensures a reliable supply of water for \ndrinking, agriculture, and recreation.\n  Passage of these water compacts is the result of nearly 20 years of \nwork between the States of Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Today's \naction represents only the initial step in a challenging process which \nmust ultimately be carried through by these States. The water compacts \nthemselves do not contain the formula for actually dividing the water \nresources, but serve only to grant permission to the States to create a \nformula themselves. Without the water compacts, it is likely my home \nState of Alabama, along with Georgia and Florida, would be forced into \nFederal court for protracted litigation to determine an equitable way \nto divide these resources. The action taken today will allow our States \nto enter into thoughtful negotiations rather than wasteful litigation \nto determine a permanent solution to our region's water resource \nproblems.\n  Mr. President, no remarks on this action by me today would be \ncomplete without my mentioning the work of Alabama Gov. Fob James and \nState Representative Richard Laird, who have worked tirelessly toward \nthis end. Governor James has personally given his attention to the \nmatter, and negotiations have been ongoing, as I have noted, for many \nyears. Representative Laird has been very active in this entire process \nand has been the main spokesman for Alabama's effort for over 3 years. \nAs a former attorney general in the State of Alabama and one who was \ninvolved in these activities, I know firsthand the personal commitment \nthat Representative Laird has given to this effort.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to recognize Mr. Craig Kneisel, \nthe chief of the environmental section of the Alabama Attorney \nGeneral's office. Craig Kneisel has been the chief of that \nenvironmental office since its founding around 20 years ago. He has \ngiven leadership and legal advice to this effort that has reached a \ngood conclusion today.\n  So we have made a major step toward making an equitable resolution of \nthe water problems of these States, but we have to keep on going. There \nis no doubt that, as our population increases, as our economy grows, \nthere will be greater and greater stress on these wonderful \nenvironmental resources. We must protect them and at the same time must \nmake sure that economic growth is facilitated by having a healthy \nenvironmental resource such as these two river basins.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

Mr. President, 2 years ago Senator Shelby, the \ndistinguished Senator from Alabama, and I were managing the Treasury-\nPostal appropriations bill on the floor at about this time of the year, \nI believe.\n  And one of the actions that we had taken in our bill was to zero out \nthe drug czar's office. And the reason that we had done that was that \nwe were quite unhappy with the progress and the performance and, \nespecially, the effort made to interdict and the effort here at home to \ntry to get young people to quit consuming drugs.\n  We were persuaded at the end of the day, Senator Hatch, Senator \nBiden, and the President himself, saying that they were going to make \nsome substantial changes.\n  Change No. 1 that they made was to bring on Barry McCaffrey, a \nretired Army general. I do not know how they talked him into it. \nSomehow they managed to talk him into coming back and being the drug \nczar.\n  Yesterday, Mr. President, Barry McCaffrey sent a letter to the \nSecretary of Defense. Among other things he has done over the past \ncouple years, this justifies both the President's confidence in him and \nSenator Shelby's and my confidence that action would occur.\n  General McCaffrey sent Secretary Cohen, Secretary of Defense, a \nletter on the 6th of November saying essentially that:\n\n       The National Narcotics Leadership Act requires that the \n     Office of National Drug Control Policy review the drug budget \n     of each department and certify whether the amount requested \n     is adequate to implement the drug control program of the \n     President. For [fiscal year] 1999, the Department of Defense \n     has requested $809 million for drug control programs, \n     approximately the same level as FY 1998. After careful \n     review, ONDCP has determined pursuant to 21 U.S.C. . . . that \n     this budget cannot be certified.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a gutsy move. As you know, as everybody around \nthis town very long knows, to send the Department of Defense a letter \nsaying, ``We're not going to certify that your budget is adequate to \naccomplish the strategy that we have all approved in terms of fighting \ndrugs in America,'' is a rather substantially gutsy move. And I support \nit 100 percent.\n  Perhaps Secretary Cohen will have a response to it. I have a great \ndeal of respect for Secretary Cohen as well. Perhaps he will be able to \ncome back and give a justification as to why the additional money for \nthe Andean Coca Reduction Initiative, for the Mexican Initiative, for \nthe Caribbean Violent Crime and Regional Interdiction Initiative, and \nfor the National Guard Counterdrug Operations are fully funded at the \n$809 million level.\n  My guess is, he will not. My guess is that General McCaffrey has done \nhis homework and analyzed it well and understands what the drug policy \nis supposed to accomplish. And he understands that as drug czar he has \nauthority.\n  In the past, drug czars have not exercised that authority quite as \nwillingly. Barry McCaffrey did. And I hope this Congress supports him. \nAll of us, when we are home, we will have townhall meetings. And if the \nsubject of drugs comes up of, what are we doing? people say to me, ``At \nleast I hear you say it's a war on drugs. Describe the nature of the \nwar we're fighting. Are we winning it? Are we losing it? What kind of \nresources are we putting into it?'' I say, ``We've got a drug czar. \nWe've got a drug strategy. And we're implementing that drug strategy. \nWe're not going to hold anything back in order to be successful.''\n  What General McCaffrey has done is he has called upon the Department \nof Defense to do just that. As I said, I have not seen Secretary \nCohen's response to this letter. I am here this evening just to applaud \nthe drug czar for having the courage that previously drug czars have \nbeen a little reluctant to show. And if it is shown that these\n\n[[Page S11955]]\n\nadditional resources are needed in order to be able to answer the \nquestion at home in townhall meetings in Nebraska that that is what is \nneeded to get the job done, then I hope the Congress will provide the \nDepartment of Defense with the resources and insist that the Department \nof Defense allocate in 1999 the resources in order to be able to get it \ndone.\n  I have not read all of them, the three- or four- or five-part series \nin the Washington Post on the problem of drugs coming across the \nborder--so-called. There is not much of a border between the United \nStates and Mexico. It is over 2,000 miles. And from what I have seen \ndown there, there is not much to let you know when you are in Mexico or \nin the United States. And there is a tremendous amount of truck and \nautomobile traffic and an awful lot of resources and money behind the \neffort to get drugs into the United States.\n  It is corrupting Mexico, making it difficult for them to operate--an \nextremely violent world. And in this morning's paper, there is a story \nabout Mr. Fuentes' doctors, three of whom were held responsible for his \ndeath, apparently, giving him a facelift or something so he would look \na little different. They were found in concrete canisters along a road \nin Mexico.\n  These guys play for keeps. From their standpoint, it is a war. From \ntheir standpoint, they are deploying the maximum amount of resources, \ntheir considerable amount of wealth and resources.\n  Barry McCaffrey, a first-rate military officer, now our drug czar, \nwhen he says to me, ``We need additional resources in order to be \nsuccessful in these four areas,'' I pay attention to him. And I applaud \nhis willingness to be able to come to the Department of Defense and to \nthis Congress and say, ``This is what we need to do in order to be \nsuccessful.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that three documents be \nprinted in the Record: One is the letter of November 6 that General \nMcCaffrey sent to Secretary Cohen, and another is the document that \nindicates the additional resources that are needed, and the third is \nthe ``Legal Authority to De-Certify Agency Budgets.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1997.\n     Hon. William S. Cohen,\n     Secretary of Defense, Department of Defense, The Pentagon, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Cohen: The National Narcotics Leadership Act \n     requires that the Office of National Drug Control Policy \n     (ONDCP) review the drug budget of each department and certify \n     whether the amount requested is adequate to implement the \n     drug control program of the President. For FY 1999, the \n     Department of Defense (DoD) has requested $809 million for \n     drug control programs, approximately the same level as FY \n     1998. After careful review, ONDCP has determined pursuant to \n     21 U.S.C. Sec. 1502(c)(3)(B) that this budget cannot be \n     certified.\n       To correct the deficiencies in the current FY 1999 \n     proposal, DoD needs to amend its FY 1999 budget to include an \n     additional $141 million in drug control initiatives, which \n     will enhance operations in the Andes, Mexico, the Caribbean, \n     and along our borders. Details associated with these \n     amendments are highlighted in the enclosed document. Under 21 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1502(c)(5), DoD is required to include this \n     additional funding in its FY 1999 submission to the Office of \n     Management and Budget.\n       The support of the Department of Defense (DoD) is critical \n     to achieving the goals of the National Drug Control Strategy. \n     Appreciate your leadership of DoD's important counterdrug \n     programs. The outstanding success of these missions in a \n     credit to the dedicated men and women of our armed forces. \n     Working together, the Executive Branch can structure a drug \n     control budget which will reduce drug use and its \n     consequences in America. Look forward to receiving the \n     Department's amended FY 1999 budget proposal. Your support on \n     this issue, which is so vital to our Nation's security and \n     the health of our young people, is critical.\n           Respectfully,\n                                               Barry R.

Sec. 1502(c)(5))\n\n       Andean Coca Reduction Initiative (+$75 million). This \n     initiative incorporates enforcement and interdiction measures \n     that will disrupt the cocaine export industry, These efforts \n     will include support for host nation programs to interdict \n     the flow of coca base and cocaine in source countries, as \n     well as expanded support to Peruvian and Colombian riverine \n     interdiction programs.\n       Mexican Initiative (+$24 million). This proposal will \n     provide additional resources to reduce the flow of illicit \n     drugs from Mexico into the United States and disrupt and \n     dismantle criminal organizations engaging in drug trafficking \n     and money laundering. This effort will help implement the \n     Declaration of the Mexican-U.S. Alliance Against Drugs signed \n     by President Zedillo and President Clinton on May 6, 1997. It \n     will expand U.S. operational support to detection and \n     monitoring missions in Mexican airspace and territorial seas, \n     establish a joint law enforcement investigative capability in \n     the Bilateral Border Task Forces, and aid the Mexican \n     Government in developing a self-sustaining interdiction \n     capability.\n       Caribbean Violent Crime and Regional Interdiction \n     Initiative (+$12 million). This effort will target drug \n     trafficking-related criminal activities and violence in the \n     Caribbean Region, including South Florida, Puerto Rico, the \n     U.S. Virgin Islands, and the independent states and \n     territories of the Eastern Caribbean. This will implement \n     commitments made by the President during the Caribbean Summit \n     held in Barbados.\n       National Guard Counterdrug Operations (+$30 million). These \n     funds will partially restore reductions incurred since FY \n     1993 in State Plans funding, which includes support for \n     counterdrug activities along the border.\n                                  ____\n\n         Executive Office of the President, Office of National \n           Drug Control Policy,\n                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 1997.\n     Memorandum for Director\n     Through: Chief of Staff\n     From: Charles Blanchard, Director, Office of Legal Counsel\n\n              Legal Authority To De-Certify Agency Budgets\n\n       At your request, both General Counsel Judith Leonard and I \n     independently reviewed ONDCP's statutes to determine our \n     authority to certify national drug control agency budget.\n       It is our firm and considered legal opinion that the \n     statute gives you two specific powers:\n       (1) The power to ``certify in writing as to the adequacy of \n     such [agency budget] request in whole or in part . . . and \n     [should a budget not be certified] . . . include in the \n     certification an initiative or funding level that would make \n     this request adequate.'' [21 U.S.C. Sec. 1502(c)(3)(B)]; and\n       (2) The power to ``request the head of a department or \n     agency to include in the department's or agency's budget \n     submission [to OMB] funding requests for specific initiatives \n     that are consistent with the President's priorities for the \n     National Drug Control Strategy'' [21 U.S.C. Sec. 1502(c)(5)]\n       Most importantly, the statute makes quite clear that ``the \n     department or agency shall comply with such a [ONDCP] \n     request.'' [21 U.S.C. Sec. 1502(c)(5)] In our view, this \n     power to order an agency to place specific initiatives in the \n     budget request is the most important power.\n       We have reviewed the proposed letter to the Secretary of \n     Defense, and believe that it is fully consistent with this \n     statute.\n\n  Mr. KERREY.

Mr. President, I wish to address the great efforts that \nthis\n\n[[Page S11956]]\n\nChamber has undertaken on the matter of NATO enlargement--the extension \nof the alliance membership to the democracies of Central and Eastern \nEurope.\n  It is sometimes charged that Congress has provided serious \nconsideration to this matter. Anyone who makes this argument has not \npaid attention to the legislation Congress passed on this matter over \nthe last 3 years and have clearly ignored the activities of our \ncommittees, particularly the extensive amount of hearings that have \nbeen held over the last 2 months. Our leadership on both sides of the \naisle is to be commended for the time and effort they have dedicated to \nthis important matter.\n  Allow me to quickly review the highlights of Congress' role in the \nNATO enlargement issue. It is important to remember that Congress, in a \nmost bipartisan manner, has led the charge for NATO enlargement.\n  In 1994, the 104th Congress, then led by a Democratic majority, \npassed the NATO Enlargement Participation Act, an initiative of then-\nSenator Hank Brown. This act not only endorsed NATO enlargement, but \nalso called upon the President to establish programs to assist selected \nCentral European democracies prepare for the burdens and \nresponsibilities of alliance membership. This was a bipartisan \ninitiative, one that found strong support in both parties. I might add \nthat NATO enlargement was even a key pillar in the GOP's Contract With \nAmerica.\n  In 1996, the Senate passed by recorded vote of 81-16 the NATO \nEnlargement Facilitation Act, a bill that explicitly endorsed NATO \nmembership for Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovenia.\n  This summer the alliance finally heeded the urging of Congress. Last \nJuly, at the Madrid summit, the North Atlantic Council invited Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic to accession negotiations that will \nculminate in protocols of accessions that should be approved and signed \nthis December at the annual NAC ministerial.\n  I might add that I had the honor serving as a member of the \nPresident's delegation to the Madrid summit along with Senators Joe \nBiden, Gordon Smith, and Barbara Mikulski. We attended in our capacity \nas members of the Senate's NATO Observer Group. Our role in this \nhistoric summit reflected the bipartisan support behind NATO's policy \nof enlargement and the degree of consultation and communication \noccurring on this issue between Congress and the administration.\n  Since the Madrid summit, and particularly over the last 2 months, \nthis Chamber has focused on NATO enlargement in a manner I believe \nunprecedented for any realm of issues. I and Senator Joe Biden have had \nthe privilege of facilitating 16 NATO Observer Group meetings with \nadministration officials, experts, and foreign officials including NATO \nSecretary General, Javier Solana.\n  I want to especially commend the leadership of the Senate committees, \nwhose statutory jurisdictions are far broader, for directing so much of \ntheir energies to this matter.\n  Over the last 2 months alone, the Foreign Relations Committee, the \nAppropriations Committee, and the Senate Budget Committee have held a \ntotal of nine hearings on NATO enlargement. They have addressed such \nissues as the geopolitical rational behind this initiative, the affect \nit has on Russia's evolution as international actor and as a democracy, \nthe financial costs, and the military implications, among other issues, \nand the pro's and con's that one hears on these matters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na list of the meetings and hearings that have been conducted by these \nthree Senate committees on NATO enlargement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Senate Committee Hearings on NATO Enlargement\n\n       October 7: Senate Foreign Relations Committee begins \n     hearing on NATO expansion.

These hearings have been conducted to the highest standard. \nThey have addressed the most contentious and potentially divisive \ndimensions of NATO enlargement. They have provided a powerful podium \nfor skeptics and for those who simply want to be sure that all the \n``i's'' have been dotted.\n  Mr. President, I firmly believe that NATO enlargement will yield a \nstronger alliance, a more peaceful and more stable Europe, and a Europe \nthat will be an even more effective partner for the United States in a \nworld where our shared interests are increasingly global in nature.\n  I am not going to burden this Chamber with another rendition of why I \nsupport NATO enlargement.\n  However, I have followed these hearings closely, and I would like to \naddress what I think one should draw from their deliberations on three \nof the most important issues of NATO enlargement: the cost; its \nrelationship to America's global interests; and, the future of Russia.\n  Costs has been the most debated dimension of NATO enlargement. \nHowever, the Senate's examination of this issue so far leaves me even \nmore confident that this will be a most worthwhile investment.\n  Earlier this year, the President, at the request of Congress, \nestimated that NATO enlargement will cost the United States some $100-\n200 million per year over the next decade.\n  Last month, Secretary Cohen and Secretary Albright testified to the \nAppropriations Committee that the costs to the United States may be \nless because some if not much of the infrastructure existing in Poland, \nthe Czech Republic, and Hungary is more capable than previously \nestimated.\n  More detail on the costs of NATO enlargement is an urgent priority. \nNATO will soon complete its own estimate of the costs of integrating \nthe three nations. This report is due before the December NAC \nministerial. It is imperative that this study is fully transparent, \nclear, and specific.\n  With that said, even if NATO enlargement were to cost the United \nStates some $500 million a year over the decade, that yearly cost would \nstill amount to about a quarter of the cost of one B-2 bomber. That is \nnot a bad deal considering the gains we will attain in solidifying \npeace and stability in post-cold-war Europe.\n  The Senate hearings have also reaffirmed my confidence that NATO \nenlargement will enhance America's ability to secure its vital interest \naround the globe--not just those in Europe.\n  NATO enlargement is critical step toward a more unified and more \npeaceful Europe. It is, thus, fundamental to Europe's evolution into a \npartner that will more effectively meet global challenges before to the \ntransatlantic community. An undivided Europe at peace is a Europe that \nwill be better able to look outward, a Europe better able to join with \nthe United States to address necessary global security concerns. A \npartnership with an undivided Europe in the time-tested architecture of \nNATO will enable the United States to more effectively meet the global \nchallenges to its vital interests at time when our defense resources \nare increasingly strained.\n  This was a, if not the, central theme of former national security \nadvisor Zbigniew Brzezinski's recent presentation before the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. To use his words:\n\n       NATO expansion is central to the vitality of the European-\n     American connection, to the\n\n[[Page S11957]]\n\n     scope of a secure and democratic Europe, and to the ability \n     of the America and Europe to work together in promoting \n     international security.\n\n  European instability, which is inherently more likely should we fail \nto extend Alliance membership to the democracies of Central Europe, \nportends to be the greatest of drains upon U.S. defense resources, \nenergy, and effort. This has already proven to be the case in Bosnia. \nWe must take the pro-active steps necessary to consolidate and widen \nthe zone of security and, thus, peace and stability in Europe. NATO \nenlargement is the most effective step we can take toward this end.\n  Third, these Senate hearings have constructively and aggressively \naddressed concerns that have been voiced about the potential impact of \nNATO enlargement upon Russia's future.\n  Testimony from Under Secretary of State Thomas Pickering, our former \nAmbassador to Moscow, emphasized that NATO enlargement has not produced \na revanchist Russian foreign policy nor undercut democracy in Russia. \nIn fact, let me quote directly form Ambassador Pickering's testimony.\n  He stated:\n\n       Over the last 18 months, precisely, when NATO enlargement \n     has been a salient point of our agenda, Russian reform and \n     security cooperation have moved forward, not backward.\n\n  This former ambassador to Russia added that in the course of NATO \nenlargement, Yeltsin was reelected as Russia's president and that since \nthen he has elevated reformers in his government. Moreover, Yeltsin has \nappointed a new defense minister, one who publicly supports START II. \nMost importantly, last May Russia signed the Founding Act, an agreement \nthat offers an unprecedented opportunity for a new era of cooperation \nand partnership between the Alliance and Russia.\n  Mr. President, too many times this year Congress has been accused of \npaying inadequate attention to the policy of NATO enlargement. The fact \nis that Congress has aggressively addressed this matter. Congress has \nnot only been engaged in this policy its bipartisan leadership on this \nmatter has actually been a catalyst of action.\n  Much commendation is due to the Senate leadership and the Chamber as \na whole for the sustained attention that has been directed to the many \nfacets of this issue. The amount of consultation that has occurred \nbetween the administration and Congress makes NATO enlargement a model \nof how to approach the executive-legislative dimension of U.S. security \npolicy.\n  I fully recognize that our deliberations on NATO enlargement are far \nfrom over. More hearings are sure to be held on this important policy, \nas they should be. However, I thought it important to highlight the \ntremendously effective efforts that this Chamber has already directed \nto this matter of national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11955-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11957-S11958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATOR BIDEN'S NATO SPEECH\n\n  Mr. ROTH. Mr. President, our colleague, Senator Joe Biden, addressed \nthe Permanent Representatives to the North Atlantic Council, the so \ncalled NAC, during their visit to the United States last month. His \nspeech was an impressive overview of the state of debate here in the \nUnited States on NATO enlargement and how that debate is being affected \nthe debate in Europe on issues of transatlantic security. Among these \nare, of course, the effort to foster reconciliation and peace in the \nBalkans.\n  The next coming months will feature a number of important events \nconcerning NATO enlargement, including the NAC ministerial in mid-\nDecember which will yield protocols of accession into NATO for Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic.\n  Keeping in mind the debate that we will have early next year on NATO \nenlargement, I encourage my colleagues to read Senator Binden's \nstatement. It is one that should also be closely read by our colleagues \nin the executive branch.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Biden's \noutstanding speech on NATO enlargement be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Ratification of NATO Enlargement by the U.S. Senate\n\n                   (By Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr.)\n\n       I am honored by the invitation of the North Atlantic \n     Council to share my thoughts on the American side of one of \n     the most important foreign policy decisions that our alliance \n     has faced for many decades: ratification of the admission of \n     Poland, the Czech Republic, and Hungary to membership in the \n     North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n       First, let me make clear that I am a strong proponent of \n     NATO enlargement. In the interest of brevity, and because \n     there is no need to persuade this audience, I will not go \n     into the details of my rationale.\n       Let me just say I believe the case for enlargement is \n     overwhelmingly persuasive. First, it is my belief that the \n     inclusion of the three aforementioned countries--if they meet \n     all of NATO's rigid political, military, and economic \n     criteria--would strengthen the alliance and enhance the \n     security of the United States.\n       Second, the consequences if we fail to act are equally \n     serious. The history of the twentieth century has taught us \n     that if the United States distances itself from European \n     affairs, the result on the continent is instability leading \n     to chaos. Ultimately, dealing with the instability and chaos \n     will cost far more in blood and treasure than the initial \n     costs of staying engaged.\n       Finally, there is the moral factor. As Secretary of State \n     Albright noted in her testimony before the Senate Foreign \n     Relations Committee:\n       What possible justification can there be for confirming the \n     old cold war division of Europe by freezing out the new \n     democracies east of Germany?\n       As most of you know, according to the U.S. Constitution, \n     international treaties must be ratified by a two-thirds \n     majority in the Senate. In this case, we would be ratifying \n     an amendment to the Treaty of Washington of 1949. As the \n     Democratic party's chief foreign policy spokesman in the \n     Senate, I have the responsibility to lead the fight for \n     ratification.\n       Despite what I believe to be the overwhelming logic for \n     NATO enlargement, ratification will not be easy--it will not \n     be a ``slam dunk,'' as we say in this country. It will be \n     considered, not only in the context of national security \n     policy, but in the context of domestic politics.\n       And in the context of our debate about engagement versus \n     isolationism. I know most of you are primarily concerned with \n     military matters. But I hope you will convey to the civilian \n     and political leaders in each of your countries the kinds of \n     issues that could derail ratification in the U.S. Senate--to \n     the detriment of all of us.\n       My principal reasons for being cautious about NATO \n     enlargement revolve around two sides of the same issue: \n     burden-sharing. The first side relates to sharing the costs \n     of NATO enlargement; the second side relates to sharing the \n     military duties in Bosnia.\n       Contrary to assertions by some European politicians, these \n     cost and burden-sharing issues are not superficial problems. \n     They have direct relevance, not only to the ratification of \n     enlargement, but also to the kind of alliance we will have in \n     the 21st century.\n       First the costs. There has been a good deal of publicity in \n     the United States about three widely differing cost estimates \n     of NATO enlargement. NATO's own cost-estimate--mandated by \n     the North Atlantic Council at last July's Madrid summit--will \n     not be known until just before the December NATO ministerial. \n     So any firm predictions about how that will come out would be \n     risky and premature.\n       Nonetheless, the latest estimate from the Clinton \n     administration, offered this week in testimony before the \n     Foreign Relations Committee, was somewhat reassuring. It \n     appears that the NATO estimate may be somewhat lower than the \n     Pentagon's earlier study because only three--not four--\n     countries are to be added to the alliance, and some of their \n     militaries are in a bit better shape than previously thought.\n       Whatever the final numbers, the atmospherics of the debate \n     over cost-sharing since Madrid have been damaging to Trans-\n     Atlantic solidarity. Public statements from West European \n     leaders that their countries should not--or even will not--\n     pay any additional costs for enlargement given potent \n     ammunition both to neo-isolationists in the U.S. Senate and \n     to those who favor engagement but who have legitimate \n     questions about costs.\n       Although there have been many warnings in the United States \n     about the possibly huge costs of NATO enlargement, to my \n     knowledge not a single American politician has said that we \n     will not pay our share if enlargement is ratified. Yet when \n     European leaders--before even waiting for the official NATO \n     cost-study to come out in December--threaten not to pay even \n     one additional franc or mark for enlargement, it is waving a \n     red flag in front of my colleagues in the Senate.\n       Many of my fellow Senators are aware of the fact that West \n     Europeans face competing priorities. We know that the eleven \n     European NATO members who are also members of the European \n     Union are currently engaged in painful budget cutting in \n     order to meet the criteria for a single currency, the \n     Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) on January 1, 1999. And we \n     are aware that Germany and others are insisting that those \n     countries who qualify be held to rigid fiscal discipline \n     thereafter through a so-called ``stability pact'' without \n     ``political'' criteria.\n\n[[Page S11958]]\n\n       We do not underestimate the political stakes: resentment \n     against this belt-tightening played a key role in the defeat \n     of President Chirac's coalition in the French national \n     elections last June and in the one-day temporary fall of \n     Prime Minister Prodi's government in Italy earlier this \n     month. Several other EU member states have also seen anti-\n     austerity demonstrations.\n       As a politician, I empathize with the challenge my European \n     parliamentary colleagues face. But we all have to make \n     difficult choices. For example, in my country after years of \n     spirited debate we have finally agreed upon a plan to balance \n     the Federal budget by the year 2002. In fact, by having taken \n     extremely painful measures like reducing the civilian Federal \n     workforce by more than a quarter-million individuals we may \n     reach a balanced budget even earlier.\n       So however difficult it may be, if you--our European \n     allies--want continued American involvement in your security, \n     to use a baseball metaphor, your governments will have to \n     ``step up to the plate.'' Let me be as frank as I possibly \n     can: Americans simply must not be led to believe that our \n     European allies will cut corners on NATO in order to fulfill \n     their obligations to the European union.\n       Let me go one step further, if NATO is to remain a vibrant \n     organization with the United States playing a lead role, when \n     the alliance cost figures are issued in December, the non-\n     U.S. members must join the United States in declaring their \n     willingness to assume their fair share of direct enlargement \n     costs.\n       This includes developing the power projection capabilities \n     to which all alliance members agreed in the ``strategic \n     concept'' in 1991, before enlargement was even being \n     seriously discussed. The flexibility afforded by these power \n     projection enhancements are central to NATO's ability to \n     carry out its expanded, new mission--to defend our common \n     ideals beyond our borders, while we continue to carry out the \n     core function of defending the territory of alliance members.\n       Some of our European allies--the United Kingdom, France, \n     Germany, and the Netherlands, in particular--are making \n     strides in improving the deployability and sustainability of \n     their forces. But neither their forces, nor those of the rest \n     of our European partners, are as yet fully deployable.\n       If our European partners were not to meet these force-\n     projection obligations--and it was this part of the Pentagon \n     study that occasioned the loudest criticism from across the \n     Atlantic--the United States would continue to possess the \n     only fully deployable and sustainable land and air forces in \n     the alliance and would therefore be cast in the permanent \n     role of ``the good gendarme of Europe''--a role that neither \n     the American people, nor the Senate of the United States, \n     would accept.\n       I also would like to comment on the recent call by some \n     West European defense ministers for counting economic \n     assistance to Central and Eastern Europe as a substitute for \n     meeting their countries' current alliance commitments and \n     their future share of enlargement costs. Their proposal makes \n     no sense and is totally counter-productive.\n       First of all, European statistics on economic assistance \n     typically include healthy components of export credits, tied \n     aid, and investment, making alleged comparisons with U.S. \n     assistance one of ``apples versus oranges.'' Thus, the \n     difference in the amount of economic aid from Western Europe \n     and from the United States is less significant than some \n     European politicians would have us believe.\n       Second, even if Western European economic assistance to the \n     East since 1990 has exceeded our own, it would be unwise to \n     consider these contributions as a substitute for obligations \n     related to NATO's military budget: it would only reinforce \n     the ``European businessman''/``American gendarme'' syndrome. \n     It would widen the military gap between the U.S. and the \n     continent and, not unintentionally, give a comparative \n     advantage to Western European companies in dealing with the \n     East on the economic front. We in the United States simply \n     won't play that game.\n       Third, and most importantly, such substitution arguments \n     are ultimately self-defeating for Europe. As many of my \n     Senate colleagues are eager to point out, if Western Europe \n     claims security credit for its economic assistance to Eastern \n     Europe, then the United States can justifiably claim credit \n     for its worldwide containment of the threat of nuclear \n     proliferation, for keeping international sea lanes open, and \n     for guaranteeing continued access to Middle East oil.\n       To be blunt: I don't think you want us to play that game, \n     because we can win it hands down.\n       The real point is that burden-sharing is not a book-keeping \n     exercise. We would all do well to restrict the NATO burden-\n     sharing discussion to just that--military burden-sharing in \n     the alliance.\n       One other point related to comparative spending on defense: \n     above and beyond enlargement and power-projection capability, \n     unless you--our European allies--significantly upgrade your \n     militaries, particularly in gathering and real-time \n     processing of information, a ``strategic disconnect'' between \n     a technologically superior United States military and \n     outdated Western European militaries will eventually make it \n     impossible for NATO to function effectively. From several \n     personal conversations, I believe that this is a worry that \n     many of you share.\n       There is a second dark cloud looming on the horizon of \n     Trans-Atlantic relations. In the spring of 1998, just when \n     the U.S. Senate is likely to be voting on amending the Treaty \n     of Washington to accept new members, American SFOR ground \n     forces are scheduled to be completing their withdrawal from \n     Bosnia.\n       As it now stands, our European NATO allies will follow \n     suit, in line with their ``in together, out together'' \n     policy, despite a U.S. offer to make our air, naval, \n     communications, and intelligence assets available to a \n     European-led follow-on force, with an American rapid reaction \n     force on standby alert ``over the horizon'' in Hungary or \n     Italy.\n       My colleagues in the Senate have listened carefully as some \n     European NATO members, led by France, call for more European \n     leadership in the alliance and for a sturdier ``European \n     pillar'' in NATO. But when they hear those same European \n     voices say they will refuse to maintain troops in Bosnia \n     without U.S. participation, it sounds like unfair burden-\n     sharing and it only reinforces their doubts about NATO \n     itself. After all, if Bosnia is the prototypical crisis \n     the alliance will face in the next century, and internal \n     squabbling prevents it from dealing effectively with \n     Bosnia now, even staunch NATO supporters will be hard-\n     pressed to defend its continued relevance.\n       France's position on Bosnia is particularly irritating when \n     one considers its insistence on European command of Allied \n     Forces Southern Europe (AFSOUTH) in Naples, the home of the \n     U.S. Sixth Fleet. No matter how Paris tries to dress it up, \n     this demand is perceived by U.S. Senators as a gratuitous \n     poke in the eye. Not only is this idea a non-starter, it \n     simply poisons the Trans-Atlantic atmosphere.\n       As many of you may know, I have been deeply involved in our \n     policy toward Bosnia since 1991. My own personal view is that \n     it was unwise to have set a June 1998 date for SFOR's \n     withdrawal and that the United States should agree to a \n     scaled-down ground force in Bosnia beyond that date, with \n     Europeans comprising the overwhelming majority of the ground \n     forces. In short, a C.J.T.F. (combined joint task force), but \n     one in which the United States has at least some forces \n     present in all its components.\n       But whatever the final mix of post-SFOR forces, it is \n     essential that we settle this issue this fall in order for an \n     orderely redeployment to take place and to clear the air for \n     the parliamentary debates on NATO enlargement. Time is \n     running short.\n       Let me sum up by giving you my prognosis for ratification \n     of NATO enlargement in the U.S. Senate. The debate has \n     already begun and will continue to be lively. In the end, I \n     believe it will be very difficult for most of my colleagues \n     to vote against admitting the Poles, Czechs, and Hungarians \n     if the final accession negotiations reveal that they are \n     qualified for membership.\n       But I also believe that unless the United States quickly \n     comes to a satisfactory burden-sharing understanding with our \n     European and Canadian allies, the future of NATO in the next \n     century will be very much in doubt.\n       In that context, an advance European declaration of \n     willingness to share fairly in the enlargement costs that \n     NATO will announce in December, and a spirit of compromise on \n     a post-SFOR force for Bosnia, would considerably enhance the \n     chances for ratification of NATO enlargement by the U.S. \n     Senate.\n       Together we can enlarge and strengthen NATO, but only if we \n     fairly share the burden of meeting the challenges of the \n     twenty-first century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11957-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11958-S11959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

The Federal Government has spent millions of dollars \nduring the past decade to support research laboratories, universities \nand the private sector to develop technologies to reduce the Nation's \nreliance on imported oil through the use of renewable energy sources, \nand to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of cleaning up \nfederally-owned sites which are contaminated with hazardous waste. This \nresearch is extremely valuable and is directed at addressing some of \nthe most serious challenges facing our Nation. Unfortunately, these \nnational research and development initiatives often do not provide \nmaximum benefit to the Federal Government or to the private sector, \nsince the technologies are not demonstrated to be effective on a \ncommercial scale. It is my hope that as we continue to pursue these \nissues, the Federal Government can do more to help give the lessons \nlearned from this research broader application.\n  A new program which recently has come to my attention--Acceleration \nDemonstration of Federally Sponsored Research for Renewable Energy \nProduction and Environmental Remediation--seeks to remedy this problem. \nIt seems to me that through a cooperative effort with the Department of \nEnergy, its laboratories and other federally-sponsored research \ninstitutions, non-profit research and business development \norganizations could help commercialize existing federal research so \nthat Americans could benefit more widely from these Federal \ninitiatives.\n  Mr. BURNS. I agree with my colleague from Michigan. Commercialization \nof Federal research, particularly through non-profit organizations, \ncould play a significant role in expanding the benefits from this \nresearch and get the most from our Federal research investments.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. The Senator is right. The Federal Government should do \nmore to help commercialize the results of federally-sponsored research. \nDOE should consider what steps it can undertake to better achieve this \nobjective.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Department of Energy has a number of programs by \nwhich it might be able to team with non-Federal entities to \ncommercialize technologies developed by the Department. I would \nencourage the Department of Energy to review the proposal mentioned by \nmy colleagues and, to the extent appropriate within existing Department \nof Energy technology transfer programs, consider it for possible \nfunding.\n  Mr. REID. That is correct. Funding is available under this bill for \nDOE in the Acceleration Demonstration of Federally Sponsored Research \nfor Renewable Energy Production and Environmental Remediation programs \naccount that can be awarded for commercialization of renewable fuels \nand environmental cleanup technologies on a competitive basis. I would \nurge DOE to seriously consider supporting this work in fiscal year 1998 \nup to the $5 million level.\n  Mr. BURNS. That is my view as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11959-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 THE VILLHAUERS OF HOSMER, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am looking forward to returning to \nSouth Dakota next week to join the citizens of my home state in \nhonoring the men and women who have so faithfully served our nation in \nthe armed forces. While all those who have given themselves to the call \nof duty will be on our minds on Tuesday, November 11, 1997, there is \none family that will especially be on my mind.\n  The Villhauers of Hosmer, South Dakota hold a distinction that may \nwell separate them from any other family in this nation. Mr. and Mrs. \nFred Villhauer raised 7 sons in Hosmer, all of whom served this nation \nconcurrently during World War II. Fred Jr., John, Henry, Albert, \nArthur, Edmund and Herman Villhauer all answered the call of this \ncountry, and laid their lives on the line for the security and ideals \nof the United States.\n  Six of the brothers would survive the second world war and return to \nthe United States. Albert, unfortunately, was killed during the \nretaking of the Philippine Islands on January 30, 1945. Fred Jr. \nreturned to my hometown of Aberdeen where he lived until several years \nago. The 5 other brothers are all alive today.\n  I should add that an 8th Villhauer brother, Paul, was too young to \nserve in World War II. But he joined the Army shortly after the war and \neventually served during the Korean War. Paul Villhauer has also passed \naway.\n  Service to the United States seemed to run in the family for the \nVillhauers. The grandparents of the 8 brothers would have over 20 of \ntheir descendants serve in World War II, including 3 at Pearl Harbor. \nIn all, more than 60 members of this family would join the armed forces \nof the United States of America. Six generations later, this segment of \nthe Villhauer family boasts more than 1,000 descendants. This \ninformation was graciously provided by Emil Vilhauer, a former resident \nof South Dakota now residing in Wisconsin.\n  As Veterans' Day draws near, let us remember all who have served this \nnation, and especially those who were called to make the ultimate \nsacrifice to preserve our freedom. But this year in particular, I hope \nmy colleagues and all the citizens of our great nation will join me in \nremembering one very special family that knows the true meaning of love \nof country: the family of Fred and Catherine Villhauer of Hosmer, South \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11959-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11959-S11960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ENCRYPTION\n\n  Mr. ASHCROFT.

Mr. President, today the Senate is sending two very \ndistinguished and qualified new Commissioners to the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission. I am pleased that my good friend Curtis L. \nHebert, Jr. of Pascagoula, MS, is one of them.\n  Curt has served the State of Mississippi as a member of the Public \nService Commission for several years. During that time, he has \ndemonstrated the ability to balance the diverse utility interests in \nour State. This is no easy task. Mississippi is the home to both public \nand private power companies, PUHCA's and providers of all sizes. Curt \nhas proven that he has the skills necessary to address the needs of \neach of these entities, while keeping the best interest of the consumer \nin mind.\n  As a former member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I certainly appreciate the high standard that FERC nominees \nare held to during committee consideration. Throughout the nomination \nprocess, Curt has demonstrated that he has not only the knowledge, but \nthe determination and skills to get the job done. He has been a \nresponsible and able steward of the utility industry in Mississippi. I \nexpect that he will serve the FERC and our Nation with the same \nenthusiasm and foresight.\n  We all must recognize that electric utility deregulation is on the \nhorizon. How and when a new system will be created remains to be seen. \nWhat is certain, however, is that the FERC will be instrumental in \nguiding Congress toward competition in the utility industry. I am \nconfident that Curt has the experience and insight necessary to help us \nreach the right balance of interests. Most importantly, Curt \nunderstands what deregulation means on the State level.\n  There is no industry as complex as the utility world--and none that \nimpacts the lives of Americans more directly every day. The challenge \nahead are great and must be tackled head on. There is no denying that \nthe FERC Commissioners have their work cut out for them.\n\n[[Page S11961]]\n\n  Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has unanimously confirmed \nCurt Hebert as a member of the FERC, ensuring that the future of the \nelectric utility industry is in good hands. I congratulate him on this \naccomplishment and wish him the best of luck in the future.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Jerry Friedman\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I commend the majority leader for deciding \nto take up the nomination of Jerry Friedman to serve as a judge for the \nEastern District of Virginia. Judge Friedman's nomination was received \nby the Judiciary Committee on June 26, 1997. He appeared before us \nduring a nomination hearing on October 28 and was reported favorably \nout of the committee on November 6.\n  From June 1985 to January 1991, Judge Friedman sat on the bench of \nthe Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court in Virginia Beach, \nVA. Since 1991, he has served as a judge for the Virginia Beach Circuit \nCourt. The American Bar Association gave Judge Friedman a unanimous \n``well-qualified'' evaluation--its highest rating.\n  I would like to congratulate both Judge Friedman and his family. I \nlook forward to his service on the U.S. District Court.\n\n\n                       nomination of norman moon\n\n  I am delighted that the majority leader has taken up the nomination \nof Norman Moon to serve as a U.S. District Court judge for the Western \nDistrict of Virginia. Judge Moon has been sitting on the bench of \nVirginia State courts since 1974. He is currently serving as the chief \njudge for the Virginia State Appellate Court--a position which he has \nheld since May 1, 1993.\n  Judge Moon has been a member of several legal and judicial-related \norganizations, including the National Institute of Trial Advocacy, the \nState-Federal Judicial Council for Virginia, and the National Council \nof Chief Judges.\n  We received Judge Moon's nomination on October 8, 1997. He appeared \nbefore the Judiciary Committee during a hearing on October 28 and he \nwas reported favorably out of the Committee on November 6.\n  I congratulate Judge Moon and his family on his accomplishment and I \nlook forward to his service as a U.S. District Court judge.\n  I would like to note that the nomination process experienced by Judge \nMoon has been the exception, not the rule, for this year. I hope that \nmore judicial nominees will enjoy a similar experience in the future.\n\n\n                      Nomination of Stanley Marcus\n\n  I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the \nnomination of Stanley Marcus to serve as a judge for the Eleventh \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Judge Marcus is a graduate of Queens College \nof the City University of New York and the Harvard Law School.\n  Since 1985, Judge Marcus has served as a Federal district court judge \nfor the Southern District of Florida. Prior to his Federal judgeship, \nJudge Marcus was employed as a special attorney, deputy chief and chief \nfor the organized crime and racketeering section of the U.S. Department \nof Justice Detroit strike force.\n  The committee received Judge Marcus' nomination on September 25, \n1997. He appeared before us during a nominations hearing on October 28 \nand was reported favorably out of the Judiciary Committee on November \n6.\n  I congratulate Judge Marcus and his family, and look forward to his \nservice on the U.S. Court of Appeals. Additionally, I would like to \ncommend my fellow committee members on the expediency of this \nnomination. If all judicial nominations were advanced as efficiently as \nMr. Marcus', the vacancy crisis facing the Federal judiciary would be \neasily solved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S11960-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11961]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A bill to establish a commission to assist in commemoration \nof the centennial of powered flight and the achievements of the Wright \nbrothers; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               the centennial of flight commemorative act\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Madam President, I have a bill, S. 1397, at the desk. Now, \nSenators DeWine, Faircloth, Glenn, and I are introducing this \nlegislation, and we are naming it the Centennial of Flight \nCommemorative Act. As I indicated, the bill number is S. 1397.\n  This significant legislation will establish a commission to assist \nthe numerous events that will lead up to and include the celebration of \nthe 100th anniversary of powered flight, a feat in all the history \nbooks, accomplished in my State of North Carolina by the geniuses, two \nbrothers, Orville and Wilbur Wright, Ohio brothers who were born and \nraised in Dayton where they operated a bicycle shop.\n  I don't know whether you have been to Kitty Hawk, particularly in the \nmiddle of December, but it is not a comfortable place to be. Wilbur and \nOrville came to the Outer Banks of North Carolina to conduct their \nexperiments. The first powered flight occurred at Kitty Hawk, NC, on \nDecember 17, 1903. In fact, the Wright brothers engaged in four flights \nthat day, and with their effort they changed the concept of travel \nforever.\n  About noon on that cold and windy December day, at Kitty Hawk, NC, \nthe aviation age, the air age, began.\n  So, Madam President, the Wright brothers were indisputably the first \npioneers of powered flight, and they became national heroes, \njustifiably etched in history.\n  As for our bill, S. 1397, the able Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, and \nthe able Senator from Ohio, Mr. Glenn, did excellent work in drafting \nthis legislation.\n  Senator Glenn, I am obliged to mention, and I am glad to do so, is a \nman of history himself in terms of powered flight. He was the first \nAmerican, as all of us know, to orbit the Earth. When he walks up and \ndown the corridors, I see mamas and daddies pointing to him saying, \n``That's Senator Glenn.'' Senator Glenn and six other pioneers, the \nMercury astronauts, got America's space program off the ground.\n  Madam President, S. 1397--let me say the title again so it will \nregister--the Centennial of Flight Commemorative Act--proposes the \nestablishment of a commission of 21 individuals to plan for and assist \nin events leading up to and including the commemoration of the 100th \nanniversary of the Wright brothers' flights at Kitty Hawk. The \ncommission will be composed of the Secretary of the Interior, the \nDirector of the National Air and Space Museum, the Secretary of \nDefense, the Secretary of Transportation, the NASA Administrator, and \neach of these officials can name a designee. Then there will be two \nrepresentatives each from the States of North Carolina and Ohio and 12 \nother private citizens.\n  Of these 12 private citizens, the President of the United States will \nappoint two from a list recommended by the Senate majority leader in \nconsultation with the Senate minority leader, and two from a list \nrecommended by the Speaker of the House in consultation with the House \nminority leader. The remaining eight will be chosen based on \nqualifications and/or experience in the fields of history, aerospace, \nscience, industry, or other professions that will enhance the work of \nthe commission.\n  The commission will represent the United States and take a leadership \nrole with other nations in recognizing the achievement of the Wright \nbrothers and the importance of aviation history.\n  The commission's activities will be closely coordinated with the \nFirst Flight Centennial Commission and the First Flight Centennial \nFoundation of North Carolina and the 2003 Committee of the State of \nOhio. The commission is allowed to retain an executive director and \nstaff that may be required in order to carry out its functions.\n  S. 1397 authorizes appropriations of $250,000 for each of the fiscal \nyears 1998 to 2004 to fund the work of the commission.\n  Additionally, the commission may accept monetary contributions and \nother in kind contributions, volunteer\n\n[[Page S11965]]\n\nservices and the like. In order to further defray the expenses of the \ncommission, the legislation gives it exclusive right to names, logos, \nemblems, seals, and marks, which may be licensed on which proceeds from \nroyalties will be used to offset the operating costs of the commission.\n  S. 1397 requires that annual audits of the commission be conducted by \nthe Inspector General of the General Services Administration to ensure \nits financial integrity.\n  The commission shall be terminated no later than 60 days after the \nsubmission of the final audit report.\n  Senators may ask why establish a Federal commission to commemorate \nthis event? The Wright brothers' triumph at Kitty Hawk on that bone-\nchilling day of December 17, 1903 has to rank as one of mankind's \ngreatest achievement. The world has not been the same since.\n  As the development of the airplane progressed so did its uses in \nwarfare and civilian aviation. Its development spawned generations of \naviation trailblazers. Names like Eddie Rickenbacker, Billy Mitchell, \nCharles Lindbergh, Jimmy Doolittle, Chuck Yeager, and the Mercury, \nGemini, Apollo, and space shuttle astronauts became household words.\n  What is even more astonishing is that 66 years later, Neil Armstrong \nof Ohio became the first man to set foot on the moon. That would not \nhave been possible without the Wright brothers.\n  Because of the Wright brothers you can get on a jet aircraft at \nDulles Airport and be in London in six or seven hours, far less if you \nare flying the Concorde. You can fly from New York to Tokyo in 14 \nhours. On the Concorde, you can travel from New York to London in 3 \nhours and 50 minutes.\n  We are seeing daily developments in aviation, faster planes, new \nspace technologies, all because of the genius of Wilbur and Orville \nWright.\n  I hope the Senate will swiftly approve this legislation.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I thank my \ndistinguished colleague from North Carolina.\n  I am delighted to join him, as well as Senator Faircloth and Senator \nGlenn, in introducing a bill to create the Centennial of Flight \nCommission.\n  In the year 2003, the United States and, indeed, the world will \ncelebrate a truly breathtaking anniversary. That date will mark exactly \n100 years of the adventure of human flight. For those of us who are \nfrom the State of Ohio, it is an especially important anniversary as \nSenator Helms has so ably described--first and foremost because the \nWright brothers, the very first pioneers of powered flight, were from \nDayton, OH. It was in Dayton, OH, that they grew up. It was in Dayton, \nOH, that they had a print shop. It was in Dayton, OH, that they had the \nbicycle shop that was referred to a moment ago by Senator Helms.\n  It was at Huffman Prairie, in Montgomery County, actually what is now \nenclosed in Wright Patterson Air Force Base, technically in Greene \nCounty, that the Wright brothers learned to fly. So, those of us from \nOhio are very proud of the Wright brothers, as this whole country is.\n  We are also proud in Ohio that ever since the time of the Wright \nbrothers, Ohio has continued to build a proud aviation history. From \nthe Wright brothers to World War I flying ace David Ingalls, to John \nGlenn who just walked on to the floor of the Senate, the first man, the \nfirst American to orbit the Earth, to Neil Armstrong, the first man to \nwalk on the Moon, to the incredible research being done right now at \nNASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland, OH, has continually been a \npart of the great epic of aviation.\n  This is, indeed, cause for celebration, and that is what this bill is \nall about. It would create a commission to coordinate the centennial of \nflight celebration in the year 2003. The commission will be composed of \n21 members: the Secretaries of the Interior, Transportation, and \nDefense; the Director of the National Air and Space Museum; the \nAdministrator of NASA; two people from North Carolina; the president \nand chairman of the First Flight Centennial Commission; and two people \nfrom the State of Ohio, the Governor and the chairman of the 2003 \nCommittee, and 12 additional Presidential appointees.\n  Madam President, this commission will help the United States take a \nleadership role in planning international celebrations of the \ncentennial of flight, promoting participation and sponsorship by the \naerospace industry, the commercial aviation industry, educational \ninstitutions, and State and local governments.\n  The commission is going to distribute a calendar, a register of \nnational and international programs and projects concerning the flight \ncentennial.\n  What I hope most of all is that these celebrations will recognize \nthat the history of flight is not just the story about machines or \nabout the triumph of technology. It is rather a story about people. It \nis a story of how human creativity overcame one of the most fundamental \nbarriers that humans ever faced.\n  For hundreds of thousands of years, human beings could not fly, but \nin this century, thanks to the freedom and spirit of creativity in this \ncountry, the human race broke the bonds of Earth. So, from Dayton to \nKitty Hawk and beyond the limits of our solar system, this is a story \nto truly celebrate.\n  Madam President, I see my distinguished senior Senator from the State \nof Ohio, the honorable John Glenn, is on the floor. I yield to Senator \nGlenn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. GLENN. Thank you, Madam President. I thank my distinguished \ncolleague.\n  I rise as a cosponsor of this legislation to establish a national \nCommission on the Centennial of Flight. We have been very proud through \nthe years to have worked with the people of Dayton, OH, in an effort to \nrecognize the very exceptional contribution of the two brothers who ran \nthe bicycle shop and dreamed of flight. They watched the birds and \ndreamed of flight, not knowing whether it would ever be possible.\n  In 1992, it was my privilege to sponsor the legislation that \nestablished the Dayton Aviation Heritage National Historical Park which \ncommemorates the extraordinary lives of Wilbur Wright, Orville Wright, \nand Paul Lawrence Dunbar, a black man, a poet, one of the finest poets, \nwho was a close friend of the Wright brothers.\n  That park and the memorial in North Carolina recall that on December \n17, 1903, Orville Wright flew 120 feet in 12 seconds. Can we imagine \nthat, 120 feet in 12 seconds? But it was under power. It was the \nairplane that is over in the Smithsonian now. It was under powered \nflight with an engine and propeller. It was the first sustained flight \nin a power-driven, heavier-than-air machine.\n  There were three other flights that day. We don't often hear about \nthose. There were three other flights that day, and Wilbur Wright set a \nnew world record flying on one of those flights 352 feet in 59 seconds. \nIt was more than the length of a football field.\n  Very little attention was paid at that time. People were very \ndoubtful. Octave Chanute reported the achievement in Popular Science \nMonthly in March 1904. But the first--I think this is very \ninteresting--the first eyewitness report about those flights appeared \nin a publication called Gleanings in Bee Culture, and that was in \nJanuary 1905. That was the first real eyewitness report of Orville and \nWilbur Wright's flights.\n  The work had begun in 1899 with a serious study of everything the \nWrights could find on aeronautics. In 1900, to test their glider, they \nselected Kitty Hawk on the word of the weather bureau because of the \nsteadiness of the winds and direction of the winds at that time. The \ntest glider in 1900 and 1901 failed to achieve the lifting power that \nthey thought they needed and anticipated.\n  They went back to Dayton and built a 6-foot wind tunnel to conduct \nexperiments with over 200 different wing models. They developed the \nfirst reliable tables on the effects of air pressure on curved \nsurfaces, the principles that we use today and that you see on every \nairplane, whether it is a general aviation small light airplane or a \ngiant 747 or whether it is the Concorde flying at supersonic speed \nacross the Atlantic Ocean.\n  They developed these 200 different wing models and experimented with \nthem. They developed the first reliable tables on the effects of air \npressure on curved surfaces.\n\n[[Page S11966]]\n\n  In 1902, they conducted over almost 1,000 tests with a more promising \nglider. In 1903, the Wright brothers had completed the construction of \na larger plane powered by their own lightweight gas-powered engine.\n  Arriving in Kitty Hawk in September, storms and mechanical \ndifficulties delayed trials until December. On the 17th, four men and a \nboy witnessed the very first flight, and a memorable photograph, \nfortunately, was captured. Four men and a boy witnessed that first \nflight.\n  Back home in Dayton in 1904 and 1905, the Wright brothers continued \ntesting their invention at Huffman Prairie, which is the area adjacent \nto what is today Wright Patterson Air Force Base where they first \nachieved maneuverable flight.\n  In 1908, Wilbur and Orville signed a contract with the War Department \nfor the first military airplane. In September, Orville circled the \nparade ground at an altitude of 120 feet just across the Potomac River \nfrom us today, over at Fort Meyer in Virginia.\n  When most people these days think of the Wright brothers, we tend to \nthink of them as having lived a long, long time ago. We tend to think \nof the Wright brothers as being part of ancient history. We also think \nof their airplane, the Wright Flyer III, as being an incredibly \nprimitive machine, at least by today's standards. And it was a \nprimitive machine. There were no fancy guidance systems or high-tech \ncontrols.\n  By swiveling their hips from one side to the other, Orville and \nWilbur could steer the airplane. To this day, when young people come \nin, when school groups come to Washington and visit my office and they \nsay they are going over to the Air and Space Museum, I always tell them \nto get up on the gallery level and look down on the Wright brothers' \nairplane and see how they controlled flight, because the person flying \nlay on the lower wing and had a wooden yoke around his hips. That \nwooden yoke slid back and forth and there was a wire that went to the \ntrailing edge of the upper wing, and they would slide in the direction \nthey wanted to go, slide their hips over, pull that wire and literally \nwarp the trailing edge of the wing down and made more lift on the wing \non that side and the airplane would turn in the direction their hips \nwere slid toward.\n  I am glad they developed later on in aviation a better means of \ncontrol. We can imagine a 747 pilot today making an approach swiveling \nhis hips back and forth. But that was the way the Wright brothers \ncontrolled those very early flights.\n  The first flight at Kitty Hawk and Huffman Prairie seemed so far \nremoved from what we did later on, from my own experience in orbital \nflight in 1962, or from the first lunar landing, or from living aboard \nthe orbiting space station for weeks on end, as Shannon Lucid did. She \nwas up there for 188 days. She will be honored at the Smithsonian this \nevening, as a matter of fact. Yet, all this occurred within a lifetime.\n\n  I know we kid Senator Thurmond around here quite a lot about his age, \nbut Senator Thurmond was born December 5, 1902. The Wright brothers did \nnot fly until a year later, on December 7, 1903. So we have in this \nbody right now a man whose lifetime spans all of manned flight, powered \nflight, from that first day at Kitty Hawk into space. Strom Thurmond \nhas witnessed the complete history of flight. And we marvel at just how \nfar we have come in an incredibly short period of time. We have \nliterally gone from the Wright brothers to the Moon and beyond in a \nsingle lifetime.\n  That is amazing. In that sense, I think it is fair to say that \nOrville and Wilbur Wright were our first astronauts, really, because \nthey were the first who really did rise off the Earth's surface in a \nsustained way and make flight that then advanced to higher and higher \naltitudes until we are above the Earth's atmosphere now with different \nkinds of machines; though I think in some ways we could say that they \nwere the first two who, as the poem goes, ``slipped the surly bonds of \nEarth''--slipped the surly bonds of Earth and ventured into the air \nunder the power of a motor.\n  Everything since then has just been going higher and going faster. I \nalso think it is fair to say the Wright brothers personified something \nthat is behind every single leap or advancement in science or human \nknowledge since the beginning of time. The one characteristic they \nhad--we could lump it all together and say that is something that is in \nthe heart of all human progress--is curiosity and an innate curiosity \nabout how we can do things differently or whether we can explore and \nfind new shores or whether we can do experiments and do research in new \nareas.\n  Whether you look at the voyage of Christopher Columbus, who brought \nEuropeans to the shore of North America, whether you look at the \nexperiments of Alexander Fleming--you know what Alexander Fleming was \ncurious about? It was plain old green mold on bread. He did not know \nwhy the patterns formed around the mold the way they did. The green \nmold, it was a particular pattern. He was curious about that.\n  You know what that led to? His curiosity led to the discovery of \npenicillin and the development of modern antibiotics. That curiosity \nabout green mold on bread has led to increased life expectancy of \npeople all around this Earth. We have gone up in life expectancy more \nin the last 100 years than in the previous 2,000 years, I read in a \nmagazine just a short time ago. So the discovery of penicillin and \nAlexander Fleming's curiosity about green bread mold that led to that, \nhas really revolutionized this Earth.\n  Or we go ahead with the unexpected circumstance in a small electronic \nswitching device that led to the development of the first transistor \nand ultimately to today's incredibly sophisticated computer systems.\n  It is clear to me that curiosity isn't what killed the cat. It is \nalso the goose that laid the golden egg for all of humankind. That is \ngoing to be true in the future as well as the past. In field after \nfield, in discipline after discipline, in industry after industry, it \nis curiosity, that insatiable, relentlessly questioning spirit that \nkeeps asking ``why'' that has moved our species ahead.\n  The irony, of course, is any time someone or a group such as the \nWright brothers, or a group of people undertake an exploration or \nundertake to demonstrate a new idea, whether in a laboratory, a \nspaceship, a bicycle shop or on a production line, there are many who \nquestion the wisdom of it all. Those naysayers who wanted to know when \ntheir bike would be fixed with the Wright brothers believed that if we \nwere to fly God would have given us feathers, they said.\n  So there was a joke about the Wright brothers at that time. ``If God \nwanted us to fly, why don't we have feathers?\" Well, they fortunately \nlaughed along with everybody else, but at the same time went ahead with \ntheir work. They were not deterred. But if there is one thing we know \nfor sure about research or any kind of exploration of the unknown, it \nis that it is impossible to know what we will see at the end or what it \nmay lead to.\n  I believe that today, as perhaps never before, we cannot afford to \nlose that kind of curiosity and questing spirit that the Wright \nbrothers had. With it, we can continue to learn new things, first, for \nthis Nation, putting them to practical application, staying ahead of \nglobal competition. That has been the story of this country's \nadvancement. Without it, we will quickly become yesterday's leader, \nyesterday's leader, not tomorrow's leader but yesterday's leader, \nhopelessly trying to hold back the hands of the clock and to hold on to \na past glory that can never be just retained or recaptured.\n  So the spirit of the Wright brothers is needed as much today as \nbefore their very first flight. That is why today I am pleased to join \nwith my colleagues--my colleague from Ohio, my colleagues from North \nCarolina--in introducing this legislation to establish a national \ncommission to assist in the commemoration of the centennial of powered \nflight that will occur in 2003 and the achievements of the Wright \nbrothers. Those who worked to build our national parks and memorials to \nthe Wright brothers in Ohio and North Carolina where flight was born \nand first achieved will now work together to recall and remember the \nspirit of flight to be commemorated as we approach the centennial of \nflight in 2003.\n  The spirit represented by the Wright brothers was captured in their \nown day by their good friend, Paul Lawrence\n\n[[Page S11967]]\n\nDunbar, who captured in the prophetic verse which he penned the \ntriumphs that are remembered at the Dayton Aviation Heritage National \nHistorical Park. One of his notations was:\n\n     What dreams we have\n     and how they fly\n     like rosy clouds\n     across the sky;\n     of wealth, of fame\n     of sure success . . .\n\n  That is certainly what curiosity has brought us and what the Wright \nbrothers brought us.\n  Think of all that has occurred since that first flight at Kitty Hawk \nin 1903. Think of aviation today and all it entails and the giant \nindustry. It has revised all the world's transportation, has revised \nour military, our security. All of that stemmed from that first flight \nin 1903.\n  So we are happy to put in this legislation today. We hope that it is \nsupported by all here, not just those from Ohio and North Carolina, \nbecause what started there in 1903 is something that affects everyone. \nIt affects every State and every nation around the globe, even these \ndays. And we look forward to this commission doing a great job in \nassisting in the commemoration of the centennial of powered flight and \nthe achievements of the Wright brothers.\n  Mr. FAIRCLOTH. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be an original \ncosponsor of legislation being introduced by Senator Helms--the two \nSenators from Ohio--that would establish a National Commission to \noversee the 100th anniversary of the first flight.\n  Mr. President, on a cold, windy December morning in 1903, in the \nOuter Banks of North Carolina, the Wright brothers changed the history \nof the world. Orville Wright flew for just 12 seconds--but it was the \nfirst manned flight.\n  Today, many people take for granted what was accomplished by the \nWright brothers that day, but at the time it was a historic \nachievement. Man had been thinking of flight for thousand of years--and \nyet the Wright brothers, here in the United States, were the first to \ndo it.\n  The development of flight grew rapidly. A little over a decade later, \nairplanes were used in the battles of World War I. Two decades after \nthe 12-second first flight--Charles Lindbergh flew over the Atlantic.\n  And of course, in 1962, in just a half century after the first 12-\nsecond flight, our distinguished colleague John Glenn was the first man \nto fly around the world in space. Seven years after that, we landed a \nman on the Moon.\n  It is hard to believe that all of this has taken place in the span of \nless than 100 years.\n  This is why the centennial anniversary of first flight is so \nsignificant to us, the sponsors of this legislation.\n  The Commission will coordinate the plans for the celebration. The \nWright brothers were from Ohio, of course, where they ran a bicycle \nshop. The State of North Carolina's license plates bear the slogan \n``First in Flight''--so we are especially proud of this achievement in \nmy State. To these two States, the celebration is important.\n  But much more than that, I think the anniversary should be used to \ninspire students to learn more about the history of flight. Hopefully, \nit will remind people that this is a great nation inventors--and that \nAmerican ingenuity has made us the greatest country in the history of \nthe world. Finally, it should remind our citizens that America is a \nland of opportunity and freedom--where anyone's imagination can change \nthe world. This is an entrepreneurial spirit that we must keep alive.\n  I want to thank Senator Helms and Senators Glenn and DeWine for \njoining together today to introduce this legislation. I hope that the \nSenate will take it up soon.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Enzi, and Mr. Hagel):\n  S. 1398. A bill to extend certain contracts between the Bureau of \nReclamation and irrigation water contractors in Wyoming and Nebraska \nthat receive water from Glendo Reservoir; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n\n\n         THE IRRIGATION PROJECT CONTRACT EXTENSION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Irrigation \nProject Contract Extension Act of 1997. I am pleased to be joined in \nthis endeavor by Senators Enzi, Kerrey, and Hagel.\n  This legislation would extend, for a period of 3 years, certain water \ncontracts between the Bureau of Reclamation and irrigators in Wyoming \nand Nebraska that receive water from Glendo Reservoir. All contracts \nare subject to renewal on December 31, 1998. Extending these contracts \nis considered a major Federal action and, therefore, subject to review \nof the National Environmental Policy Act [NEPA] and the Endangered \nSpecies Act [ESA]. Without a short-term continuation agreement, the \nirrigators would be responsible for the costs of the analysis and other \nenvironmental documentation.\n  Currently, the States of Wyoming, Nebraska, and Colorado--and the \nDepartment of the Interior--are in the process of implementing a \ncomprehensive ``Cooperative Agreement for Platte River Research and \nOther Efforts relating to Endangered Species Habitats along the Central \nPlatte River, Nebraska.'' The term of this initiative is for 3 years, \nwith an allowable 6-month extension. Upon completion of the cooperative \nagreement, efforts to enact the Platte River Recovery Implementation \nProgram can begin. This basin wide, three-State plan will help to \nrecover the endangered whooping crane, piping plover, and least stern, \nand improve critical habitats in the Central Platte River Basin.\n  I believe it is important for Congress to act on this measure and \nextend these contracts for 3 years, or until the cooperative agreement \nis completed. In that time, the needed NEPA and ESA reviews will be \nfulfilled--clearing the way for the program to be initiated. It is \nimportant to remember that the program cannot be implemented until the \nenvironmental studies are completed and the parties have agreed to the \nresults.\n  Mr. President, this bill does not avoid environmental evaluation. It \nmerely provides some relief to the water users, while allowing the NEPA \nand ESA documentation to take place through the cooperative agreement \nprocess. It is my understanding that once this agreement has expired, \nand if the Department of the Interior and the three States decide not \nto pursue the program, the contract renewal process would proceed as a \nseparate Federal action at that time.\n  This is good and fair legislation. It will benefit the environment \nand the water users. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe Senate and House to secure its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 1399. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Army to carry out a \nproject to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat of the \nMissouri River and the middle Mississippi River; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n\n\n               THE FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nenhance, preserve and protect habitat for fish and wildlife on the \nMissouri and Mississippi Rivers. This new 5-year $50 million \nauthorization is a win-win approach that will implement and expand the \nuse of new and innovative measures developed by the Corps of Engineers \nto improve habitat conservation without impacting adversely private \nproperty and other water-related needs of the rivers including \nnavigation, flood control and water supply.\n  As I have always maintained, fish and wildlife conservation and \ncommercial activity are not mutually exclusive. Indeed, we cannot \nafford to abandon either river commerce or the species that live in and \non the river. This new approach is a win for man, for nature and for \nthe river.\n  This legislation is supported by Missouri Farm Bureau, MARC2000, \nAmerican Rivers, the Missouri Soybean Association, the Missouri \nCorngrowers Association, and Farmland Industries. While these groups \nhave not always agreed on river policy, that should not preclude us \nfrom seeking common ground and working together to address the \nquestions of resource management and I am delighted that we can all \ncome together in support of this commonsense approach.\n  Without specific authorization and only scarce dollars, the St. Louis \nCorps of Engineers has been developing and\n\n[[Page S11968]]\n\ntesting ways in which navigation structures used to guide the river and \nmaintain the channel may be modified to meet environmental as well as \nnavigation goals. These innovations have proven successful earning wide \nacclaim including a Presidential Design Award and Federal Design \nAchievement Award.\n  This legislation seeks to put these successful innovations to work on \nthe Missouri River and expand their use on the middle Mississippi by \nproviding a specific authorization and a dedicated and substantial \nsource of funds. In other words, we are giving the corps the tools they \nneed to put their ideas to work to improve the rivers to benefit fish \nand wildlife.\n  The legislation authorizes $10 million per year to protect, create \nand enhance side channels, island habitat, sand bars, and other \nriverine habitat. For example, by notching rock dikes that run \nperpendicular to the shoreline, sandbars develop between the dikes \nwhich has been provided nesting habitat for the endangered least tern \nand valuable spawning ground for the endangered pallid sturgeon. The \nMissouri Department of Conservation has run tests validating an \nincrease in diversity and numbers of microinvertebrates surrounding the \nnotched dikes.\n  Chevron dikes have been developed to improve river habitat and to \ncreate beneficial uses of dredge material. These structures are placed \nin the shallow side of the river channel pointing upstream which \nimproves the river channel while serving as small islands. These \nislands encourage the development of all four primary river ecosystem \nhabitats and additionally, various micro-organisms cling to the \nunderwater rock structures, providing a food source for fish.\n  Changing the gradation of rock revetments, used to stabilize eroding \nriverbanks, has proved to provide greater bank stability and precluded \nthe need to remove bank vegetation so that, for the first time, trees \nand rock revetment could coexist providing greater habitat diversity.\n  The draft legislation authorizes $10 million per year over 5 years to \ndevelop and implement a plan including the following activities: \nModification and improvement of navigation training structures to \nprotect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat; creation of side \nchannels to protect and enhance fish and wildlife habitat; restoration \nand creation of island fish and wildlife habitat; creation of riverine \nfish and wildlife habitat; establishment of criteria to prioritize \nbased on cost-effectiveness and likelihood of success; and physical and \nbiological monitoring for evaluating the success of the project.\n  The draft provides that the project be coordinated with other related \nFederal and State activities and that there be public participation in \nthe development and implementation of the project. It requires a 25-\npercent non-Federal cost share and limits the Federal cost of any \nsingle project to $5 million. Finally, the draft legislation confers no \nnew regulatory authority and requires compliance with the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act.\n  The legislation is designed to work between the banks of the river \nand forbids expressly any adverse impacts on private lands and water-\nrelated activities including flood control, navigation, and water \nsupply. Additionally, it is designed to compliment other existing \nprograms such as the Missouri River Mitigation project and the \nEnvironmental Management Program on the Mississippi River.\n  I intend to work with the administration and with other Senators and \ninterested groups to build the broad support necessary to enact this \nlegislation in an omnibus Water Resources Development Act the Senate is \nexpected to consider in 1998.\n  Mr. President, the problems experienced in the Midwest and elsewhere \nwith railroad bottlenecks highlight the need for diverse transportation \noptions. As the fall harvest proceeds, there are reports of grain being \npiled on the ground in neighboring Kansas and Nebraska. Notwithstanding \nthat I must continue working on behalf of Missouri to preserve river \nnavigation as a transportation option, our joint efforts to pursue this \nnew legislation is a strong indicator that we may be experiencing an \nepisode of domestic detente on river policy between groups that have \npursued differing approaches in the past. This legislation offers a \nsignificant boost for our need to make the various river uses \ncompatible and an important step toward unifying the river's \nstakeholders behind a realistic approach for the future.\n  I thank and congratulate the various groups who have come together \nbehind this legislation and look forward to enacting this consensus \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BUMPERS (for himself and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 1401. A bill to provide for the transition to competition around \nelectric energy suppliers for the benefit and protection of consumers, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n\n\n           the transition to electric competition act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I rise to day to introduce the Transition \nto Electric Competition Act of 1997 along with my colleague from the \nState of Washington, Senator Gorton. This bill provides for the \ntransition toward deregulation and competition in the electric utility \nindustry.\n  While few people find a discussion of the electric utility industry \nand the many laws and regulations governing the industry exciting, the \nfact is that electricity is an extremely important commodity which \naffects everyone on a daily basis. Any event that increases or reduces \nelectric rates can impact: First, the lives of the poor and those on \nfixed incomes that depend on electricity to heat their homes in the \nwinter and cool them in the summer; second, the price of goods we buy \nevery day; as well as third, the competitiveness of our factories. In \naddition, decisions made by electric generators often have a direct \neffect on our environment as well as our energy security.\n  It is not at all inconsequential that the electric utility industry, \nwhich has remained relatively static for the last 60 years, is \nundergoing a fundamental change. Instead of the traditional vertically \nintegrated local utility, which generates power at its own plants, \ntransmits that power over its own lines and sells that power to all \nconsumers in a particular area, consumers in some States are starting \nto be bombarded with all sorts of offers from companies competing to \nbecome their power supplier, and other entrepreneurs will be seeking to \nbuy large blocks of power to serve certain kinds of consumers. \nNaturally, these changes are bound to create considerable apprehension \namong both utilities and consumers.\n  Mr. President, in January I introduced S. 237, the Electric Consumers \nProtection Act, because I believed that retail electric competition was \ninevitable and Federal legislation was necessary to ensure that certain \nconsumers were not disadvantaged in the process. Several States were \nproceeding to introduce competition in their jurisdictions and a number \nof others were examining the matter. Since that time I have become even \nmore convinced that competition is on the horizon. Eleven States have \nnow enacted legislation or issued regulations requiring retail \ncompetition by a time certain. Almost every other State currently has \nthe matter under review.\n  Some argue that there is no need for the Federal Government to \nintervene; that the States are doing just fine on their own and they \nshould decide when and how to proceed with retail electric competition. \nMr. President, I couldn't disagree more.\n  A State-by-State approach will likely produce a lot of unintended \nconsequences which will limit the benefits associated with retail \ncompetition and could disadvantage certain consumers. Electric \ngeneration markets are becoming increasingly regional and even multi-\nregional. What happens in one State can have direct and indirect \nimpacts on consumers and utilities located in another State. Utilities \noperating in more than one State can be subjected to conflicting \nregulatory regimes which could impact the way they operate their \nsystems and the electric rates paid by consumers.\n  This phenomenon is best illustrated by the multistate utility holding \ncompanies registered under the Public Utility Holding Company [PUHCA]. \nI have had a lot of experience with registered holding companies \nbecause two of them serve my home State of Arkansas. These holding \ncompanies generally plan for and operate generating facilities on a \nsystem-wide basis for the benefit of customers in the entire region\n\n[[Page S11969]]\n\nserved by the company. If restructuring proceeds on a State-by-State \nbasis, these holding companies would find themselves subjected to \ndifferent requirements which could negatively impact consumers.\n  A State-by-State approach to retail competition also present problems \nwhere utilities operate entirely within a single State. It would make \nno sense for a utility in a State that does not require retail \ncompetition, to be able to sell power at retail in an adjoining State \nthat requires retail competition, while a utility subjected to retail \ncompetition is unable to mitigate its losses by competing for customers \nin the adjoining State. Such a result both increases stranded costs and \ndistorts the generation marketplace.\n  Moreover, the States can't adequately address issues associated with \nthe use of transmission lines that provide for the transportation \nacross a number of States or the ability of a utility with significant \nmarket power to dominate electricity generation in an entire region. \nClearly these are issues that need to be resolved at the Federal level.\n  When I introduced S. 237 there weren't many calling for Federal \naction. However, interested observers are increasingly coming to the \nconclusion that Federal electric restructuring legislation is not only \nhelpful, but is necessary. Even some of the States are calling on the \nFederal Government to act.\n  The legislation we are introducing today is an updated version of S. \n237. The bill includes the following provisions: All consumers would \nhave the right to choose their power supplier by January 1, 2002. \nStates could choose an earlier date for their residents if they wish. \nUtilities would be able to recover their legitimate, prudent and \nverifiable costs that they would have been able to recover from \nratepayers if retail competition had not been implemented. Consumers \nlocated in States that currently have low cost electricity would be \nprotected from rate increases by ensuring that utilities can't use \ntheir existing assets to sell power in more lucrative markets to the \ndisadvantage of their existing customers. All utilities selling retail \npower would be required to generate a portion of that power using \nrenewable resources. All of the interstate transmission facilities \nthroughout the country would be managed by independent system operators \nto ensure that electricity flows in an efficient manner and that \nmarkets are competitive. FERC would be given greater authority to \nprotect against the use of market power by utilities to inhibit \ncompetition. Both the Public Utility Holding Company Act [PUHCA] and \nthe Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act [PURPA] would be repealed in \nconjunction with the implementation of retail electric competition.\n  In addition, Mr. President, the legislation attempts to address some \nof the issues that relate to the impact of retail electric competition \non two Federal entities--the Bonneville Power Administration [BPA] and \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority [TVA]. Senator Gorton is especially \nknowledgeable about the special problems facing BPA and I expect that \nhe will work closely with the other Members of the Senate from the \nPacific Northwest in developing a consensus approach.\n  With regard to TVA, our bill attempts to develop an approach that \nwill enable retail competition to be smoothly introduced in the \nTennessee Valley and will help TVA pay off its tremendous debt. The \nbill also requires the TVA board to prepare a study examining whether \nTVA should be privatized. I know that some observers may be concerned \nthat this could be a first step toward the privatization of the Federal \nPower Marketing Administration [PMA's]. Mr. President, there is no \nconnection whatsoever between TVA and the PMA's. The PMA's market power \ngenerated at hydroelectric facilities located at Federal dams. These \ndams perform a variety of public services and cannot be privatized. \nTVA, on the other hand, generates the bulk of its power from coal and \nnuclear plants that serve no public purposes. In addition, the Federal \nPMA's pay for themselves through power sales. TVA, on the other hand, \nhas an enormous level of privately held debt which it must find a way \nto pay off, since the Federal Government is not responsible for it.\n  Mr. President, I am especially pleased that Senator Gorton has \ndecided to join with me in the effort to enact comprehensive electric \nrestructuring legislation. He has a reputation as a very bright and \nthoughtful Member of this body and is a distinguished member of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over the \nmatter. I know that he shares my desire to move this legislation \nthrough Congress quickly next year.\n  Senator Murkowski, the chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, \nrecently indicated that he expects the committee to mark up electric \nrestructuring legislation next year.

If such elections are not made within \n     the requisite time period, the Commission shall assume the \n     responsibilities of the board as described in this section.\n       (3) The regional board shall have 18 months after the date \n     it is formed to determine, on a unanimous basis, the \n     wholesale stranded costs associated with the generating \n     facility which is the subject of the proceeding and to \n     allocate such costs among the retail electric energy provider \n     affiliates of the public utility holding company on a just \n     and reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.\n       (4) If the regional board fails to make either or both \n     determinations, as described in subsection (b)(3) in the \n     requisite time period, the Commission shall make the \n     determination or determinations that have yet to be made.\n       (5) After its level of wholesale stranded costs is \n     determined pursuant to this subsection, the wholesale \n     generating company affiliate of the holding company shall be \n     entitled to fully recover its stranded costs, over a \n     reasonable period of time, from the retail electric energy \n     provider affiliates to which it sells electric energy \n     pursuant to the procedures established by this subsection.\n       (6) A retail electric energy provider's wholesale stranded \n     cost payment obligations pursuant to this subsection shall be \n     deemed retail stranded costs for the purposes of section 105 \n     of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 107. LOST RETAIL BENEFITS.\n\n       A State may require a retail electric energy provider to \n     compensate its retail customers for lost retail benefits if, \n     after retail competition is implemented, the market value of \n     all of the provider's generating assets in the rate base \n     prior to the implementation of retail electric competition is \n     greater than the total costs of these assets that would have \n     been recoverable in retail rates but for the implementation \n     of retail electric competition. No retail electric energy \n     provider shall be required to compensate its customers in an \n     amount that exceeds the increased market value of its \n     generating assets resulting from the implementation of retail \n     electric competition.\n\n     SEC. 108. UNIVERSAL SERVICE\n\n       (a) State Universal Service Programs.--A State may \n     establish a Universal Service\n\n[[Page S11972]]\n\n     Program that ensures that all consumers have access to \n     purchase retail electric energy from at least one retail \n     electric energy supplier at a just and reasonable rate.\n       (b) Service Obligation.--(1) After January 1, 2002, each \n     retail electric energy provider located in a State that has \n     not yet established a Universal Service Program described in \n     subsection (a) shall be obligated to sell retail electric \n     energy to, or purchase retail electric energy on behalf of, \n     any of its customers in a particular geographic area in which \n     a State regulatory authority or the Commission, if the State \n     regulatory authority fails to make a determination pursuant \n     to a request by an affected person, determines that there is \n     not effective retail electric competition in such area and \n     the consumer has not affirmatively chosen a retail electric \n     energy supplier.\n       (2) The retail electric energy provider performing the \n     service described in subsection (b)(1) is entitled to a just \n     and reasonable rate from the consumer receiving such service.\n       (c) Universal Service Fund.--A State or a State regulatory \n     authority, if authorized by the State, may impose a \n     nonbypassable Universal Service Charge on all customers of \n     every retail electric energy provider in such State to fund \n     all or part of the costs of a Universal Service Program, \n     including the partial or full payment of the charges a \n     provider may recover pursuant to subsection (b)(2).\n\n     SEC. 109. PUBLIC BENEFITS.\n\n       Nothing in this Act shall prohibit a State or State \n     regulatory authority from assessing charges on retail \n     consumers of energy to fund public benefits programs such as \n     those designed to aid low-income energy consumers, promote \n     energy research and development or achieve energy efficiency \n     and conservation.\n\n     SEC. 110.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) FINDINGS.--The Congress finds that:\n       (1) The multi-purpose Federal Columbia River Power System's \n     Federal and non-Federal dams have provided immeasurable \n     benefits to the Pacific Northwest by providing flood control, \n     renewable hydroelectric power, irrigation, navigation, and \n     recreation;\n       (2) The dams provide the Northwest with a continuing source \n     of clean and renewable power but, along with over-fishing and \n     other natural and human impacts on the ecosystem, have \n     adversely affected the Columbia Basin's fish and wildlife;\n       (3) Enactment of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 established \n     competition for the wholesale supply of electricity, and \n     market forces have driven the cost of power down nationally, \n     the Northwest included, and has allowed utilities and large \n     users to buy power at rates below those offered by the \n     Bonneville Power Administration;\n       (4) Realizing the new economic forces impacting \n     electricity, the four Northwest State Governors undertook a \n     year-long review in 1996 of the regional electricity \n     system and made recommendations for the future of the \n     system;\n       (5) Among these recommendations is the separation of the \n     transmission and power marketing functions of the Bonneville \n     Power Administration, with Commission oversight of access to \n     Bonneville's transmission system, and undertaking this \n     separation in a way that does not impair Bonneville's ability \n     to meet its obligations to the U.S. Treasury, fish and \n     wildlife programs, and bondholders of the Washington Public \n     Power Supply System;\n       (6) There are ongoing efforts by Bonneville to reduce its \n     costs and require accountability of its funds, including \n     those of its funds used for salmon recovery; and\n       (7) There is a need to provide a regional process involving \n     the Federal Government, state governments, tribal \n     governments, utilities and other users of the water of the \n     Columbia and Snake River System, to balance the multiple \n     objectives of the river system.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this title are:\n       (1) To establish authority in a consolidated regional \n     governing body that will balance the multiple uses of the \n     Columbia and Snake river system, for hydroelectric \n     production, for irrigation, for recreation, for the \n     protection and enhancement of fish and wildlife populations, \n     and for flood control, with that body to be responsible and \n     accountable for spending funds for these purposes;\n       (2) To facilitate the maintenance of an open transmission \n     system in the Northwest based on Commission rules and to \n     ensure its reliability; and\n       (3) To assure that the Bonneville Power Administration \n     retains the ability to meet its unique financial obligations \n     to the U.S. Treasury, to fish and wildlife projects, to the \n     bondholders of the Washington Public Power Supply System, and \n     to remain a competitive wholesale supplier of electricity.\n\n     SEC. 502. COLUMBIA RIVER FISH AND WILDLIFE COORDINATION AND \n                   GOVERNANCE.\n\n       This section is reserved.\n\n     SEC. 503. PACIFIC NORTHWEST FEDERAL TRANSMISSION ACCESS.\n\n       The Commission's rules on nondiscriminatory open access to \n     transmission services provided by public utilities, including \n     its rules on standards of conduct, shall also apply to \n     transmission services provided by the Bonneville Power \n     Administration, except as otherwise provided by the \n     Commission by rule if it is in the public interest, or except \n     as necessitated by the requirements of section 504 or 506 of \n     this Act. Except as provided in sections 504 and 508 of this \n     Act, rates for transmission imposed by the Administrator \n     shall continue to be established and reviewed and approved in \n     accordance with the provisions of otherwise applicable \n     Federal laws.\n\n     SEC. 504. TRANSITION COST MECHANISM.\n\n       If the Bonneville Power Administration proposes a charge to \n     recover its transition costs resulting from this Act, the \n     Energy Policy Act, or the Commission's Order No. 888, a \n     transition cost recovery mechanism shall be developed and \n     adopted by the Commission within 180 days of the filing of \n     the proposal with the Commission.\n\n     SEC. 505. INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR PARTICIPATION.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Administrator of the Bonneville Power Administration may \n     participate in a regulated Independent System Operator \n     subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission pursuant to \n     section 112 of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 506. FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       Sections 503, 504 and 505 of this Act shall be interpreted \n     and implemented in a manner that does not adversely affect \n     the security of the Bonneville Power Administration's \n     Washington Public Power Supply System net-billing and other \n     third-party financing arrangements.\n\n     SEC. 507. PROHIBITION ON RETAIL SALES.\n\n       Except as provided in section 5(d) of the Northwest Power \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 839c(d)), the Administrator shall not market, \n     sell or dispose of electric power to any end use or retail \n     customers that did not have a contract for the purchase of \n     electric power with the Administrator for services to \n     specific facilities as of October 1, 1997.\n\n     SEC. 508. CLARIFICATION OF COMMISSION AUTHORITY.\n\n       Section 7(a)(2) of the Pacific Northwest Electric Power \n     Planning and Conservation Act (16 U.S.C. 839e(a)(2)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by deleting the word ``costs,'' in paragraph (B);\n       (2) by striking the period at the end of paragraph (C) and \n     inserting in lieu thereof ``, and''; and\n       (3) by adding at the end thereof the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(D) insofar as transmission rates are concerned, the \n     rates do not discriminate between transmission users or \n     classes of users in a manner that has the effect of \n     unreasonably denying transmission access under section 503 of \n     this Act.''\n\n     SEC. 509. REPEALED STATUTE.\n\n       Section 6 of the Federal Columbia River Transmission System \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 838d) is hereby repealed.\n\n                  TITLE VI--TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY\n\n     SEC. 601. COMPETITION IN SERVICE TERRITORY.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, beginning on \n     January 1, 2002, all retail and wholesale electric energy \n     suppliers shall have the right to sell retail and wholesale \n     electric energy to persons that currently purchase retail or \n     wholesale electric energy either directly from the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority or persons purchasing electric energy from \n     the Tennessee Valley Authority.\n\n     SEC. 602. ABILITY TO SELL ELECTRIC ENERGY.\n\n       (a) TVA.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority may sell wholesale electric energy \n     to any person, subject to any restrictions imposed pursuant \n     to Section 104(a) of this Act, beginning on January 1, 2002.\n       (b) Power Customers.--Notwithstanding any other provision \n     of law, persons that currently purchase wholesale electric \n     energy from the Tennessee Valley Authority may sell wholesale \n     and retail electric energy to any persons subject to any \n     restrictions imposed pursuant to section 104(a) of this Act, \n     beginning on January 1, 2002.\n\n     SEC. 603. TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS.\n\n       (a) Notice.--Beginning on January 1, 2001, the Tennessee \n     Valley Authority shall allow any person that has executed a \n     contract to purchase retail or wholesale electric energy from \n     it to terminate such contract upon one year's notice.\n       (b) Stranded Costs.--Each person holding a contract that is \n     terminated pursuant to subsection (a) shall be responsible \n     for retail or wholesale stranded costs as determined by the \n     Commission.\n\n[[Page S11975]]\n\n     SEC. 604. RATES FOR ELECTRIC ENERGY.\n\n       (a) Establishment.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Authority \n     shall establish, and periodically review and revise, rates \n     for the sale and disposition of wholesale and retail electric \n     energy and for the transmission of electric energy by the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority. Such rates shall be established \n     and, as appropriate, revised to recover, in accordance with \n     sound business principles, the costs associated with the \n     generation, acquisition, conservation, transmission, and \n     distribution of electric energy, including the payment of \n     principal and interest on the Authority's bonds over a \n     reasonable period.\n       (b) Commission Review.--Rates established under this \n     section shall become effective only upon confirmation and \n     approval by the Commission, upon a finding by the Commission \n     that such rates are sufficient to ensure repayment of the \n     Authority's bonds over a reasonable number of years after \n     first meeting the Authority's legitimate, prudent, and \n     verifiable costs.\n\n     SEC. 605. PRIVATIZATION STUDY.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Preparation of Study.--The Board of \n     Directors the Tennessee Valley Authority shall prepare a \n     study for selling its electric power program (excluding dams \n     and appurtenant works and structures) to private investors \n     and, not later than two years after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, shall submit such plan to the Congress.\n       (b) Contents of Study.--The study shall consider the \n     following--\n       (1) both the sale of the authority's electric power program \n     as a whole and the sale of some or all of its component \n     parts;\n       (2) alternative means of selling the Authority's electric \n     power program or its component parts, including a public \n     stock offering, a private placement of stock, or the sale of \n     assets; and\n       (3) the effect of any sale on--\n       (A) electric rates and competition in the regional \n     electricity market,\n       (B) the operation of the Authority's nonpower programs, and\n       (C) the repayment of the Authority's debt.\n       (c) Additional Elements.--The study shall also include--\n       (1) An estimate of the amount of revenue that the United \n     States Treasury would receive under each of the alternatives \n     considered;\n       (2) the Board's analysis of the feasibility of each of the \n     alternatives considered and its recommendation either for \n     retaining the Authority's power program under federal \n     ownership or the preferred alternative for selling it to \n     private investors; and\n       (3) the Board's recommendation of whether the Authority's \n     dams should--\n       (A) be transferred to the Department of the Army Corps of \n     Engineers and responsibility for marketing electric energy \n     produced by such dams assigned to the Southeastern Power \n     Marketing Administration, or\n       (B) continue to be controlled by, and the electric energy \n     they produce continue to be marketed by the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority.\n       (d) Further Action.--The Board of Directors shall take no \n     action to implement the sale of the Authority's power program \n     without further legislation authorizing such action.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Transition to Electric Competition Act of 1997--Section-by-Section \n                                Analysis\n\n\n                     title i--electric competition\n\n     Section 101--Mandatory Retail Access\n       All consumers (including current customers of investor-\n     owned municipal and rural cooperative electric utilities) \n     have the right to purchase retail electric energy beginning \n     on January 1, 2002.\n       All retail electric energy suppliers (entities selling \n     retail electric energy) have access to local distribution \n     facilities and all ancillary services beginning on January 1, \n     2002.\n     Section 102--Aggregation\n       A group of consumers or any entity acting on behalf of such \n     group is authorized to aggregate to purchase retail electric \n     energy for the members of the group if they live in a State \n     where retail electric competition exists.\n     Section 103--Prior Implementation\n       Nothing in the Federal Power Act shall prohibit States from \n     requiring retail electric competition prior to January 1, \n     2002.\n       A State requiring retail electric competition prior to \n     January 1, 2002 and providing utilities with the opportunity \n     to recover stranded costs is exempt from the Act's \n     requirements related to retail competition and stranded \n     costs.\n       A State may impose reciprocity requirements if it has \n     provided for retail competition to prevent utilities that \n     aren't subject to retail competition from selling power to \n     retail customers in its state.\n     Section 104--State Regulation\n       States may impose requirements on retail electric energy \n     suppliers to protect the public interest.\n       No class of potential retail electric energy suppliers can \n     be excluded from selling retail electric energy.\n       States may continue to regulate local distribution and \n     retail transmission service provided by retail electric \n     energy providers.\n     Section 105--Retail Stranded Cost Recovery\n       An investor-owned utility providing retail electric service \n     prior to the date of enactment which is seeking recovery of \n     its stranded costs must request the State regulatory \n     authority to determine the amount of its stranded costs \n     associated with the implementation of retail electric \n     competition.\n       If a State regulatory authority fails to determine the \n     amount of stranded costs within 18 months of the request, \n     FERC will determine the amount.\n       A municipal electric utility or a rural electric \n     cooperative may determine the amount of its stranded costs.\n       A utility is entitled to recover its stranded costs from \n     its customers pursuant to a nonbypassable Stranded Cost \n     Recovery Charge.\n       A rural electric cooperative or municipal joint action \n     agency that sells wholesale power to rural electric \n     cooperative or municipal distribution companies may recover \n     its stranded costs from the distribution companies.\n       No class of customers (such as a utility's residential \n     customers) can be required to pay a Stranded Cost Recovery \n     Charge in excess of its proportional responsibility for \n     utility costs prior to the implementation of retail electric \n     competition.\n       Customers served by utility companies operating in more \n     than one state either directly or through an affiliate are \n     only responsible for stranded costs arising from retail \n     electric competition in the state they reside.\n       For purposes of determining stranded cost amounts, prior \n     prudence determinations are binding.\n     Section 106--Wholesale Stranded Cost Recovery\n       FERC has sole jurisdiction to determine and provide for the \n     recovery of the wholesale stranded costs associated with \n     utilities subject to the Federal Power Act.\n       All of the states regulating utility subsidiaries of a \n     multistate utility holding company may form a regional board \n     to calculate the stranded costs of a wholesale electric \n     supplier subsidiary of the holding company that does not sell \n     any retail electric energy and to allocate such costs among \n     the utility subsidiaries of the holding company.\n       If the regional board is not formed or if the members of \n     the regional board fail to produce a consensus on either \n     determination required of the board, FERC shall perform the \n     board's responsibilities.\n       Once the wholesale subsidiary's stranded costs have been \n     determined, the subsidiary is entitled to recover such costs \n     from its affiliated utility companies in the manner allocated \n     by the board or FERC and the utility companies are entitled \n     to recover such costs from its customers.\n     Section 107--Lost Retail Benefits\n       A state may require a retail electric energy provider to \n     compensate its customers for any increase in power costs \n     resulting from the implementation of retail electric \n     competition if the market value of the provider's generating \n     assets increase and the provider sells power elsewhere due to \n     the implementation of retail electric competition.\n     Section 108--Universal Service\n       A state may establish a Universal Service Program to ensure \n     that all consumers have access to electric service at a just \n     and reasonable rate.\n       If a state has not established a Universal Service Program \n     prior to January 1, 2002, each retail electric energy \n     provider located in that state is obligated to sell power to \n     or purchase power on behalf of consumers that do not have \n     sufficient access to competing retail electric energy \n     suppliers.\n       The retail electric energy provider is entitled to just and \n     reasonable compensation for the service performed.\n       States may impose a nonbypassable Universal Service Charge \n     to help pay for the retail electric energy provider's \n     compensation.\n     Section 109--Public Benefits\n       States may impose charges on retail electric energy \n     consumers to fund public benefit programs (i.e. low-income \n     and energy efficiency).\n     Section 110--Renewable Energy\n       Beginning of 2003, all retail electric energy suppliers are \n     required to either (1) sell at least a minimum amount of \n     renewable energy as part of the total amount of energy it \n     sells or (2) purchase credits from retail electric energy \n     suppliers that sell renewable energy in excess of the minimum \n     requirements.\n       \\1/2\\ of one Renewable Energy Credit will be provided to \n     retail electric energy suppliers selling power generated from \n     a large hydroelectric facility (more than 80 MW). One \n     Renewable Energy Credit will be provided to retail electric \n     energy suppliers selling power generated at all other \n     renewable electric facilities built prior to the date of \n     enactment. Two Renewable Energy Credits will be provided to \n     retail electric energy suppliers selling power generated at \n     all other renewable electric facilities built subsequent to \n     the date of enactment.\n       Retail electric energy suppliers are required to have \n     Credits worth 5% of its generation beginning in 2003, 9% of \n     its generation beginning in 2008 and 12% of its generation \n     beginning in 2013.\n       The Bonneville Power Administration must use proceeds from \n     the sale of Credits issued to it to repay the \n     Administration's outstanding debt to the U.S. Treasury and \n     the Washington Public Power supply System Bondholders.\n     Section 111--Determination of Local Distribution Facilities\n       A State regulatory authority may apply with FERC for a \n     determination of whether a\n\n[[Page S11976]]\n\n     particular facility constitutes a local distribution \n     facility.\n       FERC will give the position of the State regulatory \n     authority maximum practicable deference.\n     Section 112--Transmission\n       Within two years of the date of enactment FERC must \n     establish transmission regions and designate an Independent \n     System Operator (ISO) to manage and operate all of the \n     transmission facilities in each region beginning on January \n     1, 2002.\n       The ISO can't be affiliated with any person owning \n     transmission facilities in the region or any retail electric \n     energy supplier selling retail electric energy in the region.\n       FERC is required to issue rules by January 1, 2001 \n     applicable to its oversight of the ISO's to promote \n     transmission reliability and efficiency and competition among \n     retail and wholesale electric energy suppliers.\n       The Federal Power Act prohibition on FERC requiring \n     transmission access for the purposes of retail wheeling is \n     repealed on January 1, 2002 or at an earlier date for a \n     particular retail wheeling request in a State that retail \n     electric competition prior to January 1, 2002.\n     Section 113--Competitive Generation Markets\n       FERC's authority over utility mergers pursuant to the \n     Federal Power Act is extended to electric utility mergers \n     with natural gas utility companies.\n       FERC review of mergers must take into account the impact of \n     a merger on competitive wholesale and retail electric \n     generation markets.\n       FERC has authority to take actions necessary to prohibit \n     retail electric energy suppliers and providers from using \n     their control of resources to inhibit retail and wholesale \n     electric competition.\n     Sectioin 114--Nuclear Decommissioning Costs\n       Utilities owning nuclear power plants prior to the date of \n     enactment are entitled to recover costs to fund \n     decommissioning of the plants from their customers pursuant \n     to a non-bypassable charge.\n     Section 115--Right to Know\n       Each retail electric energy supplier must publicly disclose \n     information on the types of fuel used to generate the \n     electricity sold by the supplier.\n     Section 116--Exemption of Alaska and Hawaii\n       Title I does not apply to any transaction occurring in \n     Alaska or Hawaii.\n\n\n               title ii--public utility holding companies\n\n     Section 201--Repeal of PUHCA\n       PUHCA is repealed one year from the date of enactment of \n     the Act.\n     Section 202--Exemption\n       Title II does not apply to federal or state agencies or \n     foreign governmental authorities not operating in the U.S.\n       FERC may exempt anyone from any of the requirements of the \n     Title if the Commission finds the particular regulation not \n     relevant to public utility company rates and the affected \n     States consent.\n       The provisions of the Title don't apply to a particular \n     holding company when retail electric competition exists in \n     the service territory of each utility subsidiary of the \n     holding company.\n     Section 203--Federal Access to Books and Records\n       Each holding company and associate company of the holding \n     company must make its books and records available to FERC.\n     Section 204--State Access to Books and Records\n       Each holding company and associate company of the holding \n     company must make its books and records available to each \n     State regulatory authority regulating a utility subsidiary of \n     the holding company.\n     Section 205--Affiliate Transactions\n       FERC, with regard to wholesale rates and States, with \n     regard to retail rates, have the authority to determine \n     whether a public utility affiliate of a holding company may \n     recover its costs associated with a non-power transaction \n     with an affiliated company if such costs arose after the date \n     of enactment.\n       State regulatory authorities have the authority to review \n     the prudence of a utility's wholesale power purchases form \n     nonaffiliated sellers.\n       State regulatory authorities have the authority to review \n     the prudence of a utility's wholesale power purchase from an \n     affiliated seller in the same holding company system unless \n     FERC has allocated the costs of the purchase among two or \n     more utility subsidiaries of the holding company prior to the \n     date of enactment and there is no subsequent reallocation.\n     Section 206--Clarification of Regulatory Authority\n       FERC, with regard to wholesale rates, and State regulatory \n     authorities, with regard to retail rates, must explicitly \n     consent, before a utility affiliate of a utility holding \n     company can recover costs in rates that are not directly \n     related to the provision of electric service to its \n     customers.\n     Section 207--Effect on Other Regulation\n       State regulatory authorities can exercise their \n     jurisdiction under otherwise applicable law to protect \n     utility consumers.\n     Section 208--Enforcement\n       FERC has the same enforcement authority under this Title as \n     it does under the Federal Power Act.\n     Section 209--Savings Provision\n       A person engaging in an activity it was legally entitled to \n     engage in on the date of enactment may continue to be \n     entitled to engage in the activity.\n     Section 210--Implementation\n       FERC must promulgate regulations to implement the Title \n     within 6 months of the date of enactment.\n     Section 211--Resources\n       The SEC must transfer its books and records related to \n     holding company regulation to the FERC.\n\n\n           Title iii--public utility regulatory policies act\n\n     Section 301--Definition\n     Section 302--Facilities\n       Section 210 of PURPA doesn't apply to facilities beginning \n     commercial operation after the effective date of this Title \n     unless the power purchase contract related to the facility \n     was in effect on the effective date.\n     Section 303--Contracts\n       Public utilities are no longer required to enter into new \n     purchase contracts under Section 210 of PURPA once there is \n     retail electric competition in their service territories.\n     Section 304--Savings Clause\n       This Title does not affect existing power purchase \n     contracts under PURPA.\n     Section 305--Effective Date\n       The effective date of this Title is

Mr. President, the Senator from Arkansas has eloquently \nand adequately described the bill which we are introducing jointly \ntoday. He is a leader in this field, and introduced the bill on this \nsubject early this year. He and I, and the occupant of the Chair, have \nhad the opportunity to go\n\n[[Page S11977]]\n\nthrough seven workshops on electric power marketing restructuring. \nDuring the course of this time, the Senator from Arkansas and I found \nthat we thought very similarly in this field, and we are here together \non the floor today to introduce a bill that modifies somewhat, but not \nin its general philosophy, the proposal that he introduced almost a \nyear ago.\n  The goal that we set in this bill is to provide for competition for \nchoice, and ultimately for lower prices for electric power consumers \nfrom the largest industry to the individual homeowner all across the 50 \nStates of the United States. We set a deadline for that competition to \nexist on the 1st of January of the year 2002. We encourage States, \nseveral of which have already acted, to provide for their own free and \nopen competition by allowing States that have met the general \nrequirements of this bill before 2002 to do it in their own way--in the \nway in which their legislatures have decided or may have decided.\n  We cover, as the Senator from Arkansas pointed out, the legitimate \nstranded costs of utilities that have been required to build \nfacilities, some of which may not be completely competitive in an \nentirely free and open market. We set up a system of independent system \noperators so that the entire transmission system of the United States \nwill be free and open on equal terms to all potential competitors.\n  We encourage the increased use of renewable energy sources by \nrequiring certain minimums increasing in three steps throughout the \ncourse of the next 15 years or so but providing credit for those who \nalready have renewable resources--hydropower, solar power, and the \nother forms of renewable resources which exist at the present time and \nmay exist in the future, and allow the sale of credit from those who \nalready meet or exceed the renewable requirements of the bill--credits \nthat they can sell to others.\n  Senator Bumpers has been a true leader in this field, and I am \nhonored and delighted to now join with him in what I believe is the \nfirst bipartisan approach to this subject, a bipartisan approach which \nis going to be absolutely essential to any success.\n  At the same time that he has been working with his constituents \nacross the country, I have been listening to my own, and my privately \nowned and public utility districts, those that produce electricity and \nthose that do not, and the wide range of other existing utilities or \npotential competitors in the Northwest.\n  I represent a State that already has very low power charges. We want \nto be a part of this process, not so that we can slow down the benefits \nto others--the entire American economy must and will benefit from this \nbill--but so that my constituents and consumers will benefit as well \nfrom the advent of competition. I am convinced that the outline of this \nbill does just exactly that.\n  We must deal with the peculiar challenges of the largest power \nmarketing authority, the Bonneville Power Administration. We do so in a \nway that reflects the regional review sponsored by the four Governors \nof the four Pacific Northwest States during the course of last year. We \nalso call in general terms for a more effective and broad-based \nmanagement of the Columbia River State System, reflecting all of the \nmultitude of uses of water in that system, and calling for a far more \neffective use of the billions of dollars that we are spending on salmon \nrecovery.\n  So I believe for my own region that we can provide lower power costs, \ngreater competition, better salmon recovery, and a more rational \nmanagement of the Columbia-Snake River System.\n  I believe for the people of the United States as a whole that we can \nprovide for lower power costs, a greater use of renewable energy, more \ncompetition, and a better America.\n  For those reasons, I am delighted to have been a part at this point \nof a joint operation with my friend from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. BUMPERS. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nWashington State for his eloquent remarks. I just wanted to say how \nhonored I am to have him join me on this bill, and reiterate one other \nthing because Senator Gorton and I want to be totally honest to the \npeople of this country as we go forward with this bill.\n  I think one thing that I must say is that, in my opinion, this $220 \nbillion industry can cope with this bill--not only cope with it, but \nthat industry, business, and the consumers of this country will all \nbenefit from this, and the Nation will benefit because it is a global \neconomy where we are competing so strenuously with the other nations of \nthe world.\n  Electricity is such a big part of our producing industry, and the \nless they pay the more competitive we become. That ought to be a real \nincentive for the people of this body to look very seriously at this \nbill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 1402. A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish a \ncommunity health aide program for Alaskan communities that do not \nqualify for the Community Health Aide Program for Alaska operated \nthrough the Indian Health Service; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n    the alaskan community health aide program expansion act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise to introduce \nlegislation relative to the benefits of community health aides. This \nparticular legislation would be titled the Alaskan Community Health \nAide Program Expansion Act of 1997. The purpose of the act would be to \nprovide a link to health care for rural communities, primarily in my \nState.\n  The Alaskan Community Health Aide Program Expansion Act would enable \nthe health aides to have access to rural, non-Native communities \nthroughout Alaska. The act will authorize training and continuing \neducation of Alaskans as community health aides to small communities \nthat do not currently qualify for the Indian Health Services' Community \nHealth Aide Program.\n  Mr. President, some 50 years ago, this unique system of community \nhealth aides was formed in my State. In the early 1940's, due to an \nextreme outbreak of tuberculosis across Alaska, volunteers were \nselected by local communities and trained as community health aides. \nThese communities, of course, suffered from distance, extreme \nisolation. They were often located hundreds of miles from the nearest \nphysician. And the community health aides, through radio contact to a \ndistant hospital in the region, became the eyes, the ears and hands of \na physician and administered life-saving medications to remote patients \nthroughout the State.\n  Today, through the Indian Health Services, the aides reside in 176 \nAlaskan-Native communities, small isolated communities throughout our \nState--which if you spread Alaska across the United States, in a \nproportional map it would run from Canada to Mexico, from California to \nFlorida. So we are talking about a big piece of real estate, Mr. \nPresident.\n  These aides, today, through telecommunications capability with \nphysicians in Anchorage, Fairbanks, and other urban areas, provide \nhealth care, provide disease prevention throughout our State. The \nhealth aides are broadly acknowledged as the backbone of rural health \ndelivery for Alaska's Native people.\n  However, Mr. President, there is a large void in Alaska's Community \nHealth Aide Program. Approximately 50 of our local Alaskan communities \ndo not have community health aides because the people who live there \nare non-Native, and thus they do not qualify for the service under \ncurrent law.\n  In these 50, 51 communities, there is no physician, there is no other \nhealth care provider of any kind. Instead, these communities are served \nby public health care nurses who come and go on an itinerant basis. In \nother words, Mr. President, health care access in these communities is \ninfrequent at best.\n  Often these non-Native communities are characterized by geographic \nisolation and cultural isolation, especially in areas such as the \nRussian communities of Nikolaevsk, Vosnesenda, Katchmaksel, and \nRassdonla.\n  Most of these communities are completely unconnected by roads. Access \nis only available by airplane, boat, and sometimes snowmachine or \ndogsled. The needs of these communities is a daunting task.\n\n[[Page S11978]]\n\n  The Community Health Aide Program Expansion Act would remedy this \ndilemma. For the first time in the history of our State, all \ncommunities and villages will have the opportunity to have health care \navailable within a village. This legislation will enable the trained \nhealth aide to live within a community, teach basic disease prevention \nand health promotion, in other words, the basic skills for good health.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will enable affordable and consistent \naccess to health care to all Alaskan communities.\n  I ask my colleagues to join in support of this legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1402\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Alaskan Community Health \n     Aide Program Expansion Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Numerous communities in Alaska have no physicians or \n     health care providers of any kind.\n       (2) While those communities are served by Alaskan public \n     health nurses on an itinerant basis, Alaskan law prohibits \n     those nurses from treating patients for individual health \n     concerns.\n       (3) Physical and cultural isolation is so severe in those \n     communities that private health care providers often opt not \n     to serve those communities.\n       (4) Not enough Native Alaskans reside in such communities \n     to warrant placement of a community health aide pursuant to \n     the Community Health Aide Program for Alaska operated through \n     the Indian Health Service.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the National Historic Preservation Act for \npurposes of establishing a national historic lighthouse preservation \nprogram; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       the national historic lighthouse preservation act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto establish the historic lighthouse preservation bill. This \nlegislation would amend the National Historic Preservation Act to \nestablish a historic lighthouse preservation program within the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  The legislation would direct the Secretary of the Interior and the \nAdministrator of General Services to establish a process for conveying \nhistoric lighthouses which are around our coastal areas and Great Lakes \nwhen these lighthouses have been deemed to be in excess of Federal \nneeds of the agency owning and operating the lighthouse.\n  For entities eligible to receive a historic lighthouse, it would be \nfor the uses of educational, park, recreation, cultural, and historic \npreservation. And the agencies that would be included would be Federal \nor State agencies, local governments, nonprofit corporations, \neducational agencies, and community development organizations, and so \nforth.\n  There is no question that the historic lighthouses would be conveyed \nin a nonfee structure to selected entities which would have the \nobligation to maintain these historic structures and maintain their \nintegrity.\n  The historic lighthouses would revert back to the United States if a \nproperty ceases to be used for education, park, recreation, cultural or \nhistoric preservation purposes, or failed to be maintained in \ncompliance with the National Historic Preservation Act.\n  Mr. President, as I said, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nwill establish a national historic light station program.\n  Lighthouses are among the most romantic reminders of our country's \nmaritime heritage. Marking dangerous headlands, shoals, bars, and \nreefs, these structures played a vital role in indicating navigable \nwaters and supporting this Nation's maritime transportation and \ncommerce. These lighthouses served the needs of the early mariners who \nnavigated by visual sightings on landmarks, coastal lights, and the \nheavens. Hundreds of lighthouses have been built along our sea coasts \nand on the Great Lakes, creating the world's most complex aids to \nnavigation system. No other national lighthouse system compares with \nthat of the United States in size and diversity of architectural and \nengineering types.\n  My legislation pays tribute to this legacy and establishes a process \nwhich will ensure the protection and maintenance of these historic \nlighthouses so that future generations of Americans will be able to \nappreciate these treasured landmarks.\n  The legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Department of the \nInterior, through the National Park Service, to establish a historic \nlighthouse preservation program. The Secretary is charged with \ncollecting and sharing information on historic lighthouses; conducting \neducational programs to inform the public about the contribution to \nsociety of historic lighthouses; and maintaining an inventory of \nhistoric lighthouses.\n  A historic light station is defined as a lighthouse, and surrounding \nproperty, at least 50 years old, which has been evaluated for inclusion \non the National Register of Historic Places, and included in the \nSecretary's listing of historic light stations.\n  Most important, the Secretary, in conjunction with the Administrator \nof General Services, is to establish a process for identifying, and \nselecting among eligible entities to which a historic lighthouse could \nbe conveyed. Eligible entities will include Federal agencies, State \nagencies, local communities, nonprofit corporations, and educational \nand community development organizations financially able to maintain a \nhistoric lighthouse, including conformance with the National Historic \nPreservation Act. When a historic lighthouse has been deemed excess to \nthe needs of the Federal agency which manages the lighthouse, the \nGeneral Services Administration will convey it, for free, to a selected \nentity for education, park, recreation, cultural, and historic \npreservation purposes.\n\n[[Page S11979]]\n\n  My legislation also recognizes the value of lighthouse friends \ngroups. Often, these groups have spent significant time and resources \non preserving the character of historic lighthouses only to have this \nwork go to waste when the lighthouse is transferred out of Federal \nownership. Under current General Services Administration regulations, \nthese friends groups are last on the priority list to receive a surplus \nlight station in spite of their efforts to protect it. My bill gives \npriority consideration to public entities who submit applications in \nwhich the public entity partners with a nonprofit friends group.\n  Everyone agrees that the historic character of these lighthouses \nneeds to be maintained. But the cost of maintaining these historic \nstructures is becoming increasingly high for Federal agencies in these \ntimes of tight budgetary constraints. These lighthouses were built in \nan age when they had to be manned continuously. Today's advanced \ntechnology makes it possible to build automated aids to navigation that \ndo not require around-the-clock manning. This technology has made many \nof these historic lighthouses expensive anachronisms which Federal \nagencies must maintain even if they no longer use them as navigational \naids.\n  My legislation ensures that the historic character of these \nlighthouses are maintained when the lighthouses are no longer needed by \nthe Federal Government. When the historic lighthouse is conveyed out of \nFederal ownership, the entity which receives the lighthouse must \nmaintain it in accordance with historic preservation laws and \nstandards. A lighthouse would revert to the United States, at the \noption of the General Services Administration, if the lighthouse is not \nbeing used or maintained as required by the law.\n  In the event no government agency or nonprofit organization is \napproved to receive a historic lighthouse, it would be offered for sale \nby the General Services Administration. The proceeds from these sales \nwould be transferred to the National Maritime Heritage Grant Program \nwithin the National Park Service. Congress established the National \nMaritime Heritage Grant Program in 1994 to provide grants for maritime \nheritage preservation and education projects. Unfortunately, funding \nfor this program has been nonexistent so the proceeds from any historic \nlighthouse sales would help ensure the program's viability.\n  It is my intent to ensure that coastal towns, where a historic \nlighthouse is an integral part of the community, would receive a \nhistoric lighthouse when it is no longer needed by the Federal \nGovernment. These historic lighthouses could be used by the community \nas a local park, a community center, or a tourist bureau. It also would \nensure that historic lighthouse friends groups or lighthouse \npreservation societies, which have voluntarily helped to maintain the \nhistoric character of the lighthouse, could receive an excess \nlighthouse.\n  Mr. President, I know firsthand the importance and allure of these \nhistoric lighthouses. When I was in the Coast Guard, I helped maintain \nlighthouses and other navigational aids. These lights were critical to \nsafe maritime traffic and I took my responsibilities seriously knowing \nthat lives were dependent on it.\n  By preserving historic lighthouses, we preserve a symbol of that era \nin American history when maritime traffic was the lifeblood of the \nNation, tying isolated coastal towns through trade to distant ports \naround the world. Hundreds of historic lighthouses are owned by the \nFederal Government and many of these are difficult and expensive to \nmaintain. This legislation provides a process to ensure that these \nhistoric lighthouses are maintained and publicly accessible.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1403\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Federal Commission on Statistical \nPolicy to study the reorganization of the Federal statistical system, \nto provide uniform safeguards for the confidentiality of information \nacquired for exclusively statistical purposes, and to improve the \nefficiency of Federal statistical programs and the quality of Federal \nstatistics by permitting limited sharing of records among designated \nagencies for statistical purposes under strong safeguards; to the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n\n               the federal statistical system act of 1997\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Sam Brownback of Kansas, Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, \nand Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, in introducing legislation to \nestablish a commission to study the Federal statistical system. \nCongressman Stephen Horn of California and Congresswoman Carolyn \nMaloney of New York plan on introducing identical legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives. This legislation is similar to bills I \nintroduced in September 1996, and again at the beginning of this \nCongress.\n  The commission to study the Federal statistical system would consist \nof 15 Presidential and congressional appointees with expertise in \nfields such as actuarial science, finance, and economics. Its members \nwould conduct a thorough review of the U.S. statistical system, and \nissue a report including recommendations on whether statistical \nagencies should be consolidated.\n  Of course, we have an example of a consolidated statistical agency \njust across the northern border. Statistics Canada, the most \ncentralized statistical agency among OECD countries, was established in \nNovember, 1918 as a reaction to a familiar problem. At that time, the \nCanadian Minister of Industry was trying to obtain an estimate of the \nmanpower resources that Canada could commit to the war effort. And he \ngot widely different estimates from statistical agencies scattered \nthroughout the government. Consolidation seemed the way to solve this \nproblem, and so it happened--as it can in a parliamentary government--\nrather quickly, just as World War I ended.\n  Last spring, a member of my staff met in Ottawa with the Assistant \nChief Statistician of Statistics Canada. He reported that Statistics \nCanada is doing quite well. Decisions about the allocation of resources \namong statistical functions are made at the highest levels of \ngovernment because the Chief Statistician of Statistics Canada holds a \nposition equivalent to Deputy Cabinet Minister. He communicates \ndirectly with Deputy Ministers in other Cabinet Departments. In \ncontrast, in the United States, statistical agencies are buried several \nlevels below the Cabinet Secretaries, so it is difficult for the heads \nof these statistical agencies to bring issues to the attention of high-\nranking administration officials and Congress.\n  Statistics are part of our constitutional arrangement, which provides \nfor a decennial census that, among other purposes, is the basis for \napportionment of membership in the House of Representatives. I quote \nfrom article I, section I:\n\n       . . . enumeration shall be made within three Years after \n     the first meeting of the Congress of the United States, and \n     within ever subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as \n     they shall by Law direct.\n\n  But, while the Constitution directed that there be a census, there \nwas, initially, no Census Bureau. The earliest censuses were conducted \nby U.S. Marshals. Later on, statistical bureaus in State governments \ncollected the data, with a Superintendent of the Census overseeing from \nWashington. It was not until 1902 that a permanent Bureau of the Census \nwas created by the Congress, housed initially in the Interior \nDepartment. In 1903 the Bureau was transferred to the newly established \nDepartment of Commerce and Labor.\n  The Statistics of Income Division of the Internal Revenue Service, \nwhich was originally an independent body, began collecting data in \n1866. It too was transferred to the new Department of Commerce and \nLabor in 1903, but then was put in the Treasury Department in 1913 \nfollowing ratification of the 16th amendment, which gave Congress the \npower to impose an income tax.\n  A Bureau of Labor, created in 1884, was also initially in the \nInterior Department. The first Commissioner, appointed in 1885, was \nCol. Carroll D. Wright, a distinguished Civil War veteran of the New \nHampshire Volunteers. A self-trained social scientist, Colonel Wright \npioneered techniques for collecting and analyzing survey data on \nincome, prices, and wages. He had previously served as chief of the \nMassachusetts Bureau of Statistics, a post he held for 15 years, and in \nthat capacity had supervised the 1880 Federal Census in Massachusetts.\n  In 1888, the Bureau of Labor became an independent agency. In 1903, \nit was once again made a bureau, joining other statistical agencies in \nthe Department of Commerce and Labor. When a new Department of Labor \nwas formed in 1913, giving labor an independent voice--as labor was \nremoved from the Department of Commerce and Labor--what we now know as \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics was transferred the newly created \nDepartment of Labor.\n  And so it went. Statistical agencies sprung up as needed. And they \nmoved back and forth as new executive departments were formed. Today, \nsome 89\n\n[[Page S11981]]\n\ndifferent organizations in the Federal Government comprise parts of our \nnational statistical infrastructure. Eleven of these organizations have \nas their primary function the generation of data. These 11 \norganizations are:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                 Date\n               Agency                      Department        established\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNational Agricultural Statistical    Agriculture...........       1863\n Service.\nStatistics of Income Division, IRS.

It requires \n     the highest qualities of self-discipline, restraint, a \n     willingness to make commitments and sacrifices for the \n     general interest, and also it requires knowledge.\n\nThat knowledge often comes from accurate statistics. You cannot begin \nto solve a problem until you can measure it.\n  This legislation would require the Commission to conduct a \ncomprehensive examination of the current statistical system and focus \nparticularly on whether three agencies that produce data as their \nprimary product--the Bureau of Economic Analysis [BEA] and the Bureau \nof the Census in the Commerce Department, and the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics [BLS] in the Labor Department--should be consolidated into a \nFederal statistical service.\n  In September 1996, prior to when I first introduced a bill \nestablishing a commission to study the U.S. statistical system, I \nreceived a letter from nine former chairmen of the Council of Economic \nAdvisers [CEA] endorsing this legislation. Excluding two recent chairs, \nwho at that time were still serving in the Clinton administration, the \nsignatories include virtually every living former chair of the CEA. \nWhile acknowledging that the United States possesses a first-class \nstatistical system, these former chairmen remind us that problems \nperiodically arise under the current system of widely scattered \nresponsibilities. They conclude as follows:\n\n       Without at all prejudging the appropriate measures to deal \n     with these difficult problems, we believe that a \n     thoroughgoing review by a highly qualified and bipartisan \n     Commission as provided in your bill has great promise of \n     showing the way to major improvements.\n\n  The letter is signed by Michael J. Boskin, Martin Feldstein, Alan \nGreenspan, Paul W. McCracken, Raymond J. Saulnier, Charles L. Schultze, \nBeryl W. Sprinkel, Herbert Stein, and Murray Weidenbaum. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  It happens that this Senator's association with the statistical \nsystem in the executive branch began over three decades ago. I was \nAssistant Secretary of Labor for Policy and Planning in the \nadministration of President John F. Kennedy. This was a new position in \nwhich I was nominally responsible for the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I \nsay nominally out of respect for the independence of that venerable \ninstitution, which as I noted earlier long predated the Department of \nLabor itself. The then-Commissioner of the BLS, Ewan Clague, could not \nhave been more friendly and supportive. And so were the statisticians, \nwho undertook to teach me to the extent I was teachable. They even \nshared professional confidences. And so it was that I came to have some \nfamiliarity with the field.\n\n  For example, we had just received a report on price indexes from a \ncommittee led by a Nobel laureate, George Stigler. The committee \nstressed the importance of accurate and timely statistics noting that:\n\n       The periodic revision of price indexes, and the almost \n     continuous alterations in details of their calculation, are \n     essential if the indexes are to serve their primary function \n     of measuring the average movements of prices.\n\n  While the final report of the Advisory Commission to Study the \nConsumer Index, the Boskin Commission, focused primarily on the extent \nto which changes in the CPI overstate inflation, the commission also \naddressed issues related to the effectiveness of Federal statistical \nprograms and recommended that:\n\n       Congress should enact the legislation necessary for the \n     Department of Commerce and Labor to share information in the \n     interest of improving accuracy and timeliness of economic \n     statistics and to reduce the resources consumed in their \n     development and production.\n\n  And last week, we were again reminded of the importance of accurate \nand timely government statistics. The front page of the Wall Street \nJournal carried this headline on Tuesday October 29: ``An Extra $46 \nBillion in Treasury's Coffers Puzzles Washington''.\n  No one knows for sure the answer to this puzzle. Surely though, a \nchanging economy which produces more and more services--which are \nharder to measure the value of than the goods it replaces--needs a top \nto bottom review of its statistical infrastructure. For if the public \nloses confidence in our statistics, they are likely to lose confidence \nin our policies as well.\n  There is, of course, a long history of attempts to reform our \nNation's statistical infrastructure. From the period 1903 to 1990, 16 \ndifferent committees, commissions, and study groups have convened to \nassess our statistical infrastructure, but in most cases little or no \naction has been taken on their recommendations. The result of this \ninaction has been an ever expanding statistical system. It continues to \ngrow in order to meet new data needs, but with little or no regard for \nthe overall objectives of the system. Janet L. Norwood, former \nCommissioner of the BLS, writes in her book ``Organizing to Count'':\n\n       The U.S. system has neither the advantages that come from \n     centralization nor the efficiency that comes from strong \n     coordination in decentralization. As presently organized, \n     therefore, the country's statistical system will be hard \n     pressed to meet the demands of a technologically advanced, \n     increasingly internationalized world in which the demand for \n     objective data of high quality is steadily rising.\n\n  In this era of Government downsizing and budget cutting, it is \nunlikely that Congress will appropriate more funds for statistical \nagencies. It is clear that to preserve and improve the statistical \nsystem we must consider reforming it, yet we must not attempt to reform \nthe system until we have heard from experts in the field.\n\n\n                         summary of legislation\n\n  The legislation establishes a commission to study the Federal \nstatistical system. The commission would consist of 15 members. Two--\nthe Chief Statistician of the Office of Management and Budget and a \nhigh-level government official--serve ex officio on the commission. The \nhigh-level official, selected by the President from among Cabinet \nofficers, the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve, the Comptroller General, or the Chairman of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers--will serve as chairman.\n  The other 13 members of the commission will be appointed as follows: \nFive by the President, no more than three of whom are to be from the \nsame political party, four by the President pro tempore of the Senate, \nno more than two of whom are to be from the same political party, and \nfour by the Speaker of the House, no more than two of whom are to be \nfrom the same political party.\n  In an initial 18-month period, the commission would determine whether \nand how to consolidate the Federal statistical system, and would also \nmake recommendations with respect to ways to achieve greater efficiency \nin carrying out Federal statistical programs. If the commission \nrecommends consolidation of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Bureau \nof the Census, and the Bureau of Economic Analysis into a newly \nestablished independent Federal agency, designated as the Federal \nStatistical Service, the commission's report would contain draft \nlegislation incorporating such recommendations. The legislation would \nthen be considered by the Congress under fast-track procedures.\n  If legislation establishing a Federal statistical service is enacted \nby the Congress, the commission then would become a permanent body that \nwould:\n  Make recommendations for nominations for the appointment of an \nAdministrator and Deputy Administrator of the Federal Statistical \nService; serve\n\n[[Page S11982]]\n\nas an advisory body to the Federal Statistical Service on \nconfidentiality issues; and conduct comprehensive studies, and submit \nreports to Congress on all matters relating to the Federal statistical \ninfrastructure, including:\n  An examination of the methodology involved in producing official \ndata; a review of information technology and recommendations of \nappropriate methods for disseminating statistical data; and a \ncomparison of our statistical system with the systems of other nations.\n  This legislation is only a first step, but an essential one. The \ncommission will provide Congress with the blueprint for reform. It will \nbe up to us to finally take action after nearly a century of \ninattention to this very important issue.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. Mack, Mr. Faircloth, Mr. D'Amato, \n        Mr. Bryan, Mr. Grams, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Gramm, Mr. \n        Hagel, Mr. Allard, Mr. Enzi, and Ms. Moseley-Braun):\n  S. 1405. A bill to amend titles 17 and 18, United States Code, to \nprovide greater copyright protection by amending copyright infringement \nprovisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n  the financial regulatory relief and economic efficiency act of 1997\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan \nbill with my colleague from Florida, Senator Connie Mack, and 11 other \noriginal cosponsors from the Banking Committee. Entitled the \n``Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 1997,'' \nthe bill is designed to promote greater access to capital and credit \nfor businesses and consumers, while ensuring the safety and soundness \nof our financial system.\n  The acronym for the bill, FRREE, is actually indicative of the bill \nitself. If enacted, the bill would free valuable resources at financial \ninstitutions now being used to comply with the bureaucratic maze of \ncurrent rules and regulations, and instead allow institutions to commit \nmore of those resources to the business of lending. This is especially \nimportant, now that we are entering the 80th month of the current \neconomic expansion. The 9 completed expansions since the end of World \nWar II have averaged 50 months. Thus, many professional economists, \nbusinessmen, and academics worry how much longer the expansion of the \ncurrent business cycle can go. Because this bill frees up resources \nthat are inefficiently being used in the private sector, I believe this \nbill could have a substantial positive impact on extending the current \nbusiness cycle as well as minimize any future economic downturn.\n  One key provision would repeal an antiquated law that disallows banks \nto pay interest on business checking accounts. Due to sophisticated and \nexpensive technology, big corporations can get around this problem by \nemploying sweep accounts. However, smaller, family owned businesses \ncannot take advantage of this expensive technology and are forced to \nkeep their money in noninterest bearing checking accounts. The Board of \nGovernors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the \nOffice of Thrift Supervision, concluded in their 1996 Joint Report, \n``Streamlining of Regulatory Requirements,'' that the statutory \nprohibition against paying interest on demand deposits no longer serves \na public purpose. Today, the repeal also has the support of the Chamber \nof Commerce, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the \nAmerican Farm Bureau Federation.\n  The bill also allows the Federal Reserve to pay interest on reserve \nbalances, thus reducing potential volatility in short-term lending \nrates. Given the historical importance of price stability, it is \nimperative we give the Federal Reserve this tool in order to better \nconduct monetary policy.\n  In short, Mr. President, the bill repeals outdated laws that hinder \nthe management practices of institutions; cuts bureaucratic red tape; \neliminates unnecessary bookkeeping; increases funds available for \nresidential mortgage lending; and eliminates unnecessary restrictions \non the discounting, and bundling of financial services to consumers.\n  The bill enjoys the overwhelming support of the Senate Banking \nCommittee and the chairman of the committee, Chairman D'Amato, is \ncommitted to having hearings on this bill when we return early next \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today, Senator Shelby and several \nof my other colleagues on the Banking Committee are introducing the \nFinancial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 1997. I am \ncosponsoring this legislation because I have long been committed to the \nprocess of reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens on financial \ninstitutions. Many of the provisions were drafted in consultation with \nthe banking regulatory agencies and will remove duplicative, \nunnecessary restrictions that no longer make sense and are no longer \nappropriate, given this era of great change in the financial services \nindustry. This bill will allow the banks to be more efficient and cost-\neffective in their activities. It will also allow them to better meet \nthe needs of the users of the system, the individuals, the communities, \nthe businesses, the exporters, the farmers, and all those who depend on \nour financial system. We live in capital-scarce times and that means \nthat it is imperative that our financial system provides capital to \nthose who need it in the most cost-effective manner possible. We can be \nlonger tolerate inefficiencies due to outmoded regulation.\n  However, it is important to note that I do not support every \nprovision of this bill, and in fact I have serious concerns about \nportions of it. I believe that certain sections of the bill will need \nto be changed significantly as it works its way through the Banking \nCommittee and the Senate floor. That said, I want to be a part of this \nprocess, because I believe in the objectives of the bill: reducing \nunnecessary regulatory burden. Furthermore, I think the issue should be \naddressed in a bipartisan manner.\n\n[[Page S11989]]\n\nThis type of effort needs to be a priority for Banking Committee and \nthe Senate as a whole, and that is why I am an original cosponsor of \nthe Financial Regulatory Relief and Economic Efficiency Act of 1997.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon:\n  S. 1406. A bill to amend section 2301 of title 38, United States \nCode, to provide for the furnishing of burial flags on behalf of \ncertain deceased members and former members of the Selected Reserve; to \nthe Committee on Veterans Affairs.\n\n\n     burial flags for members of the guard and reserves legislation\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, several months ago, one of my \nconstituents, Gilbert Miller, a retired Air Force senior master \nsergeant, walked into my Medford, OR office to share an idea with me. \nAfter doing some research, he discovered that some military reserve \ncomponent members who had honorably served their country as Selected \nReservists were not eligible for funeral burial flags. In response to \nthis inequity, and in recognition of Veterans' Day, I rise to introduce \na bill authorizing the Department of Veterans' Affairs to issue burial \nflags to deceased members of the reserve component.\n  Mr. President, National Guard and Reserve units and individual \nmembers increasingly share the day-to-day burden of our national \ndefense. Their service is routinely performed in a drill or short \nactive duty tour status alongside an active component service member. \nTheir status, however, does not make their contribution to our national \ndefense any less important or less critical. Simply put, many \nrequirements could not be met without the direct involvement of Reserve \nforces, either in a drill status or on short active duty tours.\n  In view of this reality, I believe it is time to expand the current \nlaw regarding burial flags to include these members of the total force. \nTherefore, my bill permits the issuance of a burial flag to those \nNational Guard and Reserve members who honorably served in the reserve \ncomponent.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank the Non Commissioned Officers \nAssociation and all the veterans' groups for their support of this \nbill.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to our veterans \nas we prepare to celebrate Veterans' Day. Each day as I drive to work \nat the U.S. Senate, I cannot help but notice the beautiful monuments of \nour Nation's capital. These monuments were built to honor great people \nand great events, and each has its own inspirational story to tell. \nWhat you will find in the stories is that the greatness of our country \nand of its leaders was founded in the willingness of common men and \nwomen, our veterans, to risk their lives defending the principle of \nright. Serving both at home and on foreign soil, their service must \nalways be remembered.\n  Working in Washington in this great institution and among these \nbeautiful monuments, I frequently am reminded of the sacrifices of our \nveterans. Even outside of Washington, in almost every town across \nAmerica, there are monuments dedicated to our veterans. I urge each \nAmerican to discover their story, not only from a historical \nperspective, but also through the eyes of the veterans living in their \ncommunities, where you will find common men and women who simply did \nthe right thing when called upon. And because of them, we live in a \nworld where there is more peace than ever before. They deserve our \nthanks.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1406\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. ISSUANCE OF BURIAL FLAGS FOR DECEASED MEMBERS AND \n                   FORMER MEMBERS OF THE SELECTED RESERVE.\n\n       Section 2301(a)(2) of title 38, United States Code, is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(2) deceased individual who--\n       ``(A) was serving as a member of the Selected Reserve (as \n     described in section 10143 of title 10) at the time of death;\n       ``(B) had served at least one enlistment, or the period of \n     initial obligated service, as a member of the Selected \n     Reserve and was discharged from service in the Armed Forces \n     under conditions not less favorable than honorable; or\n       ``(C) was discharged from service in the Armed Forces under \n     conditions not less favorable than honorable by reason of a \n     disability incurred or aggravated in line of duty during the \n     individual's initial enlistment, or period of initial \n     obligated service, as a member of the Selected Reserve.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n\n  S. 1407. A bill to allow participation by the communities surrounding \nYellowstone National Park in decisions affecting the park, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n       THE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK COMMUNITY PARTICIPATION ACT\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Yellowstone \nNational Park Community Participation Act. This is a bill to require \nthe National Park Service to work in conjunction and consult with the \ncommunities surrounding Yellowstone National Park in both Montana and \nWyoming.\n  The communities surrounding Yellowstone National Park, are as \ndirectly affected by actions within the park, as anything in the park \nitself. These communities' stability and economic viability are in a \nlarge part dependent on the actions within the park. Their future is \ndependent upon the actions taken both by local park management, and the \nmanagement of the National Park Service in Washington, DC.\n  The Department of the Interior and the Director of the National Park \nService have stated that the management of the parks and the Park \nService itself should work in a cooperative effort to make sure that \nthe local communities, affected by actions in the parks, are consulted \nbefore action occurs. Well unfortunately this is not always the case.\n  Last year in the 104th Congress, authority was given to the National \nPark Service to provide for a demonstration project as it relates to \nfees charged to enter our national park. This was done with the \nunderstanding that this would assist the parks in coming up with \nadditional funding for the backlog of construction and maintenance in \neach individual parks. Dollars which are sorely needed in the parks and \nwhich it is hoped would be put to good use.\n  Communities surrounding our parks, especially Yellowstone, understand \nthe need for the repairs to the infrastructure in the parks. They are \nall very willing to work with park management to do what they can to \nassist in maintaining the parks and assisting management in working on \na means for caring for the parks.\n  Yet, when the Park Service asked for input and provided each \nindividual park with an opportunity to use and develop a new fee \nstructure for the parks not all the communities were asked or informed \nof the increases in the fees. This was the case in Yellowstone National \nPark.\n  While the management of Grand Teton, just a few miles south of \nYellowstone, worked with and notified the communities affected by the \nfuture fee changes. Providing these communities an opportunity to \nprepare for the effects these changes would have on their business and \neconomic vitality.\n  An announcement was made by the management in Yellowstone to address \nthe upcoming changes without very much, if any interaction with the \nsurrounding communities. This then affected their ability to provide \nthe information necessary to people who use their communities as a \nstaging site for their visit to Yellowstone. It put them in the \nunenviable position of either subjecting their businesses to a loss, \ndue to the fact that they either accepted the additional cost for \noperating their park tours, or charging the difference to those \nconsumers who were there on the spur of the moment. This is not what \nany of us would like to do to our customers, nor anything that the \nGovernment should require of taxpayers who are either living at the \ngates of our national parks or visiting them for recreation.\n  Had a consultation occurred in this instance, it is possible that \nrelations between the communities and the park management could have \ndeveloped to find a way to work through this process. However no \nconsultation occurred and as a result, relations between park \nmanagement and the local communities have been strained.\n  Another telling facet of this dissolution of relations between local \ncommunities and the park management, is\n\n[[Page S11990]]\n\nwhat occurred just last winter. Due to what the park management called \nreduced funding, they changed the winter opening dates for the \nentrances to Yellowstone. This had a dramatic effect on the economic \nstability of the communities which are located at the entrances to \nYellowstone.\n  The basis for business in those communities at the entrances to \nYellowstone, is not just the traffic they see during the summer, but \nrests in large part on winter tourism in and around Yellowstone. As \nbeautiful and magnificent, as Yellowstone can be during the summer, the \nvisual experiences a person can enjoy during the winter are multiplied. \nMany of the businesses in these local communities look upon winter \ntourism as a means of keeping them in business for the next year.\n  When any change is announced, without suitable notification or \nadequate consultation, these communities suffer greatly. Last winter \nvisitors arrived at Yellowstone with the understanding that the park \nwould be open, to allow them to experience the beauty of the Nation's \n``Crown Jewel'' as it lay under a winter coating of snow. However, when \nthey arrived at the entrance to the park, they were greeted not with a \nwelcome, but with a barrier which kept them from enjoying their park.\n  This delayed opening had a devastating effect on the communities at \nthe gateways to Yellowstone. Many tours were canceled and groups which \nhad planned future winter events in the area, have since canceled those \nplans. Although it was not true, many of these tour and business groups \nwere of the understanding that Yellowstone was closed to winter travel \nand activity.\n  The language in this bill would assure stability for the future of \nthose communities located at the gateways to Yellowstone National Park. \nThe legislation would provide for an opening and closing date, which \nthe people of the community of West Yellowstone, MT, could count on in \nplanning for tour groups and the hiring of personnel to make the \nvisitors' stays a memorable experience.\n  I have attempted to work with the Park Service and the local \ncommunities to see if some means of consultation could be worked out \namong all the parties involved. Last January a series of meetings \noccurred, between members of the local community the Park Service and \nmy staff, to discuss the problems which the local communities were \nfacing due to the actions taken last winter. As a result of these \nmeetings, it was hoped that the management of the park would be more \nreceptive to the working with the local communities in the development \nof changes affecting their lives. So far this has not been the case.\n  I am offering this legislation today, in an attempt to open dialog to \nfind suitable arrangements for consultation between the park and the \ngateway communities of Yellowstone National Park. I will request a \nhearing on this matter to open that dialog and to seek a means by which \nall parties are comfortable in a process of exchange and consultation \non the future of the business related to Yellowstone. I look forward to \nworking with the Park Service and the local communities to find a means \nof keeping Yellowstone a treasure for all America and the world to \nenjoy, during all seasons of the year.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. D'AMATO (for himself and Mr. Moynihan):\n  S. 1408. A bill to establish the Lower East Side Tenement National \nHistoric Site, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n\n\n the lower east side tenement museum national historic site act of 1997\n\n  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Moynihan, to introduce legislation that will declare \nthe Lower East Side Tenement Museum a national historic site. Most of \nus have heard the stories of how the great wave of immigrants of \ngenerations ago entered our Nation, but few really know what happened \nto them after they landed at Ellis Island. At the Lower East Side \nTenement Museum at 97 Orchard Street in New York City, one is able to \nfollow the lives of the immigrants beyond the first hours on our \nshores. The museum tells their history, displays their courage and \nshowcases their values in an interpretive setting that brings the \nvisitor back to an era from which many of us came. The museum presents \nto many of us an awareness of our ancestral roots that we may never \nhave known existed. Through the legislation being introduced by Senator \nMoynihan and me, the museum will be able to affiliate itself with the \nNational Park Service, bestowing national recognition on the humble \nbeginnings of millions of our ancestors.\n  The Tenement Museum is unique in that it not only traces the quality \nof life inside the tenement, but presents a picture of the immigrant's \noutside world as well. Due to the cramped and dingy nature of the \ntenement, as much time as possible was spent outside. Thus, in order to \nfully explore their lives, it is essential to look toward their work, \ntheir houses of worship, their organizations, and their entertainment. \nThe museum incorporates the experiences of yesteryear's immigrants and \ninterprets them for today's generations. It gives the visitor a \npowerful glimpse into the life and living arrangements that our \nancestors faced on a daily basis. Besides onsite programs, the museum \nutilizes the surrounding neighborhood; an area which continues to this \nday in its role as a receiver of immigrants.\n  Throughout our Nation we have preserved, remembered and cherished \nplaces of national significance and beauty. We have put enormous energy \ntoward maintaining homes of noted Americans and protecting vast areas \nof wilderness. What we do not have, though, is a monument to the so-\ncalled ordinary citizen. The Tenement Museum can fill that role and \nwill do so at no cost to the Federal Government under this legislation.\n  It is unlikely that many of those who lived in buildings like the one \nat 97 Orchard Street felt that they were special. Rather, they were \nprobably grateful for the chance to come to America to try to make a \nbetter life for themselves and their families. Given the living and \nworking conditions that we now take for granted, the language and \ncultural obstacles they had to overcome, we should applaud their \nability to take hold of an opportunity and not only survive, but \nthrive. It is their contributions to society in the face of \noverwhelming obstacles that defined an era and established an ethic \nthat survives to this day. It is their spirit that we admire, and that, \nin retrospect, makes these otherwise ordinary individuals special. The \nTenement Museum is their monument, and as their descendants, it is ours \nas well.\n  Congress has an opportunity to recognize the pioneer spirit of our \nancestors and deliver it to future generations of Americans. The museum \nreminds us all of an important and often forgotten chapter in our \nimmigrant heritage, mainly, that millions of families made their first \nstand in our Nation not in a log cabin or farmhouse or mansion, but in \na city tenement. Granting the Lower East Side Tenement Museum \naffiliated status within the National Park Service will shed light on \nthat chapter while linking it to the chain of the Status of Liberty, \nEllis Island, and Castle Clinton in the story of our urban immigrant \nheritage. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Moynihan and me in \ncosponsoring this bill, and I urge its speedy consideration by the \nSenate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord. as follows:\n\n                                S. 1408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Lower East Side Tenement \n     National Historic Site Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) immigration, and the resulting diversity of cultural \n     influences, is a key factor in defining the identity of the \n     United States; and\n       (B) many United States citizens trace their ancestry to \n     persons born in nations other than the United States;\n       (2) the latter part of the 19th century and the early part \n     of the 20th century marked a period in which the volume of \n     immigrants coming to the United States far exceeded that of \n     any time prior to or since that period;\n       (3) no single identifiable neighborhood in the United \n     States absorbed a comparable\n\n[[Page S11991]]\n\n     number of immigrants than the Lower East Side neighborhood of \n     Manhattan in New York City;\n       (4) the Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street in \n     New York City is an outstanding survivor of the vast number \n     of humble buildings that housed immigrants to New York City \n     during the greatest wave of immigration in American history;\n       (5) the Lower East Side Tenement is owned and operated as a \n     museum by the Lower East Side Tenement Museum;\n       (6) the Lower East Side Tenement Museum is dedicated to \n     interpreting immigrant life within a neighborhood long \n     associated with the immigrant experience in the United \n     States, New York City's Lower East Side, and its importance \n     to United States history; and\n       (7)(A) the Director of the National Park Service found the \n     Lower East Side Tenement at 97 Orchard Street to be \n     nationally significant; and\n       (B) the Secretary of the Interior declared the Lower East \n     Side Tenement a National Historic Landmark on April 19, 1994; \n     and\n       (C) the Director of the National Park Service, through a \n     special resource study, found the Lower East Side Tenement \n     suitable and feasible for inclusion in the National Park \n     System.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to ensure the preservation, maintenance, and \n     interpretation of this site and to interpret at the site the \n     themes of immigration, tenement life in the latter half of \n     the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, the \n     housing reform movement, and tenement architecture in the \n     United States;\n       (2) to ensure continued interpretation of the nationally \n     significant immigrant phenomenon associated with New York \n     City's Lower East Side and the Lower East Side's role in the \n     history of immigration to the United States; and\n       (3) to enhance the interpretation of the Castle Clinton, \n     Ellis Island, and Statue of Liberty National Monuments.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n\n  Mr. MOYNIHAN. Mr. President, I rise to join my friend and colleague \nSenator D'Amato in introducing a bill that will authorize a small but \nmost significant addition to the National Park system by designating \nthe Lower East Side Tenement Museum a national historic site. For 150 \nyears New York City's Lower East Side has been the most vibrant, \npopulous, and famous immigrant neighborhood in the Nation. From the \nfirst waves of Irish and German immigrants to Italians and Eastern \nEuropean Jews to the Asian, Latin, and Caribbean immigrants arriving \ntoday, the Lower East Side has provided millions their first American \nhome.\n  For many of them that home was a brick tenement; six or so stories, \nno elevator, maybe no plumbing, maybe no windows, a business on the \nground floor, and millions of our forbearers upstairs. The Nation has \nwith great pride preserved log cabins, farm houses, and other symbols \nof our agrarian roots. We have reopened Ellis Island to commemorate and \ndisplay the first stop for 12 million immigrants who arrived in New \nYork City.\n  Until now we have not preserved a sample of urban, working class life \nas part of the immigrant experience. For many of those disembarked on \nEllis Island the next stop was a tenement on the Lower East Side, such \nas the one at 97 Orchard Street. It is here that the Lower East Side \nTenement Museum shows us what that next stop was like.\n  The tenement at 97 Orchard was built in the 1860's, during the first \nphase of tenement construction. It provided housing for 20 families on \na plot of land planned for a single family residence. Each floor had \nfour 3-room apartments, each of which had two windows in one of the \nrooms and none in the others. The privies were out back, as was the \nspigot that provided water for everyone. The public bathhouse was down \nthe street.\n  In 1900 this block was the most crowded per acre on Earth. Conditions \nimproved at 97 Orchard Street after the passage of the New York \nTenement House Act of 1901, though the crowding remained. Two toilets \nwere installed on each floor. A skylight was installed over the \nstairway and interior windows were cut in the walls to allow some light \nthroughout each apartment. For the first time the ground floor became \ncommercial space. In 1918 electricity was installed. Further \nimprovements were mandated in 1935, but the owner of this building \nchose to board it up rather than follow the new regulations. It \nremained boarded up for 60 years until the idea of a museum took hold.\n  The tenement museum will keep at least one apartment in the \ndilapidated condition in which it was found when reopened, to show \nvisitors the process of urban archaeology. Others are being restored to \nshow how real families lived at different periods in the building's \nhistory. Across the street there are interpretive programs to better \nexplain the larger experience of gaining a foothold on America in the \nLower East Side of New York. There are also plans for programmatic ties \nwith Ellis Island and its precursor, Castle Clinton. And the museum \nplans to play an active role in the immigrant community around it, \nfurther integrating the past and present immigrant experience on the \nLower East Side.\n  This bill designates the tenement museum a national historic site. It \nalso authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to enter into a \ncooperative agreement with the museum to ensure the marking, \ninterpretation, and preservation of the site. The Secretary will also \ncoordinate with the Statue of Liberty, Ellis Island, and Castle Clinton \nsites to help with the interpretation of the immigrant experience. It \nwill be a productive partnership.\n  Mr. President, I believe the tenement museum provides an outstanding \nopportunity to preserve and present an important stage of the immigrant \nexperience and the move for social change in our cities at the turn of \nthe century. I know of no better place than 97 Orchard Street to do so, \nand no\n\n[[Page S11992]]\n\nother place in the National Park system doing so already. I look \nforward to the realization of this grand idea, and I ask my colleagues \nfor their support.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Thompson, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1409. A bill for the relief of Sheila Heslin of Bethesda, MD; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n                       private relief legislation\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, along with \nmy colleagues Senators Thompson and Bennett, that will require the \nDepartment of Justice to pay the legal fees of a former Federal \nemployee, Sheila Heslin, who incurred these expenses as a direct result \nof the campaign finance investigations conducted by the Congress, the \nDepartment of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency.\n  Earlier this fall, Ms. Heslin testified before the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee about actions she took while performing \nher official duties as an employee of the National Security Council. \nEveryone who observed her testimony was impressed with her honesty and \ncourage in resisting high-level political pressure. Ms. Heslin told us \nhow other governmental and political officials pressured her to approve \na request that Roger Tamraz, a major contributor with an unsavory \nreputation, be allowed to meet with President Clinton. She resisted \nthese overtures in an effort to protect the integrity of the White \nHouse and to ensure that our foreign policy was conducted \nappropriately. Of all the individuals who testified before the Senate \nGovernmental Affairs Committee about the campaign finance problems, Ms. \nHeslin provided the best example of how career Government officials \nought to conduct themselves. She demonstrated courage and a high regard \nfor the proper conduct of U.S. foreign policy.\n  Ms. Heslin participated in these proceedings as a witness, not as the \nsubject of any investigation. She has provided important information on \nevents and activities that may well become the subject of prosecution. \nAs a result, Ms. Heslin was forced to retain private counsel to advise \nher in the various investigations because representation by Government \ncounsel would have presented a clear conflict of interest.\n  It is my understanding that the Department of Justice has to date \ndeclined to reimburse Ms. Heslin for the legal fees relating to her \ntestimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and other \nsimilar inquiries. She is now a private citizen with a new baby and \nwithout the personal wealth to afford the legal representation her \nservice as a Government employee has required. As an important and \nfully cooperative witness in these investigations, she has set an \nexample that ought to not be discouraged by denying Government payment \nfor outside legal representation in a case involving appropriate \nactions taken during her Federal employment.\n  Under existing regulations, the Department of Justice normally \napproves the payment of legal fees for Government employees when ``the \nactions for which representation is requested reasonably appears to \nhave been performed within the scope of the employees's employment'' \nand payment is ``in the interest of the United States.'' Both \nrequirements have been met in the case Sheila Heslin.\n  Moreover, Mr. President, in connection with other investigations, the \nDepartment of Justice has paid the legal fees of hundreds of Government \nemployees, some of whom were high-level political appointees. For \nexample, in fiscal year 1996, political appointees at the White House \nand on the Vice President's staff were reimbursed thousands of dollars \nin attorneys' fees. To deny the payment of legal fees to Ms. Heslin, \nwho is not suspected of any wrongdoing, while at the same time paying \nthe legal fees of many other Government employees, some of whom were \nbeing investigated for possible illegal activities, is simply unfair.\n  Earlier this month, I asked the Attorney General to personally \naddress this matter and to reverse the decision denying reimbursement \nto Ms. Heslin. I am still waiting for Attorney General Reno's response \nto my letter.\n  In the absence of action by the Department of Justice, I am \nintroducing this bill which directs the Attorney General to pay \nreasonable attorney's fees incurred by Ms. Heslin as a result of the \ncampaign finance investigations. To ensure that such payments are not \nexcessive, it is intended that the amounts be determined in accordance \nwith applicable Justice Department regulations.\n  Mr. President, this bill is not only for Sheila Heslin. It is also to \nsend a clear message to every career Government employee who in the \nfuture has to choose between succumbing to inappropriate political \npressure or doing the right thing. It is also for the American people \nwho are the ultimate beneficiaries when public servants put the \ninterests of the country ahead of the interests of those seeking to buy \naccess and influence for their own narrow purposes.\n  Mr. President, it is regrettable that we cannot do more to reward \npeople who follow the high standards of conduct we all espouse. At the \nvery least, we should ensure that the actions of their Government do \nnot penalize them. For that reason, I hope my colleagues will support \nthis measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED:\n  S. 1410. A bill to amend section 258 of the Communications Act of \n1934 to enhance to protections against unauthorized changes in \nsubscriber selections of telephone service providers, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                     the anti-slamming act of 1997\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few comments \nconcerning legislation which I am introducing to deal with the problem \nof slamming. Earlier this year, I outlined the remedies necessary to \ndeal with this serious consumer problem in a Sense of the Senate \nResolution which was amended to the Commerce State Justice \nAppropriations legislation. The legislation I introduce today embodies \nthose remedies. I would like to take a moment to thank Ranking Member \nHollings and Chairmen McCain and Burns for the assistance they have \nlent to me on this issue.\n  Telephone ``slamming'' is the illegal practice of switching a \nconsumer's long distance service without the individual's consent. This \nproblem has increased dramatically over the last several years, as \ncompetition between long distance carriers has risen. Slamming is the \ntop consumer complaint lodged at the Federal Communications Commission \n(FCC), with 11,278 reported complaints in 1995, and 16,500 in 1996. In \nthe first nine months of 1997 alone, 15,000 complaints have been filed. \nUnfortunately, this represents only the tip of the iceberg because most \nconsumers never report violations to the FCC. One regional Bell company \nestimates that 1 in every 20 switches is fraudulent. Media reports \nindicate that as many as 1 million illegal transfers occur annually. \nThus, slamming threatens to rob consumers of the benefit of a \ncompetitive market, which is now composed of over 500 companies which \ngenerate $72.5 billion. As a result of slamming, consumers face not \nonly increased phone bills, but also the significant expenditure of \ntime and energy in attempting to identify and reverse the fraud. The \nresults of slamming are clear: higher phone bills and immense consumer \nfrustration.\n  Mr. President, we are all aware of the stiff competition which occurs \nfor customers in the long distance telephone service industry. The goal \nof deregulating the telecommunications industry was to allow consumers \nto easily avail themselves of lower prices and better service. \nHopefully, this option will soon be presented to consumers for in-state \ncalls and local phone service. Indeed, better service at lower cost is \na main objective of those who seek to deregulate the utility industry. \nUnfortunately, fraud threatens to rob many consumers of the benefits of \na competitive industry.\n  Telemarketing is one of the least expensive and most effective forms \nof marketing, and it has exponentially expanded in recent years. By \nstatute, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulates most \ntelemarketing, prohibiting deceptive or abusive sales calls, requiring \nthat homes not be called at certain times, and that companies honor a \nconsumer's request not to be called again. The law mandates that \nrecords concerning sales be maintained for two years. While the FTC is \ncharged with primary enforcement, the law allows consumers, or state \nAttorneys General on their behalf, to bring legal action\n\n[[Page S11993]]\n\nagainst violators. Yet, phone companies are exempt from these \nregulations, since they are subject to FCC regulation.\n  While the FCC has brought action against twenty-two of the industry's \nlargest and smallest firms for slamming violations with penalties \ntotaling over $1.8 million, this represents a minute fraction of the \nviolations. FCC prosecution does not effectively address or deter this \nserious fraud. To date, state officials have been more aggressive in \npursuing violators. The California Public Utility Commission fined a \ncompany $2 million earlier this year after 56,000 complaints were filed \nagainst it. Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas, Minnesota, \nMississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio, Vermont, and Wisconsin have \nall pursued litigation against slammers. Earlier this summer, public \nofficials of twenty-five states asked the FCC to adopt tougher rules \nagainst slammers.\n  As directed by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC has \nrecently moved to close several loopholes which have allowed slamming \nto continue unabated. Most importantly, the FCC has proposed to \neliminate the financial incentive which encourages many companies to \nslam by mandating that all revenues generated from an illegal switch be \nreturned to the original carrier. At present, a slammer can retain the \nprofits generated from an illegal switch. Additionally, the FCC \nproposed regulations would require that a carrier confirm all switches \ngenerated by telemarketing through either (1) a letter of agency, known \nas a LOA, from the consumer; (2) a recording of the consumer verifying \nhis or her choice on a toll free line provided by the carrier; or (3) a \nrecord of verification by an appropriately qualified and independent \nthird party. The regulations are expected to be finalized by the FCC \nearly in 1998. While this represents a start, I believe that these \nremedies will be wholly inadequate to address the ever-increasing \nproblem of slamming. The problem is that slammed consumers would still \nbe left without conclusive proof that their consent was properly \nobtained and verified.\n  My legislation encompasses a three part approach to stop slamming by \nstrengthening the procedures used to verify consent obtained by \nmarketers; increasing enforcement procedures by allowing citizens or \ntheir representatives to pursue slammers in court with the evidence \nnecessary to win; and encouraging all stakeholders to use emerging \ntechnology to prevent fraud.\n  Mr. President, let me also thank the National Association of \nAttorneys General, the National Association of Regulatory Utility \nCommissioners which through both their national offices and individual \nmembers provided extensive recommendations to improve this bill. \nAdditionally, I have found extremely helpful the input of several \ngroups which advocate on behalf of consumers. I was particularly \npleased to work with the Consumer Federation of America to address \nconcerns which its members expressed, and I am honored that this \nlegislation has received the endorsement of their organization.\n  Mr. President, let me take a few minutes to outline the specific \nprovisions of my bill. My legislation requires that a consumer's \nconsent to change service is verified so that discrepancies can be \nadjudicated quickly and efficiently. Like the 1996 Act, my bill \nrequires a legal switch to include verification. However, my \nlegislation enumerates the necessary elements of a valid verification. \nFirst, the bill requires verification to be maintained by the provider, \neither in the form of a letter from the consumer or by recording \nverification of the consumer's consent via the phone. The length that \nthe verification must be maintained is to be determined by the FCC. \nSecond, the bill stipulates the form that verification must take. \nWritten verification remains the same as current regulations. Oral \nverification must include the voice of the subscriber affirmatively \ndemonstrating that she wants her long distance provider to be changed; \nis authorized to make the change; and is currently verifying an \nimminent switch. The bill mandates oral verification to be conducted in \na separate call from that of the telemarketer, by an independent, \ndisinterested party. This verifying call must promptly disclose the \nnature and purpose of the call. Third, after a change has been \nexecuted, the new service provider must send a letter to the consumer, \nwithin five business days of the change in service, informing the \nconsumer that the change, which he requested and verified, has been \neffected. Fourth, the bill mandates that a copy of verification be \nprovided to the consumer upon request. Finally, the bill requires the \nFCC to finalize rules implementing these mandates within nine months of \nenactment of the bill.\n\n  These procedures should help ensure that consumers can efficiently \navail themselves of the phone service they seek, without being exposed \nto random and undetectable fraudulent switches. If an individual is \nswitched without his or her consent, the mandate of recorded, \nmaintained verification will provide the consumer with the proof \nnecessary to prove that the switch was illegal.\n  The second main provision of my legislation would provide consumers, \nor their public representatives, a legal right to pursue violators in \ncourt. Following the model of Senator Hollings' 1991 Telephone Consumer \nProtection Act, my bill provides aggrieved consumers with a private \nright of action in any state court which allows, under specific \nslamming laws or more general consumer protection statutes such an \naction. The 1991 Act has been adjudicated to withstand constitutional \nchallenges on both equal protection and tenth amendment claims. Thus, \nthe bill has the benefit of specifying one forum in which to resolve \nillegal switches of all types of service: long distance, in-state, and \nlocal service.\n  Realizing that many individuals will not have the time, resources, or \ninclination to pursue a civil action, my bill also allows state \nAttorneys Generals, or other officials authorized by state law, to \nbring an action on behalf of citizens. Like the private right of action \nin suits brought by public officials damages are statutorily set at \n$1,000 or actual damages, whichever is greater. Treble damages are \nawarded in cases of knowing or willful violations. In addition to \nmonetary awards, states are entitled to seek relief in the form of \nwrits of mandamus, injunction, or similar relief. To ensure a proper \nrole for the FCC, state actions must be brought in a federal district \ncourt where the victim or defendant resides. Additionally, state \nactions must be certified with the Commission, which maintains a right \nto intervening in an action. The bill makes express the fact that it \nhas no impact on state authority to investigate consumer fraud or bring \nlegal action under any state law.\n  Finally, Mr. President, my legislation recognizes that neither \nlegislators nor regulators can solve tomorrow's problems with today's \ntechnology. Therefore my bill mandates that the FCC provide Congress \nwith a report on other, less burdensome but more secure means of \nobtaining and recording consumer consent. Such methods might include \nutilization of Internet technology or issuing PIN numbers or customer \ncodes to be used before carrier changes are authorized. The bill \nrequires that the FCC report to Congress on such methodology by \nDecember 31, 1999.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss my initiative \nto stop slamming. I hope that this issue can be addressed quickly. As a \nresult, I would urge all my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MACK (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. DeWine, Mr. Santorum, \n        Ms. Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mr. D'Amato, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. \n        Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Graham, \n        Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 1411. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \ndisallow a Federal income tax deduction for payments to the Federal \nGovernment or any State or local government in connection with any \ntobacco litigation or settlement and to use any increased Federal \nrevenues to promote public health; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n        THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH TRUST FUND ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. MACK. Mr. President, today I am joined by Senators Harkin, \nDeWine, Santorum, Collins, Snowe, D'Amato, Smith of Oregon, Boxer, \nKennedy, Feinstein, Lautenberg, Graham,\n\n[[Page S11994]]\n\nDodd, Durbin, and Wellstone in introducing legislation that begins to \nrealize the paramount goal of doubling funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health [NIH] over the next 5 years. The bill ensures that \nany tobacco settlements or judgments are not tax deductible.\n  As currently crafted, the global settlement specifically allows the \ntobacco companies to deduct the entire amount of their payments. That \nis a possible $128 billion break on their tax bill. I believe it is \nfundamentally wrong to allow them such a free ride at taxpayers' \nexpense. More importantly, any settlement should provide funds for \nbiomedical research, including funding to find better treatment and \ncures for the diseases caused by tobacco.\n  Although the Tax Code often allows settlement amounts to be \ndeductible, the current law provides that fines or penalties paid to a \nGovernment entity are not. The unprecedented situation we face with the \ntobacco industry demands that the Congress define these payments as \nmore akin to such a fine or penalty. If a businessman cannot deduct a \nspeeding ticket he received on his way to a meeting, tobacco shouldn't \nbe able to deduct its payment for guaranteed immunity and certainty of \nliability. Which is worse, a speeding ticket or knowingly addicting and \nkilling millions of Americans?\n  I want my colleagues to understand that the success of our efforts on \nthis front does not hinge on the enactment of a final Federal \nsettlement. The bill applies to any settlement or judgment at the State \nor Federal level. As such, if the tobacco companies are found liable in \nany forum, or see fit to settle any of their cases with governmental \nentities, those payments will not be deductible. However, the bill \nleaves in place the deductibility of compensatory sums paid to \nindividuals for harm done to them. Now is the time for Congress to step \nforward and pledge that we will not be a party to any tobacco \nsettlement that comes at taxpayers' expense.\n  Allowing the companies to state that they are willing to pay $368.5 \nbillion to the Government, when in reality they are only paying two-\nthirds of that amount, is false advertising. The bill corrects this \nmisleading situation to the benefit of thousands, perhaps millions, of \nAmericans whose tobacco-related illnesses might be cured now through \nmedical research.\n  As my colleagues will recall, the Senate passed by a vote of 98 to 0 \na Sense of the Senate Resolution that Congress, and the Nation, should \ncommit to the goal of doubling funding for NIH over the next 5 years. \nThe actions we are taking today will help us to achieve that goal.\n  The tax revenues which will be derived as a result of making the \nsettlement or judgments nondeductible will be used to establish the \nNational Trust Fund for Biomedical Research. Each year, after the \nPresident has signed the Labor/HHS/Education bill into law, the moneys \nin the medical research trust fund established by this bipartisan \nlegislation will be allocated to NIH for biomedical research.\n  Research has demonstrated that many diseases can be prevented, \neliminated, detected earlier, or managed more effectively through a \nvast array of new medical procedures and therapies.\n  For the first time in history, overall death rates from cancer have \nbegun a steady decline in the United States. Ten years ago, cancer \npatients were offered little hope of survival. Today, however, if a \nbreast cancer is detected at an early stage, there is a 94-percent \nsurvival rate. Today, 80 percent of children diagnosed with acute \nlymphoblastic leukemia [ALL] are alive and free of the disease 5 years \nafter diagnosis.\n  Genetic research has enabled Americans to learn if they are more \nlikely to develop osteoporosis, breast cancer, Lou Gehrig's disease and \nother illnesses. Scientists now know that, in at least 50 percent, and \npossibly as many as 80 percent, of all cancers, one gene--p53--is \ndamaged. If cancer cells growing in a dish are given healthy p53 genes, \nthey immediately stop proliferating and die.\n  We now know that if one inherits a mutated gene for hemochromatosis, \nmore commonly known as iron overload disease, a disease which affects \napproximately 1 million Americans, then one will actually develop the \ndisease. The benefit of knowing this is that giving blood is an \neffective way to manage the disease.\n  Because of the advances made in biomedical research, people with \nParkinson's disease, AIDS, Alzheimer's disease, and other ailments are \nliving longer and healthier lives. We are on the verge of cures and new \ntreatments for diseases which have plagued our society for many years. \nResearch is the key which will unlock the knowledge needed to find \nthese cures.\n  But doubling our commitment to NIH, we could improve the grant \nsuccess rate from 25 to 40 percent. More patients would have access to \nclinical trials. Approximately 2 percent of all cancer patients are now \nenrolled in clinical trials. We could increase that to 20 percent. The \nresult is that more families would have access to the most effective \nstate-of-the-art treatment.\n  Patients would also benefit by advances in new methods of treatment \nincluding gene therapy, immunotherapy, spinal cord rejuvenation; \nhelping diabetics naturally produce insulin; relief for Parkinson's \ndisease patients, and reduction in heart disease, which is the leading \ncause of death in the United States.\n  We have entered a new era of medical research in this country, but we \nmust provide the necessary funding in order to translate discoveries \ninto new methods of diagnosis and treatment.\n  There can be little argument that scientific advances will also have \na significant positive impact upon our Nation's economy. They will \nresult in reduced health expenditures for Medicare, Medicaid, DOD, VA, \nand other public and private health programs. A recent study by the \nNational Science Foundation concluded that every dollar spent on basic \nresearch permanently adds 50 cents or more each year to national \noutput.\n  In addition, the medical technology industry provides high-wage jobs \nto millions of Americans. Investment in basic science helps the United \nStates compete in the global marketplace in such industries as \npharmacology, biotechnology, and medical technology. Combined with the \nactions taken earlier this year to reform the FDA, public and private \ninvestment in biomedical research will ensure our ability to compete in \nthis important industry and create new jobs.\n  Mr. President, there are millions of Americans who are fighting a \nday-to-day battle against cancer, sickle cell anemia, AIDS, \nosteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, and other ailments. Their lives are \nin our hands. They are asking for hope and the opportunity for a cure. \nWe must act now.\n  This legislation is supported by more than 175 organizations \nrepresenting a broad base of research, patient, health professions, \nconsumer, and education communities. I ask unanimous consent that a \nlist of these organizations be included in the Record.\n  I urge my colleagues to join this bipartisan effort to help achieve \nthe goal of doubling NIH funding over the next 5 years.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Organizations Supporting Mack-Harkin Tobacco Research Fund as of \n                            November 6, 1997\n\n       1.

Mr. President, today Senator Mack and I, joined by a \nstrong bipartisan group of our colleagues, are introducing legislation \nthat would prevent tobacco companies from claiming the settlement or \njudgement payments as a tax-deductible expense, and use the resulting \nsavings to substantially expand our Nation's investment in the search \nfor medical breakthroughs.\n  It is important to note that this common sense proposal is the first \nmajor tobacco legislation this year to be introduced with strong \nbipartisan support. We have 16 cosponsors--8 Democrats and 8 \nRepublicans--and I believe we'll have many more as more of our \ncolleagues have the time to review this bill. Senator Mack and I are \nalso very pleased to have the support of over 170 organizations from \nacross the Nation signed up in support of this plan.\n  During the negotiations that led to the proposed national tobacco \nsettlement, lawyers for the big tobacco companies insisted on a \nprovision stating\n\n[[Page S11996]]\n\nthat ``all payments pursuant to this agreement shall be deemed ordinary \nand necessary business expenses.'' This means that all payments under \nthis proposal, an estimated $368.5 billion over 25 years, would be tax \ndeductible. Thus the industry could write off about 35 percent of the \nentire settlement payment of $368.5 billion, as well as any future \npayments or fines. So, if this were allowed to happen, the American \npeople--not Big Tobacco--would be forced to pay approximately $130 \nbillion of the tobacco settlement.\n  But the American people have paid enough. They've paid by having \ntheir kids deliberately targeted in slick advertising campaigns. \nThey've paid by having the industry lie to them about the health \neffects of tobacco. And they've paid with disease and death.\n  Tobacco products kill more than 400,000 Americans every year--that's \nmore deaths than from AIDS, alcohol, car accidents, murders, suicides, \ndrugs, and fires combined. Last year, close to 5,000 Iowans died from \nsmoking related illnesses.\n  Mr. President, our bipartisan bill would close this outrageous \nloophole in the proposed national tobacco settlement, and open a new \nsource of funding for investing in health research.\n  And that's what we really need. The proposed settlement provides \nfunding for smoking cessation programs, anti-smoking education \nprograms, and FDA enforcement--but only a tiny amount is set aside for \nvital scientific research on lung cancer, emphysema, and heart disease.\n  The Senate is already on record, in a vote of 98-0, to double the \nbudget of NIH within 5 years. If we create a trust fund for medical \nresearch as I have been calling for since 1993 and deposit in it the \nsavings from the elimination of this special interest loophole, we \ncould take a major step to meet the Senate's objective and make even \nmore headway in curing killer diseases.\n  A fund for health research would provide additional resources for our \nsearch for medical breakthroughs over and above those provided to NIH \nin the annual appropriations process. The fund would greatly enhance \nthe quality of health care by investing more in finding preventive \nmeasures, cures and more cost effective treatments for the major \nillnesses and conditions that strike Americans.\n  In 1993 and 1994 I argued that any health care reform plan should \ninclude additional funding for health research. Health care reform was \ntaken off the front burner but the need to increase our Nation's \ncommitment to health research has only grown.\n  While health care spending devours nearly $1 trillion annually our \nmedical research budget is dying of starvation. The United States \ndevotes less than 2 percent of its total health care budget to health \nresearch. The Defense Department spends 15 percent of its budget on \nresearch. Does this make sense? The cold war is over but the war \nagainst disease and disability continues.\n  Increased investment in health research is key to reducing health \ncosts in the long run. If we can find cures for lung cancer, emphysema, \nand heart disease, the savings would be enormous.\n  Mr. President, I do everything I can to increase funding for NIH \nthrough the appropriations process. But, given the current budget \nsituation and freeze in discretionary spending what we can do is \nlimited. Without action, our investment in medical research through the \nNIH is likely to decline in real terms.\n  The NIH is able to fund only about 25 percent of competing research \nprojects or grant applications deemed worthy of funding. This is \ncompared to rates of 30 percent or more just over a decade ago. Science \nand cutting edge medical research are being put on hold. We may be \ngiving up possible cures for diabetes, Parkinson's, cancer, and \ncountless other diseases.\n  Our lack of investment in research may also be discouraging our young \npeople from pursuing careers in medical research. The number of people \nunder the age of 36 even applying for NIH grants dropped by 54 percent \nbetween 1985 and 1993. This is due to a host of factors but I'm afraid \nthat the lower success rates among applicants is making biomedical \nresearch less and less attractive to young people.\n  I am tremendously heartened by the significant bipartisan coalition \nof 16 Senators that has formed in support of our bill. Our colleagues \nwho have joined with us on this legislation understand that health \nresearch is an investment in our future--an investment in our children \nand grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is common sense, bipartisan--and it's \nthe right thing to do. Senator Mack and I join in asking our colleagues \nfor their willingness to carefully review our proposal. Certainly any \ntobacco legislation that this Congress adopts next year should \ncontribute significantly to our Nation's commitment in the search for \nmedical breakthroughs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues, Senator \nMack, Senator Harkin, and others in introducing the National Institutes \nof Health Trust Fund Act of 1997. This bill, very simply, is intended \nto ensure that payments made by the tobacco industry under any \nsettlement legislation enacted by Congress on behalf of the people of \nthis Nation, will be the full responsibility of the tobacco companies.\n  Many of us were dismayed to learn that under current law, those \npayments could be deducted by these companies as a business expense--\neffectively reducing the cost to manufacturers by one-third. I don't \nthink that this is what the negotiators of the settlement intended, nor \nis it what the public expects. This bill would disallow the \ndeductibility of the proposed settlement or the settlement of any other \ntobacco-related civil action. The tax revenues from the disallowance of \nthe deduction, estimated at $100 billion, would go toward a trust fund \nfor the National Institutes of Health.\n  My primary interest in the tobacco settlement originates in the \ndramatically high incidence of teen smoking in our country. The \nstatistics are startling--3,000 young children begin smoking each day \nand over 90 percent of adults that smoke started before the age of 18. \nOur hope and expectation is that with resources generated by a tobacco \nsettlement, we can fund effective programs to help addicted teens quit \nsmoking and prevent most children from ever starting.\n  In essence, we want to encourage young people to take responsibility \nfor their health. Tobacco companies must set a precedent for our youth \nby taking full financial responsibility for the damage they have \ninflicted on the public health of the Nation. Tobacco companies have \nalready conceded the points that tobacco is harmful and addictive and \ninformation that would have been useful to our understanding of tobacco \naddition was withheld. Avoiding full payment of penalties for their \nactions through the tax deduction loophole is ethically wrong, even if \nlegal. The tobacco industry needs to serve as an example for the \nchildren of the Nation by accepting the full financial consequences of \nthe settlement.\n  Just a few months ago, the public loudly voiced its disgust with the \ncovert attempt to give the tobacco industry a $50 billion credit toward \npayment of a future settlement. While we were successful in eliminating \nthat loophole, an unfortunate repercussion has been the exacerbation of \nthe public's doubts about the settlement. Even if they didn't before, \nmany now believe that the industry will exploit any loophole to escape \nits responsibility. We must restore the public's faith in this process. \nWe must send a clear message that any tobacco settlement reached will \nbe grounded in the principle that tobacco companies take full \nresponsibility for their actions. That objective can best be achieved \nby swift passage of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of Oregon (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Wyden, \n        Mr. Baucus and Mr. Gorton):\n  S. 1412. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \ncertain tax free corporate liquidations into a 501(c)(3) organization \nand to revise the unrelated business income tax rules regarding receipt \nof debt-financed property in such a liquidation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n\n\n                  THE CHARITABLE GIVING INCENTIVE ACT\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise to introduce with Senator \nFeinstein legislation that will provide incentives to taxpayers to use \ntheir wealth for charitable causes. In this era of ever-tightening \nfiscal constraints placed on congressional ability\n\n[[Page S11997]]\n\nto authorize discretionary funding, we have asked our communities to do \nmore and more for those less fortunate. Charitable organizations in our \ncommunities have become an integral part of the safety net for the poor \nand homeless and significant sources of assistance for education in \nevery community.\n  To help charities take advantage of those donors who wish to \ncontribute significant wealth for charitable purposes, we are \nintroducing the Charitable Giving Incentive Act. This legislation will \nchange current tax law to encourage prospective donors to contribute a \ncontrolling interest in a closely-held corporation to charity.\n  When a donor is willing to make a gift of a controlling interest in a \ncompany, a tax is imposed on the corporation upon its liquidation, \nreducing the gift that the charity receives by 35 percent. The Smith/\nFeinstein bill would eliminate this egregious tax that is levied upon \nthe value of these qualifying corporations. We sincerely hope that this \nwill directly encourage meaningful contributions to charitable \norganizations that help a variety of causes. I ask that my colleagues \nsupport this legislation and look forward to its being considered by \nthe Finance Committee in the near future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1412\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues \nSenator Gordon Smith and Ron Wyden of Oregon, as well Senator Max \nBaucus and Senator Slade Gorton to introduce legislation to strengthen \ntax incentives and encourage more charitable giving in America. The \nlegislation, based on S. 1121 which I introduced last year, represents \nan important step to encourage greater private sector support for \nimportant educational, medical, and other goals in local communities \nacross the country.\n  Americans are among the most caring in the world, contributing \ngenerously to charities in their communities: American families \ncontribute, on average, nearly $650 for each household, or about $130 \nbillion annually, to charities. Approximately, three out of every four \nhouseholds give to nonprofit charitable organizations.\n  However, charities are very concerned for the future, as Federal \nefforts to balance the budget will limit funds for social spending for \nurgent needs like children's services, homelessness, job training, and \nhealth care. While support for charities grew by 3.7 percent in 1994, \ncontributions for human services, the area most closely associated with \npoverty programs, dropped by 6 percent. Nonprofit charities are very \nconcerned about their ability to maintain their current level of \nservices or grow to address unmet needs.\n  Nonprofit charities can never replace government programs, but they \ncan play a critical role and provide vital social services. The Federal \nGovernment must ensure we are doing everything we can to encourage \nsupport for charities, which supplement Federal programs.\n\n\n             expanding tax incentives for charitable giving\n\n  The Federal Government must provide the leadership and the tools to \nencourage more charitable giving through the Tax Code. One source of \nuntapped resources for charitable purposes is closely held corporate \nstock. A closely held business is a corporation, in which stock is \nissued to a small number shareholders, such as family members, but is \nnot publicly traded on an exchange. This type of business is very \npopular for family businesses involving different generations.\n  However, the tax cost of contributing closely held stock to a charity \nor foundation can be prohibitively high. The tax burden discourages \nfamilies and owners from winding down a business and contributing the \nproceeds to charity. This legislation would permit certain tax-free \nliquidations of closely held corporations into one or more tax exempt \n501(c)(3) organizations.\n  Under current law, a corporation may have to be liquidated to \neffectively complete the transfer of assets to a charity, incurring a \ncorporate tax at the 35 percent tax rate. In 1986, Congress repealed \nthe ``General Utilities'' doctrine, imposing a corporate level tax on \nall corporate transfers, including those to tax exempt charitable \norganizations. A charity may also be subject to taxation on its \nunrelated business income from certain types of donated property.\n  These tax costs make contributions of closely held stock a costly and \nineffective means of giving funds to a charity. If we are going to find \nnew ways to strengthen charities, we need to review the tax costs which \nundercut the incentive to give and the value of a charitable gift.\n  Volunteers are already hard at work in their communities and \ncharitable funding is already stretched dangerously thin. Charities \nneed added tools to unlock the public's desire to give generously. We \nneed to create appropriate incentives for the private sector to do \nmore.\n  In California, volunteer and charitable organizations, together, \nperform vital roles in the community and deserve our support. I would \nlike to offer some examples, which can be also found throughout the \ncountry:\n  Summer Search: In San Francisco, the Summer Search Foundation is hard \nat work preventing students from dropping out of high school. Summer \nSearch helps students successfully complete school and, for 93 percent \nof the participants, go on to college. With increased charitable \ncontributions, Summer Search could help keep kids in school and on \ntrack toward graduation and a more productive contribution to the \nNation.\n\n  Drew Center for Child Development: I am deeply concerned with \nincreases in the number of child abuse and neglect cases, which now \ntotal nearly 3 million children in the United States. Social services \nblock grants cuts will impose new burdens on local communities. The \nDrew Child Development Center, located in the Watts area of Los \nAngeles, works directly with children and families involved in child \nabuse environments. There are thousands of other families that could \nbenefit from the Drew Center program if only more resources were \navailable. Stronger tax\n\n[[Page S11998]]\n\nincentives to boost charitable giving could provide the Drew Center \nwith some of the resources needed to combat this enormous problem.\n  The Chrysalis Center: In 1993 I visited the Chrysalis Center, a Los \nAngeles organization dedicated to helping homeless individuals find and \nkeep jobs. Chrysalis provides employment assistance, from training in \njobseeking skills to supervised searches for permanent employment. The \nCenter has helped place thousands of people in permanent, full-time \njobs in the last decade.\n  Jobs for the Homeless: Jobs for the Homeless assists with job \nplacement services for the homeless in Berkeley and Oakland, supporting \nover 1,400 men and women. However, thousands more need their help. The \nformer homeless individuals have landed successful positions in \nmanufacturer, retailers, and small and large businesses. Without more \ncontributions, Jobs for the Homeless will be unable to provide the \nnecessary support and increase their literacy or drug rehabilitation \nprograms, critical ingredients in moving people back to work.\n  Today, Senators Smith, Wyden, Baucus, Gorton, and I introduce tax \nincentive legislation to encourage stronger support for the Nation's \nvital charities. The proposal: Eliminates the corporate tax upon \nliquidation of a qualifying closely held corporation under certain \ncircumstances. The legislation would require 80 percent or more of the \nstock to be dedicated to a charity; and clarifies that a charity can \nreceive mortgaged property in a qualified liquidation, without \ntriggering unrelated business income tax for 10 years.\n  By eliminating the corporate tax upon liquidation, Congress would \nencourage additional, and much needed, charitable gifts. Across \nAmerica, countless thousands have built successful careers and have \ngenerated substantial wealth in closely held corporations. As the \nindividuals age and plan their estates, we should help them channel \ntheir wealth to philanthropic goals. Individuals who are willing to \nmake generous bequests of companies and assets, often companies they \nhave spent years building, should not be discouraged by substantially \nreducing the value of their gifts through Federal taxes.\n  While the Joint Tax Committee has not yet prepared an official \nrevenue cost, previous estimates suggest a cost of about $400 million \nover 5 years. However, as a result of capital gains tax reform adopted \nearlier this year, the cost if likely to be significantly lower. Of \nequal significance, the same revenue estimating assumptions project big \nincreases in charitable giving as a result of the legislation, \nstimulating between $3 and 5 billion in charitable contributions. This \ntax proposal may generate as much as seven or eight times its projected \nrevenue loss in expanded charitable giving.\n  I encourage others to review this legislation and listen to the \ncharities in your community. The legislation has been endorsed by the \nCouncil on Foundations, which represents foundations throughout the \ncountry, and the Council of Jewish Federations. Since the introduction \nof the legislation last year, the proposal has been revised to sharpen \nthe bill's focus and target the legislation in the most effective \nmanner. I want to encourage the review process to continue, so we may \ncontinue to build support and target the bill's impact for the benefit \nof the Nation's nonprofit community.\n  With virtually limitless need, we must look at new ways to encourage \nand nurture a strong charitable sector. Private charities cannot \nreplace the government, but if the desire to support charitable \nactivity exists, we should not impose taxes to decrease the value of \nthat support. Tax laws should encourage, rather than impede, charitable \ngiving. By inhibiting charitable gifts, Federal tax laws hurt those \nindividuals that most need the help of their government and theie \ncommunity.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Thomas, \n        Mr. Grams, Mr. Kerrey, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Chafee):\n  S. 1413. A bill to provide a framework for consideration by the \nlegislative and executive branches of unilateral economic sanctions; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n\nTHE ENHANCEMENT OF TRADE, SECURITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS THROUGH SANCTIONS \n                               REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Enhancement of \nTrade, Security, and Human Rights Through Sanctions Reform Act, a bill \nthat will establish a more deliberative, commonsense approach to U.S. \nsanctions policy. I'm pleased to be joined by several distinguished \ncolleagues, in introducing this important piece of legislation.\n  In recent years, there has been a proliferation in the use of \nunilateral economic sanctions as a tool of American foreign policy. \nWhile unilateral sanctions may be a low cost alternative to the \ndeployment of American Armed Forces abroad--or to milder, less coercive \nchoices--they almost never succeed in achieving their foreign policy \nobjectives. They frequently impose a greater burden on American \ncompanies, producers, farmers, and workers than on the intended target \ncountry.\n  A cardinal test of foreign policy is that when we act \ninternationally, our actions should do less harm to ourselves than to \nothers. Unilateral economic sanctions, unfortunately, often fail this \ncrucial test.\n  Mr. President, there have been a large number of studies on \nunilateral economic sanctions in recent years and they provide some \ninteresting results. Manufacturers revealed that in the period 1993 to \n1996, the United States imposed unilateral sanctions to achieve foreign \npolicy goals 61 times in 35 different countries. Last year, the report \nof the President's Export Council cited 75 countries representing 52 \npercent of the world's population that have been subject to or \nthreatened by U.S. unilateral economic sanctions.\n  These actions have jeopardized billions in export earnings and \nhundreds of thousands of American jobs, while weakening our ability to \nprovide humanitarian assistance abroad. In another study, the Institute \nfor International Economics concluded that, in 1995 alone, economic \nsanctions cost U.S. exports--to 26 countries--between $15-19 billion, \nand eliminated upwards to 200,000 U.S. jobs, many in high wage export \nsector.\n  The damage to the U.S. economy can have long-term consequences. Once \nforeign competitors establish a presence in international markets \nabandoned by the United States, the potential losses begin to magnify. \nOver time, the cumulative effect of sanctions will be a loss of \ncommercial contracts, but more importantly, may be a loss of confidence \nin American suppliers and in the United States as a reliable partner to \ndo business. Frequent resort to economic sanctions, however, \nmeritorious they may be, runs the risk of weakening the export sector \nwhich has contributed so greatly to our economic prosperity. This \nweakening effect can, in turn, have an adverse effect on our political \ninfluence abroad.\n\n  The major difficulty with our increased use of unilateral economic \nsanctions is that they rarely achieve the foreign policy goals they are \nintended to achieve. Sanctions frequently give the illusion of action \nby substituting for more decisive action or by serving as a palliative \nfor those who demand that some action be taken--any action--by the \nUnited States against another country with whom we have a disagreement.\n  Sanctions can also make it more difficult diplomatically to engage \nforeign governments in dialogue to help bring about a political opening \nor a change in behavior. Serious trade sanctions can, in fact, inhibit, \nrather than facilitate, constructive dialogue with others.\n  As a nation, we often seek instant gratification or quick results \nfrom our actions. Sanctions, however, take a long time to work and the \nchange in behavior we seek in other countries will most often take \nplace incrementally over time. In some cases, our sanctions have the \nunintended consequences of providing authoritarian leaders a basis for \nincreasing their political support and rally opposition to the United \nStates because our sanctions can be used to divert popular anger and \nresentment away from their own mis-deeds and mis-rule.\n  Unilateral sanctions almost never help those we want to assist, they \nfrequently harm the United States more than the sanctioned country and \nundermine our international economic\n\n[[Page S11999]]\n\ncompetitiveness and economic security. Most regrettably, unilateral \nsanctions have become a policy of first choice when other policy \nalternatives exist.\n  Nonetheless, some economic sanctions are effective and, therefore, \nmust remain a tool of American foreign policy. Multilateral, unlike \nunilateral, sanctions have frequently advanced American national \ninterests. The multilateral sanctions against Saddam Hussein following \nIraq's aggression against Kuwait have slowed down Iraq's weapons of \nmass destruction program. Similarly, international sanctions aimed at \nSerbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia functioned to isolate \nthem diplomatically and protect United States and allied interests in \nthe Balkans. The international sanctions against apartheid in South \nAfrica in the 1980's had a significant influence on bringing about a \nnonviolent peaceful transition in that country.\n  Finally, the broad consensus to oppose Soviet expansion through \nexport restraints on East-West trade in the Coordinating Committee, or \nCoCom, proved to be enormously effective. Most economic sanctions, \nwhether unilateral or multilateral, must be in place for a long time \nbefore they are effective and their success will almost always be \ndependent upon extensive multilateral cooperation and compliance.\n  Nothing in our proposed legislation prohibits unilateral economic \nsanctions. There are situations where other foreign policy options have \nbeen exhausted and where the actions of others are so outrageous or so \nthreatening to the United States and our national interests that our \nresponse, short of the use of force, must be firm and unambiguous. In \nsuch instances, economic sanctions may be a useful instrument of \nAmerican foreign policy.\n  Mr. President, my proposed legislation is prospective. It will not \naffect existing U.S. sanctions. It will apply only to unilateral \nsanctions and to those sanctions intended to achieve foreign policy or \nnational security objectives. It would exclude, by definition, U.S. \ntrade laws, Jackson-Vanik and munitions list controls. It would not \naddress the complex and important issue of state and local sanctions \ndesigned to achieve foreign policy goals, although these so-called \nvertical sanctions are increasingly important features of American \nforeign policy.\n  More specifically, Mr. President, this legislation seeks to establish \nclear guidelines and informational requirements to help us understand \nbetter the likely consequences of our actions before we opt to impose \neconomic sanctions. We should know in advance of voting on sanctions \nlegislation what our goals are, the anticipated economic, political and \nhumanitarian benefits and costs to the United States and \nother countries, the possible impact on our reputation as a reliable \nsupplier, the other policy options that have been explored, and whether \nthe proposed sanctions are likely to contribute to achieving the \nforeign policy objectives sought by legislation. Comparable \nrequirements are also in the bill for sanctions mandated by the \nexecutive branch.\n\n  Once sanctions are implemented, the bill also requires an annual \nreport from the President detailing the degree to which sanctions have \naccomplished U.S. goals, as well as their impact on our economic, \npolitical and humanitarian interests, including our relations with \nother countries.\n  The bill also provides for more active and timely consultations \nbetween Congress and the President. It provides Presidential waiver \nauthority in emergencies or if he determines it is in the national \ninterest.\n  It includes a sunset provision that would terminate unilateral \neconomic sanctions after 2 years duration unless the Congress or the \nPresident acts to reauthorize them.\n  It includes language on contract sanctity to help ensure the United \nStates is a reliable supplier.\n  It identifies U.S. agriculture as an especially vulnerable sector of \nour economy that has borne a disproportionate burden stemming from U.S. \neconomic sanctions. Because of this, there is discretionary authority \nfor agricultural assistance in the bill. In addition, the bill opposes \nagricultural embargoes as a foreign policy weapon and urges that \neconomic sanctions be targeted as narrowly as possible in order to \nminimize harm to innocent people and humanitarian activities.\n  Mr. President, my sanctions reform bill represents an attempt to \ndevelop an improved and comprehensive approach to an important foreign \npolicy issue. We, in the Congress, are often called upon to make \ndifficult choices between conflicting interests or among our core \nvalues as a nation and our international interests.\n  These are frequently hard choices that should be given careful \nattention and preceded by careful analysis. We should never turn our \nback on our fundamental values of supporting democracy, human rights, \nand basic freedoms abroad but we should ask whether we can alter the \nbehavior of other countries by imposing sanctions on them. Many times \nwe cannot do so and many times we exacerbate the very behavior we hope \nto reverse. There is no magic formula for influencing the behavior of \nother countries, but unilateral economic sanctions are rarely the \nanswer.\n  Nothing in this bill prevents the imposition of U.S. unilateral \neconomic sanctions or dictates a particular trade-off between American \ncore values and our commercial and other interests. The steps detailed \nin this bill provide for better policy procedures so that consideration \nof economic sanctions are preceded by a more deliberative process by \nwhich the President and the Congress can make reasoned and balanced \nchoices affecting the totality of American values and interests.\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly about this issue. I hope my colleagues \nwill join the other original cosponsors by taking a close look at this \nlegislation. I welcome their support and believe that if we deal with \nthe sanctions issues in a careful and systematic manner, we can make a \nsignificant positive contribution to our national interest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1413\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The act may be cited as the \n     ``Enhancement of Trade, Security and Human Rights through \n     Sanctions Reform Act.''\n       Section 2: Purpose. The purpose of the Act is to establish \n     an effective framework for consideration of unilateral \n     economic sanctions.\n       Section 3: Statement of Policy. This section sets forth \n     U.S. policy to pursue American security, trade, and \n     humanitarian interests through broad-ranging engagement with \n     other countries, while recognizing the need at times to \n     impose sanctions as a last resort. It supports multilateral \n     cooperation as an alternative to unilateral U.S. sanctions. \n     It seeks to promote U.S. economic growth through trade and to \n     maintain America's reputation as a reliable supplier. It \n     opposes boycotts and use of agricultural embargoes as a \n     foreign policy weapon. It urges that economic sanctions be \n     targeted as narrowly as possible, to minimize harm to \n     innocent people or to humanitarian activities.\n       Section 4: Definitions. This section defines ``unilateral \n     economic sanction'' as any restriction or condition on \n     economic activity with respect to a foreign country or entity \n     imposed for reasons of foreign policy or national security. \n     This definition excludes multilateral sanctions, where other \n     countries have agreed to adopt ``substantially equivalent'' \n     measures. The definition also excludes U.S. trade laws, \n     Jackson-Vanik, and munitions list controls. This section also \n     defines the terms ``national emergency,'' ``agricultural \n     commodity,'' ``appropriate committees,'' and ``contract \n     sanctity.''\n       Section 5: Guidelines for Unilateral Economic Sanctions \n     Legislation. This section provides that any bill or joint \n     resolution imposing or authorizing a unilateral economic \n     sanction should state the U.S. foreign policy or national \n     security objective, sunset after two years unless \n     specifically reauthorized, protect contract sanctity, provide \n     Presidential authority to adjust or waive the sanction in the \n     national interest, target the sanction as narrowly as \n     possible against the parties responsible for the offending \n     conduct, and provide for expanded export promotion if \n     sanctions target a major export market for American farmers.\n       Section 6: Requirements for Report Accompanying the Bill. \n     The committee reporting sanctions legislation shall request \n     reports from the President and Secretary of Agriculture. \n     These reports shall be included in the committee report. If \n     the legislation does not meet any Section 5 guideline, the \n     committee report shall explain why not.\n       The President's report shall contain an assessment of the \n     likelihood that the proposed sanction will achieve its stated \n     objective within a reasonable time. It must weigh the likely \n     foreign policy, national security, economic, and humanitarian \n     benefits against the costs of acting unilaterally. The report \n     will also assess alternatives, such as prior diplomatic and \n     other U.S. steps and comparable multilateral measures.\n       The Secretary of Agriculture's report shall assess the \n     likely extent of the proposed legislation in terms of market \n     share in affected countries, the likelihood that U.S. \n     agricultural exports will be affected on the reputation of \n     U.S. farmers as reliable suppliers.\n       Section 6 also considers unilateral sanctions as unfunded \n     federal mandates for purposes of the Unfunded Mandates Act. \n     The Congressional Budget Office shall assess the likely \n     short- and long-term cost of the proposed sanctions to the \n     U.S. economy.\n       Section 7: Requirements for Executive Action. The President \n     may impose a unilateral sanction no less than 60 days after \n     announcing his intention to do so, during which time he shall \n     consult with Congressional committees and publish a notice in \n     the Federal Register seeking public comment. Any Executive \n     sanction must meet the same guidelines that Section 5 applies \n     to the Congress and must, in addition, include a clear \n     finding that the sanction is likely to achieve a specific \n     U.S. foreign policy or national security objective within a \n     reasonable--and specified--period of time.\n       Section 7 also requires--prior to the imposition of a \n     unilateral sanction--the President and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture to provide to the appropriate Congressional \n     committees reports that contain the same assessment as \n     required in the reports described in Section 6.

If the President acts on an \n     emergency basis, the waived requirements must be met within \n     sixty days. Finally, the President shall establish an \n     interagency Sanctions Review Committee to improve \n     coordination of U.S. policy regarding unilateral sanctions.\n       Section 8: Annual Report.

The \n     U.S. International Trade Commission shall report to the \n     Congress on the costs, individually and in the aggregate, of \n     all unilateral economic sanctions in effect under U.S. law, \n     regulation, or Executive order, including the impact on U.S. \n     competitiveness.\n\n[[Page S12003]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Hollings, Mr. Breaux, and Mr. \n        Gorton):\n  S. 1415. A bill to reform and restructure the processes by which \ntobacco products are manufactured, marketed, and distributed, to \nprevent the use of tobacco products by minors, to redress the adverse \nhealth effects of tobacco use, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n                  the universal tobacco settlement act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nUniversal Tobacco Settlement Act. This bill is cosponsored by the \nCommerce Committee Ranking Member Senator Hollings, Senator Gorton, and \nSenator Breaux.\n  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today is the legislative \nversion of the Universal Tobacco Settlement agreed upon by the \nattorneys general and the tobacco companies. We hope it will serve as \nthe basis of discussion and amendment here in the Senate.\n  I want briefly to discuss what this bill is and is not. It is the \nbasis for hearings, discussion, and amendment. After this bill is \nintroduced, I will ask consent to have it jointly referred to various \ncommittees of jurisdiction for consideration. As the chairman of the \nCommerce Committee, I intend to hold extensive hearings on this bill \nand use it as the vehicle for amendment.\n  First, let me emphasize that this legislation was drafted by Senate \nlegislative counsel who was requested to write a bill that would \nimplement and mirror the universal tobacco agreement without any \ndirection or input from Members and without any alteration from the \nagreement.\n  The substance of the bill is not perfect, complete, comprehensive, or \nlegislation that could ever be signed into law without considerable \ndebate and amendments. None of the cosponsors endorse this bill as \nbeing the answer to our Nation's problem with tobacco-related death and \nillness. But it can and should serve as a basis to began negotiations \nbetween all concerned parties.\n  The bipartisan group of attorneys general and the tobacco companies \ndeserve praise for developing this language. I know it was not easy. \nBut much more needs to be done. The Universal Tobacco Settlement \nAgreement presents more questions than it answers. That is why we must \nmove the legislative process forward and begin debating substantive \nlanguage.\n  I had hoped that the administration would send the Congress \nlegislation in this area. I would have liked for the Congress to begin \nconsidering the proposals developed and advocated by the White House. \nUnfortunately, the White House chose not to take such action. As a \nresult, I have chosen to begin this discussion with attorneys general \nagreement.\n  There has been one addition to the settlement developed by the \nattorneys general. The universal tobacco settlement did not address the \nissue of tobacco farmers and the communities whose existence and \neconomy depends on the growing of tobacco. To address this concern, a \nnew title IX has been added to the bill. The text of title IX is the \nlanguage of S. 1310, legislation introduced by Senator Ford. It is my \nhope that with the addition of this language to the bill, we can begin \nthe comprehensive debate necessary on this subject.\n  Mr. President, let there be no mistake, the Senate takes its role in \nthis matter very seriously. Millions of lives have been lost and \nmillions more will follow. Every day 3,000 young adults and children \nbegin smoking. We cannot and should not allow this to continue. With \nthe introduction of this bill we will begin this debate and I am \nhopeful that by early next year we can move forward on the floor on \nthis matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1416. A bill to amend Federal election laws to repeal the public \nfinancing of national political party conventions and Presidential \nelections and spending limits on Presidential election campaigns, to \nrepeal the limits on coordinated expenditures by political parties, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n              the presidential campaign reform act of 1997\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the Governmental Affairs hearings \ninvestigating the 1996 Presidential election affirmed what \nknowledgeable observers have contended for years--that the Presidential \ncampaign finance system of spending limits and taxpayer funding is a \nfraud.\n  Not soon forgotten will be the seamy videos of the White House coffee \nfundraisers in which the President was caught on tape extolling the \nvirtues of circumventing the Presidential system's contribution and \nspending limits, via soft money contributions to the DNC--that once \nproud institution hijacked by the Clinton-Gore campaign bent on \nreelection in 1996. The 1996 Clinton-Gore reelection campaign took \ncampaign finance chicanery to new heights, or lows, depending on your \nperspective.\n  Mr. President, I am no fan of spending limits so am not without \nsympathy for those who must campaign under them. The Presidential \nsystem, while technically voluntary, presents a Hobson's choice to \nthose contemplating a campaign. Candidates can choose between \ncompliance with arbitrary and severe spending limits, burdensome \nregulatory requirements, and the prospect of years of FEC audits or \ntrying to mount a credible campaign under the severe constraints of \noutdated contribution limits.\n  It's difficult enough to mount a statewide Senate campaign with \nindividual contributions limited to $1,000 a pop. Conducting a \nnationwide effort under the same contribution limits must be a \nnightmare. It requires, at the least, a Herculean effort, unless a \ncandidate has the good fortune to have a fortune sufficient to bankroll \ntheir own campaign out of their own pocket. So I might be inclined to \ncut the President and Vice President some slack for this particular \nmalfeasance--they have so many fundraising misdeeds to account for this \none got lost in the shuffle until recently. I might cut them some slack \nif they were not such shameless hypocrites, portraying themselves as \nvictims of the system and America's biggest fans of reform, when they \naren't pleading incompetence.\n  ``William J. Clinton'' signed a letter, addressed to the Chairman of \nthe Federal Election Commission, on October 13, 1995, in which the \nPresident agreed to comply with the Presidential system's limits in \nexchange for which the Clinton-Gore campaign would receive taxpayer \ndollars. All told, the Clinton-Gore campaign received $75 million for \nthe primary and general elections in 1996. The Democratic National \nCommittee received over $12 million for its convention extravaganza in \nChicago. It was a lie.\n  The Clinton-Gore campaign took the money--$75 million from the U.S. \nTreasury--and never had any intention of confining their campaign to \nthe spending limits. The Presidential system, from its inception, has \nbeen a bad joke on the American taxpayers, limiting neither spending, \nnor so-called ``special interests,'' as its creators--self-styled \nreformers--said it would.\n  Unwilling to concede that their utopian reform vision has become a \ntaxpayer-funded debacle worthy only of dismantling, the inside-the-\nbeltway reform industry agitates instead for even more restrictions--on \nthe party committees and independent groups. It would be like putting \nband-aids on the Titanic, and unconstitutional, to boot.\n  The reform dream is the taxpayers' nightmare. Over $1 billion has \nbeen squandered on the Presidential system. It is an entitlement \nprogram for politicians. And a boondoggle for the likes of fringe \ncandidates such as Lenora Fulani and Lyndon LaRouche who have flocked \nto the Presidential campaign entitlement program, like moths to a \nflame.\n  Even Ross Perot's Reform Party has gotten into the act--as the Texas \nbillionaire received $30 million from the U.S. Treasury last year for \nhis campaign. An irony is that the Perot Reform Party's partaking of \ntaxpayer funds from the Presidential system coffers will be the straw \nthat breaks the camel's back in 2000. The Reform Party is going to \nbleed the reform dream dry if it takes what it will be entitled to in \nprimary matching, convention, and general election funding. This is the \ngist of a recent FEC staff report on the fund's prospects for the 2000 \ncampaign.\n  At the outset of the 2000 Presidential primaries, the Presidential \nfund will be so near bankruptcy that candidates will be able to receive \nonly a tiny fraction of what they are entitled to. FEC\n\n[[Page S12004]]\n\nstaff predict this dearth of funding will prompt some candidates to opt \nout of the Presidential spending limit system altogether. Where would \nsuch an exodus leave the competitive field? The candidates would still \nbe stuck with the quarter-century old contribution limits, bestowing a \ntremendous advantage on those select few who have a huge donor base \nfrom which to draw or the wherewithal to fund a campaign out of their \nown pocket.\n  This is a very real campaign finance crisis--a Presidential system on \nthe edge of oblivion and a wide-open contest looming in the year 2000. \nSo I rise today to introduce a bill to reform the Presidential system--\nthe object of so much scandal and scorn. This reform legislation would \nrepeal the Presidential system's spending limits and taxpayer funding. \nIt would save the American taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars \nevery election. To compensate for the loss of taxpayer funding and make \nthe system more realistic, the contribution limit for Presidential \ncandidates would be adjusted to $10,000, up from the current $1,000. \nThe PAC limit would also be adjusted up to $10,000.\n  It would also strengthen the political parties by updating the hard \nmoney contribution limits regulating donations to them. These limits \nare a quarter-century old and long overdue for adjustments. Candidates \nand political parties should not be shackled in the year 2000 with \ncirca-1970's contribution limits. The bill would also do what the \nSupreme Court talked about doing in the 1996 Colorado decision and is \nlikely to do in the near future: abolish the coordinated spending \nlimit. This arbitrary restriction on what parties can do in \ncoordination with their nominees is absurd. The parties prefer to \noperate in hard money over soft money. These reforms would facilitate \nthat activity.\n  Mr. President, these are commonsense reforms that would enhance \ncompetition and increase accountability in Presidential elections. In \nthe interest of heading off a complete breakdown of the Presidential \nsystem in 2000, I urge Senators to step away from the traditional \nreform paradigm and join me in this effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Craig, and Ms. Landrieu):\n  S. 1418. A bill to promote the research, identification, assessment, \nexploration, and development of methane hydrate resources, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n\n        the methane hydrate research and development act of 1997\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senators Craig and \nLandrieu, I am introducing the Methane Hydrate Research and Development \nAct of 1997.\n  Methane hydrate is a methane-bearing, ice-like substance that occurs \nin abundance in marine sediments. It is a crystalline solid of methane \nmolecules surrounded by a structure of water molecules.\n  Methane hydrates are stable at moderately high pressures and low \ntemperatures and contain large quantities of methane. One unit volume \nof methane hydrate contains more than 160 volumes of methane at \nstandard temperature and pressure.\n  Methane hydrates are found in deep ocean sediments. Significant \nquantities are also found in the permafrost of Alaska, Canada, and \nSiberia.\n  Despite their potential as an energy resource, methane hydrates have \nnot received the attention they deserve. We are only beginning to \nunderstand the magnitude of this potential resource. The amount of \nmethane sequestered in gas hydrates is enormous. Worldwide estimates \nrange from 100,000 trillion cubic feet to 270 million trillion cubic \nfeet. Locations of known methane hydrate deposits within the Untied \nStates include the Arctic, the seabed adjacent to northern California, \nthe Gulf of Mexico, and the Eastern Seaboard.\n  A conservative estimate of deposits under U.S. jurisdiction is 2,700 \ntrillion cubic feet to seven million trillion cubic feet of gas. A \nrecent U.S. Geological Survey analysis indicates the presence of over \n500 trillion cubic feet of methane at the Black Ridge site off the \ncoast of Carolinas alone. When you consider that current U.S. \nconsumption is less than 25 trillion cubic feet of natural gas per \nyear, you begin to appreciate the magnitude of this energy resource.\n  The U.S. energy outlook is perilous at best. Our dependence on \nimported oil is steadily increasing. Soon we will import over 60 \npercent of the oil we consume. Air pollution is a persistent problem. \nWe are spending enormous resources to improve air quality. Global \nclimate change poses a looming challenge. With these concerns in mind, \nit is easy to recognize the importance of methane hydrates.\n  Methane hydrates are a strategic resource because they contain huge \namounts of methane in a concentrated form. Extracted methane from \nhydrates represents an extraordinarily large energy resource and \npetrochemical feedstock. Methane is less polluting than other \nhydrocarbons because of its higher hydrogen-to-carbon ratio. Given the \nconcerns about global climate change, a transition to methane as an \nenergy resource is an attractive solution.\n  The U.S. is not doing enough to explore this viable energy source. \nOther countries, primarily Japan and India, have aggressive programs to \ndevelop methane hydrates. Japan has launched an exploration project for \nmethane hydrates in its surrounding waters. The Japanese National Oil \nCorporation is conducting a seismic survey off Hokkaido Island and will \ndrill test wells in two locations in 1999. Commercial production is \nplanned for 2010. About six trillion cubic meters of methane hydrates \ncan be found in the seabed near Japan. Recovery of one-tenth of this \nreserve could yield about 100 years supply of natural gas for Japan.\n  As part of its plan to boost natural gas resources, the Oil Industry \nDevelopment Board of India has earmarked $56 million for a program of \nmethane hydrates research and development. We cannot be left behind \nthese and other nations in the race to develop this important energy \nresource.\n  Science News recently published an article summarizing the hopes and \nhazards associated with methane hydrates. Mr. President, I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of this article be printed in the Record.\n  This is an exciting area of research and of new knowledge. It has an \nenormous payoff, not only for our energy security, but also for the \nglobal environment.\n  My bill establishes a small research and development program with the \npotential for major payback. It would direct the Department of Energy \nto conduct research and development in collaboration with the Naval \nResearch Laboratory and the U.S. Geological Survey. The Secretary of \nEnergy would also consult with other Federal and State agencies, \nindustry, and academia. It directs the Department to conduct research \non, and identify, explore, assess, and develop methane hydrate \nresources as a source of energy. It also directs the Department to \ndevelop technologies needed to develop methane resources in an \nenvironmentally sound manner. It provides for research to develop safe \nmeans of transportation and storage of methane produced from methane \nhydrates. To alleviate the concerns related to releases of methane, the \nlegislation directs the Department to undertake research to assess and \nmitigate hydrate degassing, both natural and that associated with \ncommercial development. It requires the Department to develop \ntechnologies to reduce the risk of drilling through the gas hydrates. \nAnd finally, it provides for the training of scientists and engineers \nthat would be needed for this new and exciting field on endeavor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1418\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as are \n     necessary to carry out this Act.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            [From the Science News, Vol. 150, Nov. 9, 1996]\n\n                     The Mother Lode of Natural Gas\n\n                        (By Richard McNastersky)\n\n       For kicks, oceanographer William P. Dillon likes to \n     surprise visitors to his lab by taking ordinary-looking ice \n     balls and setting them on fire.\n       ``They're easy to light. You just put a match to them and \n     they will go,'' says Dillon, a researcher with the U.S. \n     Geological Survey (USGS) in Woods Hole, Mass.\n       If the truth be told, this is not typical ice. The prop in \n     Dillon's show is a curious and poorly known structure called \n     methane hydrate. Unlike ordinary water ice, methane hydrate \n     consists of single molecules of natural gas trapped within \n     crystalline cages formed by frozen water molecules. Although \n     chemists first discovered gas hydrates in the early part of \n     the 19th century, geoscientists have only recently started \n     documenting their existence in underground deposits and \n     exploring their importance as potential fuel.\n       Late last year a team of oceanographers conducted the most \n     in-depth investigation of methane hydrates to date by \n     drilling into an extensive accumulation beneath the seabed \n     off the coast of the southeastern United States. The results \n     of this research, which are now beginning to appear in the \n     scientific literature, seem to bolster extremely sketchy \n     estimates made years ago about the vastness of the hydrate \n     resource.\n       ``It turns out there is a tremendous amount of gas down \n     there,'' says Charles Paull, a marine geologist at the \n     University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and a leader of \n     the recent drilling expedition. ``It shores up the fact that \n     these are large reserves and makes it increasingly important \n     that they get assessed in terms of whether they are energy-\n     producing deposits or not.''\n       At the same time, scientists wonder whether this resource \n     also has a dark side. ``There have been extremely rapid \n     changes in climate in the past. Some think that these were \n     caused by methane released from methane hydrate,'' says \n     Dillon.\n       Despite their potential importance, methane hydrates have \n     evaded scientific scrutiny until now, largely because they \n     are extremely difficult to study. They exist only where high \n     pressures and low temperatures squeeze water and methane into \n     a solid form.\n       Most known deposits of methane hydrate lie below the \n     seafloor in regions that slope from the continents to the \n     deep ocean basins thousands of meters underwater. Marine \n     geologists have tentatively identified deposits off the \n     coasts of Costa Rica, New Jersey, Oregon, Japan, India, and \n     hundreds of other sites around the globe. Petroleum companies \n     have also encountered hydrates while drilling through Arctic \n     pernafrost in Siberia, Alaska, and Canada.\n       Like vampires, hydrates disintegrate quickly if pulled from \n     their dark lair. When researchers on the recent drilling \n     expedition hauled up cores of sediment from the ocean floor, \n     the drastic reduction in pressure caused much of the hydrate \n     to melt before it even reached the ship. Without unusual \n     precautions, any remaining hydrate fizzed away when the \n     scientists cut open the core.\n       ``Gas hydrates have largely escaped traditional geologic \n     observation because gas hydrates and humans are sort of \n     incompatible. The gas hydrates decompose under the conditions \n     [in which] people traditionally analyze cores. Conversely, \n     humans have no experience in operating in the conditions \n     where gas hydrates are stable. We die under the conditions of \n     gas hydrate stability,'' says Paull.\n       Oceanographers first drilled through methane hydrates \n     unintentionally, on an expedition in 1970. Although that \n     encounter was uneventful, research drilling cruises purposely \n     avoided suspected hydrate deposits for 2 decades afterward, \n     fearing they might hit an overpressureized pocket of gas, \n     which could blast away the drilling equipment. Concerns over \n     pressurized gas gradually diminished, and mounting scientific \n     curiosity emboldened researchers to try boring through more \n     hydrate fields. Starting in 1992, the International Ocean \n     Drilling Program (ODP) intentionally breached hydrate \n     deposits several times without incident.\n       On the recent expedition, Paull and his colleagues drilled \n     at three sites along the Blake Ridge, a large, submerged \n     promontory 330 kilometers off the southeast coast of the \n     United States. Working in water depths of 2,800 meters, the \n     researchers penetrated 700 meters below the seafloor with \n     a hollow drill bit that cuts away a core of sediment the \n     diameter of a soda can.\n       The investigators had to take special precautions to \n     prevent losing methane-hydrate during the 10 minutes it too \n     to haul fresh sections of core up from the ocean bottom. At \n     various depths, they sealed small bits of core in pressurized \n     barrels, thereby containing the gas until the core reached \n     shipboard laboratories. These samples provided the first \n     direct measurements of how much methane-hydrate exists at \n     different depths beneath the seafloor.\n       ``The amount of hydrate down there is much higher than has \n     previously been estimated says Paull. ``It was not uncommon \n     to go from 10 liters up to 30 liters of gas per liter of \n     sediment.''\n       The researchers also measured, for the first time, large \n     amounts of free gas trapped beneath the frozen hydra-\n     deposits. The volume of gas was far more than expected, \n     exceeding even the amount within the frozen layer, says \n     Paull.\n       Although the exact origin of hydrate remains unknown, Paull \n     and others suspect that bacteria within the sediment consume \n     rich organic material and generate methane gas. At a certain \n     depth beneath the seafloor, the low temperatures and high \n     pressures ensnare the gas within the frozen hydrate \n     structures. Methane below the hydrate layer remains in \n     gaseous form because the temperatures there are too high to \n     support freezing.\n       Conventional deposits of methane, a natural gas, form \n     through a different process, when seafloor sediments are \n     buried far deeper. Exposed to much higher temperatures, the \n     organic material the sediments simmers until it transforms \n     into petroleum and eventually methane.\n\n[[Page S12006]]\n\n       Nearly a decade ago, several researchers independently \n     tried to estimate how much methane exists in hydrate \n     deposits. Because of the scarcity of direct hyro-measurements \n     at the time, the estimate rested on indirect seismic studies \n     which probe the ocean bottom sediments with blasts of sound \n     that reflect off hidden layers.\n       These studies suggested that global hydrate deposits \n     contain approximately 10,000 gigatons, or 10 tons, of carbon. \n     That number represents double the combined amount in all \n     reserves of coal, oil, and conventional natural gas.\n       The newly emerging evidence, supports these rough \n     approximations, says Gordon J. MacDonald, one of the \n     scientists who made the calculations in the 1980s. ``All \n     these estimates are quite uncertain. But it remains \n     abundantly clear that methane hydrates contain the largest \n     store of carbon that we know about that is underground,'' \n     says MacDonald, who now directs the International Institute \n     for Applied Systems Analysis in Laxenburg, Austria.\n       In fact, hydrates may be more widespread than previously \n     thought. The recent ODP expedition found hydrates in regions \n     that lack the seismically reflective layers usually used to \n     identify potential deposits, the team reports in the Sept. 27 \n     Science.\n       ``Given their worldwide distribution and their very large \n     quantities, they make a very attractive energy source, \n     provided that one can bring the gas up at somewhere near \n     market price,'' MacDonald says. The cost of accessing \n     hydrates has served as a barrier in the past, but some \n     energy-hungry nations lacking conventional fossil fuels are \n     extremely interested in future use of hydrates.\n       Japan plans to drill exploratory wells in the next few \n     years, first on land in Alaska and then in Japanese waters. \n     The Japanese National Oil Company is currently negotiating \n     with the U.S. and Canadian governments to conduct \n     experimental drilling of hydrate deposits near Prudhoe Bay, \n     Alaska in early 1998. They hope to have more success than the \n     nations and commercial companies that tried to extract frozen \n     methane in Canada, Alaska and Siberia during the 1970s and \n     1980s.\n       In nature, methane hydrates are fickle molecules, liable to \n     melt whenever the pressure drops slightly or the temperature \n     creeps upward. Evidence of this instability pockmarks the \n     ocean floor along the Blake Ridge. Marine geologists have \n     identified numerous craters there that apparently formed when \n     hydrates melted, releasing methane gas.\n       ``The Blake Ridge is a pressure cooker, over geological \n     time. The gas and fluids come up and blow thought the \n     sediments. We can see depressions 500 to 700 meters wide and \n     20 to 30 meters deep,'' says Dillon.\n       In other cases, melting at the base of the hydrate layer \n     has destabilized seafloor slopes, leading to massive \n     submarine landslides. Researchers have suggested hydrate \n     weakness as a factor behind landslides off Alaska, the U.S. \n     Atlantic coast, British Columbia, Norway, and Africa, says \n     Keith A. Kvenvolden of the USGS in Menlo Park, Calif.\n       Such inherent instability could spell problems for future \n     drilling platforms resting on top of hydrate-rich deposits. \n     If the collapses are large enough, they could also produce \n     the destructive waves called tsunamis that race across ocean \n     basins.\n       Hydrates may exert their greatest impact through their \n     indirect links to climate. Because methane is a powerful \n     greenhouse gas--about 10 times as strong as carbon dioxide--\n     massive melting of hydrates and the ensuing release of \n     methane gas could raise Earth's surface temperature.\n       James P. Kennett of the University of California, Santa \n     Barbara has recently discovered intriguing evidence \n     implicating methane hydrates as an instigator of climate \n     change. Sediments off the California coast show signs that \n     carbon isotopic ratios in the ocean shifted quite \n     dramatically and quickly at several times during the last \n     70,000 years. Because methane has a distinctive isotopic \n     fingerprint that matches the shifts, Kennett suggests that \n     large volumes of methane must have poured into the ocean at \n     these times.\n       In this theory, the methane came from hydrates that melted \n     when ocean waters warmed slightly. The liberation of so much \n     methane over a few decades would have caused widespread \n     warming that affected the entire globe. As supporting \n     evidence, Kennett notes that the ocean's isotopic shifts \n     indeed coincide with well-known Dansgaard-Oeschger episodes \n     when Earth's ice age climate went suddenly warm.\n       ``Until now, [hydrates] haven't really entered into \n     discussions of climate change. They have been almost \n     completely ignored. Until the beginning of this year, I had \n     not even considered them. But I'm now convinced that they are \n     of great importance to the global environment and have been \n     for billions of years,'' says Kennett. He presented his \n     findings in September at a gas hydrate conference in Ghent, \n     Belgium.\n       Kvenvolden has proposed a different mechanism that might \n     have released hydrates at the end of the last ice age. As the \n     great blanket of continental ice melted at that time, global \n     sea levels swelled by more than 90 meters, submerging many \n     Arctic regions where hydrate layers exist. The relatively \n     warm ocean water would have melted the hydrates, unleashing \n     tremendous amounts of methane into the atmosphere, Kvenvolden \n     believes.\n       The same rationale could apply to the modern world. Sea \n     levels are currently rising slowly, at a rate of a few \n     centimeters per decade. Projections suggest that they will \n     rise even faster in the future because of the climatic \n     warming caused by greenhouse gas pollution. At the same time, \n     ocean temperatures are expected to creep upward.\n       ``If you reason that hydrates were important in climate \n     change in the past, there is no reason they wouldn't be \n     important in the future,'' says Kvenvolden. Indeed, some \n     scientists speculate that melting methane hydrates could \n     greatly exacerbate global warming.\n       For now, though, Kvenvolden and others remain unsure \n     exactly what role hydrates have played in past climate \n     changes. Lacking this knowledge, they say it is impossible to \n     predict how hydrates will behave in the future.\n       A greater understanding of hydrates and their importance \n     will come as oceanographers tap deposits in other areas of \n     the world, testing whether the lessons learned on the Blake \n     Ridge apply elsewhere. Scientists are also creating synthetic \n     hydrates in the laboratory (SN:10/19/96, p. 252). By \n     squeezing methane and water in a pressurized apparatus, \n     Dillon and his colleagues can not only gauge how hydrates \n     weaken seafloor sediments but also improve seismic methods \n     for detecting hydrates.\n       When the experiments are over, the remaining synthetic \n     hydrates could have other uses. ``I hadn't really thought of \n     it before, but you could try cooking with them'' says Dillon, \n     ``I wouldn't want to plan a major meal, but you could \n     probably scramble an egg on it.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1420. A bill to amend the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act of 1996 to provide for full reimbursement of States \nand localities for costs related to providing emergency medical \ntreatment to individuals injured while entering the United States \nillegally; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n\n THE ILLEGAL ALIEN EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES REIMBURSEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am offering legislation with Senator \nKyl as original cosponsor, a legislation which provides full \nreimbursement to state and local counties for costs incurred for \nemergency medical services and ambulatory services provided to \nundocumented aliens injured during a pursuit by border patrol or under \nthe custody of federal, state, or local authorities.\n  This legislation: Authorizes full reimbursement for emergency medical \ncosts, including ambulatory services for illegal aliens who are injured \nduring illegal crossings at land and sea ports, or during a pursuit by \nborder patrol, or while in custody of federal, state, or local \nauthorities;\n  Authorizes up to $18 million per year for the next 4 years from a \nseparate account under the Attorney General to reimburse states and \nlocalities for emergency medical services provided to illegal aliens.\n  Requires the Attorney General to submit a written report to Senate \nand House Judiciary Committees on the policy and practice, including \ncustody practice, of the border patrol by March 1, 1998.\n  Requires annual report by the Attorney General to Senate and House \nJudiciary and Appropriations Committees on the implementation of this \nbill.\n  INS reports show that in FY96, 1.65 million illegal aliens were \napprehended, of which 97% or 1.6 million apprehensions were made at the \nSouthwest Border. INS also reports that more than 300,000 illegal \naliens come into the country every year and in FY97, over 111,000 \ncriminal and other illegal aliens were put through formal deportation \nproceedings.\n  With increased focus on apprehending illegal aliens at the 140 mile \nstretch of our Southwest border, recent reports also show increases in \nunreimbursed emergency medical service cost of illegal aliens to state \nand local county hospitals.\n  The California State Auditor recently released a report which charged \nthat San Diego alone incurred up to $8.1 million in unreimbursed \ncharges in emergency medical service for illegal aliens between January \n1996 and May 1997. The Auditor estimates that San Diego hospitals \nincurred from $4.9 million to $8.1 million in unreimbursed emergency \nmedical services and ambulatory services for up to 1074 illegal aliens \nduring the seventeen month period. The unreimbursed medical service \ncosts include hospital care, costs incurred for paramedics and air \ntransportations, physicians, surgeons and laboratories. These \nuncompensated services, which hospitals and other emergency service \nproviders are required to\n\n[[Page S12007]]\n\nprovide under California law, were provided to illegal aliens who were \ninjured during illegal crossings at the border and while escaping \nborder patrol pursuits.\n\n  The Sacramento Bee recently reported the following:\n\n       Every time a Border patrol chase results in injuries, San \n     Diego area hospitals provide `free' care to those injured... \n     (For instance), medical care for Fransciso Quintera--who was \n     struck by a car while fleeing Border patrol agents--cost UCSD \n     Medical Center over $1 million in uncompensated expenses. In \n     one recent vehicle chase, a van loaded with illegal \n     immigrants crashed while evading the Border Patrol, costing \n     Scripps Hospital $200,000 and Mercy Hospital $100,000 in \n     uncompensated care.\n\n  In the 1996 Immigration Act, Congress acknowledged the huge cost \nshift to state and local county hospitals in unreimbursed cost for \nemergency medical services provided to illegal aliens by authorizing \nfull reimbursement for emergency Medicaid and ambulatory services.\n  However, the $25 million appropriated annually over the next 4 years \nunder the Balance Budget Act for emergency Medicaid for illegal aliens \nis insufficient to cover the full cost of emergency medical services \nfor illegal aliens nationwide, where high immigrant States like \nCalifornia, Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey, Arizona and \nMassachusetts end up picking up the responsibility for caring for the \ninjured illegal aliens.\n  In fact, for fiscal year 1998, there are no appropriations for \nreimbursement for emergency ambulatory services, as authorized by the \n1996 Immigration Act. Instead, Congress only requires INS to perform a \npilot project in Nogales, Arizona and report its findings to Congress.\n  Appropriating $25 million over the next 4 years and performing a \npilot project in Nogales, Arizona is not enough to cover the millions \nof dollars high immigrant States like California incur every year in \nunreimbursed emergency medical and ambulatory costs for illegal aliens \ninjured at the border or during a border patrol pursuit.\n  Mr. President, time has come for the Federal Government to take full \nresponsibility for the cost associated with providing emergency medical \nservices, including ambulatory services, for illegal aliens and lifting \nthe fiscal burden on State and local counties.\n  Thank you and I urge all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1420\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \nadditional support for and to expand clinical research programs, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.\n\n\n             THE CLINICAL RESEARCH ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the promise of new biomedical research is \nboundless. As impressive as the progress of the past has been, it pales \nin comparison to future opportunities. We stand on the threshold of \nstunning advances in medicine. Supporting biomedical research is among \nthe wisest possible investments we can make in our Nation's future.\n  Support for clinical research is central to biomedical research. \nClinical research is essential for the advancement of scientific \nknowledge and the development of cures and improvement treatments of \ndisease. Tremendous advances in basic biological research are opening \ndoors to new insights into all aspects of medicine. As a result, there \nare extraordinary opportunities for cutting-edge clinical research to \ntranslate breakthroughs in the laboratory to the bedsides of patients.\n  Improvements in patient care and diagnosis and prevention of disease \ndepend upon clinical research that brings basic research discoveries to \nthe bedside. In addition, the results of clinical research are \nincorporated by industry and developed into new drugs, vaccines, and \nhealth care products. These developments strengthen the economy and \ncreate jobs.\n  Advances in biomedical research may also prove to be the most \neffective way to reduce the country's health care costs in the long \nrun. As our Nation's demographics change and the baby boomers move \ntoward retirement, financing Medicare has become an increasing concern. \nA Duke University study released earlier this year suggests that a \nsmall improvement in the disability rate of older Americans can bring \nlarge cost savings for Medicare. Investment in medical research will \nresult in healthier older Americans and lower costs to Medicare.\n  Despite these clear benefits, clinical research is in crisis. The \nresources dedicated to such research, particularly at the NIH, have \nfallen to a level that places the United States at a serious \ninternational disadvantage.\n  Studies by the Institute of Medicine, the National Research Council, \nthe National Academy of Sciences, and the National Institutes of Health \nhave highlighted significant problems in the Nation's clinical research \nefforts. A 1994 report by the Institute of Medicine, for example, \ncharacterized the current level of training and support for health \nresearch professionals as ``fragmented, frequently undervalued and \npotentially underfunded.''\n  The legislation we are introducing today seeks to enhance support of \nclinical research by addressing the issues that have caused this crisis \nin clinical research.\n\n  First, it will implement the longstanding recommendations regarding \nthe merit review process for clinical research proposals at NIH.\n  Second, it will provide greater support for general clinical research \ncenters.\n  Third, it will create new opportunities to pursue clinical research. \nA Clinical Research Career Enhancement Award will enable a clinical \nresearcher to pursue research projects with a mentor prior to \nindependent pursuit of research. For more established researchers, the \nInnovative Medical Science Award will provide funds to apply basic \nscientific discoveries to medical treatment. Both awards will generate \nthe protected time which is so valuable to physician-scientists.\n  Fourth, the bill provides support for individuals seeking advanced \ndegrees in clinical investigation.\n  Fifth, it expands the Loan Repayment Program for clinical researchers \nto encourage the recruitment of new investigators.\n\n[[Page S12008]]\n\n  A solid infrastructure is essential to any research program. In \nclinical research, that infrastructure is provided by the general \nclinical research centers at academic health centers throughout the \ncountry. Support for these centers was once largely provided by \nacademic health centers. Today, academic health centers provide \napproximately $1 billion annually from clinical revenues to support \nclinical research. However, academic health centers are confronted with \nheavy competition from nonteaching institutions and are increasingly \nobligated to emphasize patient care over research to minimize costs. In \nthe face of these changes, clinical researchers have become more \ndependent on NIH for infrastructure support.\n  In spite of the expanding need, NIH support for the general clinical \nresearch centers has barely kept up with inflation. The centers are \nconsistently funded at 75 percent of the funding level recommended by \nthe NIH's own Advisory Council. This level is not adequate for the \nbackbone of the Nation's clinical research efforts. Clearly we need to \ndo more.\n  The number of physicians choosing careers in clinical investigation \nis in serious decline. Between 1985 and 1997, the number of physicians \nincreased by 34 percent, while the number of physicians pursuing \nresearch decreased by 37 percent. Fewer young physicians are choosing \ncareers in research, and we need to reverse that decline.\n  Student debt is a major barrier to pursuing clinical research. Young \nphysicians graduate from medical school with an average debt burden of \n$80,000. Limited financial opportunity in clinical research has caused \nmany young physicians to choose more lucrative medical practice. NIH \nhas acknowledged this problem and has established a loan repayment \nsubsidy to encourage the recruitment of clinical researchers to NIH. \nOur legislation expands the current program.\n  Many of today's young clinical investigators are unfamiliar with \nresearch methodology. Dr. Harold Varmus, the Director of NIH, has \narticulated the need for individuals seeking careers in clinical \nresearch to have access to clinical research-specific training programs \nafter they graduate from medical school. The NIH already supports a \npostgraduate training for those pursuing basic research. This \nlegislation will support a comparable program for clinical \ninvestigators.\n  Clinical researchers at academic health centers are also increasingly \nurged to turn their attention away from research to generate greater \nrevenues. This loss of protected time has a significant adverse impact \non their ability to compete for NIH research grants. This problem is \nparticularly difficult for young researchers still seeking mentored \nresearch experience during the early years of clinical investigation. \nThe NIH currently has awards to provide mentored career development \nexperiences for basic scientists. Our legislation creates career \ndevelopment awards to help meet this need.\n  Less than a third of all NIH grantees are physicians. Only a fraction \nof them receive awards for clinical investigation. The funding gap for \nclinical research is most severe in the earliest phases of clinical \ninvestigation, where basic scientific discoveries are tested on a small \nscale in studies involving few patients. Industry will not support such \nresearch in non-product-oriented studies and often regard such efforts \nas too speculative. The medical science awards in our bill will ensure \nfunding for these important research initiatives.\n  The need for reform of the peer review system has been documented by \nstudies by the Institute of Medicine and an outside review committee of \nthe NIH Division of Research Grants, which is responsible for the peer \nreview process. So far, their recommendations have not been \nimplemented, and the bias against clinical research persists. Our \nlegislation will implement these recommendations and provide effective \nevaluation of clinical research proposals.\n  The funds authorized by our legislation to support clinical research \ndo not target specific diseases. The funds would go to peer-reviewed \nproposals to translate basic scientific discoveries into treatment and \nprevention of disease. Without such legislation, clinical research will \ncontinue to decline to a point where advances in medicine will no \nlonger come from this country but from abroad.\n  Mr. President, our bill is supported by more than a hundred and forty \nbiomedical associations and organizations. I would like to thank the \nAmerican Federation for Medical Research for their efforts to support \nthis legislation and ask unanimous consent that the list of supporters, \nthe letters of support be and a copy of the bill be included in the \nRecord.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues as we move this \nimportant legislation through Congress.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1421\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clinical Research \n     Enhancement Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of \n     scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and \n     improved treatment for disease.\n       (2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new \n     insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, \n     creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research.\n       (3) Clinical research includes translational research which \n     is an integral part of the research process leading to \n     general human applications. It is the bridge between the \n     laboratory and new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and \n     prevention and is thus essential to progress against cancer \n     and other diseases.\n       (4) The United States will spend more than $1 trillion on \n     health care in 1997, but the Federal budget for health \n     research at the National Institutes of Health was $12.7 \n     billion, only 1 percent of that total.\n       (5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National \n     Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have \n     all addressed the current problems in clinical research.\n       (6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has \n     recognized the current problems in clinical research and has \n     through the use of an advisory committee begun to evaluate \n     these problems.\n       (7) The current level of training and support for health \n     professionals in clinical research is fragmented, frequently \n     undervalued, and potentially underfunded.\n       (8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future \n     positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and \n     ideas in the day-to-day research that constitutes the \n     scientific enterprise. Serious questions about the future of \n     life-science research are raised by the following:\n       (A) The number of young investigators applying for grants \n     dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.\n       (B) The number of federally funded research (R01) grants \n     awarded to persons under the age of 36 have decreased by 70 \n     percent from 1985 to 1993.\n       (C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise \n     funds to support their new research programs and a \n     substantial proportion of their own salaries.\n       (9) The following have been cited as reasons for the \n     decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and \n     those choosing this career path:\n       (A) A medical school graduate incurs an average debt of \n     $80,000, as reported in the Medical School Graduation \n     Questionnaire by the American Association of Medical Colleges \n     (AAMC).\n       (B) The prolonged period of clinical training required \n     increases the accumulated debt burden.\n       (C) The decreasing number of mentors and role models.\n       (D) The perceived instability of funding from the National \n     Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies.\n       (E) The almost complete absence of clinical research \n     training in the curriculum of training grant awardees.\n       (F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing difficulties \n     in maintaining a proper environment for research in a highly \n     competitive health care marketplace, which are compounded by \n     the decreased willingness of third party payers to cover \n     health care costs for patients engaged in research studies \n     and research procedures.\n       (10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were \n     established under the Office of the Director of the National \n     Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of \n     $3,000,000.\n       (11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers \n     in fiscal year 1997 equaled $153,000,000.\n       (12) In fiscal year 1997, there were 74 general clinical \n     research centers in operation, supplying patients in the \n     areas in which such centers operate with access to the most \n     modern clinical research and clinical research facilities and \n     technologies.\n       (13) The average annual amount allocated for each general \n     clinical research center is $1,900,000, establishing a \n     current funding level of 75 percent of the amounts approved \n     by the Advisory Council of the National Center for Research \n     Resources.\n\n[[Page S12009]]\n\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to provide \n     additional support for and to expand clinical research \n     programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. INCREASING THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES \n                   OF HEALTH IN CLINICAL RESEARCH.\n\n       Section 402 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. \n     282) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(l)(1) The Director of NIH shall undertake activities to \n     support and expand the involvement of the National Institutes \n     of Health in clinical research.\n       ``(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), the Director of NIH \n     shall--\n       ``(A) design test pilot projects and implement the \n     recommendations of the Division of Research Grants Clinical \n     Research Study Group and other recommendations for enhancing \n     clinical research, where applicable; and\n       ``(B) establish an intramural clinical research fellowship \n     program and a continuing education clinical research training \n     program at NIH.\n       ``(3) The Director of NIH, in cooperation with the \n     Directors of the Institutes, Centers, and Divisions of the \n     National Institutes of Health, shall support and expand the \n     resources available for the diverse needs of the clinical \n     research community, including inpatient, outpatient, and \n     critical care clinical research.\n       ``(4) The Director of NIH shall establish peer review \n     mechanisms to evaluate applications for--\n       ``(A) clinical research career enhancement awards;\n       ``(B) innovative medical science awards;\n       ``(C) graduate training in clinical investigation awards;\n       ``(D) intramural clinical research fellowships.\n\n     Such review mechanisms shall include individuals who are \n     exceptionally qualified to appraise the merits of potential \n     clinical research training and research grant proposals.''.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Federation\n\n\n                                          for Medical Research\n\n                                                 November 7, 1997.\n     Hon. Thad Cochran\n     The Honorable Edward Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Cochran and Kennedy: I write to express the \n     strong support of the American Federation for Medical \n     Research for the legislation you will introduce to enhance \n     clinical research programs at the National Institutes of \n     Health. The AFMR is a national organization of 6,000 \n     physician scientists engaged in basic, clinical, and health \n     services research. Most of our members receive NIH support \n     for their basic research but are finding it increasingly \n     difficult to obtain public or private funding for \n     translational or clinical research--studies through which \n     basic science discoveries are translated to the care of \n     patients. In the past, academic medical centers provided \n     institutional support for this research through revenues \n     generated by patient care activities. However, as the health \n     care marketplace has become increasingly competitive, \n     academic centers have all but eliminated internal subsidizes \n     clinical research or the training of clinical investigators. \n     In fact, the Association of American Medical Colleges has \n     estimated that these institutions have lost approximately \n     $800 million in annual ``purchasing power'' for research and \n     research training within their institutions. In this context, \n     the $60 million in spending entailed in your legislation \n     (representing less than one-half of one percent of the NIH \n     budget) would seem an extremely modest investment in a much-\n     needed program to reinvigorate our nation's clinical research \n     capabilities.\n       The Clinical Research Enhancement Act is a conservative \n     approach to a severe problem. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) \n     expressed alarm about the challenges confronting clinical \n     research in a 1994 report, and your bill is based on the \n     initiatives recommended by the IOM:\n       The IOM recommended that the General Clinical Research \n     Centers program be strengthened. Your bill would codify this \n     program, which has existed since the late 1950's, so that the \n     Congress will have greater discretion over GCRC funding.\n       The IOM recommended enhanced career development in clinical \n     investigation, and your bill proposes such awards.\n       The IOM noted problems with the NIH peer review of clinical \n     research. Your bill directs the NIH to improve the peer \n     review process for such research and establishes ``innovative \n     science awards'' that will be reviewed by scientists \n     knowledgeable in clinical investigation.\n       The IOM recommended programs to relieve the tuition debt of \n     physicians pursuing clinical research careers. Your bill \n     would expand an existing NIH intramural program for this \n     purpose to the extramural community.\n       The IOM recommended structured, didactic training in \n     clinical investigation. Your bill authorizes funding for \n     advanced degree (master's and Ph.D.) training in clinical \n     research as successfully initiated at several institutions \n     around the country.\n       The list of almost 150 organizations that support the \n     Clinical Research Enhancement Act indicates the consensus of \n     scientific, medical, consumer, and patient organizations that \n     steps must be taken as soon as possible to stop the \n     deterioration of the U.S. clinical research capacity, to \n     reinvigorate the clinical research programs of academic \n     medical centers, and to assure that the American people and \n     the American economy benefit from the translation of basic \n     science breakthroughs to improved clinical care and new \n     medical products. The American Federation for Medical \n     Research is pleased to have the opportunity to express its \n     strong support for your legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jeffrey Kern, MD.,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a coalition of organizations concerned about improving \n     the quality of health care, the National Health Council \n     strongly\n\n[[Page S12011]]\n\n     supports the Clinical Research Enhancement Act. As you know, \n     it has been more than three years since the Institute of \n     Medicine (IOM) documented the major challenges confronting \n     clinical research in our country. Your bill would implement a \n     number of the IOM recommendations for addressing these \n     problems. It is critically important that the NIH move \n     forward as rapidly as possible with these initiatives.\n       The NIH is the major funding source in the United States \n     for basic biomedical research. However, the major dividends \n     from this investment are discoveries that improve our ability \n     to prevent, effectively treat, and cure disease and \n     disability. The NIH must foster not only the basic research \n     that begins this process but also the translational research \n     through which a basic science discovery is applied to a \n     medical problem. There is generous industry support for \n     clinical research and clinical trials aimed at the \n     development of new products. However, private funding is \n     extremely limited for initial translational research that may \n     have little or no commercial product potential. Examples of \n     such research include studies of nutritional therapies, new \n     approaches to disease prevention, transplantation techniques, \n     behavioral interventions, and studies of off-label uses of \n     approved drugs. In the past, such research was often \n     subsidized from patient care revenues to academic medical \n     centers. However, competition in the health care marketplace \n     has begun to erode this source of funding; therefore, NIH \n     must play an expanded role in providing support for this \n     research. The Clinical Research Enhancement Act would foster \n     NIH funding opportunities for this type of research through \n     the establishment of ``innovative medical science awards.'' \n     Such studies will focus on translating basic research \n     discoveries into tools that health care professionals can use \n     to cure disease and relieve suffering.\n       In addition, we support provisions of the bill that would \n     foster opportunities for physicians to pursue careers in \n     clinical research. There is ample evidence that American \n     physicians are opting out of careers in science for a variety \n     of reasons. Steps must be taken to rebuild our nation's \n     supply of well-trained physician scientists if the United \n     States is to continue its leadership of the world in medical \n     science.\n       Finally, the bill would direct the NIH to improve the peer \n     review of patient-oriented research. Studies have documented \n     the fact that clinical research proposals are at a \n     disadvantage when reviewed by NIH study sections because of \n     NIH's primary focus on basic biomedical research. This must \n     be changed, as proposed in your bill, so that scientific \n     opportunities to improve medical care are not lost.\n       The undersigned organizations are extremely grateful for \n     your leadership in addressing the problems confronting \n     clinical research. We support your initiative to assure that \n     the NIH invests in the translational research that holds the \n     key for patients around the country who are waiting for a \n     cure.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to promote \ncompetition in the market for delivery of multichannel video \nprogramming and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n\n the federal communications commission satellite carrier oversight act\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, today I am introducing the Federal \nCommunications Commission Satellite Carrier Oversight Act. This bill \nwill do a number of things to promote competition in the multichannel \nvideo marketplace. I wish to thank Senator Burns for his support on \nthis bill.\n  Congress has had a longstanding interest in promoting competition in \nthe multichannel video marketplace so as to enable consumers to have a \nchoice of video providers at competitive rates. However, a recent \nregulatory action threatens the ability of direct-to-home [DTH] \nsatellite television operators to compete effectively with cable \noperators.\n  On October 27, 1997, the Librarian of Congress adopted a Copyright \nArbitration Royalty Panel's recommendation of a precipitous and wholly \nunjustified increase in the copyright fees satellite carriers pay for \nsuperstation and network affiliate signals delivered to satellite TV \nhouseholds. This action will result in a rate increase for satellite \ntelevision subscribers and have a detrimental effect on the ability of \nDTH operators to compete with cable.\n  This bill will ensure that this rate increase does not take effect as \nscheduled on January 1, 1998. It delays the effective date of the rate \nincrease to January 1, 1999. The 7.5 million U.S. households who \ncurrently subscribe to satellite television deserve to have Congress \nexamine the effect of this copyright fee increase on video competition \nand to consider changes to the law that would ensure a less arbitrary \nand more consumer friendly result. This delay will give the FCC an \nopportunity to determine what impact the increased copyright fees will \nhave on satellite's ability to compete with cable, and it will give \nCongress an opportunity to evaluate the FCC's report and respond \naccordingly.\n  The current satellite copyright rates are 14 cents per subscriber per \nmonth for each superstation signal and 6 cents per subscriber per month \nfor each network signal. Cable operators currently pay an average of \n9.7 cents for the exact same superstations and 2.7 cents for the exact \nsame network signals. At the 27-cent rate adopted by the Librarian, \nsatellite carriers will be paying almost 270 percent more than cable \nfor the exact same superstations and 900 percent more for the exact \nsame network signals.\n  This creates an enormous disparity in the copyright fees paid for the \nsame signals and will result in rate increases to satellite \nsubscribers, which in turn will have a negative impact on competition \nbetween cable and satellite. Such a result is directly contrary to the \nintent of Congress to give consumers a choice of video providers at \ncompetitive rates.\n  The bill also addresses an issue of continuing concern to the DTH \nindustry. Signal theft represents a serious threat to DTH operators. In \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress confirmed the \napplicability of penalties for unauthorized decryption of DTH satellite \nservices. The amendment we propose would confirm the judicial \ninterpretation that civil suits may be brought by DTH operators for \nsignal theft.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1422\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Communications \n     Commission Satellite Carrier Oversight Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) The Congress finds that:\n       (1) Signal theft represents a serious threat to direct-to-\n     home satellite television. In the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996, Congress confirmed the applicability of penalties for \n     unauthorized decryption of direct-to-home satellite services. \n     Nevertheless, concerns remain about civil liability for such \n     unauthorized decryption.\n       (2) In view of the desire to establish competition to the \n     cable television industry, Congress authorized consumers to \n     utilize direct-to-home satellite systems for viewing video \n     programming through the Cable Communications Policy Act of \n     1984.\n       (3) Congress found in the Cable Television Consumer \n     Protection and Competition Act of 1992 that without the \n     presence of another multichannel video programming \n     distributor, a cable television operator faces no local \n     competition and that the result is undue market power for the \n     cable operator as compared to that of consumers and other \n     video programmers.\n       (4) The Federal Communications Commission, under the Cable \n     Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992, \n     has the responsibility for reporting annually to the Congress \n     on the state of competition in the market for delivery of \n     multichannel video programming.\n       (5) In the Cable Television Consumer Protection and \n     Competition Act of 1992, Congress stated its policy of \n     promoting the availability to the public of a diversity of\n\n[[Page S12012]]\n\n     views and information through cable television and other \n     video distribution media.\n       (6) Direct-to-home satellite television service is the \n     fastest growing multichannel video programming service with \n     approximately 8 million households subscribing to video \n     programming delivered by satellite carriers.\n       (7) Direct-to-home satellite television service is the \n     service that most likely can provide effective competition to \n     cable television service.\n       (8) Through the compulsory copyright license created by \n     Section 119 of the Satellite Home Viewer Act of 1988, \n     satellite carriers have paid a royalty fee per subscriber, \n     per month to retransmit network and superstation signals by \n     satellite to subscribers for private home viewing.\n       (9) Congress set the 1988 fees to equal the average fees \n     paid by cable television operators for the same superstation \n     and network signals.\n       (10) Effective May 1, 1992, the royalty fees payable by \n     satellite carriers were increased through compulsory \n     arbitration to $0.06 per subscriber per month for \n     retransmission of network signals and $0.175 per subscriber \n     per month for retransmission of superstation signals, unless \n     all of the programming contained in the superstation signal \n     is free from syndicated exclusivity protection under the \n     rules of the Federal Communications Commission, in which case \n     the fee was decreased to $0.14 per subscriber per month. \n     These fees were 40-70 percent higher than the royalty fees \n     paid by cable television operators to retransmit the same \n     signals.\n       (11) On October 27, 1997, the Librarian of Congress adopted \n     the recommendation of the Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel \n     and approved raising the royalty fees of satellite carriers \n     to $0.27 per subscriber per month for both superstation and \n     network signals, effective January 1, 1998.\n       (12) The fees adopted by the Librarian are 270 percent \n     higher for superstations and 900 percent higher for network \n     signals than the royalty fees paid by cable television \n     operators for the exact same signals.\n       (13) To be an effective competitor to cable, direct-to-home \n     satellite television must have access to the same programming \n     carried by its competitors and at comparable rates. In \n     addition, consumers living in areas where over-the-air \n     network signals are not available rely upon satellite \n     carriers for access to important news and entertainment.\n       (14) The Copyright Arbitration Royalty Panel did not \n     adequately consider the adverse competitive effect of the \n     differential in satellite and cable royalty fees on promoting \n     competition among multichannel video programming providers \n     and the importance of evaluating the fees satellite carriers \n     pay in the context of the competitive nature of the \n     multichannel video programming marketplace.\n       (15) If the recommendation of the Copyright Arbitration \n     Royalty Panel is allowed to stand, the direct-to-home \n     satellite industry, whose total subscriber base is equivalent \n     in size to approximately 11 percent of all cable households, \n     will be paying royalties that equal half the size of the \n     cable royalty pool, thus giving satellite subscribers a \n     disproportionate burden for paying copyright royalties when \n     compared to cable television subscribers.\n\n     SEC. 3. DBS SIGNAL SECURITY.\n\n       (a) Section 605(d) of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 605) is amended by adding after ``satellite cable \n     programming,'' the following: ``or direct-to-home satellite \n     services,''.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROCEEDING ON RETRANSMISSION OF DISTANT BROADCAST \n                   SIGNALS; REPORT ON EFFECT OF INCREASED ROYALTY \n                   FEES FOR SATELLITE CARRIERS ON COMPETITION IN \n                   THE MARKET FOR DELIVERY OF MULTICHANNEL VIDEO \n                   PROGRAMMING.\n\n       (a) Section 628 of the Communications Act of 1934 (47 \n     U.S.C. 548) is amended--\n       (1) by adding at the end of subsection (g): ``The \n     Commission shall, within 180 days of enactment of this \n     amendment initiate a notice of inquiry to determine the best \n     way in which to facilitate the retransmission of distant \n     broadcast signals such that it is more consistent with the \n     1992 Cable Act's goal of promoting competition in the market \n     for delivery of multichannel video programming and the public \n     interest. The Commission also shall within 180 days of \n     enactment report to Congress on the effect of the increase in \n     royalty fees paid by satellite carriers pursuant to the \n     decision by the Librarian of Congress on competition in the \n     market for delivery of multichannel video programming and the \n     ability of the direct-to-home satellite industry to \n     compete.''\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE OF INCREASED ROYALTY FEES.\n\n       (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \n     Copyright Office shall be prohibited from implementing, \n     enforcing, collecting or awarding copyright royalty fees, and \n     no obligation or liability for copyright royalty fees shall \n     accrue pursuant to the decision of the Librarian of Congress \n     on October 27, 1997, which established a royalty fee of $0.27 \n     per subscriber per month for the retransmission of distant \n     broadcast signals by satellite carriers, before January 1, \n     1999.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HAGEL (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Kerrey, and Mr. \n        Grams):\n  S. 1423. A bill to modernize and improve the Federal Home Loan Bank \nSystem; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n\n          the federal home loan bank system modernization act\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Federal Home \nLoan Bank System Modernization Act of 1997. I am joined in this effort \nby my distinguished colleagues Senators Bennett, Grams, and Kerrey.\n\n  This legislation represents months of work in crafting a bill that \nhas bipartisan support. The process has been open, and we have included \nall the affected parties: The Federal Home Loan Banks themselves, the \nFederal Housing Finance Board, and the banking industry. This process \nhas allowed us to craft legislation that represents, above all, sound \nbanking policy.\n  This bill will help community banks and the consumers who rely on \nthem. Take, for example, the case of Commercial State Bank in Wausa, \nNE. Commercial has served northeast Nebraska as an agricultural and \nbusiness lender for more than 70 years.\n  Now, with a growing economy in the region, the bank is growing as \nwell. In the small community of 600 people, deposits cannot keep pace \nwith the growing demand for loans--and that means the bank's liquidity \nis declining. With less liquidity, there just isn't as much money \navailable for lending as the community demands.\n  This bill would help banks like Commercial and communities like \nWausa. As Doug Johnson, president of Commercial State Bank, wrote to me \nabout this legislation:\n\n       If banks like the Commercial State Bank were able to access \n     the Federal Home Loan Bank, our customers would be better \n     able to be serviced with a consistent and competitive source \n     of funding. Denying credit to qualified borrowers is not \n     productive for Nebraska or the Midwest. Unfortunately, those \n     borrowers may miss the opportunities available to them at \n     this time to improve their economic prosperity.\n\n  Mr. President, that is what this bill is all about--helping small \ncommunities to better secure their economic futures.\n  The Federal Home Loan Bank system was established in 1932, primarily \nto provide a source of credit to savings and loan institutions for home \nlending. Now, a majority of the members in the FHLB system are \ncommercial banks. We should update this system to recognize this change \nin its membership.\n  Not since 1989 has significant Federal Home Loan Bank legislation \nbecome law. The system is working well, but I believe Congress can make \nit better. It's time for Congress to act.\n  This legislation has four main components:\n  First, it recognizes the importance of the FHLB system to community \nbanks. Many smaller institutions are dependent on deposits to fund \nlending in their local communities. Because of competition from non \nbank competitors, those deposits are shrinking. That is going to mean \nless community lending--which will hurt the economies of these small \ncommunities. A recent article in American Banker newspaper titled \n``Small Banks Face Crisis as Deposits Drain Away'' highlighted this \nproblem, and I ask that this article be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  Our legislation would ease membership requirements for smaller \ncommunity banks and thrifts that are vital sources of credit in their \nlocal communities. It would allow the FHLB System to be more easily \naccessed as an important source of liquidity for community lenders. \nThese institutions would be permitted to post different types of \ncollateral for various kinds of lending. This critical change will \nfacilitate more small business, rural development, agricultural, and \nlow-income community development lending in rural and urban \ncommunities.\n  The second main component of this bill is an issue of basic fairness. \nFederally chartered savings associations, or thrifts as they are called \ntoday, are required to be members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. \nCommercial banks, on the other hand, are voluntary members. This \ndisparity is unfair.\n  Our legislation allows federally chartered thrifts to become \nvoluntary members. This is important to these institutions, which are \nlarge stockholders in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. It is critical \nthat all member financial institutions have the ability to choose \nwhether Federal Home Loan Bank membership is appropriate or not. As a \nresult of this action, we also equalize stock purchase requirements for \nall member institutions. We do this in a way that maintains and \nenhances the safety and soundness of the FHLB system.\n  The third component of this legislation fixes an imbalance in the \nsystem's annual REFCORP obligation. Currently, the 12 FHLBanks must \ncollectively pay a fixed $300 million obligation to service the REFCORP \nbonds\n\n[[Page S12013]]\n\nthat were issued to help pay for the S bailout. This fixed obligation \nhas driven the banks to increase their levels of non-mission-related \ninvestments.\n  Under our legislation each FHLBank would be required to pay 20.75 \npercent of its earnings to service the REFCORP debt. Freeing the \nFHLBanks of the obligation to generate a specific dollar figure would \nallow them to concentrate on their primary mission of housing finance \nand community lending. This change was scored by the Congressional \nBudget Office as increasing Federal revenues by $44 million over the \nnext 5 years. In other words, this change would allow a $44 million \nreduction in taxpayer obligations.\n  Fourth and finally, the legislation addresses the issue of devolution \nof management functions from the Finance Board to the FHLBanks. On \nissues of day-to-day management, the FHLBanks should be able to govern \nthemselves independently of their regulator. The function of the \nFinance Board should be mission regulation and safety-and-soundness \nregulation. The provisions of the legislation that accomplish this goal \nare non controversial and enjoy broad support.\n  Mr. President, it is time to modernize the Federal Home Loan Bank \nSystem. The landscape of the financial services industry is rapidly \nevolving. The Federal Home Loan Banks should be allowed to modernize to \nkeep pace with these changes. I am proud to take up this issue in the \nSenate and build on the work done in the House of Representatives by \nCongressmen Baker and Kanjorski, both tireless proponents for Federal \nHome Loan Bank modernization. Their help in the formulation of this \nlegislation was critical.\n  I sincerely hope the Senate Banking Committee and the full Senate \nwill have the chance to consider this important legislation, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From American Banker, Oct. 14, 1997]\n\n             Small Banks Face Crisis as Deposits Drain Away\n\n                       (By Laura Pavlenko Lutton)\n\n       Community banks are finding it increasingly tough to meet \n     deposit and withdrawal demands as customers shift their \n     deposits into higher-yielding investments like mutual funds. \n     ``I think it could become a crisis,'' said C. William \n     Landefeld, president of Citizens Savings Bank in Bloomington, \n     Ill., and chairman of America's Community Bankers. ``It's one \n     of our biggest concerns.''\n       Over the last three years, loans at banks with assets \n     between $100 million and $1 billion have grown nearly 11% \n     while deposits only increased 3.27%, according to the Federal \n     Deposit Insurance Corp. At June 30, loans at these banks \n     averaged 74% of deposits--an all-time high. ``We're clearly \n     seeing some community banks struggle with liquidity,'' said \n     Keith Leggett, an economist at the American Bankers \n     Association. Loan-to-deposit ratios above 70% force these \n     institutions to seek alternative sources of funds to meet \n     loan demand--a move that can squeeze profit margins.\n       ``Banks may give up liquidity to meet loan demand and that \n     raises a safety question,'' he added. While deposits are \n     leaving banks of all sizes, the problem is worst at small \n     banks because they have fewer funding sources. ``The big \n     banks can issue debt securities, but we can't really do \n     that,'' said Arthur C. Johnson, president of United Bank of \n     Michigan, a $165 million-asset bank in Grand Rapids.\n       ``Smaller banks don't have the same access to the capital \n     markets.'' Many of these banks also are in towns with \n     dwindling populations or slumping economies. Dennis Utter, \n     president of $45 million-asset Adams County Bank, said it's \n     difficult to keep deposits in the bank's hometown of Kenesaw, \n     Neb. Baby boomers have moved much of their savings to \n     alternative investments, and younger depositors are even \n     tougher to attract, he said. ``When an old, loyal customer \n     passes away, those funds don't stay in Adams County Bank,'' \n     he said. ``The heirs don't live here anymore.''\n       To increase liquidity, community bankers are turning to the \n     Federal Home Loan Bank System, seeking out deposit brokers, \n     nudging up interest rates, or selling off assets. The 12 \n     Federal Home Loan banks, which lend money to member \n     institutions, are a popular source of funds for community \n     banks nationwide. Membership in the system has doubled in the \n     last six years to roughly 6,300, and through August total \n     loans were up 10.3%, to 177.8 billion.\n       Mr. Johnson said United Bank of Michigan has borrowed $5 \n     million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis to \n     fund loan growth. But the Federal Home Loan Bank System is \n     not the answer for all community banks. Membership is limited \n     to banks and thrifts with mortgages making up at least 10% of \n     their total loan portfolios. What's more, only mortgage loans \n     may be used as collateral, further limiting what some \n     institutions may borrow.\n       William L. McQuillan, president of City National Bank in \n     Greely, Neb., said his bank went out and brought enough \n     mortgages to meet the 10% test so it could start borrowing. \n     ``We couldn't continue to go out in the local market and pay \n     up for deposits,'' he said. The membership and collateral \n     requirements soon may be relaxed through rule change and \n     pending legislation.\n       For example, banks may be able to reclassify some \n     agricultural loans as mortgages under a proposed rule, and \n     pending legislation would waive the 10% mortgage rule for \n     banks with assets under $500 million--making 800 more banks \n     eligible for membership. In the meantime, banks may buy \n     deposits from brokers. Mr. Utter said he buys about $5 \n     million of deposits to get Adams County Bank through the peak \n     agricultural lending season of April through October.\n       ``Brokered deposits used to be really frowned upon by \n     regulators, but we're not funding long-term investments'' he \n     said. Bank also sell older loans in their portfolio, \n     branches, or other investments to boost liquidity.\n       Gary Scott, president of Cheatam State Bank in Kingston \n     Springs, Tenn., said his bank occasionally bundles 15- to 20-\n     year mortgages and then sells them to raise cash. Citizens \n     Savings Bank recently sold one of its under-performing \n     branches to bring in new funds. The bank sacrificed the \n     branch's $7 million of deposits, but Citizens was able to use \n     cash from the sale to pay off some Federal Home Loan bank \n     advances, Mr. Landefeld said.\n       First Dakota National Bank in Yankton, S.D., has sold off \n     municipal bond securities in recent years to increase its \n     loan capacity, according to its president, James Ahrendt. Lew \n     Stone, president of Goleta (Calif.) National Bank, said his \n     bank is using the Internet to solve liquidity problems. \n     Goleta sells certificates of deposit through an electronic \n     bulletin board, raising and lowering the rates depending on \n     how much money the bank needs. ``We could raise $10 million \n     overnight if we had to,'' Mr. Stone said.\n       Industry experts say they expect the current trend of \n     declining deposit growth and increasing loan demand to \n     continue. ``I don't see any real relief for community \n     banks,'' said Charles N. Cranmer, head of equity research at \n     M.A. Schapiro & Co. in New York. ``You've got a banking \n     population that's been educated that they can do better \n     things with their money than put it in a bank.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Stevens, and Mr. \n        Inouye):\n  S. 1424. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe air transportation tax changes made by the Taxpayer Relief Act of \n1997; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\n                aviation taxes modification legislation\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Akaka, \nStevens, and Inouye, I am introducing legislation that will provide a \nmeasure of relief to the citizens of Alaska and Hawaii who must rely on \nair transport far more than citizens in the lower-48.\n  When Congress adopted the balanced budget legislation last summer, \none of the provisions of the tax bill re-wrote the formula for \ncalculating the air passenger tax for domestic and international \nflights. As part of this formula change, Congress adopted a per \npassenger, per segment fee which disproportionately penalizes travelers \nto and from Alaska and Hawaii who have no choice but to travel by air.\n  Th legislation we are introducing today would reinstate the prior law \n10 percent tax formula for flights to and from our states. In addition, \nthe $6 international departure fees that are imposed on such flights \nwould be retained at the current level and would not be indexed. I see \nno reason why passengers flying to and from our states must face a \nguaranteed increase in tax every year because of inflation. We don't \nindex tobacco taxes, we don't index fuel taxes; why should government \nautomatically gain additional revenue from air passengers simply \nbecause of inflation?\n  Mr. President, this legislation requires that intrastate Alaska and \nHawaii flights will be subject to a flat 10 percent tax if such flights \ndo not originate or terminate at a rural airport in our states. In \naddition, the definition of a rural airport is expanded to include \nairports within 75 miles of each other where no roads connect the \ncommunities. In many towns in Alaska, air transport is the only viable \nmeans of transportation from one community to another. There is no \nreason these airports should be denied the benefit of the special rural \nairport tax rate simply because our state does not have the\n\n[[Page S12014]]\n\ntransportation infrastructure or geographic definition that exists in \nmost of the lower-48.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1424\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to lend my support to Senator \nMurkowski's bill that would amend Public Law 105-34, the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, with respect to domestic aviation travel to, from, \nand within Hawaii and Alaska. Hawaii, unlike any other State, save \nAlaska, does not have the transportation alternatives that are \navailable to citizens of other States. Roads, bridges, trains, and \nbuses do not operate between the islands of Hawaii. This geographic \ndifference causes any tax imposed on the cost of flying, our citizens' \nonly means of getting from one island to another, to fall \ndisproportionately on our citizens.\n  This bill would correct any injustice that the citizens of Hawaii and \nAlaska were, perhaps inadvertently, subjected to as a result of last \nsummer's passage of increased excise taxes on air transportation. \nSpecifically, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997's provision for the \ncollection of an additional segment tax for each segment of air travel \namong the Hawaiian Islands disproportionately penalized Hawaii \ncitizens.\n  In addition, the current law definition of ``rural airports'' is \nunder inclusive. Under the current law, Hawaii citizens traveling to \nand from an airport located within 75 miles of a high-traffic airport \nthat is inaccessible to them because there are no paved roads \nconnecting the two airports, are nonetheless ineligible for the reduced \n7.5 percent tax. By amending the definition of ``rural airports,'' this \nbill will afford Hawaii citizens the same tax benefits as similarly \nsituated citizens of other States.\n  Therefore, I support the reinstatement of the pre-act formula for \ncomputing taxes on domestic segments that begin or end in Alaska and \nHawaii, which would correct the inequitable tax treatment of Hawaii \npassengers under the current law.\n  It is my hope that my colleagues will support this measure during the \nsecond session of the 105th Congress.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I am pleased to join Senator Murkowski and other \ncolleagues in introducing legislation today that addresses certain \naviation tax inequities that were enacted as part of Public Law 105-34, \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.\n  Among other aviation provisions, Public Law 105-34 lowered the \npassenger ticket tax from 10 percent to 9 percent, falling \nincrementally to 7.5 percent over 3 years. In addition, the law \nestablished a new domestic segment fee of $1, rising incrementally to \n$3 over 5 years, which will ultimately be indexed for inflation. \nHowever, flights from certain small, rural airports are taxed at a \nsimple 7.5 percent rate and exempted from the segment fee. Finally, \nwhile the existing $6 international departure tax for flights between \nHawaii and other states is maintained, the charge is indexed for \ninflation beginning in 1999.\n  Mr. President, these taxes unfairly discriminate against Hawaii \ntravellers. Residents of and visitors to Hawaii are entirely dependent \non plane service for communication among the State's eight major \nislands as well as for travel to and from the distant U.S. mainland. \nThe new aviation charges make personal, commercial, and Government \ntravel within Hawaii more costly and hurts our tourism-based economy by \ninhibiting visitation from other States. I understand that many of \nthese problems also apply to Alaska, which has similar transportation \nconcerns.\n  The bill we are introducing today addresses these shortcomings. Our \nlegislation would reinstate the prior 10 percent ticket tax and \neliminate the new segment fee on flights between our States and the \nmainland as well as on intrastate flights in Hawaii and Alaska. The \nmeasure would also eliminate the inflation adjustment for the $6 \ninternational departure tax to which flights to and from our States are \nsubject. Finally, the bill would redefine the rural airport exemption \nin such a way that will qualify many passengers travelling within \nHawaii and Alaska for the reduced 7.5 percent rate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. For the sake of Hawaii's and Alaska's \nunique air transportation needs, I urge my colleagues to support this \ninitiative.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 1425. A bill to provide for the preservation and sustainability of \nthe family farm through the transfer of responsibility for operation \nand maintenance of the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, Montana; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n\n          the flathead irrigation project transfer act of 1997\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \ntransfer the operation of an irrigation project in Montana from the \nBureau of Indian Affairs to the local irrigators. This is a bill, which \nhas been before Congress before, but has been changed to address the \nconcerns expressed by the BIA and groups which have opposed this \nlegislation in the past.\n\n  Years of management by the Bureau of Indian Affairs has led to a \nproject in poor physical condition. Rather than being an asset for the \ngovernment and the users, the Flathead Irrigation is rapidly becoming a \nliability. Using current estimates, the project is in need of $15 to \n$20 million worth of repair and conditioning. Government managers admit \nthat costs associated with rehabilation of this project could be as \nmuch as 40 percent higher than if the project were under local control.\n  The irony of this project however, is the fact that studies on \nlocally owned irrigation projects in Montana and Wyoming show that the \ncosts of operation and maintenance of the Flathead project are some of \nthe highest in the Rocky Mountain Region the condition of the project \nmay be worst in that same region. What do these people, and for that \nmatter the taxpayer, get for the higher costs associated with the \ncurrent management? Not much if anything at all.\n  Let's take a moment here to see what local control of this irrigation \nproject would mean to the irrigators and to the taxpayer. First of all, \nlocal control will mean increased accountability of the monies \ncollected by and used in the operation of the Flathead Irrigation \nProject. At the current time the BIA is unable, or unwilling, to \nprovide basic financial information to the local irrigation districts. \nThis despite the fact that the local farmers and ranchers pay 100% of \nthe costs to operate and maintain the project. At the same time, the \ncurrent management cannot even deliver a year-end balance of funds paid \nby the local irrigation users.\n\n[[Page S12015]]\n\n  Local control will also create savings over the current operation \nmanagement. By using these savings the local management could be used \nto restore the Flathead Irrigation Project to a fully functioning, \nefficiently operating unit.\n  Without the transfer to local control, the residents of the Flathead \nface an uncertain future. This irrigation project is located in one of \nthe most beautiful valleys in western Montana. Current trends in \nagriculture have put farmers and ranchers in a difficult position. \nMontana farmers and ranchers have always been land rich and cash poor. \nIn the case of this valley in Montana, this is the rule and not the \nexception. They live in an area that is being changed daily due to the \nnumber of summer home construction, because of the beauty and a \ntemperate climate for Montana.\n  The family farmers and ranchers in this area continue to face \neconomic pressures from outside. Which has led to a number of folks \npacking up and subdividing their land for residential home sites. Those \nwho have packed up and left the area, have taken their land and \nsubdivided it for the residential development, removing the land from \nagricultural production.\n  The subdivision of the land has a number of negative impacts on this \nvalley and Montana and the Nation. The landscape is dotted with \nmagnificent homes which impacts on the landscape and open spaces, and \nof course wildlife. Another of the major impacts sin on the local and \nstate economies and governments. Agriculture land in Montana pays \napproximately $1.29 in property taxes for every dollar invested by the \nlocal government for services. Residential subdivisions only pay \napproximately $0.89 for every dollar they receive in local government \nservices.\n  Preservation of the small family farm and ranch in the Mission, Jocko \nand Camas valleys in Montana is dependent upon local control. As local \ncontrol of the Flathead Irrigation Project will provide these hard \nworking Americans an opportunity to control and have input on the costs \nassociated with the operation of this vital water source.\n  The local control of this project is supported by a wide cross \nsection of Montanan's. Governor Marc Racicot, the Lake County \nCommissioners and local irrigation districts are among the local \ngovernment officials in support of this bill. Organizations which have \nvoiced their support for the measure include the Montana Stockgrowers \nAssociation, Montana Water Resources Association and the National Water \nResources Association. The support of this measure in bipartisan in \nnature as well.\n  Madam President. I am pleased to introduce this measure today, and I \nlook forward to moving this bill forward through committee and to the \nfloor in an attempt to give local control back to the people who depend \non the Flathead Irrigation Project for their way of living.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG:\n  S. 1426. A bill to encourage beneficiary developing countries to \nprovide adequate protection of intellectual property rights, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n\nthe rights of intellectual property owners fairness facilitation act of \n                                  1997\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nI believe will encourage many of our trading partners to improve their \nprotection of American intellectual property rights. This is not an \ninsignificant matter, Mr. President. It is estimated that American \ncompanies lose approximately $50 billion every year from intellectual \nproperty violations. This theft not only affects a company's bottom \nline, it means losses to America's competitiveness, and, most \nimportantly, it means loss of American jobs.\n\n  The ``Rights of Intellectual Property Owners Fairness Facilitation \nAct of 1997,'' or RIP-OFF, will require participants in the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences program to expedite their implementation of the \nintellectual property agreement contained in the Uruguay Round of the \nGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. In addition, to continue as a \nGSP beneficiary, a country must fully comply with the terms of any \nbilateral or other multilateral intellectual property agreement it has \nwith the United States.\n  Mr. President, the Agreement on the Trade-Related Aspects of \nIntellectual Property Rights, known as TRIPS, requires signatories to \nimprove and better enforce the rights of intellectual property holders. \nUnfortunately, too many countries are able to delay implementation of \nTRIPS for an inordinately long period of time. Developing countries \nhave until 2000 and least developed countries are permitted to delay \nsome TRIPS requirements for as long as 2006. The United States simply \ncannot afford to permit piracy to continue unabated for such a lengthy \nperiod.\n  The GSP program enables certain products from developing countries to \nbe exported to the United States duty-free. Through the years, Congress \nhas conditioned the receipt of these tariff preferences on such factors \nas whether a country enforces arbitral awards in favor of US citizens, \nwhether it affords internationally recognized worker rights to its \nworkers, and whether it harbors terrorists. Although GSP beneficiaries \nare supposed to provide 'adequate and effective' intellectual property \nprotection, it is an amorphous standard that has only been used a \nhandful of times against countries, and then, only for a limited period \nof time, and with limited success. By tying the GSP program to \nexpedited implementation of TRIPS and full compliance with agreements \nthey have negotiated with the U.S., countries will know what they must \ndo and by when to continue receiving GSP benefits. It also demonstrates \nour commitment to protecting American intellectual property rights \noverseas.\n  My legislation conforms to current law, which provides the President \nwith the discretion, via a waiver, to continue or extend GSP benefits \nto a country that does not comply with the requirements of this bill by \nallowing a waiver. The President has every right to determine that \ndesignating a country as a GSP beneficiary is in the national economic \ninterest of the United States. I thought it was important to maintain \nthe existing flexibility in this program. My bill will also enable our \ngovernment to provide support and technical assistance to countries \nhaving difficulty meeting their intellectual property protection \nrequirements.\n  The GSP program provides countries with a benefit, not a right. \nCongress continues to downsize the federal government. Resources are \nscarce. In this climate, it is inappropriate to provide GSP benefits to \ncountries that do not uphold our intellectual property rights. \nIndustries reliant upon strong intellectual property protection, \npharmaceutical, telecommunications, and motion picture companies, for \nexample, are among this country's most competitive. We should be \nfostering this competitiveness by using appropriate tools to protect \nour innovators. Mr. President, this legislation will accomplish this \ngoal.\n  This legislation is very similar to a bill I introduced several years \nago with Senator Roth. The modifications I have made account for the \ntime countries have already had to commence changes to their \nintellectual property laws and regulations. Additionally, the bill \nclarifies that the standards provided in TRIPS should be the floor for \nintellectual property agreements, and that our government should \ncontinue seeking stronger protection for American intellectual property \nowners.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and \nask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be inserted into the \nRecord along with letters of support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1426\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The protection and enhancement of American \n     intellectual property is fundamental to the competitiveness \n     of many U.S. industries, especially the research-based \n     pharmaceutical industry. Thanks to the support of the \n     Congress and the Executive Branch, over the years many \n     countries such as Mexico and Brazil have improved their \n     intellectual property regimes, thereby improving their \n     prospects for economic development and setting a positive \n     example for other countries around the world.\n       I believe your legislation, by providing a balanced range \n     of incentives for countries to improve their protection of \n     intellectual property rights, will send a positive signal to \n     our trading partners. Please do not hesitate to contact me if \n     there is anything PHRMA can do to support the passage of your \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Alan F. Holmer,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                             Procter & Gamble,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 28, 1997.\n     Hon. Frank Lautenberg,\n     United States Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lautenberg: On behalf of Procter & Gamble, I \n     write in strong support of your efforts to protect U.S. \n     intellectual property rights through your bill, the ``Rights \n     of Intellectual Property Owners Fairness Facilitation Act of \n     1997.''\n       Procter & Gamble now generates over half of its $35 billion \n     annual sales from international markets. America's leadership \n     to create rules-based international markets is\n\n[[Page S12017]]\n\n     one of our primary concerns. As we continue to build our \n     business in developing countries, we seek a ``level playing \n     field'' in the form of transparent, rules-based treatment and \n     protection of investments, including trademarks, \n     technologies, and ideas. Your bill, which requires that \n     developing countries adequately protect our intellectual \n     property rights or lose GSP benefits, represents a positive \n     step.\n       We are all too familiar with what can happen overseas when \n     U.S. intellectual property rights are not adequately \n     protected. For instance, in the Persian Gulf countries, P \n     suffers from severe counterfeit activity. In certain other \n     nations receiving GSP preferences, we estimate that nearly \n     10% of our total sales is lost to counterfeit products. If \n     GSP can be used as an incentive for countries to implement \n     the TRIPS standards at an accelerated pace, we would avoid \n     those losses.\n       Your proposed similar legislation in 1994, which we and \n     many of our trade associations such as IPO and PhRMA \n     supported. We will encourage those organizations to again \n     support this initiative.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Scott Miller,\n                                                         Director.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FORD:\n  S. 1427. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require \nthe Federal Communications Commission to preserve lowpower television \nstations that provide community broadcasting, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n           THE COMMUNITY BROADCASTERS PROTECTION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. FORD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nCommunity Broadcasters Protection Act of 1997. This legislation is \ndesigned to provide some limited protections for the owners and \noperators of low-power television, or LPTV.\n  Mr. President, when the Federal Communications Commission created \nlow-power television licenses in the early 1980's, it did so with a \nsimple premise: television stations unable to reach a large area, can \nstill offer a valuable service to our communities. Low-power television \nstations operate at the higher ends of the broadcast spectrum and serve \na more limited area, generally a coverage area of approximately 12 to \n15 miles. In addition, LPTV licensees operate as a ``secondary \nstatus''. That is, they cannot interfere with the transmission of full \npower television stations.\n  Since their creation almost 20 years ago, LPTV stations have \nflourished. As entrepreneurs, LPTV owners and operators have \nexperimented with various kinds of programming. Many have been \nextremely successful as local, community broadcasters, providing \nregional news and sports coverage. In fact, LPTV stations have much in \ncommon with full power stations. Many offer a full service daily \nprogram schedule. Other LPTV stations have predominantly religious, all \nnews, all sports, or all movie formats. Still, many other LPTV stations \noffer more local and ``niche'' programming because their service areas \nare smaller, their audiences more targeted.\n  Unfortunately, the transition to the digital television era threatens \nthe viability of many LPTV stations. As their spectrum is reclaimed by \nthe FCC for the purpose of providing the second channel for digital \ntelevision, some of the LPTV stations may face darkness during the \ntransition to digital television, or afterwards.\n  Let me say, Mr. President, that I have been and continue to be, a \nsupporter of the transition to digital television. I believe the move \nto digital television is a prudent use of modern technology for the use \nof a scarce public resource, the electromagnetic spectrum. But I also \nbelieve that as we make this transition, good public policy must \nsupport the investments made by LPTV licensees. I would note, Mr. \nPresident, that a majority of Members of the Senate agreed with me on \nthis point as a number of Members joined me on a March 6, 1997 letter \nto then FCC Chairman Reed Hundt in which we expressed concerns about \nthe plans for the transition to digital television.\n  And while the FCC agrees that LPTV licensees have been successful and \noffer a valuable enterprise, there remains regulatory uncertainty for \nLPTV licensees in the digital age. That is why I have introduced the \nCommunity Broadcasters Protection Act of 1997. This legislation will \nelevate some LPTV stations from their current secondary status to a \nnewly created Class A license. In so doing, Class A LPTV licensees \nwould be treated under law and FCC regulations like a full power \ntelevision station. That is, Class A LPTV licensees would assume the \nsame duties and responsibilities as their full power counterparts.\n  To qualify for a Class A license, an LPTV station must broadcast a \nminimum of 18 hours per day, and broadcast an average of at least 3 \nhours per week of programming produced within the market area served by \nthe LPTV station. LPTV stations must be operating under these \nconditions within the last 2 years before enactment of this legislation \nand within 6 months of filing for the license. Once an LPTV station \nobtains a Class A license, the FCC would be required to find spectrum \nfor the station in the new digital television era. Like its full power \ncounterparts, a Class A licensee could not be forced off the air by \nhaving its license terminated or rescinded. However, in those instances \nwhere the FCC cannot accommodate an LPTV licensee in one market, \nbecause of the potential for interference with full power digital \ntransmissions, the FCC is authorized to award the LPTV Class A licensee \nanother license in an adjacent community, or if that is not available, \nin another community acceptable to the licensee.\n  Lower-power television licensees are willing and prepared to join \ntheir full power counterparts in the transition to digital television--\na transition which is technically complex and potentially costly for \nboth full power and low-power broadcasters. But as long as there \nremains a regulatory uncertainty about the future of LPTV, they will \nnot be able to obtain the investments and capital to make that \ntransition.\n  It is an interesting historic footnote, that at the time LPTV was \nauthorized by the FCC, then FCC Chairman Charles Ferris suggested that \none day, LPTV could develop into full power television stations. While \nthis legislation does not elevate LPTV to full power status, I do \nbelieve that this legislation addresses a critical issue for LPTV \nsupporters--the development of adequate protections in the digital age \nfor broadcasters who provide a significant benefit to the public. I \nhope my colleagues, who are also supporters of their community \nbroadcasters agree with me and will lend their support to move this \nlegislation forward towards enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRAHAM (for himself, Mr. Mack and Mr. Bumpers):\n  S. 1428. A bill to waive time limitations specified by law in order \nto allow the Medal of Honor to be awarded to be awarded to Robert R. \nIngram of Jacksonville, Florida, for acts of valor while a Navy \nHospital Corpsman in the Republic of Vietnam during the Vietnam \nconflict; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n\n\n              the robert r. ingram recognition act of 1997\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to urge passage of a private \nbill that will honor a man that served this country with honor and \nbravery. This bill will allow Robert R. Ingram to receive the Medal of \nHonor for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk to his life \nabove and beyond the call of duty.\n  Robert R. Ingram served as Corpsman with Company C, First Battalion, \nSeventh Marines in Vietnam. On March 28, 1966, Corpsman Ingram \naccompanied Marine point platoon as it dispatched an outpost of a North \nVietnam Aggressor battalion in Quang Ngai Province, Republic of \nVietnam. They were sabotaged by the Vietnamese, and the platoon was \ndecimated, suffering numerous casualties. Corpsman Ingram was himself \ninjured four times during the attack while he administered first aid to \nother members of his platoon.\n  Enduring the pain from his many injuries and disregarding his own \nlife, Corpsman Ingram's selfless actions saved many U.S. soldiers that \nday. By his indomitable fighting spirit, daring initiative, and \nunfaltering dedication to duty, Corpsman Ingram clearly earned the \nMedal of Honor as a result of his actions. However, the Navy failed to \nprocess an award, and Corpsman Ingram received no official commendation \nfor his actions. The men with whom he served that fateful day, and the \nmen whose lives he saved, all feel that a commendation is due. However, \nthere is no evidence of an award recommendation.\n\n[[Page S12018]]\n\n  Mr. President, it is time that Robert R. Ingram receives an honor \nthat should have been bestowed upon him over thirty years ago. This \nbill calls for the time limitations in Section 6248 to be waived so \nthat this action may be taken.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1428\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AUTHORITY FOR AWARD OF MEDAL OF HONOR TO ROBERT R. \n                   INGRAM FOR VALOR DURING THE VIETNAM CONFLICT.\n\n       (a) Waiver of Time Limitations.--Notwithstanding the time \n     limitations specified in section 6248 of title 10, United \n     States Code, or any other time limitation with respect to the \n     awarding of certain medals to persons who served in the naval \n     service, the President may award the Medal of Honor under \n     section 6241 of that title to Robert R. Ingram of \n     Jacksonville, Florida, for the acts of valor referred to in \n     subsection (b).\n       (b) Action Described.--The acts of valor referred to in \n     subsection (a) are the actions of Robert R. Ingram on March \n     28, 1966, as a Hospital Corpsman Third Class in the Navy \n     serving in the Republic of Vietnam with Company C of the \n     First Battalion, Seventh Marines, during a combat operation \n     designated as Operation Indiana.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Burns, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 1429. A bill to enhance rail competition and to ensure reasonable \nrail rates in any case in which there is an absence of effective \ncompetition; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n\n              the railroad shipper protection act of 1997\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud to be joined \nby two of my distinguished colleagues, Senator Conrad Burns and Senator \nByron Dorgan, in introducing today the Railroad Shipper Protection Act \nof 1997. This legislation is the result of many months of effort to \ndevelop constructive and pragmatic proposals for addressing the \nincreasingly serious problems faced by shippers in need of affordable \naccess to railroad service in every region of the country. As a \nbipartisan team committed to achieving urgently needed results in the \ncoming year, we offer this bill with the hope that it will generate the \ninterest, input, and support needed to help shippers obtain fair \ntreatment and true competitive access from railroads across the \ncountry. I commend both Senators Burns and Dorgan for their leadership \nand constant attention to these issues, which can be complex and yet \naffect numerous communities, key industries, and workers nationwide.\n  This legislation deals with issues of longstanding concern to me. \nBecause of the importance of the relationship between the Nation's \nrailroads and the shippers and communities that they serve, especially \nin my State of West Virginia, I have made a special effort throughout \nmy tenure in the Senate to promote a rail transportation system that is \nfair and economically sound for all parties. Of all of the things that \nhave troubled me about that system over the years, none is more \ntroubling than the plight of captive rail shippers--businesses and \ncommunities that are dependent on a single railroad for freight \ntransportation service.\n  West Virginia has more than its fair share of captive shippers. Many \nof our coal fields, most of our chemical manufacturers, and one of our \nfinest steel manufacturing facilities--and the largest single employer \nin our State--all are captive to a single railroad for shipments to \ndomestic and foreign markets. The result is that West Virginia \nbusinesses too often suffer from unreasonable freight rates and \ninadequate transportation service.\n  Today, two events are conspiring to create additional captive rail \nshippers--and worsen the competitive position of existing captive rail \nshippers--in West Virginia and across the Nation.\n  First, our national freight rail system continues to concentrate into \nfewer and fewer major railroads. Since Congress deregulated the \nrailroads in 1980, the number of major Class I railroads has declined \nfrom 43 to 5--and will drop to 4 if the division of Conrail is \napproved. For a long time the fears expressed by shippers, and by those \nof us in Congress who are dedicated to protecting shippers, have fallen \non deaf ears. In the past several months, however, the entire Nation \nhas witnessed the far-reaching economic impact of a merger gone awry. \nThe 1996 merger of Union Pacific and Southern Pacific has made dramatic \nheadlines as service is disrupted, trains pile up, shipments are lost, \nand ultimately facilities and jobs are put in jeopardy. The chemical \nindustry alone has had to grapple with service disruptions costing an \naverage of $35 to $60 million per month through the summer and into the \nfall.\n\n  The UP-SP service crisis has caught my attention in part because the \neffects are so far-reaching that a number of West Virginia shippers \nhave asked for my help, and in part because I now face a major merger \nin my own backyard with the proposal to divide Conrail between CSX and \nNorfolk Southern. The UP-SP situation is expected to improve in the \ncoming months, following implementation of a comprehensive service \nrecovery plan and unprecedented intervention by the Surface \nTransportation Board, but the UP-SP story has only reinforced my belief \nthat concentration of the Nation's railroads is an ominous development \nfor many shippers and for States like West Virginia. Railroad \nconcentration is reducing transportation options and worsening the \ncompetitive position of captive shippers.\n  Second, the Surface Transportation Board, established in 1995 to \nsucceed the Interstate Commerce Commission, is understaffed and \nunderfunded, and is not adequately promoting rail competition and \nprotecting captive shippers. As I feared at the time it was passed, the \neffect of the ICC Termination Act has been to reduce our national \ncommitment to a strong and effective regulatory body to protect rail \nshippers. Rather than being vigilant in protecting captive shippers \nfrom railroad abuses, the STB has instead been consumed with reviewing \nmajor railroad mergers, conducting annual revenue adequacy \ndeterminations which serve no purpose, and making matters worse for \nshippers by deciding in December 1996 that railroads may render captive \na shipper that is otherwise positioned to enjoy competitive service by \nrefusing to quote a rate on a bottleneck segment.\n  Mr. President, just as the railroad industry has become more and more \nconcentrated, the regulatory agency charged with protecting captive \nrailroad customers has become less and less able to do its job.\n  Some may wonder how the STB, which is directly charged with \nprotecting against unreasonable rates and promoting competition, came \nto make such an anticompetitive and antishipper decision as that set \nforth in the 1996 bottleneck cases, and I think the answer illustrates \nwell the need for Congress to correct the current imbalance between \nrailroads and their customers.\n\n  The answer lies in the confusing instructions that were given to the \nSTB in the ICC Termination Act, and previously in the Staggers Rail Act \nof 1980 and the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of \n1976. In these statutes Congress directed the STB and its predecessor, \nthe ICC, to promote our national rail transportation system ``by \nallowing rail carriers to earn adequate revenues'' (49 U.S.C. 10101(3)) \nand by making ``an adequate and continuing effort to assist those \ncarriers in attaining revenue levels'' that allow them ``to attract and \nretain capital in amounts adequate to provide a sound transportation \nsystem in the United States'' (49 U.S.C. 10704(a)(2)). Congress has \nfurther directed the STB to make an annual determination of each \nrailroad's revenue adequacy--a determination that finds most class I \nrailroads to be revenue inadequate, contrary to the view of Wall Street \nand industry observers about the financial strength of individual \nrailroads and the industry as a whole.\n  As is evident in reading the Board's bottleneck decision, the \nperceived revenue inadequacy of the major railroads, and the belief \nthat protecting revenue adequacy is the preeminent responsibility of \nthe agency, formed the basis of the STB's agreement with the railroads \nthat they should have the right to prevent rail-to-rail competition \neven where competition is physically possible. At this point in the \nevolution of the railroad industry, such an approach is not only \ninequitable, it is harmful to our national economy.\n\n[[Page S12019]]\n\n  Today, I join with my colleagues in proposing legislation to clarify \nthe policy of the U.S. Government with regard to railroad competition \nand to restore the intended balance between railroads and shippers in \nthe laws governing their relationship and the oversight role of the \nSTB. This bill would accomplish five major objectives: First, making \nclear that it is the policy of the U.S. Government to promote rail \ncompetition and protect captive shippers; second, reducing the \nregulatory burden on captive shippers by simplifying the market \ndominance test; third, overturning the bottleneck decision by requiring \nrailroads to quote a rate on any available segment of service; fourth, \neliminating the ``revenue adequacy'' test, which serves no practical \npurpose and perpetuates the erroneous view that railroads are in dire \nfinancial straits; and fifth, requiring the STB to open its process \nmore widely in order to meet the needs of small shippers.\n  It is our intention to pursue this legislation in the context of the \nSTB's reauthorization next year. I am firmly committed to ensuring that \nthe Board is reauthorized in a timely way and is provided with the \nfunds it needs to perform its mission as the primary oversight agency \nfor the Nation's railroads, but I want to make clear that I will not \nsupport continuation of the status quo in the relationship between \nrailroads and shippers.\n  The legislation I introduce today will begin to afford rail-to-rail \ncompetition and captive shipper protection the priority they deserve in \nour national transportation policy. It is an important first-step, and \nI look forward to working with Senator Burns, Senator Dorgan, and \nothers over the course of the next several months to expand upon the \nshipper protections we propose today. I invite our colleagues to join \nus in this effort, and genuinely seek constructive input and assistance \nto achieve needed solutions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in its entirety in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1429\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Railroad Shipper Protection \n     Act of 1997''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) the railroad industry has consolidated dramatically \n     since passage of the Staggers Rail Act of 1980 (94 Stat. 1895 \n     et seq.), leaving the railroad industry with only a few major \n     carriers and providing shippers with limited competitive \n     options;\n       (2) the financial health of the railroad industry has \n     improved substantially since the passage of the Staggers Rail \n     Act of 1980;\n       (3) due partly to the continued consolidation of the \n     railroad industry, captive rail shippers--\n       (A) continue to exist; and\n       (B) are increasing in number; and\n       (4) rail shippers, including captive rail shippers, will \n     benefit from increased competition among railroads and a \n     streamlined process under which the Surface Transportation \n     Board determines the reasonableness of captive rail shipper \n     rates.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of Transportation.\n       (2) Surface transportation board.--The term ``Surface \n     Transportation Board'' or ``Board'' means the Surface \n     Transportation Board established under section 701 of title \n     49, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to clarify the rail transportation policy of the United \n     States;\n       (2) to ensure rail competition for shippers in geographic \n     areas in which rail competition is physically available;\n       (3) to ensure reasonable rates for captive rail shippers; \n     and\n       (4) to remove unnecessary regulatory burdens from the rate \n     reasonableness process of the Surface Transportation Board.\n\n     SEC. 5. CLARIFICATION OF RAIL TRANSPORTATION POLICY.\n\n       Section 10101 of title 49, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``(a) In General.--'' before ``In \n     regulating''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(b) Primary Objectives.--The primary objectives of the \n     rail transportation policy of the United States shall be--\n       ``(1) to ensure effective competition among rail carriers \n     at origin and destination; and\n       ``(2) to maintain reasonable rates in the absence of \n     effective competition.''.\n\n     SEC. 6.

In making that notification, the \n     Board shall make recommendations concerning those changes.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I am joining Senator Rockefeller and \nothers in introducing legislation that is designed to address some \nchronic problems facing rail shippers, especially small, captive \nshippers such as the small grain elevators in agricultural States like \nNorth Dakota. As this bill is introduced in the Senate today, thousands \nof bushels of grain are lying on the ground in North Dakota because \nthere are no cars available to small elevators to take wheat and barley \nto market. The frustration of North Dakota farmers and grain shippers \nis focused not only on the availability of grain cars to take their \nproducts to market this time of year, but also on what they have to pay \nwhen they have only one railroad serving them. The rates captive \nshippers pay to get their products to market reflect the basic \nprinciples of economics: where there is competition there are lower \nrates and where there is not, the captive shipper pays significantly \nmore.\n\n[[Page S12020]]\n\n  While the legislation we are introducing today will not create more \ngrain cars this year and it will not solve full the myriad of concerns \nthat many captive shippers have with respect to rail service in this \ncountry, this bill will take a step towards addressing some issues that \nwill help improve the situation of captive shippers.\n  The inspiration of this bill is the fact that 20 years ago there were \nmore than 40 Class I railroads and today there are eight, of which 5 of \nthese ``mega carriers'' generate 94 percent of the Class I rail \nindustry's gross income and own over 90 percent of the track miles, and \nproduce nearly 95 percent of the gross ton miles. Today, the western \ntwo-thirds of the country is divided up between two mega carriers that \nown approximately 85 percent of the track, generate over 90 percent of \nthe gross ton miles, and earn about 90 percent of the total net \nrailroad operating income west of the Mississippi River.\n  As the railroad industry has consolidated over the past 20 years, \nmore and more shippers have become captive to one carrier, replacing \ncompetitive service with monopoly service. At the same time, small \ncaptive shippers face insurmountable obstacles to seek relief on \nunreasonable rates before the Surface Transportation Board [STB]. It \nseems to me that the Congress needs to begin a serious debate on issues \neffecting captive shippers. The STB still operates under outdated \nregulatory structures and too many hurdles and red tape stand between \nthe small shipper and relief on unreasonable rates. This legislation \ntakes a modest step at addressing a few specific issues in these areas.\n  This legislation addresses the broader issues of promoting rail \ncompetition and protecting captive shippers where competition does not \nexist by identifying these issues as priorities for the STB. The also \nmakes a couple of changes in specific policies of the STB. First, this \nbill overturns the STB's decision on the so-called ``bottleneck'' case \nwhere the STB concluded that carriers have no obligation to quote a \nrate for a segment of line. The essence of the bottleneck case was that \nsome shippers believe that in areas where their products were being \nshipped where rail competition exists, they want to take advantage of \nthe lower rates for that particular segment of line. This legislation \nwould require a carrier to quote a rate for a specific segment at the \nrequest of the shipper. If the carrier did not quote a rate, then the \nSTB would have to set a rate. This circumstance will permit captive \nshippers to take advantage of the little competition that does exist in \nthe rail industry.\n\n  This legislation also repeals the outdated revenue adequacy test. The \nVice Chairman of the STB, Gus Owen, has appropriately questioned the \nappropriateness and the relevance of the STB conducting this outdated \nexercise of determining the revenue adequacy of railroads. This test is \nso out of date that the two largest railroads in the Nation failed the \nlast revenue adequacy test by the STB. However, these and other major \nrailroads have no problem leveraging capital and their own financial \nreports indicate record profits. It is a ridiculous test and it serves \nno useful purpose for STB procedures.\n  In addition, the legislation attempts to streamline the bureaucratic \nhurdles facing small shippers in seeking rate relief before the STB. \nOne provision streamlines the requirements imposed on the shipper to \ndemonstrate that the rail carrier serving them meets the STB's \ndefinition of ``market dominance.'' Under current law, market dominance \nis defined as ``the absence of effective competition from other rail \ncarriers or modes of transportation'' and the STB cannot find market \ndominance unless the revenue to variable cost percentage exceeds 180 \npercent. Under the STB's interpretation of this requirement, the STB \nrequires shippers to demonstrate that there is no product nor \ngeographic competition under he what constitutes transportation \ncompetition. This legislation makes the market dominance test simple \nand easier to understand. Under this bill, a shipper need only \ndemonstrate that they are served by only one rail carrier and that \ntheir rates exceed 180 percent revenue to variable cost to determine \nmarket dominance.\n  This legislation would also require the STB to review its regulations \nand rules with respect to barriers that impede a small shippers' \nability to file rate and other complaints against railroads before the \nSTB. The STB would be required to minimize their red tape and barriers \nfor shippers and also to report to Congress on barriers that require \nlegislative action to remedy.\n  Mr. President, this legislation is modest, but it will make a \ndifference for small shippers in this country. The premise of the bill \nis that the STB ought to emphasize competition and where competition \ndoes not exist, the STB needs to make it easier for captive shippers to \nseek relief from unreasonable rates.\n  Next year, the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation will be debating reauthorization legislation on the STB. \nThat will be a very important debate. Senator Rockefeller, I and others \nintend to make sure that one element of that debate will focus on the \nproblems facing small, captive shippers and we consider this \nlegislation as a building block for next year's debate. I hope my \ncolleagues will support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1453. A bill to establish a Commission on Fairness in the \nWorkplace, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Labor and Human \nResources.\n\n\n        THE NATIONAL COMMISSION ON FAIRNESS IN THE WORKPLACE ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the National \nCommission on Fairness in the Workplace Act. This commission will be \ntasked to review the trend of creating more part-time jobs than full-\ntime jobs; assess the relationship between part-time work and wage \nlevels, benefits, earning potential, and productivity; and examine the \npractice of having different wage and benefit levels for part-time and \nfull-time workers. This commission, comprised of representatives of the \nbusiness community, labor, academia and government, will report its \nfindings and recommendations to Congress and the President.\n  I fully recognize that for many individuals, part-time employment is \na perfect solution. Full-time students and individuals wanting to \ncombine work and family responsibilities choose to work part-time. But, \npart-time work should not be a passport to second class status. Often \nthese employees perform the same duties as their full-time \ncounterparts, but for less money and no benefits. And for those \nindividuals seeking employment, too often they can only find work that \nrequires full-time hours, but not full-time pay and benefits.\n  Too many Americans are forced to work two and three part-time jobs to \npay their rent or mortgage, and put food on their tables. Let's not \nforget that employees who work full-time, earning benefits and living \nwages, are often still struggling. How do we expect individuals and \nfamilies to survive on part-time wages and no benefits. Their status \nmay be classified as part-time, but their expenses certainly are not.\n  Employers must strive to provide salaries and benefits that meet the \ndemands of today's circumstances, while searching for ways to increase \nproductivity and remain competitive in a global environment.\n  The recent UPS experience put a national spotlight on this issue; \nworking full-time hours at part-time status and receiving less money \nand fewer benefits than a full-time employee. One of the concessions of \nthe negotiations was that UPS would agree to create 10,000 full-time \njobs from existing part-time positions.\n  A poll of 500 individuals by the University of Connecticut in \nSeptember found strong support for action that would guarantee part-\ntime workers some benefits and compel employers to pay those workers \nhourly wages equal to their full-time counterparts. Part-time employees \nin Connecticut comprise 12 percent of the work-force, less than the 18 \npercent national average.\n  Our work-force is one of our countries most treasured assets. \nEmployees deserve to receive living wages and benefits and we must act \nnow. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the Hartford \nCourant article ``Part-timers' Rights Backed'' be included in the \nRecord and I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n[[Page S12021]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1453\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Commission on \n     Fairness in the Workplace Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., who is urging Congress to \n     set up a committee to study part-time work.\n       ``[Part-time work] shouldn't be a passport to second-class \n     status,'' he said.\n       It seems those in Connecticut agree strongly that part-time \n     work that provides significant pay, benefits and stature must \n     remain an option for families and individuals struggling to \n     satisfy their own needs, those of their children and demands \n     of their careers.\n       Part-timers in Connecticut make up about 12 percent of the \n     work force--less than the 18 percent national average--and \n     most don't want a full-time job, a new Courant/Connecticut \n     Poll shows.\n       But the residents polled by telephone by the University of \n     Connecticut Sept. 9-15 showed remarkable support for \n     government action that would guarantee part-timers some \n     benefits, and compel companies to pay those workers hourly \n     wages equal to their full-time counterparts. Only one in \n     three said they would support laws restricting companies from \n     hiring part-time workers instead of creating full-time jobs.\n       But two-thirds said they would support laws requiring \n     employers to give part-time workers benefits such as health \n     insurance, pensions and vacations. Three out of four of those \n     polled said that there should be no difference in the hourly \n     pay of part- and full-time workers.\n       ``There is backing for `fairness'--especially in hourly \n     rates and for the provision of at least some fringe \n     benefits,'' said G. Donald Ferree Jr., poll director.\n       A majority of the 500 residents polled, however, seemed \n     more interested in making sure that all workers--including \n     part-timers--are paid equitably, than in judging whether jobs \n     should be part or full time, Ferree said.\n       Democrats were more apt than Republicans to support \n     government policies regarding part-time work, as were women, \n     who\n\n[[Page S12022]]\n\n     are more likely than men to work part time, he said.\n       The strong support the poll results show for part-time \n     worker benefits and equal pay did not surprise Joseph F. \n     Brennan, vice president of legislative affairs at the \n     Connecticut Business and Industry Association.\n       ``I think the timing of the poll may have skewed results \n     somewhat because the UPS strike was in the headlines, and \n     general polling at that time seemed to support the workers,'' \n     Brennan said.\n       Polling done in the past by the business association tells \n     a different story, he said, suggesting that residents do not \n     support greater governmental control of general business \n     practices. The association polls, however, have not asked \n     specifically about part-time work.\n       Some business leaders have also argued that state \n     intervention into policies regarding part-time employee pay \n     and benefits could hamper Connecticut's ability to compete \n     with other states for jobs. They have also said that any \n     requirements should come from Congress and be applied \n     uniformly nationwide.\n       A package of state legislative proposals aimed at \n     regulating corporate behavior, including a requirement to pay \n     part-timers the same hourly wage as full-timers doing the \n     same job, made little headway in the General Assembly this \n     year.\n       Union officials say they believe that public sentiment for \n     part-time workers runs deeper than simply timing.\n       ``The people in the poll have said it all--it's about equal \n     pay and equal benefits for equal work,'' said John W. Olsen, \n     president of the state AFL-CIO. ``It's not as much about part \n     and full time anymore.''\n       Olsen said that if part-timers are compensated equally, \n     employers will find it less attractive to use them to replace \n     full-time positions.\n       The issue was central to a demonstration in mid-September \n     against Pratt & Whitney, a division of United Technologies \n     Corp. About 400 workers and supporters, dozens of whom were \n     arrested, gathered in downtown Hartford to protest Pratt's \n     decision to cut contracted full-time cleaning jobs and \n     replace them with part-time, lower-paying positions.\n       While there are instances in Connecticut where workers have \n     been affected by company decisions to replace full-time jobs \n     with low-wage, no-benefit positions, most part-time employees \n     polled said they are not looking for full-time work.\n       Only one out of five part-timers questioned in the poll \n     said they were actively seeking full-time work.\n       ``Part-time work plays a real role in Connecticut, and many \n     engaged in it do not want full-time work instead,'' Ferree \n     said.\n       One other thing the poll made clear, Ferree said, was that \n     the days when one income was deemed enough for a family to \n     live on are over. About half of those polled said their \n     family could live on what the main earner is paid, but nearly \n     as many said that their household needs the income of more \n     than one person.\n       On the job, some of the time:\n       Connecticut residents show remarkable support for requiring \n     employers to pay part-time workers at the same hourly rate as \n     full-time workers and to provide part-time workers some \n     benefits. Those polled also strongly believe it is important \n     to preserve part-time employment as a work option.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Courant/Connecticut Poll on part-time workers was \n     conducted by the University of Connecticut from Sept. 9-15. \n     Five hundred randomly selected people were interviewed by \n     telephone. Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole \n     number and may not add up to 100.\n       The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 5 \n     percentage points. This means there is a 1-in-20 chance that \n     the results would differ by more than 5 points in either \n     direction from the results of a survey of all adult \n     residents.\n       A poll's margin of error increases as the sample size \n     shrinks. Results for a subgroup within the poll have a higher \n     margin of error.\n       The telephone numbers were generated by a computer in \n     proportion to the number of adults living in each area. The \n     actual respondent in each household also was selected at \n     random.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url":

ADVISORY ROLE FOR THE SENATE IN \n                THE SELECTION OF SUPREME COURT JUSTICES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Byrd) submitted the following \nresolution; which as referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 146\n\n       Whereas, Article II, Section 2 of the United States \n     Constitution authorizes the President to appoint Judges of \n     the Supreme Court ``by and with the Advice and Consent of the \n     Senate'';\n       Whereas, the Senate has exercised its ``Consent'' function \n     with due diligence through extensive hearings and \n     deliberation prior to voting on nominees to the Court;\n       Whereas, the Senate has not historically exercised its \n     ``Advice'' function with the exception of a limited \n     consultation with the President on the selection of a nominee \n     in advance of the President making such a nomination;\n       Whereas, there is no systematic method for selecting \n     Supreme Court nominees, with the\n\n[[Page S12024]]\n\n     President having historically proceeded on an ad hoc basis to \n     consider a limited number of individuals before making his \n     nomination;\n       Whereas, there is an enormous pool of legal talent who \n     could become Supreme Court nominees;\n       Whereas, in one case where the Senate exercised influence \n     on the selection of a nominee, it was to replace Justice \n     Oliver Wendell Holmes with Justice Benjamin Cardozo;\n       Whereas, the importance of having the best and brightest \n     judges is reflected in the fact that the Supreme Court has \n     decided numerous significant cases by a one-vote margin; and\n       Whereas, it would be useful to create a pool of recognized \n     candidates of superior quality for consideration by the \n     President; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate should better fulfill its \n     ``Advice'' function under Article II, Section 2 by having the \n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary establish a pool of \n     possible Supreme Court nominees for the President to \n     consider, based on suggestions from Federal and State judges, \n     distinguished lawyers and law professors, and others with a \n     similar level of insight into the suitability of individuals \n     considered for appointment to the Supreme Court.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \ndiscuss an idea which has the potential to have a major impact on the \nrule of law in the United States by having the U.S. Senate exercise its \nadvise function under the advise and consent clause of the Constitution \nto advise Presidents on who the nominee should be for the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, as we all know, is the \nultimate arbiter of determining what the law will be. In the session \nwhich ended last June, the Supreme Court of the United States handed \ndown historic, really monumental decisions on dying, religion, speech, \ndue process, States rights, congressional power, among many other \ndecisions.\n  The Constitution of the United States established the Congress, in \narticle I, the President in article II, the Court in article III, with \nan implicit suggestion that the legislative body was preeminent, the \nexecutive second, and the judiciary third.\n  But we know since the decision of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates in Marbury versus Madison, the Supreme Court of the United \nStates has been the preeminent institution, because the Supreme Court \nof the United States has the last word.\n  The Supreme Court Justice, the late Chief Justice Charles Evans \nHughes, said that the Constitution is what the Supreme Court says it \nis.\n  We talk a great deal about the legislature having the power to make \nthe laws and the courts having the limited power to interpret the laws, \nbut the reality is, the brutal fact of life is that the Supreme Court \nof the United States makes the avant-garde decisions on the periphery \nand on the horizons of the law.\n  We can do better, I submit, in the deliberations, the decisions of \nthe Supreme Court of the United States by a closer focus on the quality \nof those men and women who go to the Supreme Court.\n  I expect our distinguished colleague, Senator Byrd, to join us on the \nfloor in a few minutes to make a few comments about this idea, as the \npermanent resident scholar of the Senate and a great authority on \nconstitutional law and a recent losing litigant in the decision of the \nSupreme Court of the United States in the line-item veto case, where \nSenator Byrd, along with Senator Moynihan, Senator Hatfield, and \nSenator Levin challenged the line-item veto in the case of Raines \nversus Byrd.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States, in that decision, ruled that \nSenator Byrd and the other Senators did not have standing to challenge \nthe constitutionality of line-item veto--a curious decision. In my \nopinion, who would have greater status to challenge the \nconstitutionality of line-item veto than sitting Senators, especially \nthe existing chairman of Appropriations, Senator Hatfield, and the \nformer chairman of Appropriations, Senator Byrd? But that was the \nruling of the Supreme Court.\n  When we take a look historically, Mr. President, at what the Supreme \nCourt has decided, and in many, many cases by 5 to 4 decisions, it is \nreally astonishing the authority and the power wielded by the Supreme \nCourt of the United States on the lives of every man, woman and child \nin this country, in a fundamental sense, more so than what the Congress \ndoes, and in an equally fundamental sense, more so than what the \nPresident does and the bureaucracy of the United States.\n  In the famous Lochner versus New York case in 1905, the Supreme Court \nstruck down an early attempt at labor regulation by holding that a law \nlimiting bakers to a 60-hour workweek violated the liberty of contracts \nsecured by the due process clause of the 14th amendment. It was a 5-4 \ndecision holding up the efforts of the legislative branch to limit the \nworkweek to 60 hours in the interests of public welfare.\n  In Hammer versus Dagenhart in 1918, the Supreme Court, again by a 5-4 \ndecision, struck down a labor law. This time the Keating-Owen Federal \nChild Labor Act, on the grounds that the commerce clause did not give \nCongress the power to completely forbid certain categories of commerce.\n  In a celebrated decision, Furman versus Georgia in 1972, the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, again by a 5-4 decision, struck down the \ndeath penalty provision under the cruel and unusual punishment clause \nof the eighth amendment.\n  We have had a series of very controversial decisions where the Court \nhas imposed seriatim limitations on what States may do by way of \nimposing the death penalty.\n  In 1982, in Plyler versus Doe, the Supreme Court, again by a 5-4 \ndecision, invoked the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment to \nstrike down a Texas statute which denied State funding for the \neducation of illegal immigrant children and authorized local school \nboards to deny enrollment to such children.\n  Again in a 5-4 decision in Webster versus Reproductive Health \nServices in 1989, the Supreme Court, in a case widely viewed as a \nretreat from Roe versus Wade, upheld various restrictions on the \navailability of abortion, including a ban on the use of public funds \nand facilities for abortions, and required viability testing after 20 \nweeks. Again, on a 5-4 decision in 1990 in United States v. Eichman, \nthe Court invalidated State and Federal laws prohibiting flag \ndesecration on the grounds that they violated the first amendment.\n\n  In Adarand versus Pena, 1995, the Court held that Federal racial \nclassifications like those of a State must be viewed under strict \nscrutiny standards.\n  In the course of the past 5 years, on decisions from 1993-1997, there \nhave been 74 decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States by a \n5-4 decision.\n  Mr. President, when there is a vacancy in the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, there is no existing systematic way for the selection \nprocess to occur with respect to the Senate involvement under the \nadvice section of the Advice and Consent Clause. We do know \nhistorically that when Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes retired in 1931, \nthere was unique concern about who his replacement should be and that \nwas because of the unique status which Justice Holmes had on the life \nof the law; the author of ``Common Law'' in 1881, member of the Supreme \nJudicial Court of Massachusetts for 20 years from 1891 to 1901, and a \nmember of the Supreme Court of the United States for 30 years, until \n1931, the author of perhaps the most brilliant decisions on clear and \npresent danger, a Justice extraordinarily gifted.\n  When he was set to retire, there was unusual public concern about who \nhis replacement would be. President Hoover was reluctant to appoint a \nNew Yorker when many people suggested Benjamin Cardozo, a very \ndistinguished judge on the court of appeals in the State of New York. \nThe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, George W. Norris, made an \neffort to persuade the President that Benjamin Cardozo ought to be the \nreplacement for Oliver Wendell Holmes, but it was the chairman of the \nForeign Relations Committee, William E. Borah, who is historically \ncredited with making the critical suggestion when President Hoover \nhanded Senator Borah a list on which he had ranked individuals whom he \nwas considering for nomination in descending order of preference. The \nlist contained 10 names, and the name on the bottom of the list was \nBenjamin Cardozo. The Senator looked at the list and replied, ``Your \nlist was all right, but you handed it to me upside down.'' And \nPresident Hoover finally conceded, even though reluctant to appoint a \nDemocrat and even though reluctant to\n\n[[Page S12025]]\n\nappoint another nominee from the State of New York. Benjamin Cardozo \nwas appointed on February 15, 1932, and the nomination won instant and \nunanimous approval by the U.S. Senate.\n  In modern times, we have been very diligent in the exercise of our \nconsent function. The hearings in the Judiciary Committee have focused \nenormous public attention when the nominees come forward because at \nthat point in time there is an awareness of the importance of the \nSupreme Court. The decisions which come down, and the 74 decisions \nwhich have come down in the last 5 years 5-4, really do not create much \nof a public ripple, do not attract very much public attention, even \nthough these decisions are of enormous, enormous importance.\n  Because of this background, Mr. President, it is my thinking that the \nSenate ought to give consideration to establishing a panel of \nprospective Supreme Court nominees for submission to the President \nunder our advice function, under the Advice and Consent Clause. \nObviously, it is a matter that the President can take or leave, but at \nleast we ought to make that pool available.\n  I advance this in the closing days of the first session of the 105th \nCongress so that our colleagues can think about it over the intervening \nseveral months, and I will seek cosponsors, seek advice from my \ncolleagues. I have talked it over with a number of the Members of the \nSenate, including members of the Judiciary Committee and the \nleadership. There has been a very responsive note about it. I have \ntalked to some on the Supreme Court of the United States. The effort \nwould be to try to diversify the background. Few would know, and many \nwould be surprised to learn, that of the nine Justices on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, eight of them came from prior judicial \nappointments.\n  From time to time when there is a suggestion that somebody be \nnominated who has a broader background--perhaps as a former Governor, \nperhaps as a former Cabinet officer, with more background--there is \nsome reluctance. It is safer to appoint someone who has been on a \ncourt. It may well be, I think it is true, that the country would be \nbetter served by having a Supreme Court which had a more diverse \nbackground. One thought would be to ask for suggestions from, say, the \nchief judges of the Federal circuit courts of appeals to suggest \nindividuals whom they know in their circuit--distinguished lawyers, \ndistinguished professors, people from all walks of life; or to ask the \nchief judges of the U.S. district courts; or the chief justices of the \nsupreme courts of the various States; or a cross-sampling of judges; or \nthe bar associations of the States; or the American Bar Association; or \nfrom the public at large.\n  Then the Judiciary Committee might well establish a practice--and \nthis is a matter of flexibility--where we would inquire into the \nbackgrounds of the individuals and compile a pool of prospective \nSupreme Court nominees. There are thousands of lawyers at this moment \nin America who would love to be judges, and all of them would love to \nbe Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States as a very high \nhonor and an opportunity to serve in a very, very important position. \nThere is enormous legal talent in America, and very little of it, \nnecessarily so, is called to the attention of the President of the \nUnited States when a vacancy occurs. From time to time you hear about a \nnomination and somebody was considered, and the next time a vacancy \noccurs that person is pretty much automatically put into the spot.\n  I think it is not betraying the confidence to retell a story about \nSenator Howard Baker, our distinguished majority leader who later \nbecame chief of staff to President Reagan. When Justice Potter Stewart \nleft the bench in 1987, Senator Baker said to President Reagan, ``I'll \nprepare a list of possible replacements for the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.'' According to Senator Baker, President Reagan \nresponded, ``Do you think you could put Judge Bork on the list?'' \nrather an interesting comment, perhaps even a curious comment, coming \nfrom the President of the United States. Of course he had the power to \nmake the determination, certainly more than the power to decide who \nwould be on the list among those who would be considered.\n  So I advance this idea, Mr. President, as I say, in the closing days \nof this session, with my stated intention to discuss the matter further \nwith my colleagues in an effort to develop more ideas as to how we \nmight function and how we might activate and motivate the advice \nfunction of the Advice and Consent Clause.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a very brief summary statement of the \nkernel of this idea be printed; a form of the resolution be printed \nwith the caveat that it is not intended to be final but a suggested \nform; and that a listing of the Supreme Court decisions decided by 5-4 \nfrom 1994, 1995 and 1996--since I do not want to take the time to put \nthem in the Record at this time--be printed, showing the tremendously \nimportant matters which are decided by a single Justice having such a \nprofound impact on the law in the United States.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Summary Statement\n\n       I suggest to my Senate colleagues that we consider \n     exercising our constitutional ``advice'' function under the \n     ``advice and consent'' clause by establishing a panel of \n     possible Supreme Court nominees for consideration by the \n     President when a vacancy occurs.\n       There is no doubt about the great power exercised by the \n     Supreme Court since the Court itself decided in Marbury v. \n     Madison that it had the last word on interpretation of the \n     relative powers of the Congress, the Executive Branch, the \n     states and disputes between any parties who sought a \n     constitutional adjudication.\n       The Supreme Court has the final say on what happens from \n     conception to death.\n       In the last week of this June, the Court handed down \n     historic/monumental decisions on dying, religion, speech, due \n     process, states rights and congressional power. Several of \n     the cases were decided by a single justice on a 5 to 4 vote. \n     One case, following two other decisions in the past 2 years, \n     reversed six decades of firmly established constitutional \n     authority on the supremacy of federal laws over states rights \n     under the commerce clause.\n       Without disparaging the Court's current personnel, it is \n     worth noting that seldom are the justices compared to Oliver \n     Wendell Holmes, Louis Dembitz Brandeis or Benjamin Cardozo.\n       Wile some nominees get strict scrutiny during the \n     confirmation process, the Senate has traditionally been AWOL \n     on its constitutional responsibility for ``advice.''\n       For the Supreme Court especially, we should seek the best \n     and brightest.\n       To create a panel of the best and brightest, I suggest we \n     call on State Supreme Court Chief Justices, Chief Judges from \n     the 13 Federal Courts of Appeals, Chief Judges from the 94 \n     Federal District Court panels, academic and lawyers' \n     associations and others to make suggestions. The Judiciary \n     Committee could then review and evaluate those suggested for \n     submission of a panel to the President.\n       Frequent complaints are heard about nominations to satisfy \n     a specific constituency. With sufficient early outreach, we \n     can get diversity in the best and the brightest without \n     accepting lesser qualifications.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        Supreme Court Decisions\n\n                           october 1996 term\n\n       Abrams v.

I noticed the arrival of our very distinguished \ncolleague, Senator Robert Byrd, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank my very distinguished colelague, the \nsenior Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, for yielding to me and \nfor allowing me to be a cosponsor of the legislation which he has just \nbeen discussing before the Senate. I am proud to be one of his \ncolleagues. I have great admiration for Senator Specter and admiration \nfor his knowledge of the law. He has had long and varied experiences. I \nadmire him for that experience.\n  Senator Specter is a good lawyer. If I wanted a lawyer to plead my \ncase to the Supreme Court, I think I would like Arlen Specter. If I \nwere President of the United States--of course, I guess that will never \nbecome a reality--I would consider him for Attorney General, even \nthough he is on the other side of the aisle. He calls the shots like \nthey are.\n  I am pleased to join with my distinguished colleague in introducing \nthe legislation. Our proposal is aimed at helping the Senate to fulfill \nits constitutional duty by directing the Judiciary Committee to \nestablish a pool of the best and the brightest Supreme Court candidates \nfor the President's consideration whenever there is a vacancy on the \nCourt--the best and the brightest.\n  I personally do not promote the idea that we must make diversity a \ncriterion. I have no problem with diversity, as long as the chosen ones \nare chosen because of their merit--their merit. That is what we seek to \ndo here. We want the best and the brightest--not because they are \nRepublicans, or not because they are Democrats, necessarily, but \nbecause they are the best and the brightest.\n  As anyone who has ever read the Constitution knows, one of the most \nimportant differences between the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives is the Senate's constitutional duty to advise and \nconsent on Presidential nominations. Specifically, that power which is \ncontained in article II, section 2, stipulates that the President, ``by \nand with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint \nAmbassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of\n\n[[Page S12028]]\n\nthe supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose \nAppointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be \nestablished by Law.''\n  While it may be true that the Senate has traditionally given a \nPresident great leeway in choosing his executive branch subordinates, \nespecially those in Cabinet and sub-Cabinet positions, such deference \non the part of the Senate has generally not applied to judicial \nnominations, particularly Supreme Court nominations. On the contrary, \nthe Senate has historically exercised great caution to ensure that it \ncarries out its responsibility, a responsibility that is a fundamental \nelement of the separation of powers established in the Constitution.\n  While we have been very diligent in granting our consent, I believe, \nas does Senator Specter, that the Senate has been less than energized \nwith respect to the offering of its advice. The Constitution refers to \nthe ``Advice and Consent.''\n  It doesn't just refer to the word ``consent,'' nor does it put the \nword ``consent'' in front of the word ``advise.'' It uses the phrase \n``advise and consent of the Senate.'' Too often, as the American people \nare acutely aware, nominations to the High Court have become embroiled \nin special interest battles. All too often, the qualifications of a \nnominee have been aside as outside forces--interest groups and so on--\nhave sought to use a nomination as a means of furthering their \nparticular ideological agenda. That is not what the Supreme Court is \nfor. Too often, the eventual loser in the process is not just the \nindividual who has been nominated, but also the Court and its \nintegrity, and also, more than that even, the people of the United \nStates--the whole people, not just some particular interest group, but \nall of the people.\n  Mr. President, in an era when the nine life-tenured Justices who sit \non our highest Court routinely decide questions that go to the very \nheart of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we cannot afford \nto have anything less than the most highly qualified individuals \nserving on that Court.\n  While I do not mean to disparage any of the current Justices, the \nfact remains that, more and more, nominees are being selected for \nreasons that go beyond their qualifications, that go beyond their \nabilities, that go beyond their dedication, their reverence for and \ndedication to the Constitution. Accordingly, Senator Specter has come \nto the conclusion--and he has allowed me to join him--that the best way \nto resolve this problem and the best way for the Senate to undertake \nits advice responsibility is to direct the Judiciary Committee, after \nconsultation with the finest legal minds in our country, to establish a \npanel of potential nominees that would be made available to the \nPresident--this President, or any other President. In so doing, it is \nour hope that we can begin to depoliticize the nomination process and, \nin turn, help restore to the High Court the esteem, much of which has \nbeen lost over the past few years.\n  In closing, I again want to thank Senator Specter for his \nthoughtfulness, for his vision, as we have worked on the resolution. I \nknow that he shares my concern that the Senate has not only this \nresponsibility, but it has a duty, a constitutional duty, to ensure \nthat the highest Court in the land is comprised of the best and the \nbrightest talent that our Nation has to offer. I hope that others will \njoin us in this effort.\n  Mr. SPECTER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, for \nthose comments about the substance of the resolution. When Senator Byrd \njoins on an issue of constitutional import, there is great weight. I \nthank him on a personal level for his very kind comments about me. When \nhe started to talk about an appointment of Arlen Specter if Senator \nByrd were President, I was about to start a rumor on ``Byrd for \nPresident.'' I still might. If it was the Attorney General job, I am \nnot so sure, but if it had been the Supreme Court he was talking about, \nI might have had a little more motivation on that.\n  In the case of Raines versus Byrd, where Senator Byrd challenged the \nline-item veto, in which a curious decision of the Supreme Court said \nthat Senator Byrd, Senator Hatfield, Senator Moynihan, and Senator \nLevin didn't have standing, that goes to show you we need more advice \nfrom the Senate in anticipation. When Senator Byrd said he might have \nasked me to argue the case, I have argued three cases in the Supreme \nCourt--most recently, in March of 1994, on the Base Closing Commission. \nIt was the fastest 30 minutes of my life, to appear before the Supreme \nCourt, and 7 of those sitting nine Justices had appeared before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. I noted a certain tenor of questions from \nthe Court, similar to the ones, I had asked when they appeared as \nnominees for the Supreme Court. Although, I was not successful in that \ncase, the Court being reluctant to upset 300 base closings, the Harvard \nLaw Review published a detailed critique of the case and found that my \nposition was right on the separation of powers. That was just a word or \ntwo on a parenthetical expression.\n   Mr. President, I am going to revise my approach a little bit and at \nthis time formally offer this resolution on behalf of Senator Byrd and \nmyself on the advise and consent function. I realize that it cannot be \nacted on in this session, but it will be a guidepost for revision after \nconsultation with our colleagues.\n  I again thank my colleague, Senator Byrd, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12023-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 147--RELATIVE TO AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY, PRODUCTION OF \n                     DOCUMENTS, AND REPRESENTATION\n\n  Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to.\n\n                              S.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) intercity rail passenger service is an essential \n     component of a national intermodal passenger transportation \n     system;\n       (2) Amtrak is facing a financial crisis, with growing and \n     substantial debt obligations severely limiting its ability to \n     cover operating costs and jeopardizing its long-term \n     viability;\n       (3) immediate action is required to improve Amtrak's \n     financial condition if Amtrak is to survive;\n       (4) all of Amtrak's stakeholders, including labor, \n     management, and the Federal government, must participate in \n     efforts to reduce Amtrak's costs and increase its revenues;\n       (5) additional flexibility is needed to allow Amtrak to \n     operate in a businesslike manner in order to manage costs and \n     maximize revenues;\n       (6) Amtrak should ensure that new management flexibility \n     produces cost savings without compromising safety;\n       (7) Amtrak's management should be held accountable to \n     ensure that all investment by the Federal Government and \n     State governments is used effectively to improve the quality \n     of service and the long-term financial health of Amtrak;\n       (8) Amtrak and its employees should proceed quickly with \n     proposals to modify collective bargaining agreements to make \n     more efficient use of manpower and to realize cost savings \n     which are necessary to reduce Federal financial assistance;\n       (9) Amtrak and intercity bus service providers should work \n     cooperatively and develop coordinated intermodal \n     relationships promoting seamless transportation services \n     which enhance travel options and increase operating \n     efficiencies;\n       (10) Amtrak's Strategic Business Plan calls for the \n     establishment of a dedicated source of capital funding for \n     Amtrak in order to ensure that Amtrak will be able to fulfill \n     the goals of maintaining--\n       (A) a national passenger rail system; and\n       (B) that system without Federal operating assistance; and\n       (11) Federal financial assistance to cover operating losses \n     incurred by Amtrak should be eliminated by the year 2002.\n\n                            TITLE I--REFORMS\n\n                    Subtitle a--Operational Reforms\n\n     SEC. 101.

The independent assessment shall \n     be based on an objective analysis of Amtrak's funding needs.\n       (c) Certain Factors To Be Taken Into Account.--The \n     independent assessment shall take into account all relevant \n     factors, including Amtrak's--\n       (1) cost allocation process and procedures;\n       (2) expenses related to intercity rail passenger service, \n     commuter service, and any other service Amtrak provides;\n       (3) Strategic Business Plan, including Amtrak's projected \n     expenses, capital needs, ridership, and revenue forecasts; \n     and\n       (4) Amtrak's assets and liabilities.\n\n     For purposes of paragraph (3), in the capital needs part of \n     its Strategic Business Plan Amtrak shall distinguish between \n     that portion of the capital required for the Northeast \n     corridor and that required outside the Northeast corridor, \n     and shall include rolling stock requirements, including \n     capital leases, ``state of good repair'' requirements, and \n     infrastructure improvements.\n       (d) Bidding Practices.--\n       (1) Study.--The independent assessment also shall determine \n     whether, and to what extent, Amtrak has performed each year \n     during the period from 1992 through 1996 services under \n     contract at amounts less than the cost to Amtrak of \n     performing such services with respect to any activity other \n     than the provision of intercity rail passenger \n     transportation, or mail or express transportation.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) The impending retirement of the baby boom generation \n     will severely strain our already overburdened entitlement \n     system, necessitating increased reliance on pension and other \n     personal savings.\n       (2) Studies have found that less than a third of Americans \n     have even tried to calculate how much they will need to have \n     saved by retirement, and that less than 20 percent are very \n     confident they will have enough money to live comfortably \n     throughout their retirement.\n       (3) A leading obstacle to expanding retirement savings is \n     the simple fact that far too many Americans--particularly the \n     young--are either unaware of, or without the knowledge and \n     resources necessary to take advantage of, the extensive \n     benefits offered by our retirement savings system.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act--\n       (1) to advance the public's knowledge and understanding of \n     retirement savings and its critical importance to the future \n     well-being of American workers and their families;\n       (2) to provide for a periodic, bipartisan national \n     retirement savings summit in conjunction with the White House \n     to elevate the issue of savings to national prominence; and\n       (3) to initiate the development of a broad-based, public \n     education program to encourage and enhance individual \n     commitment to a personal retirement savings strategy.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, during the debate over the North \nAmerican Free Trade Agreement, I quoted President Thomas Jefferson who \nwrote, in 1785, to his fellow Virginian, James Monroe: ``I would say to \nevery nation on earth, by treaty, your people shall trade freely with \nus, and ours with you.''\n  In that same spirit, the 103d Congress of the United States passed \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement and the nations of Canada, the \nUnited States, and Mexico began to open their borders. The resulting \nrising tide has already begun to lift the economic well-being of all \nAmericans.\n  We now begin a similar debate over the President's request for fast-\ntrack trade negotiating authority. This gives me another opportunity to \nemphasize my commitment to free and open trade and pledge that I will \nwork hard to enact the President's request. I am pleased that the \nproposal coming from the Finance Committee has attracted such broad \nbipartisan support.\n  My colleagues need to understand how important fast track is. Fast \ntrack provides that Congress will consider trade agreements within \nmandatory deadlines, with limited debate and without amendment. Its \npower has been held by every President for over 20 years, both \nRepublicans and Democrats.\n  In his book, ``American Trade Politics,'' Professor I.M. Destler, \nnoted that fast track rose from Congress' natural inclination to shift \nresponsibility for negotiating liberal trade agreements to the \nPresident while still maintaining its constitutional authority over \nforeign commerce.\n\n       By delegating responsibility to the executive and by \n     helping fashion a system that protected legislators from one-\n     sided restrictive pressures, Congress made it possible for \n     successive presidents to maintain and expand the liberal \n     trade order.\n\n  In other words, the fast-track mechanism is the result of years of \npractical experience by our predecessors. And from it, the United \nStates has been a leader in opening markets throughout the world. \nImplementation of the Uruguay round, establishment of the World Trade \nOrganization, and unification of the markets of NAFTA countries are \njust a few of the success stories arising from the grant of fast-track \nauthority to the President.\n  Unfortunately, far too many Americans have been misled into believing \nthat free trade agreements are bad for the working men and women of our \ncountry. A late July NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll which simply \nasked if you would support fast track to negotiate more free trade \nagreements, a full 61 percent said ``No.'' But these figures are \nbeginning to change.\n  For too long, those who would build walls around our borders have \npointed to the isolated cases of job disruptions to argue that trade \nonly means job loss. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky testified recently how in \nour booming economy more than 11 million Americans now work in jobs \nsupported by exports and that these jobs pay 13 to 16 percent above the \nnational average wage. Exports have increased dramatically across the \ncountry with 47 of 50 States registering significant export growth over \nthe last 4 years.\n  Exports from California are up 45 percent, Michigan--68 percent, \nIllinois--64 percent, Ohio--42 percent, Texas--40 percent, Nebraska--54 \npercent, North Dakota--76 percent, and Montana--52 percent. Exports \nfrom Florida, Rhode Island, Louisiana, and West Virginia have increased \nmore than 30 percent. States from New York to Utah also have posted \ndouble digit increases.\n  Instead of the giant sucking sound warned by many opponents of free \ntrade, one of the first consequences of NAFTA was the swift relocation \nof some auto plants from Mexico to the United States.\n  In my home State, increased trade has resulted in an enormous growth \nin exports and increased wealth for Arizona families. We exported goods \ntotaling $10.5 billion in 1996, up 93 percent from 1992. Total exports \nfrom Arizona to NAFTA countries alone increased by 52 percent between \n1993 and 1996. Even exports to the European Union, which is not a \nmember of NAFTA, increased 54 percent during this period.\n  These increases would be meaningless but for one important economic \ntruth: exports mean jobs. Today, the unemployment rate is at one of the \nlowest points in the last 20 years. An article in the Wall Street \nJournal about job growth in the St. Louis area and around the Nation \nstated:\n\n       . . . here . . ., it is evident that, with a buoyant \n     economy slashing unemployment to a quarter-century low and \n     U.S. exports booming, Mr. Clinton will surely win by the time \n     the issue is resolved this fall . . .\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n\n[[Page S12038]]\n\n\n       In the St. Louis area alone, more than 1,200 companies are \n     now exporting, up from 600 five years ago . . .\n       . . . as more companies flourish by exporting, a silent \n     majority favoring more trade is forming in much of the \n     country. One recent poll found 78% of respondents favoring \n     expanded trade ``on a reciprocal basis.''\n\n  Without fast track legislation, we have missed a number of \nopportunities to be involved in trade agreements throughout the world. \nThe Southern Cone Common Market, known as MERCOSUR, is expanding to set \nup a regional trade bloc that will not include the United States. The \nGovernment of Chile has already concluded trade agreements with Canada \nand Mexico. In Asia, ASEAN is setting up a free trade area without \nUnited States' participation. The EU has begun to set up agreements in \nthe Western Hemisphere, and is currently negotiating trade agreements \nwith Chile and Mexico.\n  Despite these missed opportunities, the United States can still \ncontinue its pre-eminent leadership role on the world economic stage. \nWe need to complete the negotiations on Chile's accession to NAFTA, to \nbegin building the Free Trade Area for the Americas, and to pursue the \nlong-term commitment to eliminate barriers to trade with other Asia \nPacific nations in the Asia Pacific economic cooperation forum. Some \nMembers of Congress have even proposed negotiating free trade \nagreements with other trading partners, such as the European Union or \nSub-Saharan African countries.\n  The Clinton administration has noted that future multilateral \nnegotiations may also require congressional implementation. For \nexample, negotiations to further liberalize trade in services and \nagriculture and to establish new rules for subsidies are likely to \nbegin by the year 2000. Moreover, the United States and other \ngovernments have expressed interest in pursuing multilateral \nnegotiations on issues related to labor and environmental standards, \ncompetition policy, and rules for foreign investment. The success of \nthese negotiations will hinge on the President's fast track authority.\n  Finally, I think that it is important to recognize the message being \nsent by the recent decline in the world's stock markets, Those who \nargue that we should only look inward and forgo opportunities to open \nmarkets around the world fail to recognize that we are now moving \ntoward a single world economy. Dramatic market declines in Hong Kong \nare felt on Wall Street, in South America, and in Europe. It is \nimportant that we not listen to the siren song of protectionism at this \nmoment in history. Instead, our Nation must signal its support of free \ntrade by supporting fast-track legislation. Fast track will promote \nopen trade and create wealth around our planet. The benefits are \nobvious.\n  The editorial pages of American newspapers have almost uniformly \ncalled for swift enactment of fast track. These newspapers observed \nlong ago that delicate negotiations with foreign leaders go nowhere \nwhen these negotiations must first be approved by 535 congressional \nSecretaries of State.\n  The Christian, Science Monitor states:\n\n       There should be no doubt that much of the growing U.S. and \n     world prosperity in the past two decades--indeed in the past \n     half century--is a result of global trade expansion . . . \n     President Clinton should press ahead decisively now. Benefits \n     outweigh drawbacks. History is on his side.\n\n  The Washington Post says:\n\n       Economies that are open to trade and foreign investment \n     grow more quickly and lift their populations out of poverty \n     more quickly than economies that are closed.\n\n  The Journal of Commerce says:\n\n       . . . the real issue is the unwieldy nature of negotiating \n     with each member of Congress, a situation that would \n     encourage foreign trading partners to hold back their best \n     offers knowing Congress could second-guess the deal later, \n     leading to delays and weaker trade policy.\n       Mr. Clinton should directly and honestly address the fears \n     of average Americans and use the bully pulpit to explain how \n     global competition ultimately improves the U.S. competitive \n     position. Only then will Americans better understand why \n     their smart, innovative companies and hard-working people \n     stand to benefit globally from open markets and fast-track \n     authority.\n\n  The Arizona Daily News-Sun correctly argues:\n\n       . . . enterprise free of the bureaucratic costs of trade \n     ``quotas'' and tariffs only raise the cost of doing business \n     for American businesses selling to foreign markets and result \n     in higher prices to consumers. Capitalism is not a zero-sum \n     game.\n\n  And, finally, USA Today states:\n\n       Congressional dithering over trade agreements is the kiss \n     of death. Let the president negotiate.\n\n  I could not agree more.\n  The commonsense perception of the negative consequences of high \ntariffs was well understood by Americans who engaged in the great \ntariff debates of the last century. It was understood by many of our \nFounding Fathers, by committed free traders in the 19th century, and by \nsupporters of free trade today who argue persistently that tariffs are \nunfair taxes on an already overtaxed public and an impediment to \nprosperity.\n  There are, of course, other arguments at stake that transcend \npartisan economic values. Under the benefits of NAFTA, Mexico has moved \ndramatically away from statism, protectionism, and the reflexively \nanti-American, anticapitalist left wing policies that have kept Mexico \nso firmly rooted in the Third World. Had we rejected NAFTA and denied \nMexico the benefits of enlightened engagement with the world, we may \nvery well have provoked a return to those policies which are so \ninimical to our own interests.\n  I have long argued that free trade agreements help promote democratic \nfreedoms in countries around the world. Support for free trade, as \nexemplified by vote for fast-track authority, is another way to help \nensure that many, many people are able to live in a free and prospering \nenvironment.\n  In conclusion, I urge my colleagues not to reject this golden \nopportunity to solidify the global free trade regime that we have \ncreated. Instead of heeding the cries of protectionism and throwing our \ncountry down a path of eventual economic ruin, we should vote to \ncontinue prosperity from Wall Street to Main Street America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12037-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12038]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THE HAWAII HOUSING AUTHORITY\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Public Housing Management \nAssessment Program was established under the National Affordable \nHousing Act of 1990 to ensure that public housing functions as a well-\nmanaged enterprise on a uniform, nationwide basis. The PHMAP was \ndesigned to institute a system of accountability that would help the \nU.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development monitor and evaluate \nmanagement operations of housing authorities nationwide. PHMAP scores \nare based on ranking in seven areas: vacancy rate and unit turnaround \ntime, modernization, rents uncollected, work orders, inspection of \nunits and systems, financial management, resident services, and \ncommunity building.\n  The Hawaii Housing Authority is ranked the 29th largest authority of \n4,000 housing authorities in the country. Last month, HUD announced \nthat the HHA received a 92.5 score and high-performer status for its \nmanagement program under PHMAP. This enables the State of Hawaii to \ncontinue to receive its share of Federal funding, and allows HHA \nmaximum flexibility in using those federal funds.\n  I would like to congratulate Hawaii Gov. Benjamin J. Cayetano, Ms. \nSharon R. Yamada, executive director of the Hawaii Housing Authority, \nand the extraordinary staff of the HHA for this outstanding \nachievement. I proudly commend the staff of HHA for their dedication, \nhard work, and detailed attention to serving their housing customers. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12038-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12038-S12039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PUBLICATION OF THE SWISS BANKS' DORMANT ACCOUNT LIST\n\n Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I rise today briefly to discuss \nthe publication of the latest list of dormant accounts in Swiss banks.\n  On October 29, 1997, the Swiss Bankers Association published its \nsecond list of dormant accounts. The list contains some 3,700 names of \naccount holders that have not been heard from since May 9, 1945, the \nconclusion of the Second World War. This is the second time the Swiss \nBankers Association has published such a list, the first time being on \nJuly 23, 1997. On that occasion, a great number of names appeared on \nthat list that had proven to be either Nazis or those that were unable \nto obtain their accounts despite repeated attempts to do so.\n\n[[Page S12039]]\n\n  The latest list, contains the names of Johann Rohani and Anna \nRohanny, of Amsterdam. Yesterday afternoon, I heard from the Rohany's \ndaughter, Susan Unger, who informed my staff that these people were her \nparents. She went on to say that her mother had tried and been turned \ndown in 1968 trying to claim the funds which were hers. Moreover, as \nlate as October 1, of this year, she tried to claim the account and was \nturned down. Yet, when one looks at the latest list, it is inescapable \nthat these are the same names. Apparently, the accounting firm looking \nfor the accounts failed to check her parents' names on the then-pending \nlists. This is terribly unfortunate. Mrs. Unger has tried and tried to \nobtain funds that were legitimately hers and yet, she and her mother \nhave been denied.\n  What is even more bothersome is the fact that while the accounting \nfirm turned her down 1 month ago, and that her parents' names appear on \nthe new list, how many others I wonder, are in the same situation. How \nmany have been turned down, with looking for names appearing on the \nfirst list, when they might well have appeared on this new list? We \nwould have a better idea if the second list had been published in full \nlike the first list. This one was not, it was only available on the \nInternet, through a search mechanism, not a full printout of the names, \nmaking it immensely more difficult, if not impossible to find names, if \nyou do not see all of them.\n  Mr. President, the Swiss banks have a long way to go before they can \nregain the respectability they once had. Continued indifference to \ncases such as this are very unfortunate. I wish for the sake of the \nclaimants they would come to their senses and do what is right. One can \nonly hope.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12038-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               CHILD CARE\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, on October 23, 1997, President \nClinton convened the first ever White House Conference on Child Care. \nThis important summit examined one of the most critical issues facing \nAmerican families today, the need for safe, affordable, quality child \ncare. I rise today to commend the President for working to focus public \nattention on this very important matter, and to urge the Senate to move \nquickly to address the critical issues facing us with regard to our \nchildren's future.\n  Mr. President, it has long been my view that our children are our \ngreatest national resource and must number among our country's highest \npriorities. Nationwide, nearly 10 million preschool children spend a \npart of their day in child care, and there are many more school-age \nchildren who spend portions of their afternoons under the supervision \nof someone other than a parent when the school day ends. These children \nneed care that will enable them to learn and grow, while keeping them \nsafe, healthy, and happy.\n  There can be no disagreement that high quality child care and early \nchildhood development services are absolutely essential to the well-\nbeing of our children and our families. In fact, recent research \nfindings in early brain development indicate that much of children's \ngrowth and future emotional health is determined by early learning and \ncare. This research emphasizes the urgent need for well-trained \nreliable child care-givers for even the youngest of children, and \nunderscores the importance of continued Federal support for child care \nprograms. Whether these programs are called child care, early childhood \ndevelopment, or early childhood education they all must provide the \nnurturing and stimulation children need to develop fully, to enter \nschool ready to learn, and to grow into capable and responsible adults.\n  While quality of care is the most important consideration for parents \nchoosing a child care provider for their families, many parents must \ntake into consideration the high cost of child care in this country. \nAccording to the 1995 Census, middle class families earning \napproximately $36,000 a year spend 12 percent of their annual income in \nchild care expenses, and families earning $15,000 or less a year pay \napproximately 25 percent of their household income on care for their \nchildren. For these parents child care is an enormous financial burden.\n  In my own State of Maryland, many parents are struggling to hold jobs \nand at the same time provide quality care for their children. While the \nState of Maryland is a leader in day care financing, in 1994, there \nwere approximately 4,000 children on the waiting list for child care \nassistance. Many of these children's parents must daily live with the \nfear that their child care situation is inadequate or that their \ncarefully patched together child care arrangements will fall apart. We \ncan--and we must--do better.\n  The Federal Government has a crucial responsibility to support and \nprotect society's youngest members. As a nation we must work to empower \nlow-income parents so that they may meet their children's needs by \nproviding access to affordable, quality child care. As a member of the \nSenate, I have co-sponsored previous legislation to address these \npressing issues including the Act for Better Child Care Services which \nled to the authorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant, \nand I have continued to work with my colleagues to ensure that Federal \ninvestments in the care and development of young children yield \nconcrete results.\n  The White House Child Care Conference has provided us with a strong \nfoundation on which to build and expand our Nation's child care \nprograms, and has already begun to yield tangible results. Proposals \nresulting from the White House conference include the creation of a \nnational child care provider scholarship fund to improve training, \neducation, and compensation for child care providers, and a National \nCrime Prevention and Privacy Compact to increase the efficiency and \neffectiveness of background checks on child care providers. These \nproposals are useful first steps to bolster Federal child care \nprograms, and to address issues of quality, accessibility, and \naffordability of reliable child care.\n  Mr. President, it is imperative to remember that children represent \nthe future of this Nation. Unless we provide those generations to come \nwith the knowledge and skills needed to function successfully in an \nincreasingly complex world, we not only imperil the futures of our \nchildren--we imperil the future of our Nation. We must continue to \ninvest in the future of our children by renewing our commitment to \nquality child care, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. \n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12039-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ROCOGNITION OF BEVERLY CATHCARD\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, the conclusion of the 1998 football \nseason will mark the end of the most extraordinary and successful \ncoaching career in college football history. Eddie Robinson of \nGrambling State University, in my home State of Louisiana, will retire \nas that school's head coach after 56 amazing years in that position. \nCoach Robinson enters retirement at the pinnacle of his profession, \nholding the record as the most successful college football coach in \nhistory with an impressive 408 victories and only 162 losses to his \ncredit.\n  Fifty-six years ago, when Coach Robinson came to what was then \nLouisiana Negro Normal, the school's formative\n\n[[Page S12040]]\n\nfootball program rested entirely on his shoulders. Unlike college \ncoaches of today, who are often awarded large contracts and lucrative \ntelevision deals, Coach Robinson had to build his program from the \nground up--literally. During prep basketball games, the new coach sold \nhamburgers so that he could afford to rent a bulldozer that could clear \na field on which his team could practice and play. Once, he persuaded \nthe members of his team to pick cotton so that a farmer's son, who \nhappened to be the school's top running back, could join the team.\n  In subsequent years, Coach Robinson built Grambling football into one \nof the most successful and well-known football programs in the Nation. \nToday, Coach Robinson and his Grambling Tigers are household names \nacross the country. Throughout the National Football League, the team \nthat Eddie built is known as one the best proving grounds for the NFL \nstars of the future. More than 300 of his players have gone on to \ncareers in professional football.\n  In 1971 alone, 43 former Grambling players were in NFL training \ncamps. Four of his players--Willie Brown, Willie Davis, Charlie Joiner, \nand Buck Buchanan--are members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame. And \nanother former player, Doug Williams, became the first black \nquarterback to win a Super Bowl.\n  Mr. President, these are some of the accomplishments of Coach \nRobinson's extraordinary career. But they don't tell the whole story of \nthe amazing life of this son of a former sharecropper. That is because \nit is Coach Robinson's example off the football field that has proved \njust as inspirational.\n  As a devoted husband and father and an exemplary citizen, Eddie \nRobinson symbolizes what is best about our country. As those of us who \nknow him can attest, he is the very embodiment of the values of \nintegrity, dignity, loyalty, humility, dedication, and excellence that \nmost Americans still wish for their children. In a day and time when \nheroes are few and far between, I suggest that the young people of \nAmerica look no further than Grambling State University for a true \nAmerican hero named Eddie Robinson--a hero not only because of his \nsuccess on the football field, but because of his winning attitude \ntoward life and the extraordinary content of his character.\n  I know that I speak for every Member of this body when I congratulate \nCoach Robinson for his many outstanding accomplishments on and off the \nfootball field. We wish he and his family every success and happiness \nin this new and exciting phase of their lives. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12039-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12040]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE ``SAVER'' BILL\n\n Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask that a letter from the \nSociety for Human Resource Management in support of the SAVER bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The letter follows:\n\n                                                 Society for Human\n\n\n                                          Resource Management,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, November 6, 1997.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Society for Human Resource \n     Management, SHRM, I am writing to enthusiastically endorse \n     the Savings Are Vital for Everyone's Retirement (SAVER) Act, \n     which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives under \n     suspension of the rules. This bipartisan legislation may be \n     considered on the Senate floor very soon. SHRM is the leading \n     voice of the human resource profession, representing the \n     interests of more than 89,000 professional and student \n     members from around the world.\n       Today most individuals are able to retire in a fashion that \n     meets their needs. On average, workers retire earlier and \n     live longer than in the past. However, a number of trends in \n     the economy and workplace suggest that it will become \n     increasingly difficult for American workers to meet their \n     needs for adequate retirement income. The U.S. population is \n     aging rapidly and the elderly live longer. The retirement of \n     the baby boom generation will impose severe pressure on \n     Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. It is clear that a \n     coordinated strategy is needed.\n       That is why this legislation is so critical. This \n     legislation directs the Department of Labor to maintain an \n     ongoing education and outreach program to the public to \n     educate America about the need to save more. The SAVER Act \n     also convenes a National Summit on Retirement Savings to be \n     held by April 15, 1998 and every four years thereafter. The \n     summit would bring together experts from the employee \n     benefits and retirement arena, and give lawmakers access to \n     the research and recommendations of experts so that America \n     can meet the challenges ahead. This bipartisan legislation \n     should be actively supported by all member of the Senate.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this key legislation. \n     SHRM looks forward to working with the full Senate to see \n     this legislation passed in 1997.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Deanna R.

Mr. President, I stand before you today to recognize \na tremendous individual who has exemplified citizenship, character, and \nservice to humanity throughout his life, Reverend Walter J. Keisker.\n  This special servant of God and man was bestowed an honorary degree \nof doctor of divinity in 1993 by Concordia Seminary in St. Louis for 70 \nyears of faithful service. In accepting the honor Reverend Keisker \nstated, ``There are others more deserving of the degree, but I am \nhumbly grateful for it.'' Anyone ever associated with Reverend Keisker \nwill acknowledge the humbleness of this special gentleman, but they \nwill know the unique spirit and tenacity that brought about a rich \nlifetime of accomplishments. Whether it was the Boy Scouts, Ministerial \nAlliance, Chamber of Commerce, Historical Society, or one of his many \nother activities, Reverend Keisker was totally dedicated, an enduring \nexample of service, integrity, faithfulness, and love in the best \nspirit of American citizenship.\n  On November 12, 1997, the Lutheran Family and Children Services \n[LFCS] of southeast Missouri will host the Second Annual Walter J. \nKeisker dinner. I commend LFCS for the foresightedness in choosing \nReverend Keisker to lead the LFCS mission. I can think of no better \nexample to inspire others to assist in building family life. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12040-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12040-S12041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO COMMANDER CARLISLE WILLIS BUZZELL\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, 100 years ago, Mark Twain wrote, \n``Let us endeavor so to live that when we come to die even the \nundertaker will be sorry.'' Although I cannot speak for the undertaker, \nI believe I accurately represent all of Carlisle Willis Buzzell's \nfriends, family members, and fellow aviators in saying that this \ncountry, and the Navy which serves it proudly, lost an invaluable asset \nwhen Carl peacefully passed away last July. Mr. President, I rise today \nto humbly commemorate a man whom I am proud to have known, in a time \nand place far removed from the Senate floor from which I speak today.\n  After a 3-month stint in the Army, Carl wisely joined the U.S. Navy \nin 1946, first as a petty officer, then as a midshipman at that boat \nschool on the Severn River, better known as the Naval Academy to all \nwho have not had the privilege of climbing Herndon at the end of plebe \nsummer and celebrating June Week before graduation. Carl proceeded on \nto a distinguished career as a naval aviator, with tours of duty both \nstateside and in the Mediterranean, Pacific, and Atlantic theaters.\n  I had the honor of flying with Carl when we were stationed together \non the U.S.S. Forrestal (CVA-59), a carrier better known for the \nvicious fire which consumed its flight deck than for the raw heroism of \nthe thousands on board who labored to save the vessel, and themselves, \nfrom the flames. As head of the Forrestal's Combat Information Center, \nCarl was likely better positioned to evaluate and respond to the crisis \nthan I, who held the dubious distinction of being the lucky pilot whose \nA-4E was hit by a Zuni rocket on the flight deck, thereby igniting the \ninferno.\n  Carl went on to serve on the staff of the Naval War College, where he \nhelped pioneer the latest in interactive computer technologies at the \nCenter for War Gaming. This capped the Commander's 28-year naval \ncareer, following which he managed General Electric's turbojet engine \nprograms and was responsible for maintaining the operational readiness \nof its engines in support of Navy aircraft.\n  As indicated by his private-sector work on turbojet engines for F/A-\n18 and F-14B/D fleet fighter aircraft, Carl's loyalties to the Navy \nwere not diminished by his retirement from the service. Indeed, he \nreaffirmed his commitment to his aviation roots through\n\n[[Page S12041]]\n\nactive membership on the boards of the Boston chapters of the Naval \nAcademy Alumni Association, the New England Advisory Committee of \nBusiness Executives for National Security, and the Patriots Squadron of \nthe Association of Naval Aviation.\n  Mr. President, as a Naval Academy graduate and former naval aviator \nmyself, I must concede that my respect for the service and \nprofessionalism of my friend Carl may be partially accountable to the \nparallels between his naval career and my own, although his subsequent \ndecision to enter the private sector perhaps demonstrated more \nforesight than my own choice to enter politics and make my living at \npublic expense.\n  But do not take my word as evidence of Carl's exemplary service to \nhis country. The World War II Victory Medal, the National Defense \nService Medal, the United Nations Service Medal, the Navy Occupation \nService Medal, the Korean Service Medal, the Korean Presidential Unit \nCitation, and the Vietnam Service Medal, all of which were awarded to \nCommander Buzzell during his naval career, stand as proof positive of \nhis dedication to the core values that distinguish our servicemembers \nto the same degree today as when Carl enlisted in 1946, 1 year after \nvictory in a most terrible war had confirmed the resilience of our \nideals and the promise of the American Century.\n  Mr. President, Carl Buzzell lived a life whose end deeply saddens all \nof us who know of his loyal service to this Nation. May his legacy long \nstand in testament to the virtues of a life dedicated to honor, \ncountry, and family. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12040-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            RECOGNITION OF GIRL SCOUT GOLD AWARD RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

JOHNSON AS CHIEF OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES \n         CONSERVATION SERVICE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, this week marks the end of Iowa \nnative Paul Johnson's remarkable 4-year tenure as Chief of the Natural \nResources Conservation Service at the Department of Agriculture. As a \nlong-time farmer and conservationist, Paul brought to NRCS a bold \nvision of private lands as a national resource to be managed in harmony \nwith the environment.\n  During the past 4 years, Paul guided his agency through a major \nreorganization, from the Soil Conservation Service to the Natural \nResources Conservation Service, and has shaped the agency's programs \nand policies to reflect this new emphasis on the conservation of all \nnatural resources. Paul's leadership has inspired a new commitment to \nconservation both within USDA and across the country.\n  Paul's influence was obvious in the development of the landmark \nconservation title of the 1996 Farm Bill, which included among many \nimportant provisions the new Environmental Quality Incentives Program \nand the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program. The creation and \nimplementation of these programs under Paul's direction are hallmarks \nof the energy, creativity, and commitment that he brought to NRCS, and \nof the legacy he leaves behind.\n  The agency's eloquent publication, ``A Geography of Hope,'' is a \nvisionary statement of the NRCS mission and testimony to Paul's farm \nroots and passion for the land. For 23 years on his farm in Decorah, \nIA, Paul has raised corn, hay, and Christmas trees, and had a dairy \nherd and sheep.\n  In our home State Paul is highly regarded as an architect of \nenvironmental legislation. As a representative in the Iowa General \nAssembly from 1984 to 1990, he authored the Iowa Groundwater Protection \nAct, the Iowa Resource Enhancement and Protection Program, the Iowa \nEnergy Efficiency Act and the Iowa Integrated Farm Management Program. \nFor his leadership in the State he was named conservation legislator of \nthe year by several organizations in Iowa and was named to the Iowa \nConservation Hall of Fame by the Wildlife Society.\n  Paul holds B.S. and M.S. degrees in forestry from the University of \nMichigan, where he also pursued doctoral studies in forestry. He taught \nforestry in Ghana for two years, and has been visiting professor of \nenvironmental policy at Luther College. Paul worked for the USDA Forest \nService in the Pacific Northwest and also has studied and consulted on \nforestry, agriculture, environment, and energy issues in Honduras, \nCosta Rica, Sweden, and the former Soviet Union.\n  Paul served on the Board of Agriculture of the National Academy of \nSciences from 1988 to 1994, where he was involved in major studies in \nagriculture, forestry, and conservation. He also has served as an \nassistant commissioner for his local soil conservation district.\n  Paul brings both a global perspective and a local sensibility to \nconservation. While I am sorry to see him leave NRCS, I look forward to \nhis return to Iowa, where he will continue to enrich our State. I would \nlike to extend congratulations on a job well done, and wish Paul and \nhis wife Pat the best on their return home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12041-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12041-S12042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO SOUTHWEST MISSOURI STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I stand before you today to pay \ntribute to a truly outstanding university in my home State of Missouri, \nSouthwest Missouri State University [SMSU]. SMSU was one of 135 schools \nin 42 States selected to the John Templeton Foundation Honor Roll, a \ndesignation recognizing colleges and universities that emphasize \ncharacter building as an integral part of the college experience.\n  Being the only public institution in Missouri to earn the 1997-98 \nhonor roll distinction, SMSU is also one of the eight State-funded \nschools to receive the award nationwide. Schools competing for the \nhonor roll were judged on 5 criteria and out of 2,208 4-year accredited \nundergraduate institutions only the top few were chosen. One of the \ncategories where SMSU stood out was in community service. During the \n1996-97 school year the SMSU campus, including the faculty and \nstudents, volunteered more than 69,500 hours.\n  It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a university \nlike SMSU, whose service and character-building programs have earned it \nthis distinguished award.

SMSU was one of 135 schools \nin 42 States selected to the John Templeton Foundation Honor Roll, a \ndesignation recognizing colleges and universities that emphasize \ncharacter building as an integral part of the college experience.\n  Being the only public institution in Missouri to earn the 1997-98 \nhonor roll distinction, SMSU is also one of the eight State-funded \nschools to receive the award nationwide. Schools competing for the \nhonor roll were judged on 5 criteria and out of 2,208 4-year accredited \nundergraduate institutions only the top few were chosen. One of the \ncategories where SMSU stood out was in community service. During the \n1996-97 school year the SMSU campus, including the faculty and \nstudents, volunteered more than 69,500 hours.\n  It is an honor for the entire State of Missouri to have a university \nlike SMSU, whose service and character-building programs have earned it \nthis distinguished award. I commend SMSU's President, Dr. John Keiser, \nfor his commitment to excellence and hope for continued success in the \nfuture.\n\n[[Page S12042]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12041-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION OF THE CHESTER-WALLINGFORD CHAPTER OF THE \n                           AMERICAN RED CROSS\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nChester-Wallingford chapter of the American Red Cross. The third oldest \nRed Cross chapter in the United States, this organization will, in \n1998, celebrate 100 years of continuous service to the community.\n  With 400 volunteers and 4 staff members, the Chester-Wallingford \nChapter carries out the Red Cross's mission of ``providing relief to \nvictims of disasters and helping people prevent, prepare for, and \nrespond to emergencies.'' Following disasters, the Red Cross supplies \nvictims with groceries, clothing, temporary housing, transportation, \nand medicine. Blood drives are another important initiative. Every 2 \nseconds, somebody needs a blood transfusion. The Chester-Wallingford \nchapter proudly helps satisfy this need by providing thousands of \ngallons of blood to area hospitals. As members of our Nation's Armed \nForces serve overseas, the Red Cross facilitates communication between \nthe soldiers and their families. Other public services provided by this \norganization include first aid, CPR, and swimming lessons.\n  The Chester-Wallingford chapter has helped soldiers and veterans of \nWWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, and Desert Storm in times of need. The Red \nCross has provided financial assistance to servicemen and servicewomen \nfor emergency travel, health needs, and in some cases, burial \nassistance. Likewise, dedicated workers and volunteers have helped many \nveterans settle benefit claims. Finally, the Chester-Wallingford \nchapter has provided numerous supportive services to patients in VA \nhospitals.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Chester-Wallingford chapter of the \nAmerican Red Cross for its commitment to the people of southeastern \nPennsylvania. I ask my colleagues to join me in extending the Senate's \nbest wishes for continued success to the staff and volunteers as they \nprepare to celebrate the chapter's centennial.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12042-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CAPITAL AREA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY GALA\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today, I rise to commemorate the \npeople of the Capital Area Transportation Authority [CATA] on the \nopening of the new CATA Transportation Center in Lansing, MI. Such an \nundertaking is the result many individuals in the community having \ndedicated a great portion of their time and talent toward seeing this \nidea become a reality. I, along with the citizens of Lansing and the \nsurrounding communities, join in thanks for the work of CATA in \noffering such a tremendous public transportation service and for the \nensuing impact on the quality of life for citizens in the surrounding \nareas.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank my Senate colleagues \nfor their support of my request for earmarked funding for the CATA \nTransportation Center. In 1996, our request for $3 million in funding \nwas granted and, in the following year, another earmark for $1.2 \nmillion also became a reality.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, allow me to give a \nheartfelt thanks to those at CATA for their hard work and dedication \ntoward making the great State of Michigan even greater.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12042-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RECOGNIZING STONE AND THOMAS AS AN OUTSTANDING BUSINESS\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today in order to \nrecognize Stone & Thomas, an outstanding business, for its continuous \nservice to its customers and to the State of West Virginia. Stone & \nThomas has been known for its commitment to customer service since \n1847. That is 16 years longer than West Virginia has been a State.\n  This year, Stone & Thomas celebrated 150 years in business, and its \nlongevity is a testament to the quality of service and merchandise \nwhich they are committed to.\n  Mr. President, since its founding in 1847 by Jacob Thomas and Elijah \nStone, this remarkable business has been owned and operated by five \ngenerations of the same family. Currently, Stone & Thomas is run by \nW.S. Jones, the president, chief executive officer and the great-great-\ngrandson of Elijah Stone. Mr. Jones, like the four generations before \nhim, has continued the creed of outstanding service which Mr. Stone and \nMr. Thomas pledged themselves to. Furthermore, Mr. Jones, like those \nbefore him, has continued to improve and expand upon an already \nexceptional business.\n  All told, Stone & Thomas has employed, and continues to employ, \nthousands of citizens of West Virginia. They are presently responsible \nfor over 1,500 jobs in my State, as well as several hundred jobs in \nOhio, Kentucky, and Virginia. And just this week, Mr. President, they \ncelebrated the opening of another customer-friendly store in \nCharleston, WV, which is expected to bring work to 70 more West \nVirginians.\n  Mr. President, Stone & Thomas has accomplished so much during its 150 \nyears in business. Because of its diligent efforts to satisfy the \ncustomer it has grown to become West Virginia's largest independent \nretailer, as well as one of the top 100 in the Nation.\n  Because of their outstanding commitment to customer service; because \nof their longstanding record as a fair, honest, and friendly business; \nand because of their superior contributions to the economies of West \nVirginia and three other States, I pay special tribute to Stone & \nThomas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12042-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12042]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO MISSOURI TASK FORCE ONE\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the members of \nMissouri Task Force One, which this year achieved Federal designation \nas an FEMA Urban Search and Rescue Task Force, and in October received \nthe Memorandum of Understanding that places them in deployable status.\n  What a great team. They don't call Missouri the ``Show Me'' State for \nnothing. Missouri Task Force One began as 1 of more than 150 \napplicants. They coordinated, cajoled, planned, ``recruited''--a \neuphemism for the arm-twisting for which they've become famous--begged, \nborrowed, purchased, trained, and triumphed. What was only a dream 5 \nyears ago became a reality this year.\n  This team, its members and equipment underwent a rigorous evaluation \nincluding a full-blown, onsite inspection from technical experts in \nsearch and rescue. They scored the highest in the Nation, and clobbered \nthe competition. I know this may be a sore subject with some of my \ncolleagues in the Senate, but the numbers do not lie.\n  Missouri Task Force One was head and shoulders above the next-highest \napplicant for new teams and scored ahead of already-designated teams as \nwell. This is one of the most exciting, dedicated groups of volunteers \nI have ever seen. They earned this designation in every category \nevaluated, from the quality of the team members to their excellent \nequipment.\n  The country won when Missouri Task Force One achieved their \ndesignation. Some of us have learned the very hard way that disasters \ncan happen any time, anywhere. I rest easier knowing that the Midwest \nnow has access to the Federal search and rescue teams once concentrated \non the east and west coasts. I am honored to have the privilege of \ngetting to know some of the members of Missouri Task Force One, who \ntake the time from their ``day jobs'' and their families to train, take \nrisks, pack, unpack, and train some more; for a nightmare we all hope \nwill never happen but for which we must be prepared.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12042-4", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12042-S12043]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TROY COMMUNITY COALITION\n\n Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute and \nexpress my heartfelt thanks to those who have made the Troy Community \nCoalition for the Prevention of Drug and Alcohol Abuse such a \nsuccessful program. The hard work and dedication of the coalition's \nstaff and volunteers was recently recognized by the Community Anti-Drug \nCoalitions of America ``Best Coalition'' designation. This award \nrecognizes drug abuse prevention organizations which have strong \nprograms, substantive results, and community support.\n  The Troy Community Coalition is a non-profit organization dedicated \nto\n\n[[Page S12043]]\n\nimproving the quality of life for all who live or work in Troy. This \ngoal has been successfully met through the countless ways in which they \nhave encouraged individuals to lead lives free from the abuse of \nalcohol and drugs.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of the U.S. Senate, I would like to thank \nthe Troy Community Coalition for the hard work and effort they have put \ninto making the great State of Michigan even greater. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12042-5", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12043-S12049]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        FOREIGN CURRENCY REPORTS\n\n  In accordance with the appropriate provisions of law, the Secretary \nof the Senate herewith submits the following report(s) of standing \ncommittees of the Senate, certain joint committees of the Congress, \ndelegations and groups, and select and special committees of the \nSenate, relating to expenses incurred in the performance of authorized \nforeign travel:\n\n   CONSOLIDATED REPORT OF EXPENDITURE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND APPROPRIATED FUNDS FOR FOREIGN TRAVEL BY MEMBERS AND EMPLOYEES OF THE U.S. SENATE, UNDER AUTHORITY OF SEC. 22, P.L. 95-384--22\n                                           U.S.C. 1754(b), COMMITTEE ON AGRICULTURE, NUTRITION, AND FORESTRY FOR TRAVEL FROM JULY 1 TO SEPT. 30, 1997\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                  Per diem               Transportation             Miscellaneous                 Total\n                                                                                         -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                                       U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar               U.S. dollar\n              Name and country                             Name of currency                 Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent    Foreign     equivalent\n                                                                                            currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.      currency     or U.S.\n                                                                                                         currency                  currency                  currency                  currency\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nDavid W.

Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to a small \norganization whose existence shows that a few determined individuals \ncan make a difference. I am referring to the Marine Corps--Law \nEnforcement Foundation, which was formed in February 1995 by five \nformer Marines who decided over lunch one day to help the children of \nMarines and Federal law enforcement employees.\n  Less than 3 years after forming, this organization has given away \nnearly $1.5 million to more than 150 children. The group focuses on the \neducational and special needs of children who have no where else to \nturn. They have paid for a hearing aid for a young son of a Marine \nwhose insurance did not cover it. They provided a wheelchair to a ninth \ngrader injured playing football. They gave $250,000 to children whose \nparents were Federal employees killed or injured in the 1995 Oklahoma \nCity bombing.\n  Mr. President, I know several of the founding members of this \nfoundation personally, and I want to say that I was not surprised to \nhear about the success of their collaboration. As Edmund Burke once \nsaid, ``Great men are the guideposts and landmarks in the state.'' We \ncan all learn something from them.\n  I ask that an article from the Newark Star Ledger about the \nfoundation be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n[[Page S12050]]\n\n   Foundation Formed by 5 Ex-Marines Offers Help, and Hope, Amid Pain\n\n                            (By Pat Milton)\n\n       New York.--Two years ago, the sky crashed down on Marine \n     fighter pilot Peter Harmon.\n       His wife, Shay, was driving with their 5-month-old son when \n     another driver, allegedly drunk and speeding in Pompano \n     Beach, Fla., hit them head on. The car burst into a fireball.\n       Shay managed to push the child out a window before she \n     died. The infant, George, burned over 33 percent of his body, \n     was given only a 5 percent chance to live. But he pulled \n     through, a scarred survivor.\n       Peter Harmon, who had been on a Marine Reserves training \n     mission at the time of the accident, almost immediately \n     received a $10,000 check from a group he'd never heard of: \n     the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation.\n       ``They are awesome,'' says Harmon, who believes the money \n     gave his son ``a big head start.''\n       The foundation was formed in February 1995 by five former \n     marines who decided over lunch one day to help pay for the \n     education and special needs of children of Marines and \n     federal law enforcement employees.\n       So far, the group has given away nearly $1.5 million to \n     more than 150 children.\n       ``Just because you take your uniform off, doesn't mean you \n     end service to your country,'' said one of the five founders, \n     Richard Torykian, a Vietnam veteran and senior vice president \n     at the international investment firm Lazard Freres in New \n     York.\n       He said the foundation depends entirely on private and \n     corporate donations.\n       It provides at least $10,000 for schooling children up to \n     19 years old who have a parent killed in the line of duty. \n     The parent must have worked for the FBI; Drug Enforcement \n     Administration; Secret Service; Customs; Marshals Service; \n     Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms; or Immigration and \n     Naturalization Service.\n\n\n                         scholarships provided\n\n       The group also gives scholarships to Marine Corps children \n     who lose a parent or are in financial need. And it helps \n     cover medical needs.\n       This week, a $10,000 check was sent to the widow of Marine \n     Capt. Robert Straw a day after she gave birth to their second \n     child, Seth Robert. Straw was killed two months ago in a \n     helicopter crash outside Dallas.\n       ``My husband and I had high expectations for our children's \n     education,'' Mindi Straw said by telephone from her home in \n     Jacksonville, N.C. ``This money is going to make our wishes \n     come true.''\n       The foundation also sent her $10,000 shortly after the \n     crash for the couple's other child, Molli, 3.\n       It recently paid for a hearing aid for the son of an active \n     duty Marine whose insurance did not cover it, and provided an \n     $800 wheelchair to a ninth grader injured playing football.\n       ``How are you going to get to college when you can't even \n     get down the hallway of your high school?'' said Peter Haas, \n     a retired stockbroker who is president of the foundation, \n     based in Mountain Lakes, N.J.\n       The other three founders are James K. Kallstrom, head of \n     the New York FBI; attorney Patrick McGahn, Jr.; and Steve \n     Wallace, who owns an investment firm in Los Angeles.\n       The foundation has more than 900 members, who help identify \n     worthy cases and sometimes hold fund-raisers.\n       The largest donation, $250,000, was given to children whose \n     parents were federal employees killed or injured in the 1995 \n     Oklahoma City bombing. A big chunk of that contribution, \n     $72,000, was donated by schoolchildren from the Blue Springs \n     District in Kansas City, Mo., who held dozens of fund-\n     raisers. Haas, surprised by the size of the donation, carried \n     the mostly $1 and $5 bills back to New York in laundry bags \n     and shopping bags.\n       He was stopped at the Kansas City airport by security \n     guards who he thought must be suspicious of his swelling bags \n     of cash. In fact, they wanted to give him $500 they had \n     collected.\n       Harmon, now a Federal Express pilot, lives in New Hampshire \n     and is attending the trial in Florida this month of the man \n     charged with manslaughter in his wife's death.\n       He said little George, who he calls ``G-man,'' has a \n     painful life of operations and skin graftings ahead, but \n     still liberally dispenses hugs and kisses.\n       ``To someone who sees him the first time, he may not look \n     so good on the outside, but he is smiling on the inside,'' \n     Harmon said. ``He's tough, he's a fighter, just like a \n     Marine.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12049-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE NATION'S LONGSHORE WORKERS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the recent dispute between the \nFederal Maritime Commission and Japanese cargo vessel owners over the \noperation of Japan's docks has given Congress and the country a new \nlesson in the important role of United States longshore workers. Day in \nand day out, away from the limelight, they work long hours under back-\nbreaking conditions. In so many ways, these hard-working men and women \nsymbolize the American work ethic. A recent article in the Wall Street \nJournal compared the productivity of American longshore workers \nfavorably with that of their Japanese counterparts. The article noted \nthat ``American dockworkers will unload 24 hours a day, taking 30% less \ntime for about half the price.'' The recent trade dispute has helped \nthese workers obtain the recognition they deserve for their invaluable \nwork in keeping commerce moving at our nation's ports.\n  According to recent figures, 1.7 tons of cargo a year are handled by \nlongshore workers in the United States, with a value of nearly $900 \nbillion.\n  As the Senate debates important questions of international trade and \nfair competition, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to these \nskillful, tireless, and courageous workers who do so much to support \nthe Nation's economy and our trade with other countries. U.S. longshore \nworkers across the Nation deserve America's gratitude--they have \ncertainly earned it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12050-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12050]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         REFINANCING BOND FINANCED SECTION 8 HOUSING PROPERTIES\n\n Mr. MACK. Mr. President, I rise to address a matter regarding \nthe refinancing of section 8 assisted properties whose bonds are \nfinanced with a financial adjustment factor [FAF]. In order to save \nsection 8 housing assistance payment funds, the Congress through the \nenactment of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Act encouraged owners of \nFAF properties to refund their bonds with lower interest rates. The \nrecaptured section 8 savings were equally shared between the bond \nissuing housing agency and HUD and the housing agencies were required \nto use their share of the savings for affordable housing purposes. In \nthe recently enacted VA, HUD appropriations legislation, a provision \nwas included to encourage owners to refinance their properties by \nproviding the owners a 15-percent share of the savings.\n  It has come to my attention that there may be some question as to \nwhether the fiscal year 1998 VA, HUD appropriations act would allow an \nowner or an issuer to refinance a FAF property which was previously \nrefinanced. We reviewed this matter while developing the amendments to \nthis version of S. 562. However, upon review of the appropriations \nlanguage, it appears unnecessary to include statutory language to \nclarify this matter. I would like to ask Senator Bond, the chairman of \nthe VA, HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, if he could confirm my \ninterpretation of this issue.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Senator for raising this issue. It is the \nintent of the appropriations legislation to allow a second refinancing \nto save section 8 funds. I am hopeful that owners working in \ncooperation with the bond issuers will voluntarily refinance their FAF \nproperties, where existing laws and bond documents permit. Owners and \nbond issuers will hopefully take advantage of the historically low \ninterest rates and refinance their properties.\n  Mr. MACK. I thank my colleague for his assistance in this \nmatter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12050-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12050-S12051]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RECOGNIZING THE 50TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY OF JULIAN AND LILLIAN WALLACE\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two \nNevadans whose lives serve as an inspiration not only to all Nevadans \nbut to this Nation and to this distinguished body. Fifteen years ago, \nJulian and Lillian Wallace founded an advocacy group in Las Vegas \ncalled Seniors United. Their mission was to tap into the unmined and \nundiscovered potential of Nevada's small but growing senior population \nand ensure that Nevada retirees were informed and had a voice in the \npolitical process on all levels of government. Each month for the past \n15 years they have put together a informative newsletter and a monthly \nbriefing for Nevada seniors. They stood as some of my strongest allies \nin the fight to stop the unfair source tax which allowed States to go \nafter the pension incomes of former residents. As Nevada has grown and \nchanged and the number of seniors and retirees has increased, Seniors \nUnited has become one of the most formidable groups in the State. \nLillian\n\n[[Page S12051]]\n\nand Julian's success with Seniors United comes from a simple idea-- \nempowerment. They believe that an informed democracy is a powerful \ndemocracy. They never hesitate to hold their elected officials feet to \nthe fire and demonstrate on a daily basis that an active and involved \ncitizenry is definitely not a function of age. Perhaps their greatest \nassets are those attributes which have helped them stay married for 50 \nyears: compassion, patience, love, and loyalty. On January 17, 1998, \nLillian and Julian Wallace will celebrate their 50th wedding \nanniversary. I ask all my colleagues to join with me today to recognize \nthese two Nevadans for their dedication and devotion not only to their \nmarriage but also to making this country better for all \ncitizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12050-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12051-S12052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SUPPORT OF FAST-TRACK REAUTHORIZATION\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I would like to voice my support for \nthe pending fast-track reauthorization legislation. As chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, I would like \nto begin by stressing the importance of fast track to U.S. agriculture. \nIn 1996, agricultural exports reached a record $60 billion, but import \nbarriers, export subsidies, and state trading enterprises continue to \ndistort world commodity markets. These distortions put America's \nfarmers and agribusiness operators at a disadvantage. We must reduce \nthese trade barriers and allow our industry to freely supply the \nworld's markets.\n  I ask that a letter in support of fast track from all living \nSecretaries of Agriculture, dating from President Kennedy's \nadministration, be printed in the Record.\n  Last year, my State of Indiana exported goods totaling $12.1 billion \nand these exports directly supported 66,000 Hoosier jobs. Current \nestimates indicate Indiana will achieve a record $13 billion in exports \nthis year. Indiana's exports grew by an extraordinary 75 percent \nbetween 1992 and 1996. Since 1993, exports by Indianapolis firms \nincreased 53 percent, South Bend's exports are up by 175 percent and \nMuncie's export growth leapt 114 percent. Therre Haute firms saw their \nexports rise 277 percent, the second highest rate of increase in the \nNation. Indiana was the eighth largest agricultural exporter in 1996 \nwith over $2 billion in exports. Because export related jobs pay on \naverage more than nonexport related jobs, it is easy to conclude that \nexporting is a vital component to Indiana's robust economy.\n  The United States must continue to be the leader in knocking down \ntariff and nontariff trade barriers. This bill is critical to advancing \ntrade liberalization and opening markets for all sectors. Approving \nfast track is the first step in achieving these goals.\n  Mr. President, I ask that a letter from President Clinton regarding a \nproposed congressional oversight group be inserted in the Record. I \nagree with the President that more can be done regarding strengthening \nthe current congressional advisory group. Specifically, for each new \ntrade negotiation the administration would consult with and update a \nspecific congressional oversight group for that particular round of \nnegotiations. The group would provide advice to the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative and be charged with general oversight. Second, the U.S. \nTrade Representative would work with congressional leaders, within 60 \ndays of enactment, to develop guidelines for interaction between \nCongress and the administration on trade negotiations. The guidelines \nwould address such issues as the timing of written and oral briefings \nregarding U.S. objectives, the status of the negotiations, the role of \nthe group during actual negotiations, and access to information \nobtained during negotiations. The United States must be well prepared \nfor the next round of World Trade Organization talks on agriculture in \n1999 and the establishment of a congressional oversight group would be \na positive beginning for this process.\n  Since 1974, Congress has granted every President fast-track \nnegotiating authority. America's economic future increasingly lies with \nour ability to sell our goods and services around the globe. Without \nfast track, the United States will be sidelined in future trade \nnegotiations. Since the creation of the General Agreement on Tariffs \nand Trade [GATT] in 1947, the United States has been the leader in \nknocking down trade barriers and opening up markets. As we prepare to \ncelebrate the 50th anniversary of the GATT, the United States can \neither be engaged and play an active role in further trade \nliberalization or allow our competitors to stake claim to a larger \nportion of world markets.\n  The letters follow:\n                                                 November 3, 1997.\n     Hon.

Charles Stenholm,\n     Ranking member, Committee on Agriculture, U.S. House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC\n\n       Dear Gentlemen: The U.S. food and agricultural system is \n     one of the nation's greatest success stories. American \n     agriculture competitively produces, handles, processes, \n     services, trades and transports food and fiber that the world \n     wants to buy. Agricultural trade has contributed \n     significantly to U.S. farm income, created jobs and \n     strengthened American economic and political interests. For \n     those reasons, agricultural trade has been a top priority for \n     every administration in recent memory.\n       Having served as the Secretaries of Agriculture to \n     Presidents of both political parties, we have witnessed how \n     U.S. agriculture has benefited from trade liberalization made \n     possible by previous fast-track authorities. With the \n     implementation of NAFTA and GATT, U.S. agricultural exports \n     surged another $20 billion in value, hitting an all-time high \n     of $60.3 billion in 1996. U.S. agriculture also has enjoyed a \n     consistent trade surplus, which last year climbed to $27 \n     billion.\n       Our food and agricultural system now is poised to make \n     additional export gains from upcoming trade negotiations. \n     Many developing countries are experiencing economic growth \n     which means rising incomes for their citizens. Food demand is \n     expanding as people upgrade their diets. These consumers will \n     need to rely to a greater degree than ever on world markets, \n     but there is no guarantee that agricultural products grown in \n     the United States may reach them. To assure that, we need to \n     make additional progress lowering trade barriers, eliminating \n     unfair trading practices and constraining domestic subsidies \n     that distort trade.\n       Fast track is the key to unlocking those opportunities. It \n     is the avenue for our negotiators to level the playing field \n     for U.S. farmers and processors to compete. The authorities \n     it conveys can and should be used to help resolve outstanding \n     trade disputes and strengthen the rules of international \n     commerce. Moreover, it should be used as it was in the past--\n     to exercise U.S. leadership in trade.\n       American agriculture needs to be at the table for the 199 \n     agriculture talks in the World Trade Organization to continue \n     the progress made in the Uruguay Round. In addition, we need \n     to be active in upcoming bilateral negotiations with \n     countries like Chile and for the regional Free Trade \n     Agreement of the Americas and the Asia Pacific Economic \n     Cooperation talks.\n       Very simply, fast track is critical to American agriculture \n     being able to compete and prosper in the years ahead. That is \n     why more than 60 agricultural organizations have committed \n     themselves to work for fast track, and why we as former \n     Secretaries of Agriculture support them in their effort.\n       We urge you to do what you can to assure prompt passage of \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Orville Freeman, Secretary of Agriculture, Kennedy and \n           Johnson Administrations; Earl L. Butz, Secretary of \n           Agriculture, Nixon and Ford Administrations; John R. \n           Block, Secretary of Agriculture, Reagan Administration; \n           Clayton Yeutter, Secretary of Agriculture, Bush \n           Administration; Clifford Hardin, Secretary of \n           Agriculture, Nixon Administration; Bob Bergland, \n           Secretary of Agriculture, Carter Administration; \n           Richard E. Lyng, Secretary of Agriculture, Reagan \n           Administration; Mike Espy, Clinton Administration.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                      Washington, November 5, 1997\n     Hon. Richard G. Lugar,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for taking the time to share \n     your ideas with me about advancing fast track legislation. \n     Your perspectives were, as always, welcome and useful.\n       As you know, I am committed to ensuring close Congressional \n     involvement both in the formulation and implementation of our \n     trade agreements. Appropriately, the Senate and House fast \n     track bills both provide for extensive Congressional \n     participation.\n       I was intrigued by the idea of establishing an oversight \n     mechanism for trade negotiations similar to the NATO \n     Observers Group.\n\n[[Page S12052]]\n\n     I have since looked into this idea and want to draw your \n     attention to a structure that has been in place for a while \n     that is quite similar to the NATO group. In 1974, Congress \n     established the Congressional Advisers for Trade Policy and \n     Negotiations, a trade policy and negotiations oversight body \n     that remains in place today. This is a bipartisan group of \n     official Congressional advisers, designated by the \n     Leadership, that is accredited to our trade delegations and \n     kept informed on matters affecting trade policy, including \n     ongoing negotiations. I am including with this letter a \n     summary of how the procedure works.\n       I am fully committed to ensuring that the Congressional \n     trade advisor system works effectively to ensure that \n     Congress is both fully informed and consulted as we develop \n     and implement U.S. trade policy. I am convinced that the \n     Administration benefits significantly when Congress plays an \n     active and continuing role in formulating our trade policies \n     and objectives. For that reason, the Administration bill and \n     both the Senate and House bills, which I support, include \n     specific language designed to enhance the effectiveness of \n     the Congressional trade adviser system.\n       While the bills pending in the House and Senate seek to \n     reinvigorate the Congressional Advisers mechanism, I believe \n     that more can be done. Therefore, I would propose the \n     inclusion of an additional title in the fast track bill \n     entitled ``Congressional Oversight Groups'' that would:\n       a. Establish for each trade negotiation that the \n     Administration notifies to the Congress under fast track, a \n     specific ``Congressional Oversight Group'' for that \n     negotiation. The group would be selected by the leadership \n     from among the existing congressional trade advisers, and \n     would be tasked with oversight of, and providing advice to \n     the Trade Representative regarding, the negotiation.\n       b. Instruct the Trade Representative to work with the \n     Senate and House leadership to develop, within 60 days of \n     enactment, guidelines for interaction between the \n     Administration and Congressional Oversight Groups. The \n     guidelines would be structured to ensure a useful and timely \n     flow of information between the Administration and the \n     Congressional Oversight Group, including at an early stage \n     between the Oversight Group and the Trade Representative to \n     discuss the Administration's objectives and the Group's \n     views.\n       I hope that you will give serious consideration to this \n     proposal. I would welcome any thoughts that you and other \n     Members may have.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12051-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CHRISTINA A. SNYDER, JUDICIAL NOMINEE FOR THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN \n                   THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate showed its overwhelming \nsupport today for Christina Snyder, one of the most qualified legal \nminds to fill a seat on the Federal bench of the Central District of \nCalifornia. My unwavering confidence in Ms. Snyder arises from respect \nfor her background, education and career. I am very pleased she has \nbeen confirmed.\n  Ms. Snyder is a native of the Los Angeles area, having grown up in \nthe Montebello community in East Los Angeles. She studied in the public \nelementary schools of Montebello and Orange County, and was \nvaledictorian of her high school class. She later studied at the \nUniversity of California at Los Angeles, before transferring to Pomona \nCollege where she earned her undergraduate degree. She earned her law \ndegree at Stanford University.\n  Mr. President, I am sure you are aware Ms. Snyder's legal background \nis highly respected throughout the State of California. Ms. Snyder has \ndistinguished herself in the legal community of Los Angeles through \nmore than 20 years of law practice. Ms. Snyder began her career working \nat the Los Angeles law firm of Wyman, Bautzer, Kuchel and Silbert, \nwhere she eventually was made a partner. She later went on to become a \nlaw partner at two other Los Angeles law firms. Her nomination and \nelection to the highly regarded American Law Institute in 1993 is \nfurther evidence of the respect she commands within the legal \nprofession.\n  Moreover, Ms. Snyder has demonstrated a strong commitment to \ncommunity service as one of the founding members of Public Counsel, a \npublic interest law firm of the Los Angeles County and Beverly Hills \nBar Associations. She also served as the California State Bar designee \non the Board of Directors of the Western Center for Law and Poverty.\n  Again, I am pleased to speak in favor of Ms. Snyder and feel she is a \nvaluable addition to the Federal bench.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12052-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FUNDS FOR ROAD EXPANSION TO TRANSPORT HAZARDOUS WASTE\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

Mr. President, a California company has \nembarked on an effort that I believe demonstrates how entrepreneurship \nand public service can go hand in hand.\n  The Recovery Network is a new nationwide cable television program \ndedicated to helping people recover from the devastating disease of \naddiction. This Santa Monica-based network is the first of its kind and \nthe only broadcast network in the world devoted entirely to substance \nabuse recovery and prevention.\n  It is estimated that more than 130 million Americans suffer from or \nare affected by alcoholism, drug abuse, eating disorders, depression, \ngambling and other addictions. The Recovery Network offers a lifeline \nof help to millions of those in need offering group recovery sessions, \ninformation on 12-step recovery programs, a 24-hour 800-number help \nline, discussion shows designed for children of alcoholics and parents \nwith drug abuse problems, and information shows on the pharmacological \neffects of alcohol and other addictive substances. Recovery Network \nserves not only those in need of help, but also the friends, families, \nteachers, and professionals seeking guidance and tools to effect \nchange.\n  Another important part of the Recovery Network is the localized \nprogramming effort. ``Neighborhood Recovery'' enables local community \ngroups to offer their services through cable programming. Organizations \nlike Californians for Drug-Free Youth, and the Miami Coalition for a \nSafe and Drug-Free Community can reach out to people in their specific \narea offering information on local meetings and other resources.\n  I believe this type of public service programming is exactly what \nCongress envisioned when it passed the Cable Communications Act in \n1984, ``* * * to provide the widest possible diversity of information \nsources and service to the public'' and ``* * * assure that cable \nsystems are responsive to the needs and interest of the local \ncommunity.''\n  Community cable became a permanent fixture on the American landscape \nin 1948. Its purpose was to service remote communities with a master \nantenna providing a clear television broadcast signal. Three years \nlater, 70 cable systems services 14,000 homes nationally. Since then, \ncable television has become a vital full-service link to citizens in \nevery city and town in the United States, serving more than 67 million \nhouseholds nationwide.\n  People suffering from alcohol and drug addiction have found the \nRecovery Network there to help when they were most in need:\n  One young couple from Ohio who was traveling and struggling to \nmaintain their sobriety early in recovery happened upon the Recovery \nNetwork on their hotel television. They said ``* * * we turned you on \nunknowingly, and it was like an AA meeting right in our hotel room. It \nreally helped us refocus on what is important, and that is AA and \nstaying sober.''\n  An Indiana viewer wrote ``I just want to say thank you for the \nprograms and the light at the end of the tunnel that they showed me.''\n  A Michigan man wrote ``Thank you for making such a big difference in \nmy life.''\n  A California woman wrote ``When I can't make a meeting, I know you're \nthere for me.''\n  Recovery Network has become a leader in delivering effective \nprogramming which provides solutions to these problems in the privacy \nof the home and in offering positive lifestyle choices as an \nalternative.\n  The Recovery Network is supported by every major drug abuse \nprevention and recovery organization in the Nation, including the \nCommunity Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the National Drug Prevention \nLeague, National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors \nand the National Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education.\n  Mr. President, I am proud that the Recovery Network is a product of \nthe State of California and I wish them much success in their \nendeavor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12053-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12053]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTRIBUTE TO DONN TIBBETTS, UNION LEADER STATE HOUSE BUREAU CHIEF, ON HIS \n                               RETIREMENT\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. New Hampshire's media corps will \nsuffer a great loss in January 1998 when Donn Tibbetts steps down after \n25 years as The Union Leader newspaper's Concord, New Hampshire Bureau \nChief. Donn is a New Hampshire institution, and will be missed by all \nof us who call him our friend.\n  Donn's career in journalism has spanned nearly 50 years--first as a \nbroadcaster and then, since April 3, 1972, as a reporter and columnist \nfor the Loeb newspapers. He has covered the often-colorful politics of \nthe Granite State, writing the well-known ``Under the State House \nDome'' column. As Dean of the State House press corps, he has been a \nleader in chronicling presidential primaries, state elections, nine \ngovernors, and the State Legislature--the largest in the nation. He has \ntraveled to national conventions for the Democrat and Republican \nparties, interviewed presidents, and even sat down to talk with me on \nmany occasions! My interviews with Donn always left us sharing a \nlaugh--and the resulting stories were always fair, thorough, and \nforthright, as is always Donn's style.\n  Donn's knowledge and expertise about New Hampshire politics is second \nto none. He is the author of ``The Closest U.S. Senate Race in \nHistory,'' a book about the hotly contested, historic election for New \nHampshire's U.S. Senate seat in 1974 between John Durkin and Louis \nWyman--an election that was won by one vote, with a subsequent second \nelection being held the following year.\n  Donn's accomplishments--from sports disk jockey to television host to \npolitical columnist--have brought him many accolades from distinguished \nindividuals across the country. The late William Loeb, frank publisher \nof the Union Leader, said Donn is ``a man of great integrity.'' Former \nNew Hampshire Governor John Sununu said of Donn: ``Nobody is fairer and \nnobody is more of a credit to their profession than Donn. . .''\n  Donn is originally from Manchester, and then went on to attend \nLasalle Military Academy in Long Island, and the University of New \nHampshire. He served 28 years in the military and the reserves with the \nsame honor and distinction he has brought to his career as a \njournalist. He has been a community and civic leader, as well as a \ndedicated husband, father and grandfather.\n  Retirement is a time of reflection, and I know that Donn will spend \nhis retirement years enjoying the memories of his rich and fulfilling \ncareer. I have been told that he is leaving for Corpus Christi, Texas \nthe day after he retires, to spend time traveling with his wife, Janie, \nand visiting his seven grandchildren and twin great-granddaughters.\n  Donn, I wish you all the best for a wonderful retirement. You are a \nman of character, commitment and dignity. We will all miss you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12053-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12053-S12054]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IMF AND US FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE TO INDONESIA\n\n Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my \nconcern about the current financial crisis in Indonesia and the \ndecision of the United States and the international financial community \nto provide bailout assistance.\n  As you know, Mr. President, the International Monetary Fund announced \non October 31 that it was putting together a $23 billion aid package \nfor Jakarta. This money will allow Indonesia to defend its currency, \nwhich has depreciated severely in the last few months. The IMF, the \nWorld Bank, the Asian Development Bank, and the Indonesian government \nwill together provide this $23 billion in financing.\n  In addition to the IMF package, several countries, including the \nUnited States, are offering ``second-line'' loan guarantees that \nIndonesia can use if needed. The Administration has guaranteed a $3 \nbillion loan to Indonesia as part of the Treasury Department's exchange \nstabilization fund. This fund is the same one used to loan $20 billion \nto Mexico during the peso crisis of 1994 and 1995.\n  Mr. President, I understand that the Administration hopes the $23 \nbillion IMF financing will be enough for Indonesia to overcome the \npresent crisis and that Jakarta will not need to draw on the $3 billion \n``second-line'' loan from the United States. Nevertheless,\n\n[[Page S12054]]\n\nAmerican taxpayer money is being put on the line both through the \ndirect loan guarantee and indirectly through the US contributions to \nthe IMF, the World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.\n  While there is clearly a need to help avoid a financial collapse in \nIndonesia that could spill over into other areas of Asia and even to \nthe United States, the US taxpayer has a right to know what kind of \ngovernment they are helping to support.\n  Mr. President, many of Indonesia's present economic problems are the \nresult of rampant corruption and nepotism in the country. Indonesia is \nruled by a single man, President Suharto, and his relatives and friends \ntraditionally enjoy many business perks. Using their connections, this \ngroup has engaged in highly risky and speculative business deals that \nhave exacerbated the present financial crisis. The Financial Times \nreports that of the 16 insolvent banks that Indonesia has been forced \nto close since last week, three are owned by Suharto's children, \nrelatives, or close business associates. The link between the financial \ncrisis and Indonesia's present political system, where power rests in \nthe hands of Suharto's inner circle, is inescapable.\n  The IMF has placed tough economic conditions on the $23 billion. To \nqualify for this funding, Indonesia must enact serious financial \nreforms, dismantle monopolies, and liberalize its trading regime. The \nIMF has also asked for greater transparency in Indonesia's business and \nfinancial markets. But I believe that the IMF and the United States \nshould use the opportunity of this bailout to make all assistance \nconditional on Indonesia undertaking specific and verifiable measures \nto ensure that a newly structured system in Indonesia will be free from \ncorruption and graft.\n  In addition, I strongly feel that Indonesia's need for financial \nsupport gives the world community leverage to ask for long-needed \npolitical reforms. So long as Indonesia is run by a corrupt elite, its \neconomy will never reach its full potential. The present authoritarian \nsystem has bred political instability that will ultimately limit \nIndonesia's economic potential. I read with alarm about the many riots \nand hundreds of deaths that occurred in Indonesia during the May \nelections. This is the result of a system that works largely for the \nbenefit of President Suharto and his family.\n  Finally, I am concerned about the role of the military in Indonesia, \nwhich has sustained a brutal occupation of East Timor for more than 20 \nyears. Press reports indicate that Indonesia maintains more than 20,000 \narmed troops in East Timor. Just because President Suharto's government \nhas boosted the economy in recent years does not mean it has the right \nto murder and torture Indonesians and East Timorese. Economic success \ndoes not excuse you from answering to your own citizens.\n  Political tension in Indonesia will only subside after President \nSuharto initiates real democratic change and, for example, allows all \nparties to compete equally in the political process. Indonesian \nauthorities try to argue that greater democracy will lead to \ninstability which in turn will impede economic development. But, Mr. \nPresident, clearly the problem in Indonesia is not too much democracy, \nbut too little.\n  Mr. President, I urge the administration to use the influence it has \nin the IMF and the other international financial institutions to insure \nthat this $23 billion package contains demands for real anti-corruption \nand political reform measures. At the very least, such conditions must \nbe placed on the $3 billion direct loan the US has offered.\n  These issues--of transparency, of human rights, and of good \ngovernance--are too important for the United States to ignore as we \nbail Indonesia out of this mess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12053-3", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12054-S12055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DELAY OF DR. DAVID SATCHER'S CONFIRMATION AS SURGEON GENERAL AND \n                     ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR HEALTH\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express my concern at \nthe delay in the vote on the nomination of David Satcher to be Surgeon \nGeneral and Assistant Secretary for Health. I understand that some \nSenators have placed holds on the nomination.\n  Dr. Satcher is an excellent choice for these positions. He is a \nrespected family doctor, respected scholar, and respected public health \nleader. For the past 4 years, he has ably led the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention, the agency responsible for protecting the \nNation's health and preventing disease, injury, and premature death.\n  In 1992, under Dr. Satcher's leadership, CDC developed and \nimplemented a very successful childhood immunization initiative. Before \nthe initiative, only a little more than half the Nation's children--55 \npercent--were immunized. Today, the figure is 78 percent, and vaccine-\npreventable childhood diseases are now at record lows.\n  Dr. Satcher has also led CDC efforts to deal more effectively with \ninfectious diseases and food-borne illnesses. We rely heavily on CDC to \nprovide the rapid response needed to combat outbreaks of disease and \nprotect public safety. Under Dr. Satcher, CDC is implementing a new \nstrategy against infectious diseases and a new early warning system to \ndeal with food-borne illnesses.\n  Prior to his appointment to CDC, Dr. Satcher was president of Meharry \nMedical College in Nashville, the Nation's largest private historically \nblack institution for educating health care professionals and \nbiomedical researchers. He previously served as professor and chairman \nof the Department of Community Medicine and Family Practice at the \nMorehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta. He also has been a faculty \nmember at the UCLA School of Medicine and the King/Drew Medical Center \nin Los Angeles, and interim dean of the Drew Postgraduate Medical \nSchool.\n  Dr. Satcher's range of skills and experience and his strong \ncommitment to improving public health make him extremely well qualified \nto be the country's principal official on health care and health policy \nissues--America's Doctor. He's an excellent choice to be Surgeon \nGeneral and Assistant Secretary for Health.\n  Dr. Satcher's nomination has received broad bipartisan support. He's \nbeen endorsed by a large number of health provider groups, including \nthe American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, \nnumerous academic health centers, and public health organizations.\n  Despite these endorsements, a few detractors have emerged and I want \nto take a few moments to address their concerns.\n  Some colleagues have questioned Dr. Satcher's views on abortion. This \nwas not an issue at his confirmation hearing, but some Senators are \nusing the controversial and unconstitutional ``Partial-Birth Abortion \nBan Act'' to attack his credibility.\n  Dr. Satcher believes--as do most Americans--that abortions should be \nsafe, legal, and rare. His position reflects 25 years of medical \nexperience and is consistent with Supreme Court decisions.\n  In fact, Dr. Satcher supports a ban on late-term abortions. But he \nshares President Clinton's view that ``if there are risks for severe \nhealth consequences for the mother, then the decision [to have an \nabortion] should not be made by the government, but by the woman in \nconjunction with her family and physician.''\n  Dr. Satcher's position on this issue is shared by the American \nCollege of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical \nWomen's Association, the American Nurses Association, and the American \nPublic Health Association.\n  Some in the Republican leadership have raised this issue in an \nattempt to defeat an outstanding nominee. Instead of resolving the \nlate-term abortion issue months ago, they would rather play politics \nwith Dr. Satcher's nomination and the lives and health of American \nwomen.\n  The nation faces significant public health challenges. Our national \ninfant mortality rate is at a record low, but it is still higher than \nthat of many countries. Despite recent declines in the teenage birth \nrate, the U.S rate is still the highest in the industrial world.\n  Similarly, in the case of childhood immunization, the rate nationwide \nmay be the highest ever, but in many communities, less than half of 2-\nyear-olds are adequately immunized.\n  The country needs a medical leader whom people can trust to advise \nthem\n\n[[Page S12055]]\n\non their health care. For over two years, the Office of Surgeon General \nhas been vacant. It is irresponsible to put partisanship ahead of \npublic health and safety.\n  Dr. Satcher is an excellent choice to be the Nation's Doctor. I look \nforward to working closely with him, and I urge the Senate to move \nexpeditiously to approve this nomination, so that we can deal more \neffectively with the country's important health challenges. I am \nconfident that Dr. Satcher will serve America well. He deserves to be \nconfirmed now, before this session of Congress ends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12054-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12055]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DRUG DIRECTOR USE OF BIDEN DRUG BUDGET CERTIFICATION AUTHORITY\n\n Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise to offer some remarks on Drug \nDirector Barry McCaffrey's decision to decertify the Defense \nDepartment's proposed antidrug budget for fiscal 1999.\n  At the outset, let me state that I support General McCaffrey's \ndecision to request that the Defense Department increase its budget \nrequest by $140 million for the antidrug initiatives the General \nidentifies: $24 million to boost antidrug task forces on the border to \nhelp implement the United States-Mexico Declaration signed by \nPresidents Clinton and Zedillo in May, 1997; $75 million for enfocement \nand interdiction to reduce the flow of cocaine out of the Andean \nRegion; $30 million for boost National Guard drug efforts on the \nsouthern border; and $12 million to target drug trafficking criminal \nactivity in the Caribbean.\n  Even beyond the specifics of this issue, I am greatly heartened by \nthe fact that General McCaffrey has chosen to exercise this important \nbudget-setting authority. I must admit that I have been frustrated \nthat, until General McCaffrey acted, no drug director had ever used \nthis authority--not William Bennett, not Robert Martinez, and not Lee \nBrown.\n  Let me also be up-front with my colleagues, one of the reasons I so \nstrongly favor this decision is because I wrote this authority into \nlaw. For more than a decade, I debated with the Reagan administration \nand my colleagues to establish the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy. One of the reasons my legislation was so bitterly opposed for \nso long was because I put some real teeth into this legislation. And, \nof all the teeth, it is this budget authority which is the sharpest of \nall.\n  Let me also explain to my colleagues that this so-called Biden Drug \nBudget Authority not only gives the Drug Director the authority to \ndecertify the drug budget requests of the drug agencies, but it is \ncrystal clear what must happen next. Just read the law: If the Drug \nDirector exercises this authority, ``the head of the Department or \nAgency shall comply with such a request.''\n  It does not get much clearer than that.\n  To make one more point--now before the Senate we have legislation to \nre-authorize the Drug Director's office. Yesterday, the Judiciary \nCommittee reported the bipartisan Hatch-Biden reauthorization bill. A \nbill cosponsored by Senators Thurmond, Coverdell, DeWine and Feinstein.\n  It is my hope that not only will the full Senate pass this \nlegislation before we adjourn, but also that the leadership of the \nHouse reject the unproductive and partisan approach it adopted a few \nweeks ago and come onboard the bipartisan Hatch-Biden bill.\n  Nothing puts the need for a Drug Director in starker focus than \nGeneral McCaffrey's action on the Defense Department drug budget. My \ncolleagues should need no other example--though there are many others--\nto recognize the importance of having a Drug Director.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the General's decision on the Defense \nDepartment budget, and I urge my colleagues to take the concrete step \nit is within our power to do--pass the law to keep the Drug Office in \nplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12055-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12055-S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NEIGHBORHOOD REINVESTMENT CORPORATION\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, decent, and affordable housing in \nhealthy neighborhoods for all Americans remains a national goal and a \nserious challenge. One federal initiative that is an exemplar of good \nhousing policy and a wise investment is the Neighborhood Reinvestment \nCorporation. Chartered by Congress in 1978 as a public, non-profit \ncorporation, the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation's purpose is to \nincrease affordable housing and home ownership opportunities while \nrevitalizing low and moderate income neighborhoods that are in decline. \nThat purpose is carried out in partnership with 174 neighborhood based, \nnon-profit organizations in 44 states, the District of Columbia, and \nPuerto Rico. These organizations bring together neighborhood residents, \nlocal governments, and the business community to garner diverse \nresources to carry out neighborhood resident-generated housing and \ncommunity development plans.\n  At least one measure of the effectiveness of the Neighborhood \nReinvestment Corporation and its network of local partners is the kind \nof return gained on the investment. The federal appropriation to the \nNeighborhood Reinvestment Corporation for fiscal year 1998 was \n$60,000,000 which leveraged another $500,000,000 in resources for \nhousing and community development.\n  The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation is one of three components \nof an innovative model of federal-local and public-private \npartnerships. NeighborWorks' is the network of local non-\nprofit organizations that carry out the development work in \nneighborhoods. The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation provides \ngrants and technical assistance to the NeighborWorks' member \norganizations, and conducts extensive training for neighborhood \nresidents and local organization staff. The third component is \nNeighborhood Housing Services of America, a national non-profit \nsecondary market that provides financial services to the \nNeighborWorks' network.\n  Neighborhood reinvestment requires holistic thinking and action in \nmultiple directions, but basic to neighborhood stability is housing. \nPreserving the aging housing stock in urban neighborhoods and \nmaintaining housing affordability are key objectives of the \nNeighborhood Reinvestment Corporation and the NeighborWorks' \nnetwork. Helping low and moderate income homeowners obtain financing \nand qualified contractors to rehabilitate their houses is a staple \nactivity of NeighborWorks' member organizations. \nRehabilitating existing homes on behalf of low and moderate income \nfirst-time home buyers adds new stakeholders to neighborhoods. \nIncreasing the supply of affordable rental housing helps to further \nmeet the housing needs of neighborhood residents.\n  Many of the NeighborWorks' member organizations are mutual \nhousing associations, innovative experiments in an alternative form of \nhome ownership that is proving to be very successful. Mutual housing is \npermanent housing that assures long term affordability and tenure for \nlow and moderate income people in a housing system over which the \nresidents have considerable control. Mutual housing development and \nunits are owned by mutual housing associations. Residents do not \ndirectly buy or sell their units, but are represented on the \nassociation board of directors. As members of the association and based \non their occupancy agreements, the residents in mutual housing are \nconsidered in most states to have a personal property ownership \ninterest in the property. Affordability, protection from displacement, \ndemocratic participation in the management of the housing, and a \nresident stake in the sustained health of the neighborhood are all \nattributes of mutual housing living. Exploring diverse forms of \nhousing, such as mutual housing associations, can help point the way to \nimproving housing affordability for low income people.\n  A key feature of the success of the Neighborhood Reinvestment \nCorporation and NeighborWorks' partnership is the training \ndeveloped and conducted by the Neighborhood Reinvestment Training \nInstitute. Residents, local organization board members, and local \norganization staff participate in extensive training in leadership \ndevelopment, engagement of residents in neighborhood organizations, \nconflict resolution, coalition building, organization management, \nresource development, and much more. This high quality training is \nreplicated in many parts of the country and the lessons learned put to \nwork in local communities.\n\n[[Page S12056]]\n\n  We are seeing results in communities across the country. In my state \nof Massachusetts, the Twin Cities Community Development Corporation \nserves the cities of Fitchburg and Leominster. Terri Murray, the Twin \nCities CDC Executive Director, says that ``top down'' neighborhood \nrevitalization does not succeed and the training is invaluable to \nbuilding strong resident led organizations. The turnaround they are \nexperiencing in declining neighborhoods like the Cleghorn section of \nFitchburg is attributed to a combination of the dedication of \nneighborhood residents, the marshaling of increased municipal services, \nand the leveraging of private and public grants and loans including \nfederal HOME funds. Becoming a member of NeighborWorks' and \nthus a beneficiary of Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation resources \nhas served to strengthen the capacity of the Twin Cities Community \nDevelopment Corporation, supporting its housing rehabilitation, home \nownership, and small business/micro-enterprise development programs.\n  The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation enjoys bipartisan support \nin the Senate. Along with its partners, the NeighborWorks' \nnetwork, and Neighborhood Housing Services of America, the Neighborhood \nReinvestment Corporation is to be commended for its fine work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12055-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12056]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  TRIBUTE TO BERNIE WHITEBEAR, WASHINGTON STATE CITIZEN OF THE DECADE\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, on October 31, 1997 Washington \nstate Governor Gary Locke declared the month of October ``Bernie \nWhitebear Month'' and proclaimed Bernie Whitebear as a ``Citizen of the \nDecade''. I would like to join the Governor, and the whole state of \nWashington in paying tribute to Bernie Whitebear for his outstanding \ncontributions to the Seattle metropolitan community, the urban Native \nAmerican community, the state of Washington, and in fact the entire \nPacific Northwest.\n  For 30 years, Bernie Whitebear has been a voice and representative of \nthe needs and concerns of the urban Indian community in Seattle and \nsurrounding areas. His commitment to the preservation and edification \nof Native American culture within a diverse urban environment has never \nwavered. He established the Minority Executive Director's Coalition of \nKing County, participates in the Northwest Asian American Theater's \nannual community Show-Off, and through his United Indians of All Tribes \nFoundation, acts as the Executive Director of the Daybreak Star \nCultural and Education Center in Discovery Park, a center he \nestablished.\n  In recent years, Bernie has been tireless in his pursuit of his next \nvision: the People's Lodge. The People's Lodge is the next phase of \ndevelopment for the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation (United \nIndians) Indian Cultural Center (ICC) which includes the Daybreak Star \nCenter. The United Indians is a well-established organization thanks to \nBernie with over 20 years of service in Western Washington. The ICC \nmission, and Bernie's focus in life, is to improve the social, \neconomic, and cultural well-being of Native Americans living in the \nmetropolitan Seattle area. Bernie and United Indians run a variety of \neducational, community service, and cultural arts programs serving \n4,000 clients and attracting 30,000 visitors a year. The People's Lodge \nwill improve and expand United Indian's desire to preserve and enhance \nIndian heritage and educate people about Indian cultural diversity. The \nPeople's Lodge will include a permanent Hall of Ancestors exhibition, a \nmultiple-use Potlatch House, and an exhibition gallery, the John \nKauffman, Jr. Theater, a resource center, and the Sacred Circle of the \nAmerican Indian Art.\n  The programs and activities envisioned by Bernie in the People's \nLodge will be a great benefit to the greater Seattle community and the \ncitizen's of Western Washington. The People's Lodge will create new \njobs, serve as a new venue for sales and performances by artists of all \nkinds, and help preserve and advance the cultural heritage of Native \nAmericans in this region. It has been my pleasure to work with Bernie \nin seeking federal support of this project. Bernie has been working \ndiligently to secure an Economic Development Administration grant for \nthe People's Lodge. I urge the EDA to give the grant proposal of United \nIndians for the People's Lodge their utmost consideration.\n  Bernie Whitebear is a true leader for Native Americans in Seattle and \na genuine asset to our community in the greater Seattle area. I \npersonally appreciate his efforts. It is always a pleasure to see \nBernie's warm face and bright smile come into my office. Bernie truly \nis a Citizen of the Decade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12056-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12056-S12057]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             HONORING NEW MEXICO MEDAL OF HONOR RECIPIENTS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Veteran's Day is an appropriate \noccasion to honor those who have served our Nation so nobly. I'd like \nto take this occasion to offer special recognition to New Mexico's most \ndistinguished veterans, our living Medal of Honor winners. Col. Robert \nScott, who celebrates his 84th birthday this month, is a longtime \nresident of Santa Fe, NM, who received the Congressional Medal of Honor \nfor his heroic deeds during World War II. Cpl. Hiroshi Miyamura, from \nGallup, NM, was honored for his bravery as an infantryman during the \nKorean war. Second Lt. Raymond Murphy, a resident of Albuquerque, \nserved heroically with the U.S. Marine Corps during that conflict. Sgt. \nLouis Richard Rocco, also from Albuquerque, celebrating his 59th \nbirthday this month, received the Medal for his courageous deeds as a \nmedic during the Vietnam war. New Mexico and the Nation are proud of \nthese fine men and deeply grateful for their contributions to the \nfreedom enjoyed by all Americans.\n  Since the birth of our Nation in 1776, 40 million American men and \nwomen have bravely sacrificed and served in defense of the freedoms \nthat we enjoy, perhaps even sometimes take for granted. But our freedom \nisn't free, it was bought and paid for with the sacrifices of more than \n1 million of those heroic servicemen and women who gave their lives for \nGod and country. It was our first President who cautioned a young \nnation that, ``If we desire peace, it must be known that we are at all \ntimes prepared for war.''\n  Time and again in our 220-year history, our Nation's sons and \ndaughters have been called upon to demonstrate that preparedness. \nPerhaps in no other war, however, was their resolve more tested than \nwhen our Nation struggled within itself during the Civil War. Early in \nthat conflict, Iowa Senator James W. Grimes realized that soldiers \nneeded not only leadership, they needed role models--heroes to look up \nto and emulate. To accomplish this, he introduced to this body, \nlegislation authorizing a Medal of Honor for sailors and marines who \ndistinguished themselves by their gallantry in action, in order to \n``promote the efficiency of the navy.'' Six months after President \nLincoln authorized the Navy's Medal of Honor on December 21, 1861, he \nsigned similar legislation introduced by Massachusetts Senator Henry \nWilson to establish a Medal of Honor for members of the U.S. Army.\n  Since it was established by the Senate and authorized by President \nLincoln 136 years ago, the Medal of Honor has been awarded to only \n3,408 veterans of military service. The ``roll call'' of heroes \nincludes an 11-year-old Civil War naval cabin boy, an escaped slave, \nthe sons of two Presidents, conscientious objectors, privates and \ngenerals, chaplains and medics, and members of the U.S. Senate. These \nheroes have come from every State in the Union, from all nationalities \nand ethnic backgrounds, and from all social and economic strata. Three \nother Medal of Honor winners hail from New Mexico--about whom we are \nequally proud; Richard Rocco, Raymond Murphy, and Hiroshi Miyamura. \nEach of these men, and all winners of this coveted award have one thing \nin common, an action of such remarkable heroism ``above and beyond the \ncall of duty at the risk of their own life'', that their comrades in \narms have called them ``heroes.''\n\n  World War I gave us 119 Medal of Honor heroes, men like Eddie \nRickenbacker and Sgt. Alvin York. But when the armistice was signed \nconcluding the ``war to end all wars'' at the 11th hour of the 11th day \nof the 11th month in 1918, all America prayed that there would be no \nneed to extend the honor of Medal of Honor recipient to future\n\n[[Page S12057]]\n\ngenerations, a distinction that could be achieved only as a result of \nU.S. involvement in a war.\n  Sadly, this would not be the case. Since that first ``Veterans Day'', \nsubsequent tyranny and human rights violations around the world have \ncontinued to test the commitment of our Nation's men and women in \nuniform. In the horror and devastation of the battles to defend freedom \nand human dignity since World War I, more than 30 million Americans \nhave risked everything. All who served were heroes in their own right, \nand to each of them we owe our thanks, our thoughts and our prayers \nthis Veterans Day. Of this multitude of patriots, only 811 received the \nMedal of Honor. So incredible were their acts of courage that only 316 \nof them survived to wear this highest honor.\n  It is often said that the youth of our Nation today need real heroes, \nmen and women of patriotism and integrity, examples of sacrifice and \nservice; that they can look up to and emulate. We who are of \ngenerations past can lament the loss of great Americans such as Sgt. \nYork, Jimmie Doolittle, Audie Murphy, and other heroes of our \nchildhood. But I am happy to report that today there are still many \nheroes and heroines in our land, men and women who embody the \nprinciples and character that have created and preserved the United \nStates. Among those role models are the millions of veterans that we \nhonor today, and among those veterans of military service are 168 \nsurviving Medal of Honor heroes. Today, as we honor all our Nation's \nveterans, I would like to pay special homage to our New Mexican Medal \nof Honor winners.\n  On November 30, 1913, Robert Sheldon Scott was born here in the \nNation's capital. His family later moved to California where Bob Scott \nattended school before moving again to my own State of New Mexico. Bob \nScott answered his Nation's call to duty to serve during World War II.\n  On June 30, 1943, Gen. Douglas MacArthur and Adm. William Halsey \nlaunched ``Operation Cartwheel'', a bold two-pronged offensive to gain \ncontrol of Rabul in the Pacific. On the day, Admiral Halsey landed the \n43rd Infantry Division on the New Georgia in the Solomon Islands for \nthe purpose of capturing the Japanese-held Munda airstrip. \nUnderestimating the jungles of the island and the tenacity of its \nJapanese defenders, Halsey expected the campaign to last only 2 weeks. \nBy mid-July the Admiral was forced to land two more divisions on the \nisland, and the attack on the airstrip resumed with new fervor on July \n25. More than 1,000 Americans would give up their lives in the effort.\n\n  By July 27, the 43d Infantry's 172d Regiment bogged down in front of \na salient facing the Munda airstrip. Battle-weary and demoralized from \n27 days of bitter fighting, the well-entrenched enemy seemed to have \nagain halted the advance. Two days later, a squad from the 172d's 1st \nBattalion again assaulted the hill. Young Army Lt. Robert Scott led his \nmen halfway up the hill to a position within 75 yards of the enemy, \nwhen the Japanese counterattack stopped them. Enemy soldiers rose from \ntheir fortifications firing their rifles and throwing grenades. Their \nfierce attack threw the exhausted Americans off the hill. Except for \nLieutenant Scott.\n  Ducking behind the blasted remains of a tree stump, the brave \nlieutenant had an unobstructed view of the enemy bunkers. Despite being \ntwice wounded and once having his rifle shot from his hand, for the \nnext half hour, Lieutenant Scott stood alone on the hill to repulse the \nenemy. Throwing some 30 grenades, his one-man stand ended the enemy \nassault and caused them to withdraw. His Medal of Honor citation \nconcludes with the notation that ``our troops, inspired to renewed \neffort by Lieutenant Scott's intrepid stand and incomparable courage, \nswept across the plateau to capture the hill, and from this strategic \nposition, four days later, captured Munda airstrip.''\n  Of his award, Mr. Scott recently wrote, ``I was awarded the Medal of \nHonor in World War II for deeds one day as a Second Lieutenant infantry \nplatoon leader, deeds that I initiated at least in part from the \nconviction that I ought to have enough guts to do what I was authorized \nto order a sergeant or private soldier to try to do.''\n  Today, Bob Scott still lives in the town of his youth, Santa Fe, NM. \nHe is one of four of my State's living Medal of Honor heroes. The ninth \noldest of our Nation's living Medal of Honor recipients, on the 30th \nday of this month, he will celebrate his 84th birthday. Our Governor, \nthe Honorable Gary Johnson, has declared that day to be ``Colonel \nRobert Scott Day'' throughout our State.\n  Other Medal of Honor recipients from New Mexico contributed similar \ndeeds of valor. Corporal Miyamura of Gallup was with Company H holding \na defensive position near Taejon-ni, Korea in April 1951. When the \nenemy began to overrun his position, Corporal Miyamura left his \nsheltered position and engaged the enemy in hand-to-hand combat, then \nreturned to his position to tend to the wounded. Under attack again, \nCorporal Miyamura manned two machine-guns to provide covering fire \nwhile his squad withdrew. He killed more than 50 enemy soldiers before \nhis ammunition was depleted and he was severely wounded.\n\n  Second Lt. Raymond Murphy served as a platoon commander of Company A, \n1st Battalion, 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division in action against the \nenemy west of Panmunjom, Korea. Wounded by artillery fire, Lieutenant \nMurphy refused medical aid while leading his men up a well-defended \nhill through a withering barrage of enemy fire. Murphy rescued many of \nhis fallen comrades and returned each time to lead the assault and \nprovide cover for his troops. While all the wounded evacuated and the \nassaulting units began to disengage, he remained behind with a carbine \nto cover the movement of friendly forces off the hill. After reaching \nthe base of the hill, he organized a search party and again ascended \nthe slope for a final check on missing Marines, locating and carrying \nthe bodies of a machine-gun crew down the hill. Wounded a second time, \nhe again refused medical assistance until he was certain that all of \nhis men had been safely evacuated.\n  Sgt. Louis Richard Rocco of Albuquerque served in Vietnam as a medic \nnortheast of Katum. While evacuating wounded comrades, Sergeant Rocco \ndirected fire against the enemy to enable a helicopter to land and \nassist in the operation. In the battle, the helicopter was disabled by \nenemy fire and crashed.

Mr. President, on Wednesday, November 5, the Asian \nElephant Conservation Act passed the Senate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee with unanimous support. I am hopeful that this \nimportant bill, introduced by Senator Jeffords, will ensure that the \nchildren of the world will not miss out on these extraordinary mammals.\n  The Asian Elephant Conservation Act is constructed along the lines of \nthe successful African Elephant Conservation Act. I have been heartened \nto learn that the African Elephant Act is producing positive results. I \nam hopeful that the Asian Elephant Conservation Act will likewise \nsupport research, conservation, anti-poaching education, and protection \nof the animals. I feel strongly, however, that no funds allocated by \nthese Acts are spent to promote efforts to resume the ivory trade or to \nencourage trophy hunting.\n  According to a 1996 nationwide poll, 84 percent of Americans support \nefforts to protect elephants, yet I have learned that some of the funds \nfrom the African Elephant Conservation Act have gone toward the \npromotion of elephant trophy hunting. There is ongoing debate about the \nsuccess and appropriateness of US taxpayer dollars being used to \nsupport such activities, and I look\n\n[[Page S12058]]\n\nforward to learning more about this troublesome issue in the coming \nmonths.\n  For the time being, however, I wish to ask my colleagues for quick \nsupport and passage of the Asian Elephant Conservation Act. I am \nhonored to be a co-sponsor of the bill, and look forward to finding \nmore ways to protect and conserve endangered species, both in the \nUnited States and abroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12057-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12058]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  APPOINTMENTS BY THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The message of the President is as follows:\nTo the Senate of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith, for the advice and consent of the Senate to \nratification, the Agreement Establishing the South Pacific Regional \nEnvironment Programme, done at Apia on June 16, 1993 (``the \nAgreement''). The report of the Department of State with respect to the \nAgreement is attached for the information of the Senate.\n  The South Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) has existed \nfor almost 15 years to promote cooperation in the South Pacific region, \nto protect and improve the South Pacific environment and to ensure \nsustainable development in that region. Prior to the Agreement, SPREP \nhad the status of an informal institution housed within the South \nPacific Commission. When this institutional arrangement began to prove \ninefficient, the United States and the nations of the region negotiated \nthe Agreement to allow SPREP to become an intergovernmental \norganization in its own right and enhance its ability to promote \ncooperation among its members.\n  The Agreement was concluded in June 1993 and entered into force in \nAugust 1995. Nearly every nation--except the United States--that has \nparticipated in SPREP and in the negotiation of the Agreement is now \nparty to the Agreement. As a result, SPREP now enjoys a formal \ninstitutional status that allows it to deal more effectively with the \npressing environmental concerns of the region. The United States and \nits territories can only participate in its activities as official \nobservers.\n  The Agreement improves the ability of SPREP to serve the interests of \nAmerican Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and \nGuam. Its ratification is supported by our territories and will \ndemonstrate continued United States commitment to, and concern for, the \nSouth Pacific region.\n  Under its terms, the Agreement entered into force on August 31, 1995. \nTo date, Australia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, \nFrance, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Papua New \nGuinea, Solomon Islands, Tonga, and Western Samoa have become parties \nto the Agreement.\n  I recommend that the Senate give early and favorable consideration to \nthe Agreement and give its advice and consent to ratification.\n                                                    William J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, almost 7 months ago, my colleague and I, \nSenator John Breaux, introduced S. 757, legislation identical to H.R. \n1377. This legislation--the Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement \nAct or SAVER is now ready for passage in the Senate and ultimately \nsignature of the President. While it took a little longer than I had \nhoped--it is still a timely and vital piece of legislation.\n  When I introduced the bill back in May, I cited some statistics on \nthe dismal level of savings by individuals in this country. I said that \nonly about one-third of American workers had calculated how much they \nwill need to save by retirement in order to maintain their standard of \nliving. I said that workers in the 40's to the early 50's had seen \ntheir savings levels drop by 6 percent from 1988 to 1994.\n\n[[Page S12059]]\n\n  Well, these kinds of numbers are very consistent with new data \nrecently released by the Employee Benefit Research Institute in its \nannual Retirement Confidence Survey. Slightly more than one-third of \nthe people surveyed in 1997 have even tried to determine how much they \nneed to save by retirement. Only 27 percent of Americans had an idea of \nwhat they would need to accumulate in order to retire and maintain \ntheir standard of living.\n  And people are very afraid. A recent poll by USA Today indicated that \n49 percent of people are afraid of not having enough money for \nretirement.\n  Clearly, people need help in learning how to achieve a secure \nretirement. The SAVER bill which is now before the Senate, will do \nthat. The SAVER Act will direct the Department of Labor to maintain an \nongoing public education campaign about the need to save for \nretirement. This campaign will include a broad scope of initiatives \nincluding public service announcements, covering public meetings, and \ncrating and disseminating educational materials.\n  Education has proven to be a powerful motivator for people to pay \nattention to their retirement savings. According to the Retirement \nConfidence Survey, of those employees who were provided educational \nprograms and materials about the company pension plan, 45 percent said \nthat it led them to begin contributing to the plan. Furthermore, 49 \npercent said that the educational programs and materials led them to \nreallocate their money among investment options offered.\n  The Department of Labor already has a good start on a public \neducation initiative; this legislation will ensure that public \neducation will continue beyond the current administration because this \nis a problem that will not go away.\n  The second important piece of this legislation is the creation of a \nnational event--a national summit on retirement savings at the White \nHouse. This summit will be a truly bipartisan event--hosted by both the \nexecutive and congressional branch. The summit will bring together more \nthan 200 experts in the field of pensions and retirement savings, \nelected officials, and representatives from the private sector and the \npublic--all with the goal of raising the profile of the importance of \nsaving and identifying barriers to saving and pension formation.\n  The first national summit will be held in the summer of 1998--just a \nshort time from now. We will be able to get the summit organized due in \nlarge part to the groundwork already laid by a very effective group--\nthe American Savings Education Council or ASEC. ASEC is unique in its \norigins and its mission. Its membership is made up of public and \nprivate sector employers financial, educational, and service \norganizations; and government agencies.\n  The organization is committed to helping individuals understand what \nthey need to do to prepare for retirement and to encourage savings for \nthe future. ASEC has already made appearances in towns around the \ncountry to talk about retirement planning and has distributed a logical \nchoice for a private partner to work with the public sector lead--the \nDepartment of Labor--to get the national summit on track for 1998.\n  I would like to commend Congressmen Harris Fawell and Donald Payne \nfor introducing this legislation in the House. The support they \ngenerated was an important part of the successful consideration of this \nbill. I also want to acknowledge the cosponsors in the Senate--Senator \nKerry, Senator Kyl, Senator Hagel, Senator Tim Hutchinson, Senator \nRobb, Senator Collins, and Senator Cochran.\n  Today's workers need to be prepared for retirement--private savings \ncan help minimize the risk that they will spend down their employers's \n401(k) or count on more pension benefits than they will actually \nreceive from their employer. Or, help prepare for the costs of medical \ncare through long-term care insurance--that is an expense that worries \nmany of today's retirees and their children. As we prepare for debate \nover the future of public retirement programs we must not overlook the \nrole that private savings and an employer-based pension will play. The \nGovernment should play role in encouraging individuals to acquire \nknowledge that will help them achieve a secure standard of living when \nthey are no longer able to work--SAVER is a critical first step in \nhelping people achieve their hopes for retirement.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nbe agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1612) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, as amended, that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill appear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 1377), as amended, was read a third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12058-6", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12059-S12061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CLONE PAGER AUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1997\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 166, S. 170.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 170) to provide for a process to authorize the \n     use of clone pagers, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to sponsor S. 170, the clone \nPager authorization Act, and urge its speedy passage. This bill would \nenable law enforcement officers to gain quicker and easier access to an \nimportant investigatory tool, called a clone pager, which has proven \ninvaluable in gathering evidence against gang members, drug traffickers \nand organized crime members.\n  I was pleased to have helped improve this bill from the version \nintroduced in the last congress. We included it in the juvenile crime \nbill, S. 15, that I sponsored along with other Democratic Members on \nthe first day of this session and which the Democratic leader \ndesignated among our top legislative priorities.\n  While pagers are, of course, used legitimately by millions of people, \nthese devices are relied upon by gangsters and drug dealers to carry on \ntheir illicit business from roving offices that enable time to commit \ncrimes no matter where they are at any time of day or night. Indeed, \npagers are so popular among drug traffickers, these devices are \nconsidered a regular tool of the drug trade.\n  A clone pager is programmed identically to the pager used by a \nsuspected criminal so that it displays the same numbers transmitted to, \nand displayed on, the suspect's pager. A law enforcement officer using \nthe clone pager is thereby able to receive the identical pager message \nat the same time as the targeted criminal.\n  How does this help law enforcement? When a drug dealer moves about \ntown conducting his illicit business, he can keep in constant touch \nwith his criminal associates, including his drug suppliers and \ncustomers, by carrying a pager. Contacting the dealer wherever he may \nbe is a simple matter of calling his pager. The drug dealer can then \npull up to the nearest public telephone to return the call at the \nnumber displayed on his pager. A clone pager, which simultaneously \ndisplays the same call-back numbers received by the targeted drug \ndealer, alerts law enforcement officers to the telephone numbers used \nby the dealer's suppliers and associates, and through those numbers, \ntheir locations.\n  To determine the telephone numbers of associates called by, or \ncalling to, a criminal suspect's land-line or cellular telephone, law \nenforcement officers use a pen register or trap and trace device. Yet, \nwhen criminals opt to conduct their business using pagers-- often times \nto thwart police surveillance--law enforcement officers must obtain \nauthority under the wiretap law to use a clone pager. Even though clone \npagers reveal essentially the same information about the telephone \nnumbers of associates calling the suspect as do pen register and trap \nand trace devices, the procedures for wiretap authorization are \nsignificantly more complicated and more time--consuming than those to \nobtain authority for\n\n[[Page S12060]]\n\nuse of pen register and trap and trace devices. The additional \nprocedural hurdles necessary to use clone pagers benefit only the \ncriminal.\n  This bill would permit law enforcement to use a clone pager based on \nthe same form of court authorization necessary to use a pen register or \ntrap and trace device. In fact, certain of the requirements for wiretap \nauthorization simply make no sense when the investigatory tool being \nauthorized is a clone numeric pager.\n  Thus, courts confronted with defense motions to suppress evidence \nderived from clone pagers for failure to comply with wiretap procedures \nhave concluded that certain statutory requirements for wiretaps do not \napply. For example, since clone numeric pagers do not reveal the \ncontent of any conversation or even whether any conversation actually \noccurred, courts have found that it is impossible to minimize clone \nnumeric pager interceptions as is required for interceptions of wire, \noral or electronic communications. See, e.g., U.S. v. Bautista, 1992 \nU.S. App. LEXIS 16829, 7 (4th Cir. 1992); U.S. v. tutino, 883 F.2d \n1125, 1141 (2d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1081 (1990) \n(``minimization requirements cannot reasonably be applied to clone \nbeepers''); U.S. v. Gambino, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 10689, 7 (S.D.N.Y. \n1995).\n  Furthermore, since the numbers captured from clone numeric pagers are \nusually manually, rather than electronically or mechanically, recorded \nby law enforcement officers, courts have concluded that the recordation \nand sealing requirements of the wiretap law have limited utility and \nrefused to suppress for failure to comply with these requirements. U.S. \nv. Suarez, 906 F.2d 977, 984 (4th Cir. 1990) U.S. v. Paredes-Moya, 722 \nF. Supp. 1402, 1408 (N.D. Tex. 1989).\n  Instead of providing fodder for defense motions, the time is long \noverdue for Congress to apply common sense and require law enforcement \nto follow more appropriate procedures--no more and no less--to obtain \nauthorization to use clone numeric pagers.\n  this bill would conform the requirements to obtain legal \nauthorization for use of a clone pager to those for use of a pen \nregister or trap and trace device. As one court recognized, ``[u]nlike \ntelephone wiretaps, duplicate paging devices reveal only numbers, not \nthe content of conversation. In this way they are similar to pen \nregisters.'' U.S. v. Tutino, supra, 883 F.2d at 1141. Specifically, the \nbill would authorize a Federal court to issue an order authorizing the \nuse of a clone numeric display pager to receive the communications \nintended for another such pager, upon certification of an attorney for \nthe government or law enforcement officer that the information likely \nto be obtained is relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation.\n\n  This new authority would be limited to clone numeric display pagers, \nnot more sophisticated pagers that transmit and receive written or oral \ntextual messages. The only communications obtained from, and displayed \non, clone numeric display pagers are numbers dialed into a telephone \nfor transmission to the suspect's pager--just like the information \nobtained from a pen register or trap and trace device.\n  These numbers usually are callback telephone numbers, but may also \ninclude other incidental or coded numbers. Such incidental or coded \nnumbers are also captured by pen register or trap and trace devices. \nThe capturing of incidental or coded numbers by pen registers prompted \nCongress to require in the 1994 Communications Assistance for Law \nEnforcement Act [CALEA] that technology ``reasonably available'' be \nused to restrict the recording or decoding of numbers to the ``dialing \nor signaling information utilized in call processing.'' 18 U.S.C. \nSec. 3121(c).\n  Tone-only paging devices are already completely exempt from the \nwiretap law, as amended in 1986 by the Electronic Communications \nPrivacy Act [ECPA]. The ECPA extended the protections of Title III of \nthe Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (``Title III'') \nto unauthorized interceptions of ``electronic communications.'' My main \npurpose in sponsoring ECPA was, as the Senate Report indicates, ``to \nupdate and clarify Federal privacy protections and standards in light \nof dramatic changes in new computer and telecommunications \ntechnologies.'' S. Rep. No. 541, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 1, reprinted in \n1986 U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News 3555, 3555. Alphanumeric display \npagers, which visually display both numbers and letters, and \nsophisticated tone and voice pagers should, in my view, continue to be \nsubject to the wiretap authorization procedures. The nature of the \ncommunication captured by numeric display pagers, however, is so akin \nto the information obtained by pen register and trap and trace devices, \nthat the procedures and standards for their authorized use by law \nenforcement should be equalized.\n  As criminals use technological advances for their own ill purposes, \nCongress must continue, as we did with ECPA and CALEA, to give law \nenforcement the reasonable authority it needs to keep up, while \nprotecting legitimate privacy interests. This bill does so, and I \nsupport its passage.\n  Passage of this bill will not mean the end of our work in this area, \nhowever. The judicial role in approving the use of pen register and \ntrap and trace devices is severely limited and, in fact, relegates \njudges to merely a ministerial role. U.S. v. Fregoso, 60 F.3d 1314, \n1320 (8th Cir. 1995); U.S. v. Hallmark, 911 F.2d 399, 402 (10th cir. \n1990); In re Order Authorizing Installation of Pen Reg., 846 F. Supp. \n1555, 1558-59 (M.D. Fla. 1994). The court's limited role is to confirm, \nfirst, the identity of the applicant and investigating law enforcement \nagency, and second, certification from the applicant that the \ninformation sought is relevant to an ongoing investigation. See 18 \nU.S.C. Sec. Sec. 3121-3127.\n  Significantly, the judge is not authorized to review, let alone \nquestion, the basis for the relevancy determination. If the appropriate \ncertification appears, the judge must authorize the pen register or \ntrap and trace device. This is an anomalous limitation on the judicial \nrole. While relevance to an ongoing criminal investigation remains an \nappropriate basis for use of a pen register or trap and trace device, \nCongress should reexamine the limitation on judicial authority to \nreview this determination. This remains unfinished business.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to this bill \nappear at the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Hispanics of the Southwest and New \nMexico will be celebrating an important milestone next year. 1998 is \nthe 400th anniversary of permanent Hispanic presence in New Mexico. In \n1598, Juan de Onate arrived in New Mexico and founded the second city \nof the United States, San Gabriel de los Espanoles. This was the first \npermanent Spanish settlement in New Mexico. From New Mexico, Juan de \nOnate traveled across the desert to California where he founded San \nFrancisco in 1605.\n  On the occasion of the 400th anniversary of Spanish presence, New \nMexico will be beginning a new era of Spanish pride and cooperation \nwith other cultures. In New Mexico, we are very proud of our cultural \nrelations between the Indian, Spanish, and Anglo people. It is now time \nto pay special tribute to the Spanish people of New Mexico, the \nSouthwest, and the United States.\n  In preparing for the 400th anniversary celebrations, the State of New \nMexico has invested over $17.7 million toward the establishment of \nphase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center. In addition, the \ncity of Albuquerque has donated 10.9 acres and a historic 22,000-\nsquare-foot building. Twelve acres of ``bosque'' land near the Rio \nGrande have also been donated by the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy \nDistrict. Private contributions are also helping to meet the Hispanic \nCultural Center goals.\n  I am asking my colleagues to authorize funding to match these New \nMexico contributions. This authorization is to build the critical \nHispanic Performing Arts Center at an estimated cost of $17.8 million. \nI believe the people of New Mexico have done an excellent job in \ncommitting their own resources for an art gallery, museum, restaurant, \nballroom, amphitheater, research center, literary arts center, and \nother supportive components.\n  To showcase the Hispanic culture for all Americans, the Hispanic \nPerforming Arts Center is a vital component. Phase II plans include a \n700-seat theater, a stage house, a 300-seat film/video center, a 150-\nseat black box theater, an art studio building, a culinary art \nbuilding, and a research and literary arts building. The estimated cost \nof all phase II components is $26 million. By agreeing to authorize the \nHispanic Performing Arts Center, Congress will make a significant \ncontribution toward the phase II plan.\n  Not counting the land contributions, phase I and phase II design, \nconstruction, equipping, and furnishing is estimated to cost slightly \nmore than $40 million. Major infrastructure components are included in \nboth phases. These include an aqueduct, acequia, and pond from the \nBarelas Drain; parking; a plaza and courtyard, and landscaping.\n  Phase I is now near the bidding stage. The Hispanic Performing Arts \nand Film Arts--the three theaters--are estimated to cost $17.8 million, \nwith necessary equipment--construction: $15.9 million; fixed equipment: \n$1.9 million. The remaining components of phase II are estimated to \ncost $8 million.\n  This multifaceted Hispanic Cultural Center is designed to showcase, \nshare, archive, preserve, and enhance the rich Hispanic culture for \nlocal, regional, and national audiences. It is designed to be a tourist \nattraction as well as a great source of local pride.\n  The Hispanic Cultural Center will be the southernmost facility on a \ncultural corridor that includes the Rio Grande Nature Center, the \nAlbuquerque Aquarium, Botanical Gardens, and the Rio Grande Zoo. \nHistoric Old Town Albuquerque is at the center of this cultural \ncorridor.\n  Antoine Predock of Albuquerque and Pedro Marquez of Santa Fe were the \noriginal design architects. Mr. Predock is an internationally \nrecognized architect and his design will enhance the attractiveness of \nthe center. To promote the Spanish and Southwestern themes, they have \nemphasized the inclusion of New Mexico architectural features such as \nadobe construction--like the existing historic building used as the \nadministrative center--courtyards, portals, cottonwoods for shading, \nand the irrigation ditches known in New Mexico as ``acequias''. The \nsite is at the corner of Fourth Street and Bridge Boulevard in \nSouthwest Albuquerque.\n  Once built, the Hispanic Cultural Center will employ over 100 people. \nTourism dollars are expected to increase in this part of Albuquerque, \nand new ancillary businesses are anticipated to complement and enhance \nthe attractions in the historic Barelas Neighborhood of Albuquerque.\n  The many forms of art, culture, research, performing arts, culinary \narts, literature, and other activities are expected to add important \ncultural connections to the roots of the local and state Hispanic \npeople. Completion of the Hispanic Performing Arts Center will be the \nmajor facility needed to showcase live and filmed Spanish cultural \nevents. A whole new industry of preserving, showcasing, and enhancing \npride in Spanish cultural roots is a vital anticipated benefit of this \nNew Mexico-based Hispanic institution.\n  Visitors are expected from California, New York, Florida, Texas, \nWisconsin, Minnesota, and other States with large Hispanic populations. \nThe New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center and its active Hispanic \nPerforming Arts Center are expected to become nationally known \ntreasures of living Hispanic culture in America.\n  I believe that authorizing Federal funding for the Hispanic \nPerforming Arts Center will be a significant step toward this budding \nnational treasure in its critical formative stages. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the funding for the Hispanic Performing Arts \nCenter in Albuquerque, NM, in honor of the 400th anniversary of Spanish \nculture, and in hopes of seeing the preservation and enhancement of \nthis culture flourish into its 500th year.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the bill be deemed read the third \ntime and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and \nany statements relating to the bill appear at this point in the Record\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1417) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1417\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This act may be cited as the Hispanic \n     Cultural Center Act of 1997.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONSTRUCTION OF A CENTER FOR PERFORMING ARTS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States has an enriched legacy of Hispanic \n     influence in politics, government, economic development, and \n     cultural expression.\n       (2) The Hispanic culture in what is now the United States \n     can be traced to 1528 when a Spanish expedition from Cuba to \n     Florida was shipwrecked on the Texas coast.\n       (3) The Hispanic culture in New Mexico can be traced to \n     1539 when a Spanish Franciscan Friar, Marcos de Niza, and his \n     guide, Estevanico, traveled into present day New Mexico in \n     search of the fabled city of Cibola and made contact with the \n     people of Zuni.\n       (4) The Hispanic influence in New Mexico is particularly \n     dominant and a part of daily living for all the citizens of \n     New Mexico, who are a diverse composite of racial, ethnic, \n     and cultural peoples. Don Juan de Onate and the first New \n     Mexican families established the first capital in the United \n     States, San Juan de los Caballeros, in July of 1598.\n       (5) Based on the 1990 census, there are approximately \n     650,000 Hispanics in New Mexico, the majority having roots \n     reaching back ten or more generations.\n       (6) There are an additional 200,000 Hispanics living \n     outside of New Mexico with roots in New Mexico.\n\n[[Page S12063]]\n\n       (7) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center is a living \n     tribute to the Hispanic experience and will provide all \n     citizens of New Mexico, the Southwestern United States, the \n     entire United States, and around the world, an opportunity to \n     learn about, partake in, and enjoy the unique Hispanic \n     culture, and the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will \n     assure that this 400-year old culture is preserved.\n       (8) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will teach, \n     showcase, and share all facets of Hispanic culture, including \n     literature, performing arts, visual arts, culinary arts, and \n     language arts.\n       (9) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will promote a \n     better cross-cultural understanding of the Hispanic culture \n     and the contributions of individuals to the society in which \n     we all live.\n       (10) In 1993, the legislature and Governor of New Mexico \n     created the Hispanic Cultural Division as a division within \n     the Office of Cultural Affairs. One of the principal \n     responsibilities of the Hispanic Cultural Division is to \n     oversee the planning, construction, and operation of the New \n     Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (11) The mission of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     is to create a greater appreciation and understanding of \n     Hispanic culture.\n       (12) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will serve as \n     a local, regional, national, and international site for the \n     study and advancement of Hispanic culture, expressing both \n     the rich history and the forward-looking aspirations of \n     Hispanics throughout the world.\n       (13) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will be a \n     Hispanic arts and humanities showcase to display the works of \n     national and international artists, and to provide a venue \n     for educators, scholars, artists, children, elders, and the \n     general public.\n       (14) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will provide a \n     venue for presenting the historic and contemporary \n     representations and achievements of the Hispanic culture.\n       (15) The New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center will sponsor \n     arts and humanities programs, including programs related to \n     visual arts of all forms (including drama, dance, and \n     traditional and contemporary music), research, literary arts, \n     genealogy, oral history, publications, and special events \n     such as, fiestas, culinary arts demonstrations, film video \n     productions, storytelling presentations and education \n     programs.\n       (16) Phase I of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     complex is scheduled to be completed by August of 1998 and is \n     planned to consist of an art gallery with exhibition space \n     and a museum, administrative offices, a restaurant, a \n     ballroom, a gift shop, an amphitheater, a research and \n     literary arts center, and other components.\n       (17) Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center \n     complex is planned to include a performing arts center \n     (containing a 700-seat theater, a stage house, and a 300-seat \n     film/video theater), a 150-seat black box theater, an art \n     studio building, a culinary arts building, and a research and \n     literary arts building.\n       (18) It is appropriate for the Federal Government to share \n     in the cost of constructing the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n     Center because Congress recognizes that the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center has the potential to be a premier \n     facility for performing arts and a national repository for \n     Hispanic arts and culture.\n       (b) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Center.--The term `Center' means the Center for \n     Performing Arts, within the complex known as the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center, which Center for the Performing \n     Arts is a central facility in Phase II of the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center complex.\n       (2) Hispanic cultural division.--The term `Hispanic \n     Cultural Division' means the Hispanic Cultural Division of \n     the Office of Cultural Affairs of the State of New Mexico.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n       (c) Construction of Center.--The Secretary shall award a \n     grant to New Mexico to pay for the Federal share of the costs \n     of the design, construction, furnishing, and equipping of the \n     Center for Performing Arts that will be located at a site to \n     be determined by the Hispanic Cultural Division, within the \n     complex known as the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (d) Grant Requirements.--\n       (1) In general.--In order to receive a grant awarded under \n     subsection (c), New Mexico, acting through the Director of \n     the Hispanic Cultural Division--\n       (A) shall submit to the Secretary, within 30 days of the \n     date of enactment of this section, a copy of the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center Program document dated January 1996;

or any other architect \n     subsequently named by the state.\n       (C) that the Director of the Hispanic Cultural Division \n     shall award the contract for architectural engineering and \n     design services in accordance with the New Mexico Procurement \n     Code; and\n       (D) that the contract for the construction of the Center--\n       (i) shall be awarded pursuant to a competitive bidding \n     process; and\n       (ii) shall be awarded not later than 3 months after the \n     solicitation for bids for the construction of the Center.\n       (3) Federal share.--The Federal share of the costs \n     described in subsection (c) shall be 50 percent.\n       (4) Non-federal share.--The non-Federal share of the costs \n     described in subsection (c) shall be in cash or in kind \n     fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. \n     The non-Federal share shall include any contribution received \n     by New Mexico for the design, construction, furnishing, or \n     equipping of Phase I or Phase II of the New Mexico Hispanic \n     Cultural Center complex prior to the date of enactment of \n     this section. The non-Federal share of the costs described in \n     subsection (c) shall include the following:\n       (A) $16,410,000 that was appropriated by the New Mexico \n     legislature since January 1, 1993, for the planning, property \n     acquisition, design, construction, furnishing, and equipping \n     of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center complex.\n       (B) $116,000 that was appropriated by the New Mexico \n     legislature for fiscal year 1995 for the startup and \n     operating expenses of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n     Center.\n       (C) $226,000 that was appropriated by the New Mexico \n     legislature for fiscal year 1996 for the startup and \n     operating expenses of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n     Center.\n       (D) $442,000 that was appropriated by the New Mexico \n     legislature for fiscal year 1997 for the startup and \n     operating expenses of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n     Center.\n       (E) $551,000 that was appropriated by the New Mexico \n     legislature for fiscal year 1998 for the startup and \n     operating expenses of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural \n     Center.\n       (F) A 10.9-acre lot with a historic 22,000 square foot \n     building donated by the Mayor and City Council of \n     Albuquerque, New Mexico, to New Mexico for the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (G) 12 acres of ``Bosque'' land adjacent to the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center complex for use by the New Mexico \n     Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (H) The $30,000 donation by the Sandia National \n     Laboratories and Lockheed Martin Corporation to support the \n     New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center and the program \n     activities of the New Mexico Hispanic Cultural Center.\n       (e) Use of Funds for Design, Construction, Furnishing, and \n     Equipment.--The funds received under a grant awarded under \n     subsection (c) shall be used only for the design, \n     construction, management, inspection, furnishing, and \n     equipment of the Center.\n       (f) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section \n     a total of $17,800,000 for fiscal year 1998 and succeeding \n     fiscal years. Funds appropriated pursuant to the authority of \n     the preceding sentence shall remain available until expended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12062-1", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12063-S12064]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n AUTHORIZING TESTIMONY, PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND REPRESENTATION BY \n                          SENATE LEGAL COUNSEL\n\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Senate Resolution 147 submitted earlier today by \nSenators Lott and Daschle.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S.

Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the resolution?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the civil case of First American \nCorporation, et al. versus Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan, et al., \npending in the District Court for the District of Columbia, presents \nclaims arising out of the former business relationships between First \nAmerican Bank and the Bank of Credit and Commerce, International, known \nas BCCI.\n  BCCI's business dealings were the subject of extensive hearings by \nthe Subcommittee on Terrorism, Narcotics, and International Operations, \nof the Committee on Foreign Relations, between 1988 and 1992. Senator \nJohn Kerry, who chaired that subcommittee, and former Senator Hank \nBrown, who was the ranking member, prepared a lengthy report \ndocumenting their findings.\n\n[[Page S12064]]\n\n  The Foreign Relations Committee has received a request for a former \ncounsel to the subcommittee, Jack Blum, to testify in this civil action \nabout responses that the Subcommittee received to its requests for \ninformation in the course of its investigation. The Committee believes \nthat it is appropriate to authorize the testimony requested on this \nsubject. This resolution would accordingly authorize Mr. Blum to \ntestify about this subject, but the resolution authorizes no other \ntestimony by any Member or employee.\n  The committee has also received a request for committee records in \nconnection with this case. In keeping with prior Senate practice, this \nresolution will not authorize the wholesale production of committee \nrecords, but authorizes the chairman and ranking member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee to produce, on a case-by-case basis, copies of \nselective committee records from this subcommittee investigation, where \na strong basis for the request has been shown and the Senate's \nprivileges permit.\n  Finally, the resolution authorizes the Senate legal counsel to \nprovide representation in connection with the requests for testimony \nand documents in this proceeding.\n  Mr. LOTT. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the resolution appear at this point \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 48) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, is as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 48\n\n       Whereas there is substantial evidence missile technology \n     and technical advice have been provided from Russia to Iran, \n     in violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime;\n       Whereas these violations include providing assistance to \n     Iran in developing ballistic missiles, including the transfer \n     of wind tunnel and rocket engine testing equipment;\n       Whereas these technologies give Iran the capability to \n     deploy a missile of sufficient range to threaten United \n     States military installations in the Middle East and Persian \n     Gulf, as well as the territory of Israel, and our North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization ally Turkey; and\n       Whereas President Clinton has raised with Russian President \n     Boris Yeltsin United States concerns about these activities \n     and the Russian response has to date been inadequate: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of the Congress that--\n       (1) the President should demand that the Government of \n     Russia take concrete actions to stop governmental and \n     nongovernmental entities in the Russian Federation from \n     providing missile technology and technical advice to Iran, in \n     violation of the Missile Technology Control Regime;\n       (2) if the Russian response is inadequate, the United \n     States should impose sanctions on the responsible Russian \n     entities in accordance with Executive Order 12938 on the \n     Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction, and reassess \n     cooperative activities with Russia;\n       (3) the threshold under current law allowing for the waiver \n     of the prohibition on the release of foreign assistance to \n     Russia should be raised; and\n       (4) our European allies should be encouraged to take steps \n     in accordance with their own laws to stop such proliferation.\n\n  Mr. KLY Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for their \nsupport of Senate Concurrent Resolution 48, which was adopted by \nunanimous consent.\n  This resolution is important because over the past few months a \nseries of increasingly troubling reports have been published indicating \nRussian organizations are continuing to provide missile assistance to \nIran. According to these reports, Russia has supplied blueprints and \ncomponents for the 2,000 kilometer range SS-4 ballistic missile, as \nwell as a wide variety of equipment and material useful in the design \nand manufacture of ballistic missiles, including special metals, a wind \ntunnel, and missile design software.\n  These press accounts are corroborated by an unclassified CIA report \nto Congress released in June titled, ``The Acquisition of Technology \nRelating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional \nMunitions,'' which states that, ``Russia supplied a variety of \nballistic missile-related goods to foreign countries [in late 1996], \nespecially Iran.''\n  These reports clearly make the point that the assistance provided by \nRussian organizations is the critical factor which has accelerated the \npace of Iran's ballistic missile program and may enable Tehran to \ncomplete development of a missile, called the Shahab-3, that will have \nsufficient range to strike United States forces in the region and \nIsrael in as little as 12 to 18 months. In addition, Iran is also \nreceiving Russian assistance with the development of a second missile, \ncalled the Shahab-4, that would have enough range to reach Central \nEurope and could be deployed in as little as 3 years.\n  The resolution adopted today expresses the sense of the Congress that \nthe President should demand that the Russian Government take concrete \nactions to stop governmental and nongovernmental organizations from \nassisting Iran's missile program. If Russia fails to respond to United \nStates concerns, the resolution calls on the President to impose \nsanctions on the responsible Russian entities.\n  This legislation does not require new sanctions, but rather calls on \nthe administration to enforce the substantial\n\n[[Page S12065]]\n\namount of existing sanctions law. The fact that the resolution was \nadopted by unanimous consent in the Senate and passed by an \noverwhelming vote of 414 to 8 in the House of Representatives sends a \nclear signal to Russia and the administration that this dangerous trade \nmust stop now.\n  I am very pleased that from its inception, this resolution has \nenjoyed bipartisan support; 39 Senators, from both sides of the aisle, \ncosponsored the measure and I want to thank them for their support and \nalso thank Representative Jane Harman who was the principal sponsor of \nthe resolution in the House of Representatives and worked tirelessly on \nits behalf. It has been a pleasure working with Representative Harman \nover the past few months and I look forward to continuing to work \nclosely with her to address the national security challenges facing our \nNation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of S. 1454, introduced earlier today \nby Senator Bond, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will read the bill.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1454) to provide a 6-month extension of highway, \n     highway safety, and transit programs pending enactment of a \n     law reauthorizing the Intermodal Surface Transportation \n     Efficiency Act of 1991.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I want to say how much I appreciate the \nwonderful work on this legislation by Senator Bond, Senator Warner, \nSenator Baucus, and others. I am pleased to joint them in cosponsoring \nthe Surface Transportation Extension Act of 1997.\n  Seven weeks ago, the Committee on Environment and Public Works \nunanimously reported out S. 1173, better known as ISTEA II. I am proud \nof the committee's efforts to come to an agreement on a very difficult \npiece of legislation. We filed the report at the end of September, and \nwe were prepared to complete action on the bill before the end of the \ncalendar year. Regrettably, a number of unrelated events having nothing \nto do with ISTEA have prevented us from completing work this year on a \n6-year reauthorization bill.\n  As the prospects have dimmed for the enactment of a 6-year bill this \nyear, it is clear that we cannot go home before taking care of a number \nof concerns. This past Tuesday, November 4, the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works Subcommittee on Transportation and \nInfrastructure held a hearing on which many of these concerns were \nbrought to light. First of all, if Congress does nothing, a number of \nStates will be hard-pressed to survive through the spring on their \nexisting unobligated balances. Second, States are restricted in using \ntheir unobligated balances across Federal-aid highway, transit, and \nsafety categories. Third, a number of Federal transportation safety \nprograms, as well as the Federal transit program, have no funds to \ncarry over into this fiscal year. Finally, without any relief, the \nFederal Highway Administration will be forced to shut down in January, \nwhich could result in 3,600 employees being furloughed.\n  Despite the gloomy reports of what could happen if Congress fails to \nact, there is a solution. Senators Bond, Warner, Baucus, and I have a \nmeasure that addresses the needs of the States, the safety programs, \nthe Federal-aid highway program, and transit. First of all, the bill \nbefore us will keep the nation's transportation system up and running \nuntil we enact the long-term reauthorization bill. It gives States the \nflexibility they need to continue transportation planning and \nconstruction activities. Each State is guaranteed at least 50 percent \nof the previous year's spending limitation to spend on any \ntransportation project or program. To keep the States on equal footing, \nhowever, no state may spend more than 75 percent of its 1997 spending \nlimitation.\n  Second, the bill provides states with flexibility to spend their \nunobligated balances on any highway, safety, or transit program \ncategory. To prevent important environmental programs such as the \nCongestion Mitigation and Air Quality Improvement Program [CMAQ] from \nbeing unfairly disadvantaged, however, the Secretary of Transportation \nwould restore the transferred funds back to these programs when the new \nreauthorization bill is enacted.\n  Third, the bill provides funding for key ISTEA safety and transit \nprograms. The Motor Carrier Safety Assistance Program, the State and \nCommunity Safety Grant Program, the National Driver Register, Operation \nLifesaver, and the Alcohol-impaired Driving Countermeasures Program, \nwill continue to run. Also, the Federal transit discretionary and \nformula programs will receive the funds they need. Fourth, the bill \nprovides funds for the Federal Highway Administration to continue \noperating and assisting the States with their transportation programs.\n  Before closing, let me comment on what the bill before us does not \ndo. Unlike the 6-month extension bill that was approved by the House \nearlier this month, this bill does not provide States with contract \nauthority for 1 year's worth of highway construction. Our bill gives \nthe States until May 1 of next year to obligate the funds provided in \nthis bill. The trouble with including funds that will not run out until \nnext November is that there will be no pressure to enact permanent \nISTEA legislation until that time, right before the 1998 elections. \nPushing the decision off until next fall runs the risk of our being \nwithout a bill 1 year from now. Moreover, this measure avoids the \ncontentious fight we would have over apportionment formulas and funding \ncategories if we were to take up the House bill.\n  The bill before us is by no means perfect, but it is the optimal \napproach to the situation. Our hopes for an ideal outcome were dashed \nwhen we were unable to complete work on a 6-year reauthorization bill. \nThis measure keeps the State and Federal transportation programs \nrunning, it ensures that no highway contractors are put out of work, \nand it continues funding for vital safety and transit programs. Most \nimportant, it will keep the momentum going to enact a 6-year bill early \nnext year. And it does all of this without a battle over the formulas.\n  Again, I want to commend Senator Bond for his determination in moving \nthis measure forward. I also want to thank Senators Warner and Baucus \nfor their excellent work. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in \nsupporting this important measure.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work done by the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, and the compromise it \nrepresents. However, I believe the proposal sent over by the House in \nH.R. 2516 represented a superior short-term reauthorization proposal. \nHopefully, many of these funding elements may find their way into the \nfinal ISTEA reauthorization proposal.\n  Mr. President, I would simply like to gain assurance from the \nchairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee that passage of \nhis short-term proposal in no way obligates the Senate or its Members \nto support of any specific funding level or formula, and that it is \nsimply a stop-gap measure until we can proceed to a final long-term \nauthorization bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I can definitely assure the Senator from\n\n[[Page S12066]]\n\nMichigan that passage of this short-term bill in no way implies \nacceptance of any long-term funding level or formula.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his assurances, \nand look forward to working with him in crafting the follow-on \nlegislation to ISTEA that will sufficiently rectify the onerous \nposition in which donor States, like Michigan, find themselves.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nconsidered read the third time, and passed, that the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements relating to \nthe bill appear at this point in the Record.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the unanimous-consent request that is \npending be amended in order that an amendment of mine, amendment No. \n1376, be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, with all due respect to my good friend \nfrom Michigan, I must object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object. I have a further inquiry of \nmy good friend from Montana. Would it be fair to say that the adoption \nof this short term bill would in no way prejudice efforts later on in \nthe next session of Congress to have consideration of amendments, such \nas No. 1376, and other formulas which are more equitable to many of our \nStates that have not, in our view, been treated equitably.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I say to my friend that this measure about to be passed \nis formula neutral. It in no way would prejudice the amendment to be \noffered at a later date by the Senator from Michigan, or other \namendments offered by other Senators who wish to accomplish objectives \nfor their States as well.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I think the Senator has made it very clear \nthat he was referring to ISTEA I in 1991, was he not?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am not referring to the ISTEA I bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is referring to next year.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I renew my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1454) was considered read the third time, and passed, as \nfollows:\n\n                                S. 1464\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I certainly want to commend our \ndistinguished chairman and distinguished ranking member. The senior \nSenator from Montana is also ranking on the subcommittee. We express a \nparticular appreciation to the Senator from Missouri, Senator Bond. He \nseemed to have had an understanding of how we could best and most \nequitably adopt this short-term provision. I wish to commend him for \nhis special efforts.\n  I wish to also commend the staff, Mr. President. We have had \nextraordinary staff participation on this. I have a small piece of \npaper here signed by the principal Senators expressing our \nappreciation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much hope that the other body takes \nup and passes this measure because it has been our judgment that it is \nabout the only approach that is going to allow States to continue the \ncontinuity in their highway programs until next year when we pass the \nfull 6-year program.\n  This measure that we have just adopted here in the Senate is formula \nneutral. It is designed in a way to make sure that all of the different \nStates who are in different situations are treated reasonably fairly. \nNothing is perfect. But this is a very good effort to deal with various \ndifferences among the States. It also will provide enough funds for the \nCongress next year to take up the full 6-year bill in a reasonable \nperiod of time.\n  So I very much hope that the other body takes it up and passes this \nbill because it is in the States' best interests to continue that \ncontinuity of funding.\n  Mr. WARNER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I would also like to express our \nappreciation to Senator Byrd who was very actively working with us this \nevening. And I want to associate myself with the remarks of the \ndistinguished Senator from Montana.\n  Many States have a very short period within which they can do this \nvital work. The Governors appeared at the hearing of our committee just \na few days ago, and expressed a similar interest. It is imperative that \nwe keep this highway program moving ahead until such time as the \nCongress can pass what I hope will be a 6-year bill.\n  Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I express my sincere appreciation to \nChairman Chafee, Chairman Warner, and the ranking member, Senator \nBaucus.\n  When it became clear that we were not going to pass a 6-year \nreauthorization of the ISTEA, or Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act, it was obvious to everybody that something had to be \ndone to make sure that we didn't run out of safety programs; that we \ndidn't shut the doors on the operations of the Department of \nTransportation; that we didn't leave the States without the authority \nto contract.\n  Finally, when I suggested that we merely extend the obligations based \non a half of last year's obligation authority up to 75 percent, it was \ndesigned, as Senator Baucus so ably said, to be totally formula \nneutral. We are not going to engage in a formula battle. We have some \nvery strong differences of opinion over formulas, and over allocations \namong States. That will be played out at great length on this floor I \nhope very early in 1998. But I have never seen anything unify this body \nmore than the agreement by all of the Senators with whom I have \nspoken--and I have spoken to almost all of them--that we must do \nsomething to keep the doors open; to keep construction going; to keep \nsafety and to keep transit programs. And the only way we can do it is \nto do something that is formula neutral.\n  This merely extends the obligational authority, and it has \noverwhelming support. We hope it will have support in the House so that \nwe can send it to the President and make sure that we don't shut down \noperations in the very near future.\n  I wish to expressly thank staff which has worked night and day--some \nwith almost no sleep: Dan Corbett, Jimmie Powell, Ann Loomis, Kathy \nRuffalo, Tom Sliter, and the staff of the Banking Committee, Commerce \nCommittee, and the Environment and Public Works Committee; and on my \nown personal staff, Tracy Henke who did the initial work of putting \nthis all together.\n  I hope they can all get some sleep and some rest, and that we can put \nthis measure to bed.\n  Mr. President, this does not open up any fights. It merely leaves in \nplace vitally needed safety transit, Department of Transportation \noperations, and the ability to contract while we revisit in early 1998 \nthe very important and very controversial formulas for allocating \nhighway money.\n  I thank all Senators whose cooperation was necessary for us to bring \nthe measure to the floor, and pass it this evening. But the agreement \nof all Senators shows what a high priority and what a tremendous \nimportance we place on assuring that our citizens have adequate \ntransit, that we have the highways, the bridges, and the roads that we \nneed for convenience, for our economy, and, most of all, for the safety \nof our traveling public.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CHAFEE addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, this is a very, very contentious issue. \nFortunately, in our Environment and Public Works Committee we were able \nto report out this basic legislation 18 to 0. Then we have to do this \nso-called stopgap legislation, because we weren't able to consider the \nbig bill due to a variety of factors. This bill now is a result of \nbipartisan cooperation. As we mentioned, Senator Baucus has been deeply \ninvolved in this, and of course, Senator Warner, Senator Bond, myself, \nand others.\n  I join in the salute to the staff. They have been really terrific. I \nwould like particularly to offer the names of those who worked so hard: \nJimmie Powell, Tom Sliter, Kathy Ruffalo, Dan Corbett, Ann Loomis, \nPeter Rogoff, with Senator Byrd, and Tracy Henke with Senator Bond. \nEvery single one of those staffers was absolutely terrific.\n  Mr. WARNER. And add Ellen Stein to that.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. I certainly will.\n  Mr. President, let me end with a wish. We are going to come back to \nthis, as the majority leader said, the first thing when we return in \nJanuary. It is going to take every bit of good will and patience and \nhigh level of character and perseverance for us to be able to pass a \nbill that will have the acceptance that legislation had in our \ncommittee.\n  So, in closing, I thank everyone, and urge them to carry on with this \nsame type of effort when we convene on this issue in the last part of \nJanuary.\n\n[[Page S12069]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there are two points that I want to make.\n  We are passing this rather significant piece of legislation because \nwe are doing it in a bipartisan basis. I must remind all of my \ncolleagues that when we get into partisan fights often nothing happens. \nWe make political points but don't pass legislation.\n  This has been very, very cohesive and bipartisan on both sides of the \naisle.\n  It has been an honor for me--a privilege for me--to participate with \nSenator Warner, Senator Chafee, Senator Bond, and Senator Byrd in \nputting this together.\n  My second point is to reaffirm just how lucky we are to have such a \ndedicated staff who are so able and so talented. I am always in awe in \nseeing just how right these people are and how necessary they are.\n  But, for the record, the one lady who came up with the final solution \nis on my staff. Her name is Kathy Ruffalo.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will proceed momentarily to the \nExecutive Calendar.\n  But first we want to thank the Chair. The Chair has been very \nindulgent, and indeed, the staff of the Senate.\n  But I want to further say that I hope tomorrow that the \ninfrastructure that follows this type of legislation--the contractors, \nthe secretaries of the various organizations throughout the States who \nare entrusted with the very important highway construction--would \nimmediately look at this effort by the U.S. Senate, and bring to bear \ntheir judgment tomorrow on the other body in the hopes that we can pass \nthis.\n  I particularly call on the National Governors' Association. They came \nforward in a hearing that I chaired last week, and were very explicit \non this whole matter. It was made very clear by the contractors who \nalso appeared at that hearing that there is a short period for certain \nStates for construction. It is imperative that this matter go forward. \nWe have made, as I say, in a bipartisan way, our best effort. Now, with \nthe help of the infrastructure, I am sure that the other body will see \nthe wisdom in this measure, and pass it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/1997/11/07/senate-section/article/S12065-2", "month": "11", "year": "1997"}, {"day": "07", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, I send a bill to the desk on behalf of \nSenators Chafee and Reed, re: the relocation of the Haffenreffer \nMuseum, and ask the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1455) to provide financial assistance for the \n     relocation and expansion of Haffenreffer Museum of \n     Anthropology, Providence, Rhode Island.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the immediate \nconsideration of the bill?\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nassist in the relocation and expansion of the Haffenreffer Museum of \nAnthropology at Brown University in Providence, RI.\n  In 1955, the family of Rudolf F. Haffenreffer bequeathed to Brown \nUniversity the museum he had founded in Bristol, RI. The museum \nincludes more than 100,000 objects from native peoples of the Americas, \nAfrica, Asia, and the Pacific.\n  This is a teaching museum owned and supported by Brown University. It \nhas a number of world-class holdings that attract scholars from all \nover the globe, and has been described by the American Association of \nMuseums as a ``superb medium- to small-sized facility with outstanding \ncollections, excellent exhibits, and a superb program of public \neducation and outreach.''\n  While maintaining objects from around the world, the Haffenreffer \nMuseum exhibits extensive archaeological materials from New England \nthat are used to interpret prehistoric and historical cultural \ndevelopments in Rhode Island and surrounding States. The legislation I \nintroduce today authorizes $3 million to preserve these culturally \nimportant collections and to provide expanded exhibition space that \nwill make them more accessible to schoolchildren, scholars, students, \nand other visitors.\n  In 1995, Brown University acquired from the Resolution Trust \nCorporation [RTC] the historic Old Stone Bank Building, built in 1854, \nalong with the early 19th century Federal-style residence known as the \nBenoni-Cook House, both located in downtown Providence. The RTC took \nover both properties when the Old Stone Bank failed in 1993.\n  Prior to Brown's purchase of these sites, it was unclear how or \nwhether they would be put to use. The funds authorized by this bill \nwill contribute a modest portion of the estimated $15 million Brown \nUniversity will spend to relocate the Haffenreffer Museum from Bristol, \nRI, to the bank building and the Benoni-Cook House, both of which are \nlocated on the National Register of Historic Places.\n  Mr. President, this in indeed a win-win project being carried out by \nBrown University. We will renovate, preserve,\n\n[[Page S12070]]\n\nand make fine use of two historic architectural landmarks--while \nproviding greater access to an extraordinary tool for cultural and \nhistorical education. This is a fine example of the type of assistance \nour Federal Government can provide to local communities to preserve and \nmake available for future generations the significant developments of \nour past.\n  Mr. President, I encourage the support of our Senate colleagues.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the ``Haffenreffer \nMuseum Restoration Act of 1997'', legislation that Senator Chafee and I \nintroduced to assist in the relocation and expansion of Rhode Island's \nHaffenreffer Museum of Anthropology.\n  Currently situated in Bristol, R.I., the Haffenreffer Museum is home \nto one of our Nation's finest collections of Native American and other \ncultural artifacts from around the world. Each year, thousands of \nvisitors enjoy the Haffenreffer's exhibits and benefit from its \ncommitment to education, which is a tribute to the museum's close ties \nto the Brown University Department of Anthropology. Recognizing this \neffective combination, the American Association of Museums has \ndescribed the Haffenreffer as a ``superb medium-small facility with \noutstanding collections, excellent exhibits, and a superb program of \npublic education and outreach.''\n  In an effort to increase access to the Haffenreffer's resources, \nBrown University has begun preparations to relocate the museum to \nProvidence, R.I. Toward this end, the university has acquired two \nstructures on the National Register of Historic Places, the Old Stone \nBank Building and the Benoni-Cooke House, to house the Haffenreffer in \ndowntown Providence.\n  This move would preserve these historically significant buildings, \nwhile contributing to the resurgence of Providence by adding a \nnationally renowned museum to its growing arts and entertainment \ndistrict. The new site would also allow the Haffenreffer to display \nmore of its collection for visitors, whom the museum estimates would \nincrease fivefold after the relocation. This development would \nparticularly serve children, who currently make up more than half of \nthe museum's visitors and for whom the downtown location would be more \naccessible.\n  Brown University is raising funds to restore and expand the Old Stone \nBank Building and the Benoni-Cooke House, and to complete the \nrelocation of the Haffenreffer's collection to Providence by the year \n2000. The bill before the Senate today authorizes Federal cooperation \nin advancing these goals, increasing knowledge of Native American \nhistory, preserving architectural treasures, and promoting the \nrevitalization of our Nation's downtown areas. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and the work needed to bring the Haffenreffer to \nRhode Island's capital city.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask the bill be advanced to third reading and passed \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, all without \nfurther action or debate. I further ask the statements by Senators \nChafee and Reed be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (S. 1455) was read the third time and passed, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1455\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
